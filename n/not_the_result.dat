With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new neurons.|$|E

5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of hunting larger game, {{something that might be}} assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E

5|$|By the 1930s, Glynne's {{focus was}} on cereal diseases, {{especially}} soil-borne varieties. She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or flattening of wheat close to harvest was frequently <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains of cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains of cereal should be planted in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E

5|$|It {{is true that}} a {{house that}} is between two {{destroyed}} homes can be undamaged, but this is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a tornado skipping, as some previously thought. After the 1974 Super Outbreak, Dr. Ted Fujita studied many films of tornadoes from that day. Included in his review was damage and tornado film footage of F4 and F5 tornadoes. Fujita concluded that multiple vortices, highly volatile tornadic satellites transiting within a parent tornado at high speeds, are responsible for making tornadoes appear to skip houses. The phenomenon of satellite tornadoes, where a smaller tornado orbits a larger companion tornado, {{can also lead to}} gaps in damage between the two tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death {{reached the}} King and Anne, who were overjoyed. The {{following}} day, Henry and Anne wore yellow, {{the symbol of}} joy and celebration in England, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities. In Spain, the home country of Catherine of Aragon, yellow was the colour of mourning, in addition to black. For this reason, the wearing of yellow by Henry and Anne {{may have been a}} symbol of mourning. With Mary's mother dead, Anne attempted to make peace with her. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that her heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of poisoning, but of cancer of the heart, something which was not understood at the time.|$|E

5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is <b>not,</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E
5|$|The 15th {{edition of}} the Belk Bowl was played in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday, December 29, 2016. This was the 24th {{consecutive}} bowl game for Virginia Tech and Justin Fuente's first bowl game as {{head coach of the}} Hokies football team. This was the first time ever these two teams played each other. The first and second halves were totally different in terms of how each team did. Virginia Tech was losing 24-0 at halftime but turned the game around in the second half aided by 3 interceptions and six sacks, and won 24-35. This resulted in a season record of 10-4 and was the first time a Hokie football coach won 10 games in his first season and the first Hokie 10-win season since 2011. This {{was the first time the}} Hokies won 3 straight bowl games. Only one of the 5 Hokie touchdowns was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of an Arkansas turnover. This was the only game in the college football 2016 in which a team trailing by 24 or more points ended up winning the game. There was a very confusing ruling in the second quarter that took the officials about 12 minutes to sort out. Arkansas punted and the Hokies muffed it. Arkansas touched the ball and the Hokies recovered. But there was also an inadvertent whistle blown. Officials disagree on what the ruling should have been. The game officials gave the ball back to Arkansas.|$|E
