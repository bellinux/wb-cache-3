50|$|<b>Nizofenone</b> (Ekonal, Midafenone) is a neuroprotective drug {{which protects}} neurons from death {{following}} cerebral anoxia (interruption of oxygen {{supply to the}} brain). It might thus be useful {{in the treatment of}} acute neurological conditions such as stroke.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} cerebral protection against transient cerebral ischemia, which was induced in cats by 1 -hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) via transorbital approach. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by means of a laser flowmeter and autoradiography, and through a cranial window pial arteries were continuously observed by means of a videocamera system equipped with a width analyzer computer during ischemia and after reperfusion of MCA. Neuronal damage was evaluated 5 hours after reperfusion by a microcomputer imaging device. As protective agents, calcium-antagonist (TA- 3090) for use in increasing collateral circulation and <b>nizofenone</b> for improving the ischemic threshold were administered prior to 5 minutes of ischemia. Pial arteries were dilated up to 49. 5 % at 5 hours after reperfusion in the controls, to 38. 5 % in the <b>nizofenone</b> treated group (p＜ 0. 05), and to 19. 1 % in the TA- 3090 group (p＜ 0. 01). With regard to rCBF, postischemic hyperperfusion was found markedly in the controls but the degree of hyperperfusion in the TA- 3090 group was decreased compared to the controls (p＜ 0. 01). However, there was no significant difference between the <b>nizofenone</b> group and the cotrols. Observation of neuronal damage revealed the infarcted area on the affected himisphere to be 41. 9 % in the controls, 29. 7 % in the <b>nizofenone</b> group, 18. 4 % in the TA- 3090 group and 14. 2 % in the <b>nizofenone</b> and TA- 3090 combined treatment group. These results suggest that increased collateral circulation during ischemia protected the brain from transient ischemia by means of inhibiting postischemic hyperperfusion, and maintained the pial artery after reperfusion. The most effective method of brain protection was to increase collateral circulation while simultaneously improving the threshold of ischemia...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{effects of}} delayed {{administration}} of pentobarbital and a novel imidazole derivative (<b>Nizofenone</b> or Y- 9179) on the infarction size following the regional cerebral ischemia were studied using the permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model in cats. The courses of local {{cerebral blood flow}} (€CBF) before and after drug administration were also studied using the hydrogen clearance method. The extent of infarction one week after MCA occlusion was significantly smaller in the drug-treated groups than in the control group. Regarding the time-course of (,CBF, {{there was no significant}} differences between the control and the Y- 9179 groups. On the other hand, pentobarbital administration caused a significant €CBF increase in low-flow areas where the £CBF following MCA occlusion was below 40 ml/lOOg/min. In spite of this flow increase, the corresponding cortical areas underwent infarction. Histological examination of the state of vasogenic edema revealed that the perivascular exudation of plasma fluid in the infarcted area was definitely less in the Y- 9179 treated group than in the other groups. Results indicate that redistribution of €CBF may not be involved in the mechanism of cerebral protection by pentobarbital or Y- 9179.

40|$|SUMMARY We {{previously}} published results of investigations which {{indicated that the}} combination of mannitol, which acts as a free radical scavenger, and perfluorochemicals (PFC), which have a strong oxygen-carrying capacity, can be therapeutic in cases of brain infarction. The present experiment tested the hypothesis that the effectiveness of such treatment could be increased by an optimal combination of such scavengers and other chemicals. Fifty-two dogs were used, employing the "canine model of a completely ischemic brain regulated with the perfusion method. " A total of six drugs with free radical scavenger capacities were tested: mannitol, vitamin E, vitamin C, <b>Nizofenone</b> * (Y- 9197), dexamethasone (DEXA) and suloctidilf (MY- 103). These drugs were administered intravenously 15 minutes prior to the production of ischemia, when cerebral blood flow was reduced to one-tenth its normal volume. After one hour, recirculation was allowed and the recovery of electrical activity of the brain observed for three hours. Judged by the degree of recovery of brain electrical activity, five drugs were considered to have protective effect against brain ischemia: mannitol, vitamin E, MY- 103, DEXA and Y- 9197. Among these five drugs, mannitol, vitamin E and DEXA are known to be safe and easily used clinically. The combined administration of these three drugs, together with PFC, was also investigated. It was foun...|$|E
