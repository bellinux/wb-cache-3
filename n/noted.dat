25|$|In 1861, the {{government}} of India introduced its first paper money: 10 <b>note</b> in 1864, 5 <b>note</b> in 1872, 10,000 <b>note</b> in 1899, 100 <b>note</b> in 1900, 50 <b>note</b> in 1905, 500 <b>note</b> in 1907 and 1,000 <b>note</b> in 1909. In 1917, 1 and 2 <b>notes</b> were introduced. The Reserve Bank of India began banknote production in 1938, issuing 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 <b>notes</b> while {{the government}} continued issuing 1 <b>note</b> but demonetized the 500 and 2 <b>notes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A whole <b>note</b> (American) or semibreve (British) is {{a musical}} <b>note</b> {{represented}} by a hollow oval <b>note</b> head—like a half <b>note</b> (or minim)—and no <b>note</b> stem (see Figure 1). Its length is equal to four beats in [...] time, that is the whole [...] measure (or bar). Most other <b>notes</b> are fractions of the whole <b>note.</b> Half <b>notes</b> last for one half {{the duration of the}} whole <b>note,</b> quarter <b>notes</b> (or crotchets) last for one quarter the duration, and a double whole <b>note</b> (or breve, hence the British name semibreve) lasts twice as long as a whole <b>note.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In Bach's textures, the French composer's 8th <b>notes</b> {{which were}} {{eligible}} <b>notes</b> inégales became Bach's 16th <b>notes.</b> But {{at the same}} time, other rhythms were [...] "sharpened" [...] and certain types of three <b>note</b> sixteenth <b>note</b> figures were often [...] "compressed to three 32nd <b>note</b> upbeat figures. And upbeat 8th <b>notes</b> became upbeat 16th <b>notes.</b> (All the would be evenly written eight <b>notes</b> are written out in long-short <b>notes</b> inégales). Bach's texture was very much more complex {{than that of the}} Lully and Muffat. As a result, there was ambiguity for what <b>notes</b> would be eligible for <b>notes</b> inégales performance.|$|R

50|$|In {{notation}} a grace <b>note</b> {{is distinguished}} from a regular <b>note</b> by print size. A grace <b>note</b> {{is indicated by}} printing a <b>note</b> that is much smaller than a regular <b>note,</b> sometimes with a slash through the <b>note</b> stem (if two or more grace <b>notes,</b> {{there might be a}} slash through the <b>note</b> stem of the first <b>note</b> but not the subsequent grace <b>note).</b> The presence or absence of a slash through a <b>note</b> stem is often interpreted to indicate the intention of an acciaccatura or an appoggiatura, respectively.|$|R

5000|$|In music, a whole <b>note</b> (American) or semibreve (British) is a <b>note</b> {{represented}} by a hollow oval <b>note</b> head and no <b>note</b> stem. Its length is equal to four beats in [...] time, that is the whole [...] measure (or bar). Most other <b>notes</b> are fractions of the whole <b>note</b> (e.g., half <b>notes</b> and quarter <b>notes</b> are played for one half and one quarter {{the duration of the}} whole <b>note,</b> respectively).|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} alternations between <b>notes</b> can vary {{according}} to the length of the <b>note</b> in question. At slower tempos a <b>note</b> will last longer, meaning more <b>notes</b> can be played in the trill, but with a fast tempo and short <b>note</b> a trill might be reduced to nothing more than the indicated <b>note,</b> the <b>note</b> above and the indicated <b>note</b> again.|$|R

50|$|The {{repetition}} {{of a group}} of two <b>notes</b> is abbreviated by two <b>notes</b> (most often half <b>notes</b> or whole <b>notes)</b> connected by the number of strokes ordinarily used to express eighth <b>notes,</b> sixteenth <b>notes,</b> etc., according to the rate of movement intended, as below. It will be observed that a passage lasting for the value of one half <b>note</b> requires two half <b>notes</b> to express it, on account of the group consisting of two <b>notes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{compound}} meter, even-numbered tuplets can {{indicate that}} a <b>note</b> value is changed {{in relation to the}} dotted version of the next higher <b>note</b> value. Thus, two duplet eighth <b>notes</b> (most often used in [...] meter) take the time normally totaled by three eighth <b>notes,</b> equal to a dotted quarter <b>note.</b> Four quadruplet (or quartole) eighth <b>notes</b> would also equal a dotted quarter <b>note.</b> The duplet eighth <b>note</b> is thus exactly the same duration as a dotted eighth <b>note,</b> but the duplet notation is far more common in compound meters [...] A duplet in compound time is more often written as 2:3 (a dotted quarter <b>note</b> split into two duplet eighth <b>notes)</b> than 2: (a dotted quarter <b>note</b> split into two duplet quarter <b>notes),</b> even though the former is inconsistent with a quadruplet also being written as 4:3 (a dotted quarter <b>note</b> split into two quadruplet eighth <b>notes)</b> [...]|$|R
50|$|The next <b>note</b> value {{shorter than}} the two hundred fifty-sixth <b>note</b> <b>note</b> is the five hundred twelfth <b>note</b> with seven flags or beams; it is half {{as long as the}} two hundred fifty-sixth <b>note.</b> After this would come the one {{thousand}} twenty-fourth <b>note</b> (eight flags or beams), the two thousand forty-eighth <b>note</b> (nine flags or beams), the four thousand ninety-sixth <b>note</b> (ten flags or beams), and so on indefinitely, with each <b>note</b> half the length of its predecessor. The shortest <b>note</b> value to have ever been used in a published work is the 1024th <b>note</b> (notated incorrectly as a 2048th) in Anthony Philip Heinrich's Toccata Grande Cromatica from The Sylviad, Set 2, written around 1825; 256th <b>notes</b> occur frequently in this piece, and some 512th <b>notes</b> also appear; the passage is marked grave but the composer also intended a huge ritardando. For comparison, the shortest notated duration supported by Finale is a 4096th <b>note,</b> while LilyPond can write <b>notes</b> with up to 27 beams, as short as a th (= 2−30) <b>note.</b> As of Sibelius 5, 512th <b>notes</b> are easily accessible.|$|R
