30|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condensates</b> are {{composed}} of various components of hydrocarbons and some contaminants such as hydrogen sulfide, thiols (mercaptans), and aromatics. Thus, the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condensates</b> could {{be considered as a}} fuel resource. This study concerned the simulation of an Ultra-Deep Hydrodesulfurization (UDHDS) unit plus a distillation section to treat a combination of gas condensate and disulfide oils (DSO) and produce clean fuel cuts. Gas condensate of South Pars field of Iran with high sulfur content was applied to obtain clean fuel cuts. In order to reduce the sulfur content of this stream to less than 10  ppmw as sulfur, a UDHDS unit was simulated using Aspen HYSYS software package. The clean gas condensate leaving the UDHDS unit (with sulfur content < 10  ppmw) contains complex mixtures of hydrocarbon components called petroleum cuts which are identified by their boiling points ranges. To obtain the narrow fractions of butane, light naphtha, heavy naphtha, kerosene, and gasoil, a fractional distillation system was simulated. The simulation results revealed that the top products of distillation column, namely butane, light naphtha, and heavy naphtha were sulfur free and the sulfur contents of kerosene and gasoil cuts were 12 and 27  ppmw as sulfur, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Looking at the world's {{growing demand}} for new energy resources, {{experts in the field}} of oil and energy can {{obviously}} realize that oil industry has to find new fuel supplies and upgrade their qualities. The <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condensates</b> can catch their attention as they contain complex mixtures of hydrocarbon components. Natural gas condensate is known as a low-boiling mixture of hydrocarbon liquids that are present as gaseous components in the raw natural gas produced from many natural gas fields [1]. Therefore, in addition to crude oil, the natural gas condensate can be an appropriate resource for oil industry to augment the fuel production. According to the report of International Energy Agency (IEA), the South Pars/North Dome field, which is located in the Persian Gulf, is the world’s largest gas field and shared between Iran and Qatar. This field holds an estimated 1800 trillion cubic feet (51 trillion cubic meters) of in situ natural gas and some 50 billion barrels (7.9 billion cubic meters) of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condensates.</b> 1 However, the gas condensate of this field is substantially sour as it is estimated that the sulfur content of gas condensate of South Pars field is more than 2000  ppmw as sulfur. The sulfur content of fuels is currently considered as a major factor contributing to pollution of the atmosphere.|$|E
