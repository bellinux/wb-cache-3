25|$|The {{acquisition}} of Airco in February 1920 was a financial {{disaster for the}} BSA group. Percy Martin had been strongly in favour of the purchase, including Airco's extensive production facilities near London, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> to examine Airco's true circumstances, leading to liabilities in excess of 1.3 million pounds. All dividends were passed from 1920 to 1924.|$|E
25|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the}} actual {{isolated}} and long-abandoned original site at Jamestown Island would be suitable. Jamestown had no facilities for large crowds, and the fort housing the Jamestown Settlement was {{believed to have been}} long-ago swallowed by the James River. However, there was an assumption {{in many parts of the}} state that Richmond, the state capital, would be chosen as the site of the celebration.|$|E
60|$|The {{request was}} one which they all made of <b>one</b> another, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>thought</b> of refusing. Clutton shrugged his shoulders.|$|R

25|$|During the {{planning}} phase, virtually <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the original}} site of Jamestown would be suitable, as it was isolated and long-abandoned. There were no local facilities to handle large crowds, and {{it was believed that}} the fort housing the settlement had long ago been swallowed by the James River. No rail lines ran near Jamestown. Many Virginia residents thought that Richmond, the state capital, would be chosen as the site of the celebration.|$|E
25|$|As {{a celebration}} was planned, {{virtually}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the actual}} isolated and long-abandoned original site of Jamestown would be suitable for a major event because Jamestown Island had no facilities for large crowds. The original fort housing the Jamestown settlers was {{believed to have been}} long ago swallowed by the James River. The general area in James City County near Jamestown was also considered unsuitable, as it was not very accessible in the day of rail travel before automobiles were common.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{approaches}} were more heavily mined than anticipated, the ships {{of the invasion}} fleet were unable to use the main anchorage safely until it was properly swept. As the day proceeded, ship to shore travel became more difficult as a south-easterly gale blew up and made heavy seas. But by this time, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> to delay operations for better weather. Thus, LCAs were required to make long and frequent journeys from ship to shore with supplies and reinforcements in worsening sea conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Rick Anderson, {{writing for}} AllMusic, said that Hall and Metheny [...] "...are such a natural fit that it's amazing <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> <b>thought</b> of getting them {{together}} for a duo album before." [...] He said the [...] "...interplay {{is nothing short of}} astounding, and the five improvisational pieces...sometimes sound as organized as the standards." [...] He said [...] "...the complete lack of high frequencies in both guitarists' tones might leave you wondering if you've got water in your ear", but that it [...] "really is a wonderful album." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps you do Maud injustice, Robert," [...] said Beulah, smiling. [...] "I think I can say none {{loves you}} better than our dear sister--or <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has <b>thought</b> of you more, in your absence." ...|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, leaking {{aviation}} gasoline accumulating {{in the forward}} elevator pit began vaporising and soon permeated {{the upper and lower}} hangar decks. The danger this posed to the ship was readily apparent to the damage control crews but, whether through inadequate training, lack of practice (only three months had passed since the ship's commissioning) or general incompetence, their response to it proved fatally ineffectual. Efforts to pump out the damaged elevator well were bungled and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> to try to cover the increasingly lethal mixture with foam from the hangar's fire suppression system.|$|E
25|$|Mar Samuel was unfortunate in {{his family}} life. He had no sons, and his two daughters were {{captured}} by soldiers during the war with the Romans. They were taken to Sepphoris, in Palestine, where they were ransomed by coreligionists, but both died {{at an early age}} after having been married successively to a relative (Ket. 23a; Yer. Ket. ii. 26c). The esteem in which Mar Samuel was held appears from the fact that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> of attributing his misfortune to any sin committed by him; it was explained rather as being in consequence of some offense committed in Babylon by R. Ḥananya, the nephew of R. Joshua (Yer. Ket. ii. 8; comp. Ket. 23a). After his death Samuel was glorified in legend.|$|E
25|$|One {{other major}} {{collector}} {{who was also}} famous was Carlos Monsiváis, who considered La Lagunilla {{one of his most}} important sources for his collections. During his first visit to La Lagunilla in 1968, Carlos Monsiváis found an old copy of “La familia Burrón,” when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> this series by Gabriel Vargas was collectible. He was regularly found here and other markets in the city to add to his collection which eventually filled his house in the Portales neighborhood to overflow. This collection was amassed over forty years and included stamps, postcards, scorecards, crafts by artisans such as Teresa Nava, Susana and Teodoro Torres, and Roberto Ruiz, photographs, popular toys, albums, calendars, comics, newspapers, notebooks and cookbooks. His collection eventually founded the Museo de Estanquillo in 2006, with about 12,000 objects that he collected over thirty years.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You are right,' {{said the}} goose, 'in supposing I {{was not born}} in this horrid shape. Ah! <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>thought</b> that Mimi, the {{daughter}} of the great Weatherbold, would be killed for the ducal table.' ...|$|R
2500|$|An actual Canadian {{lighthouse}} keeper, Jim Abram of British Columbia, agreed. [...] "I've been lighthouse keeping for 21 years," [...] he {{told the}} magazine, [...] "and <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> ever <b>thought</b> that I was in anything but a lighthouse." ...|$|R
500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle {{gave the}} program a rave review and saying that, [...] " [...] good you can't help {{wondering}} why <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> of it before, a compelling mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation {{of what it}} takes to get a Broadway show from the idea stage to opening night. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems." [...] He ultimately gave it three and a half stars out of four. The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray praised the cast and Eileen's divorce storyline. He mainly criticized the staging and arrangement of the musical numbers saying they threatened the realism of the show and wrote they weren't completely [...] "digetic". He ultimately gave the episode a B. Another A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff criticized the series for not avoiding clichés but also wrote [...] "the show is so damned sincere about how much it embraces the clichés of the backstage Broadway story that those inclined to like this sort of thing—and I'm very much one of them—will forgive it some of these excesses." [...] He also criticized the adoption storyline. Despite this, he went on to compare the series to Hill Street Blues, ER and The West Wing.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] finished 32nd in {{ratings for the}} week of September 27– October 4, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 11.8, equivalent to approximately 11.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the seventh best in the show's history. Entertainment Weeklys Dalton Ross lauded it as [...] "the show's best ever musical episode", while Dave Kehr of The New York Times called it a [...] "brilliant ... parody of Broadway musicals that should be required viewing for every Tony viewer." [...] In a list of his favorite episodes, Kevin Williamson of Canadian Online Explorer added, [...] "As pitch-perfect eviscerations of community theatre go, this tops Waiting for Guffman." [...] Series creator Matt Groening has listed {{it as one of}} his own favorites, calling the subplot [...] "Maggie's finest moment", and future Simpsons guest star Trey Anastasio said the episode [...] "may have been the best TV show ever". Executive producer James L. Brooks also listed it as one of his favorites, saying it [...] "showed we could go into areas <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> we could go into". Following the episode, the Ayn Rand Society called Groening to say they were amazed at the references to Rand. They also asked him if the show was making fun of them.|$|E

5000|$|Calhoun admired Dwight's extemporaneous sermons, his {{seemingly}} encyclopedic knowledge, and his awesome {{mastery of}} the classics, of the tenets of Calvinism, and of metaphysics. <b>No</b> <b>one,</b> he <b>thought,</b> could explicate the language of John Locke with such clarity.|$|R
60|$|As for Esben, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{had ever}} <b>thought</b> about him; his {{brothers}} {{had not even}} said farewell to him.|$|R
60|$|A pause ensued, {{before the}} table was replenished—a sort of {{parenthesis}} in which Mr. Simpson, Mr. Calton, and Mr. Hicks, produced respectively a bottle of sauterne, bucellas, and sherry, and took wine with everybody—except Tibbs. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>thought</b> of him.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} days {{settlers}} found at hand a convenient substitute for stone in the hardwoods, and in Sydney sandstone was so plentiful and so easily worked that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> of going afield to explore for something better, and even today [...] freestone, as the sandstone is often called, is nearly everywhere employed by architects and builders.|$|E
2500|$|Swango {{displayed}} troubling {{behavior during}} his time at SIU. Although he was a brilliant student, he preferred to work as an ambulance attendant rather than concentrate on his studies. A fascination with dying patients was noted during this time. Although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> much {{of it at the}} time, many of Swango's assigned patients ended up [...] "coding," [...] or suffering life-threatening emergencies, with at least five of them dying.|$|E
2500|$|A {{report that}} Philip II of Macedon was marching {{on the town}} had thrown all Corinth into a bustle; one was furbishing his arms, another {{wheeling}} stones, a third patching the wall, a fourth strengthening a battlement, every one making himself useful somehow or other. Diogenes having nothing to do– of course <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> of giving him a job– was moved by the sight to gather up his philosopher's cloak and begin rolling his tub energetically {{up and down the}} Craneum; an acquaintance asked for the reason, and got the explanation: [...] "I {{do not want to be}} thought the only idler in such a busy multitude; I am rolling my tub to be like the rest." ...|$|E
5000|$|... (Conversely, {{it could}} be {{supposed}} that the Book has always had this faculty, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has <b>thought</b> to investigate the possibility.

60|$|The boys' faces {{had fallen}} dismally as their hope was destroyed; but Ben {{would not give}} up. For him there was and could be only one Sancho in the world, and his quick wits {{suggested}} an explanation which <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>thought</b> of.|$|R

2500|$|Nevertheless, those {{voting on}} the bill were later {{surprised}} by the reaction it gained. [...] State Representative Michele Reagan reflected three months later: [...] "The majority of us who voted yes on that bill, myself included, did not expect or encourage an outcry from the public. The majority of us just voted for it because {{we thought we could}} try to fix the problem. Nobody envisioned boycotts. Nobody anticipated the emotion, the prayer vigils. The attitude was: These are the laws, let's start following them." [...] State Representative Kyrsten Sinema, the assistant House minority leader who tried to stop the bill and voted against it, similarly reflected: [...] "I knew it would be bad, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> it would be this big. No one." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "God Only Knows" [...] is {{frequently}} cited for referencing [...] "God" [...] in its title, {{a decision that}} Wilson and Asher agonized over, fearing it would not get airplay as a result. As Wilson's then-wife Marilyn describes, [...] "The first time I heard it, Brian played it {{for me at the}} piano. And I went, 'Oh my God, he's talking about God in a record.' It was pretty daring to me. And it was another time I thought to myself, 'Oh, boy, he's really taking a chance.' I thought it was almost too religious. Too square. At that time. Yes, it was so great that he would say it and not be intimidated by what anybody else would think of the words or what he meant." [...] Asher explains that he and Brian [...] "had lengthy conversations during the writing of 'God Only Knows', because unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thought</b> you could say 'God' in a song. No one had done it, and Brian didn't want to be the first person to try it. He said, 'We'll just never get any air play.' Isn't it amazing that we thought that? But it worked." [...] Wilson added that although he feared putting the word [...] "God" [...] in the title of the song, he eventually agreed to keep it, firstly, [...] "because God was a spiritual word", and secondly, because the Beach Boys would [...] "be breaking ground".|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{something}} {{told me when}} I was in the trance which afterwards I forgot, but now remember. And I {{have found}} the passage which leads to where they hid the gold. It begins behind the crucifix, where <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>thought</b> of looking." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was as good}} a {{listener}} as talker, appreciating everything that others said, however humble might be their rank or pretensions, and was quick to testify his perception of any point in their discourse. He arrogated nothing to himself, but was perfectly unassuming and unpretending, entering with heart and soul into the business, or pleasure, or, I had almost said, folly, of the hour and the company. <b>No</b> <b>one's</b> concerns, <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> <b>thoughts,</b> <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> opinions, <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> tastes and pleasures seemed beneath him. He made himself so thoroughly the companion of those with whom he happened to be, that they forgot for a time his vast superiority, and only recollected and wondered, when all was over, that it was Scott with whom they had been on such familiar terms, and in whose society they had felt so perfectly at their ease.|$|R
25|$|We {{began this}} race {{way back in}} late March, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had <b>thought</b> we'd {{be the focus of}} the {{national}} media or be the so-called first test of the Republican Party and the Bush mandate. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we passed that test.|$|R
