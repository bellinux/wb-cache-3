5|$|In May 1861, Isham G. Harris, the {{governor}} of Tennessee, appointed the state's attorney, Daniel S. Donelson, as a brigadier general and directed him to build fortifications on the rivers of Middle Tennessee. Donelson found suitable sites, but they were within the borders of Kentucky, still a <b>neutral</b> <b>state</b> at that time. Moving upriver, just inside the Tennessee border, Donelson selected {{the site of the}} fort on the Cumberland River that would bear his name. Colonel Bushrod Johnson of the Tennessee Corps of Engineers approved of the site.|$|E

The latter {{was divided into}} western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the USSR, accordingly. A denazification programme in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals {{and the removal of}} ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its <b>neutral</b> <b>state</b> than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
30|$|Through {{this example}} of {{plasmonic}} waves, {{we are here}} to explain several consequences resulting from the energy balance between the radiating outgoing waves and the absorptive incoming waves. By way of both mathematical analysis and numerical computations, we will find <b>neutral</b> <b>states</b> by such balanced energy exchanges. In addition, we will show how delicately those <b>neutral</b> <b>states</b> are established [4, 14, 26].|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} {{stabilization of}} flerovium's 7s27p valence electron configuration, the 0 oxidation state {{should also be}} more stable for flerovium than for lead, as the 7p1/2 electrons begin to also exhibit a mild inert pair effect: this stabilization of the <b>neutral</b> <b>state</b> may bring about some similarities between the behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E

25|$|Belgium was {{guaranteed}} by a Treaty in 1839, that no nation {{was to have}} the right to claim the passage for its army through a <b>neutral</b> <b>state.</b> The treaty was in the case that Germany and France might enter a war between each other.|$|E
25|$|International {{plans for}} the {{unification}} of Germany were made {{during the early years}} following the establishment of the two states, but to no avail. In March 1952, the Soviet government proposed the Stalin Note to hold elections for a united German assembly while making the proposed united Germany a <b>neutral</b> <b>state,</b> i.e. a <b>neutral</b> <b>state</b> approved by the people, similar to the Austrians' approval of a neutral Austria. The Western Allied governments refused this initiative, while continuing West Germany's integration into the Western alliance system. The issue was raised again during the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Berlin in January–February 1954, but the western powers refused to make Germany neutral. Following Bonn's adherence to NATO on 9 May 1955, such initiatives were abandoned by both sides.|$|E

40|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>states</b> have {{traditionally}} been seen as favoring specific norms in international relations. Being itself originally a legal concept, neutrality was intimately linked to the importance and the respect of international law. Additionally, <b>neutral</b> <b>states</b> were seen as promoters of humanitarian ideals and elements we would in our days label as peace-building. Based on these considerations, the article tackles the more general assumption according to which <b>neutral</b> <b>states</b> would in general play a disproportionate role in promoting new “positive” ideas into the international relations because a) they have a tradition of doing so which was intimately linked to their survival as states and to their political culture, b) they have a comparative advantage in doing so because the ideas they bring in are not {{seen as part of}} hidden agendas in promoting other power-related goals, and c) the type of ideas they have been and they still are promoting always aimed at either preventing war or limiting the negative effects of war...|$|R
40|$|Electrochromic (EC) {{materials}} such as poly (dimethyl 3, 4 - propylenedioxythiophene) show great potential for numerous future applications due to their high change in absorption when their level of doping is varied and fast switching times (on the order of seconds). We have constructed EC devices based on this polymer and conducted spectroscopic measurements in the ultraviolet through far infrared range using both a Fourier Transform Infrared interferometer and a microscope grating photometer. These data are {{used to determine the}} contrast between doped and <b>neutral</b> <b>states,</b> the time required for the material to fully oxidize and neutralize, and the lifetime of the device. Our results indicate a maximum change in reflectance between doped and <b>neutral</b> <b>states</b> (D %Rmax) of 93 % at a wavelength of 1420 nm between doped and <b>neutral</b> <b>states,</b> as well as rapid switching times, but suggest more research is necessary to increase the lifetime to a length appropriate for further use...|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Napoleon gave Louis and Mortier {{the signal}} to advance. First, he {{directed}} their columns on the <b>neutral</b> <b>state</b> of Hesse-Kassel. Napoleon knew that William I, Elector of Hesse, though officially neutral, was pro-Prussian and he determined to depose him. Mortier's 5,500 men and Louis' troops overran Hesse-Kassel, disarmed the Hessian army, and chased the elector into exile. On 9 November, Louis withdrew from the campaign in bad health, leaving Mortier in command of a 12,000-man corps. Starting on 7 October, French troops moved into the area of Hameln. By the 10th, {{a good part of}} Mortier's corps appeared before the city.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} {{similarities}} between adsorption chillers and absorption refrigeration, {{the former is}} based on the interaction between gases and solids. The adsorption chamber of the chiller is filled with a solid material (for example zeolite, silica gel, alumina, active carbon or certain types of metal salts), which in its <b>neutral</b> <b>state</b> has adsorbed the refrigerant. When heated, the solid desorbs (releases) refrigerant vapour, which subsequently is cooled and liquefied. This liquid refrigerant then provides a cooling effect at the evaporator from its enthalpy of vaporization. In the final stage the refrigerant vapour is (re)adsorbed into the solid. As an adsorption chiller requires no compressor, it is relatively quiet.|$|E
25|$|On 24 July 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne {{included}} the Lausanne Straits Agreement. The Lausanne Straits Agreement {{stated that the}} Dardanelles should remain open to all commercial vessels: seizure of foreign military vessels was subject to certain limitations during peacetime, and, even as a <b>neutral</b> <b>state,</b> Turkey could not limit any military passage during wartime. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the waterway was to be demilitarized, and its management left to the Straits Commission. The demilitarized zone heavily restricted Turkey's domination and sovereignty over the Straits. The defence of Constantinople was impossible without having the sovereignty over the water that passed through it.|$|E

It was later agreed {{that the question of}} joining NATO should be answered by a national referendum {{at some point in the}} future. Recently deposed President Viktor Yanukovych considered the current level of co-operation between Ukraine and NATO sufficient, and was against Ukraine joining NATO.

25|$|Consulted by {{a senior}} {{figure of the}} PLO during the siege of Beirut, he set forth five {{political}} principles that would prove conducive to securing the PLO's political battle on a firmer footing. (1) Abandon Beirut (2) {{put an end to}} terrorism (3) relocate in Tunis, the only area where the Palestinian leadership could enjoy real political liberty (4) set up a provisory government, which would immediately be recognized by at least 150 countries (5) recognize Israel. If these measures were taken, Goldmann advised, the PLO would establish the basis {{for the creation of a}} Palestinian state, alongside that of Israel. Goldmann's vision was to make Israel the spiritual and moral center for all Jews, a <b>neutral</b> <b>state,</b> and somewhat on the model of Switzerland, with international guarantees of its security, existence and borders, and perhaps even a permanent symbolic international presence.|$|E
25|$|During the Kamehameha dynasty the {{population}} in Hawaii was ravaged by epidemics following the arrival of outsiders.

After a French invasion that sacked Honolulu in 1849, Kamehameha III sought defense treaties with the United States and Britain. During the outbreak of the Crimean War in Europe, Kamehameha III declared Hawaii a <b>neutral</b> <b>state.</b> The United States government put strong pressure on Kamehameha IV to make trade exclusively to the United States even annexing the islands. To counterbalance this situation Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V pushed for alliances with other foreign powers, especially Great Britain. Hawaii claimed uninhabited islands in the Pacific, including the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, many of which came into conflict with American claims.|$|E

25|$|After the Prussian {{victory in}} the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the German Confederation was dissolved. In its place, under Prussian leadership, the North German Confederation was founded, which did not include Luxembourg. Nevertheless, Prussian troops {{remained}} in the fortress. Before the war, the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck had signalled to the French government of Napoleon III that Prussia would not object to French hegemony in Luxembourg, if France stayed out of Prussia's conflict with Austria, to which Napoleon agreed. After the war, the French offered King William III 5,000,000 guilder for his personal possession of Luxembourg, which the cash-strapped Dutch monarch accepted in March 1867. Prussian objections to what was now portrayed as French expansionism provoked the Luxembourg Crisis, {{and the threat of}} a war between the major powers was averted only by the London Conference and the Second Treaty of London. This declared Luxembourg to be a <b>neutral</b> <b>state,</b> and required the fortress to be torn down, and the Prussian garrison to leave within three months. Prussian troops finally left on 9 September 1867.|$|E
25|$|Russian {{domination}} ended abruptly {{after the}} Crimean War, when the Treaty of Paris also passed the two Romanian principalities {{under the tutelage}} of Great European Powers (together with Russia and the Ottoman overlord, power-sharing included the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Austrian Empire, the French Empire, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, and Prussia). Due to Austrian and Ottoman opposition and British reserves, the union program as demanded by radical campaigners was debated intensely. In September 1857, given that Caimacam Nicolae Vogoride had perpetrated fraud in elections in Moldavia, the Powers allowed the two states to convene ad-hoc divans, which were to decide a new constitutional framework; the result showed overwhelming support for the union, as the creation of a liberal and <b>neutral</b> <b>state.</b> After further meetings among leaders of tutor states, an agreement was reached (the Paris Convention), whereby a limited union was to be enforced – separate governments and thrones, with only two bodies (a Court of Cassation and a Central Commission residing in Focșani); it also stipulated that an end to all privilege was to be passed into law, and awarded back to Moldavia the areas around Bolhrad, Cahul, and Izmail.|$|E
