5|$|Epic {{poetry is}} a genre of poetry, {{and a major}} form of <b>narrative</b> <b>literature.</b> This genre is often defined as lengthy poems {{concerning}} events of a heroic or important nature {{to the culture of}} the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent {{on the basis of his}} epic, Omeros.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "instructions" [...] or [...] "teaching" [...] genre, {{as well as}} {{the genre}} of [...] "reflective discourses", can be grouped in the larger corpus of wisdom {{literature}} found in the ancient Near East. The genre is didactic in nature and is thought to have formed part of the Middle Kingdom scribal education syllabus. However, teaching texts often incorporate narrative elements that can instruct as well as entertain. Parkinson asserts that there is evidence that teaching texts were not created primarily for use in scribal education, but for ideological purposes. For example, Adolf Erman (1854–1937) writes that the fictional instruction given by Amenemhat I (r. 1991–1962 BC) to his sons [...] "...far exceeds the bounds of school philosophy, and there is nothing whatever to do with school in a great warning his children to be loyal to the king". While <b>narrative</b> <b>literature,</b> embodied in works such as The Eloquent Peasant, emphasize the individual hero who challenges society and its accepted ideologies, the teaching texts instead stress the need to comply with society's accepted dogmas.|$|E
500|$|The {{selection}} of one particular quote in Carr's essay from pathologist Bruce Friedman, {{a member of}} the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School, who commented on a developing difficulty reading books and long essays and specifically the novel War and Peace, was criticized for having a bias toward <b>narrative</b> <b>literature.</b> The quote failed to represent other types of literature, such as technical and scientific literature, which had, in contrast, become much more accessible and widely read {{with the advent of the}} Internet. At the Britannica Blog, writer Clay Shirky pugnaciously observed that War and Peace was [...] "too long, and not so interesting", further stating that [...] "it would be hard to argue that the last ten years have seen a decrease in either the availability or comprehension of material on scientific or technical subjects". Shirky's comments on War and Peace were derided by several of his peers as verging on philistinism. In Shirky's defense, inventor W. Daniel Hillis asserted that, although books [...] "were created to serve a purpose", that [...] "same purpose can often be served by better means". While Hillis considered the book to be [...] "a fine and admirable device", he imagined that clay tablets and scrolls of papyrus, in their time, [...] "had charms of their own". Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly believed that the idea that [...] "the book is the apex of human culture" [...] should be resisted. And Birkerts differentiated online reading from literary reading, stating that in the latter the reader is directed within themselves and enters [...] "an environment that is nothing at all like the open-ended information zone that is cyberspace" [...] in which he feels psychologically fragmented.|$|E

50|$|This view {{remained}} general {{until the}} 19th century, when artistic movements began to {{struggle against the}} establishment institutions of academic art, which continued to adhere to it. At {{the same time there}} was from {{the latter part of the}} 18th century an increased interest in depicting in the form of history painting moments of drama from recent or contemporary history, which had long largely been confined to battle-scenes and scenes of formal surrenders and the like. Scenes from ancient history had been popular in the early Renaissance, and once again became common in the Baroque and Rococo periods, and still more so with the rise of Neoclassicism. In some 19th or 20th century contexts, the term may refer specifically to paintings of scenes from secular history, rather than those from religious <b>narratives,</b> <b>literature</b> or mythology.|$|R

40|$|Using panel {{structural}} VAR {{analysis and}} quarterly data from four industrialized countries, we document that {{an increase in}} government purchases leads to an expansion in output and private consumption, a deterioration in the trade balance, and a depreciation of the real exchange rate (i. e., {{a decrease in the}} domestic CPI relative to the exchange-rate adjusted foreign CPI). We propose an explanation for these observed effects based on the deep habit mechanism. We estimate the key parameters of the deep-habit model employing a limited information approach. The predictions of the estimated deep-habit model fit well the observed responses of output, consumption, the trade balance, and the real exchange rate to an unanticipated government spending shock. In addition, the deep-habit model predicts that in response to an anticipated increase in government spending consumption and wages fail to increase on impact, which is consistent with the empirical evidence stemming from the narrative identification approach. In this way, the deep-habit model reconciles the findings of the SVAR and <b>narrative</b> <b>literatures</b> on the effects of government spending shocks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate how imperialism is energized by {{the relationship between the}} hegemonic and democratic traditions in the West. It argues that modern imperialism, through a particular negotiating dynamic, disperses the two traditions in different cultural formations to normalize exploitative relations. The dissertation traces the operation of this negotiating dynamic at particular junctures by examining the Enlightenment, 18 th century travel and <b>narrative</b> <b>literatures,</b> sexuality, globalization, and emancipation in South Africa. The dissertation makes the case that allowing performance to have a greater role in shaping; postcolonial theoretical engagements can help move the field beyond constructing another model of difference with its risky emphasis on cultural minoritarianism to an espousal of healthy humanism based on subverting Western monopoly over signification. That is why the dissertation engages the pioneering South African experience with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission launched by Nelson Mandela to interrogate apartheid era crimes. Mandela 2 ̆ 7 s endeavor offers a serious theoretical promise that can renew postcolonial energy, pointing its flow in more hopeful directions. ...|$|R
