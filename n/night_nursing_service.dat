40|$|Continuing {{professional}} development {{is important for}} both individual and service development. Staff appraisal {{is central to the}} identification of training needs. Recent health-service reforms in the United Kingdom have linked appraisal and training to pay and career progression. This project aimed to explore the conduct of appraisal and the link between appraisal processes and access to continuing education and training. Focus groups were conducted in an urban acute cancer service and a rural community <b>night</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> to explore these issues. A total of 29 nurses and allied health professionals participated. Transcripts of focus group discussions were analysed for themes, with a deliberate search for counter-instances. Focus groups revealed that appraisal was perceived as frequently rushed and often appeared undervalued by managers. The purpose of appraisal was often misunderstood; and where no clear link existed between appraisal and access to development opportunities, staff viewed appraisal with antipathy. Commissioning of training was insufficiently responsive to identified needs and appeared overly bureaucratic. The study indicates that the link between appraisal processes and the commissioning of training is insufficiently effective. Process issues that require addressing, as well as recommendations arising from the data, are discussed...|$|E

Forty-three elderly chronically sick and five disabled patients aged under 50 received care for more than 28 days, 63 patients had terminal cancer, and 131 needed short-term care or observation. Data were also collected from a one-day survey of patients receiving care. This domiciliary care enabled the chronically sick and disabled to retain their independence and remain at home.

40|$|In {{this part}} of the Report on {{developments}} in community nursing, published material (in the period 1974 - December 1982 inclusive) and in particular those involving health visitors, district nurses and practice nurses, were examined with the aim of forming a view on areas or innovations where research is called for. (In other parts of the report this view is augmented by information obtained from professional bodies and chief nursing officers of districts.) In this literature search. which included published registers of research in progress, we identified several areas where developments do not appear so far to have been sufficiently evaluate or alternatives explored. These areas are:- 1. Organisation of community nursing. 2. Community evening and <b>night</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>services.</b> 3. Provision of primary care aides (i. e. persons providing 4. both domestic and personal help to patients). 5. The roles of health visitors and district nurses. 6. Nurses working in the treatment rooms/surgery premises. 7. Schemes to keep patients in the community as much as possible. 8. Regular screening of the elderly by community nursing staff. 9. The consumer viewpoint. Generally whilst the literature search suggested that a wide variety of schemes had been tried out, formal evaluations were uncommon. Most commonly schemes were described and impressions about their effects were reportedl anything approaching a controlled trial was extremely rare. The literature revealed little evidence of attempts to appraise standards of care in schemes implemented. Also {{there was no evidence of}} a concerted attack directed at particular issuesl most studies and schemes seemed to take place in isolation from those of other innovators...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a <b>night</b> hospital <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> for elderly people suffering from dementia; in particular, to establish the appropriateness of night support for this group and their carers. The study developed as a result of previous work that demonstrated that some carers requested "inpatient" admission for their relative/friend because of the stress of providing support and supervision at night. The research methods involved an evaluative structure - process - outcome, quality assurance and case study approach. An operational policy for the service was drawn up, as were nursing standards (process). The service was evaluated over a two year period. Patient outcomes were measured using a visual analogue scale at intervals over six months to identify behavioural changes. Similarly, carers' feelings of anxiety and coping ability relating to their caring role were measured. Changes in patient behaviour and carer anxiety and felt ability to cope were analysed using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks test. Carers were interviewed to elicit the effects their relatives' attendance at CREST had on their day to day lives. Changes in the use of community care services as a result of CREST were also identified. The sample consisted of 38 patients and their informal carers. Nursing activity was observed using non-participant observation to establish both the type of activity and peak work load periods. The results demonstrate that CREST had a positive outcome in terms of supporting patients' carers and that patients' behaviour did not change significantly while attending the night hospital. This latter result has been interpreted as a positive outcome in that people suffering from dementia can be expected to deteriorate over time. In conclusion it is anticipated that the results of this study have significance for planning <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> for the care group involved and should assist in identifying the number and grade of staff needed to deliver optimum care at night to elderly people with dementia. Recommendations for changes in the operational policy have been made which will assist managers in planning new services. The research suggests that new <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> for this group in the health authority will be more closely related to the individual needs of patients and their carers than has been achieved hitherto. This strategy should lead to fewer patients needing long term in-patient care...|$|R

40|$|M. Cur. It is {{explicit}} {{that the}} change in the South African government since 1994 accompanied by the transformation of <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> with its new policies and practices is inevitable, and poses challenges for the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers in Gauteng hospitals. The transformation of <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> can be a difficult process creating a period of fear, uncertainty, stress and role ambiguity for the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers. The transformation has been so extensive that the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager's role responsibilities have changed {{to such an extent that}} they are now required to manage grossly reduced levels of resources, multicultural societies with different values, beliefs and attitudes and increased numbers of patients, resulting in overcrowded hospitals. The transformation of <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> demands the demonstration of appropriate <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> management. The abilities of the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers are critical to the effectiveness of the future. Most <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers are unprepared for their new roles and the present concern is for the quality of the management of the transformation process. No written standards for transformation management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> are available in Gauteng public hospitals. Consequently, <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers find themselves making major decisions about <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> transformation with little information about the effectiveness of alternative approaches. The experiences and perceptions of the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers regarding transformation of <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> in selected Gauteng hospitals are also not known.

40|$|M. Cur. (Professional Nursing) It is {{important}} that the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> exercises a participative managerial style in order to promote staff retention and job satisfaction of the professional nurse. No guidelines exist on what is participative management or how it can be implemented in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service.</b> Little evidence exists of any nursing research having been conducted on participative management in South Africa, nor has research been done from the Judeo-Christian approach. This study, participative management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service,</b> was conducted in three phases in order to answer the following questions: a) what is participative management? b) how does participative management work? c) what guidelines can be formulated to implement participative management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service?</b> The first phase of concept identification was effected by means of interviews with management specialists and a literature control. In the second phase a conceptual definition of participative management was formulated. In the third phase the process of participative management was identified and described by means of interviews with management specialists and a literature control. Through this process guidelines were formulated to implement participative management in <b>nursing</b> <b>services.</b> During a workshop with <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers in charge posts in the public sector hospitals in Transvaal, guidelines for the implementation of participative management were streamlined and verified with a managerial specialist. Participative management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> is a dynamic process of creative problernsolving and mutual decision-making within the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> between the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager and the professional nurse. It is a process of information exchange and consultation between the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager and the nurse, and undergoes three phases during implementation: namely the prepajgtory, the implementation and the evaluation phase. During these phases the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager acts as a facilitator in optimising the professional maturity level of the nurse. This promotes a co-responsibility and co-accountability within the decision-making process in order to promote wholeness in the <b>nursing</b> <b>service.</b> The managerial style of the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager promotes the mission and goals of the <b>nursing</b> <b>service,</b> improves job satisfaction, personnel management and quality nursing care. This facilitates wholeness, in the sense of total well-being, within the professional nurse and the patient. Recommendations forthcoming from this study should address nursing practice, nursing education and nursing research. It is recommended that participative management should be implemented, by means of the guidelines that have been formulated, in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service.</b> A <b>nursing.</b> model for particjnativ:e management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> should be developed. Further recommendations are that the effect of participative management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> on professional <b>nurses,</b> quality nursing care, nursing management, job satisfaction experienced by nurses within a multi-cultural context and personnel turnover be examined...|$|R

40|$|<b>Nursing</b> <b>service</b> in {{hospital}} {{is the main}} part of health services given to patients. <b>Nursing</b> <b>service</b> quality is most affected by nurses’ effectiveness in giving service on patient, because nurses give high contribution and represent the backbone of service quality in the hospital. The back and forth of <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> is very depended on the commitment of nurse herself to organization (hospital) to always be responsible morally and professionally. A credit to be nurse and to be admitted as part of an organization is the major.
