Common sense tells us that locally produced news and {{in the language of}} the people will have credibility as opposed to news coming from Delhi or Mumbai. Many studies have established this hypothesis that television news audience believes in local channels more than the so-called national networks. Credibility factor depends on a nine dimension credibility measuring scale. The researchers would like to find out if this hypothesis is right and the reasons for the same.
