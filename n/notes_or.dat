5|$|Related to {{this use}} of resonance, Messiaen also {{composed}} music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note is combined with higher <b>notes</b> <b>or</b> chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like mixture stops on a pipe organ. An example is {{the song of the}} golden oriole in Le loriot of the Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano (Example 4).|$|E
5|$|Since {{approximately}} 1850, clarinets {{have been}} nominally tuned according to twelve-tone equal temperament. Older clarinets were nominally tuned to meantone. A skilled performer can use {{his or her}} embouchure to considerably alter the tuning of individual <b>notes</b> <b>or</b> produce vibrato, a pulsating change of pitch often employed in jazz. Vibrato is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as Richard Stoltzman, use vibrato in classical music. Special fingerings {{may be used to}} play quarter tones and other microtonal intervals.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} the two species are not similar. The call of the greater melampitta is a double or triple note, which is slurred and {{repeated}} monotonously, and {{is reminiscent of the}} black pitohui. The call of the lesser melampitta are either harsh buzzy <b>notes</b> <b>or</b> chirped whistles, both of which are repeated at intervals.|$|E

5|$|The text {{begins by}} stating {{the size of}} the bird.

5|$|In May 1912, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company {{placed an}} order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for two new cargo ships— and Ohioan. The {{contract}} {{cost of the}} ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum price of $640,000 per ship. Maryland Steel financed the construction with a credit plan which called for a 5% down payment in cash followed by nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal allowed {{for some of the}} nine installments to be converted into longer-term <b>notes</b> <b>or</b> mortgages. The final cost of Ohioan, including financing costs, was $73.58 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $730,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{libraries}} of Europe contain many medieval {{copies of}} ancient Greek and Latin texts. Many of these contain short <b>notes</b> <b>or</b> 'subscriptions' {{on the final}} page that, in hundreds of cases, give {{the total number of}} lines in the work. In texts of classical authors such as Herodotus and Demosthenes, these totals are expressed in the older, acrophonic numerals that were used in Athens during the classical period but abandoned sometime during the Hellenistic period. Thus these stichometric totals are thought to descend, along with the content of the texts, from very early editions.|$|E
5000|$|In music, {{the fifth}} factor of a chord is the <b>note</b> <b>or</b> pitch {{that is the}} fifth scale degree, {{counting}} the root or tonal center. When the fifth is the bass <b>note,</b> <b>or</b> lowest <b>note,</b> of the expressed chord, the chord is in second inversion [...]|$|R
5000|$|The fourth {{factor of}} a chord is the <b>note</b> <b>or</b> pitch four scale degrees above the root or tonal center.

5|$|Introducing {{more taxes}} {{proved to be}} hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, {{and the people of}} the state simply did not have that much money to give. Bond issues {{generated}} controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads that were never built, or were constructed and then torn up and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received the same amount of funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate for a state penitentiary roof, which was diverted for the construction of a mansion of a Republican official J.L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory <b>notes,</b> <b>or</b> scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of the state could not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{performances}} are strung together from the meditative and measured alap (non-metrical introduction) and jor (performance with pulse) in dhrupad style, {{followed by a}} faster and less reserved gat section (composition with rhythmic pattern provided by the tabla) in khyal style. He experimented with a style of jhala (performance with rapid pulse) developed by Bundu Khan, but considered it more appropriate for plucked instruments and stopped performing it. The gat section includes one or two parts with compositions. When two gats are used, the first one tends {{to be at a}} slow or medium tempo, and the second one is faster; the gats are usually performed in the 16-beat rhythmic cycle tintal. Narayan often completes performances with ragas associated with thumri (a popular light classical genre), which are referred to as mishra (Sanskrit: mixed) because they allow for additional <b>notes,</b> <b>or</b> with a dhun (song based on folk music).|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original <b>notes,</b> <b>or</b> metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E
5000|$|In music, {{the second}} factor of a chord is the <b>note</b> <b>or</b> pitch two scale degrees above the root or tonal center. When {{the second is the}} bass <b>note,</b> <b>or</b> lowest <b>note,</b> of the {{expressed}} chord, the chord is in third inversion [...] However, this is equivalent to a gapped eleventh chord.|$|R

5|$|Linen was Scotland's premier {{industry}} in the 18th century and {{formed the basis for}} the later cotton, jute, and woollen industries. Scottish industrial policy was made by the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland, which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woollens, this meant linen. Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market. The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen {{industry in}} the 18th century, exporting linen to England and America. As a joint-stock company, it had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory <b>notes</b> <b>or</b> bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity. Renamed the British Linen Bank in 1906, it was one of Scotland's premier banks until it was bought out by the Bank of Scotland in 1969. It joined the established Scottish banks such as the Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1695) and the Royal Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1727). Glasgow would soon follow and Scotland had a flourishing financial system {{by the end of the}} century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Another {{common form}} of synesthesia is the {{association}} of sounds with colors. For some, everyday sounds such as doors opening, cars honking, or people talking can trigger seeing colors. For others, colors are triggered when musical <b>notes</b> <b>or</b> keys are being played. People with synesthesia related to music may also have perfect pitch because their ability to see/hear colors aids them in identifying <b>notes</b> <b>or</b> keys.|$|E

25|$|Unlike all {{previous}} series, these notes were all uniform in dimensions rather than staggered {{in size from}} smallest to largest. There are rumors that the original designs for the 1,000 and 2,000 won notes depicted Kim Il-sung and had similar design features to the 5,000 won that were scrapped and destroyed due to counterfeiters or thieves breaking into a bank warehouse and stealing early <b>notes</b> <b>or</b> printing materials, {{resulting in a total}} redesign of the two denominations in question.|$|E
25|$|Like any plucked instrument, {{mandolin}} notes decay {{to silence}} rather than sound out continuously {{as with a}} bowed note on a violin, and mandolin notes decay faster than larger stringed instruments like the guitar. This encourages the use of tremolo (rapid picking {{of one or more}} pairs of strings) to create sustained <b>notes</b> <b>or</b> chords. The mandolin's paired strings facilitate this technique: the plectrum (pick) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately, providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would.|$|E
