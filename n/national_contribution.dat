25|$|As the {{commemorative}} coin act legislation was pending, the DAV announced in March 2008 an additional donation of $600,000—half of {{which came from}} the state chapter in California, and half {{of which was a}} matching donation by the DAV. But although the national DAV had pledged to match state donations up to $3 million (for a total DAV state and <b>national</b> <b>contribution</b> of $6 million), $2.4 million of the pledge was still unfulfilled by early 2008. A second major memorial donation came in April 2008 when businessman H. Ross Perot agreed to give three annual payments of $1 million each to the DVLMF. Perot's contribution (the largest yet from an individual or group not already associated with the memorial foundation) brought the total amount of funds raised for construction and maintenance to $55.1 million. At this point, the DVLMF still claimed they only needed $65 million to begin construction. News sources reported that the foundation intended to begin and finish construction in 2010.|$|E
