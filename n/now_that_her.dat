25|$|Nancy is {{the female}} {{half of the}} human couple in the play; she is married to Charlie. Unlike her husband, Nancy is vibrant and curious about the world. When the play opens, she wants to live at the beach forever. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> {{children}} are grown, Nancy wants to have adventures. Charlie does not share her desires and does his best to discourage them. Despite Charlie's negative attitude, Nancy remains open to what comes her way, including the lizards.|$|E
25|$|Engel and {{the other}} {{producers}} {{did not want to}} lose Berkley, however, as she was the strongest actress they'd seen during casting. Berkley originally auditioned for the role of Karen, a love-interest of Zack's on Good Morning, Miss Bliss, but lost the role because she was so much taller than Gosselaar at the time. Engel believed that, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> height was more even {{with the rest of the}} cast, she could be perfect. They were not having much luck in casting the third new character, Jessie Spano, who was conceived as a strong, feminist activist and a straight-A student, so Engel suggested offering the role to Berkley, who gladly accepted it.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{conventional}} chart hits of the time, [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] featured {{lyrics that}} were interpreted as expressions of resentment rather than love. Author Oliver Trager characterizes the lyrics as: [...] "Dylan's sneer {{at a woman}} who has fallen from grace and is reduced to fending for herself in a hostile, unfamiliar world." [...] The song's subject, [...] "Miss Lonely," [...] previously opted for easy options in life—she attended the finest schools and enjoyed high-placed friends—but <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> situation has become difficult, it appears that she has no meaningful experiences to define her character. The opening lines of the song establish the character's former condition: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jenna Bans and {{directed}} by Tom Verica. Edward Ornelas edited the episode, and Donald Lee Harris served as production designer. The episode's title refers to the song [...] "", by American alternative rock group Community Trolls. Featured music includes The Voluntary Butler Scheme's [...] "Trading Things In" [...] and Dragonette's [...] "Come On Be Good". Pompeo was pregnant during the episode, so the filming crew had to work around it. In the episode, Lexie advocated for Meredith to donate her liver, because she was unable to. Bans commented on this: [...] "It was REALLY {{easy for me to}} understand Lexie in this episode – 'cause that's how I imagine she grew up with [...] and Thatcher. There was taco night, and movie night, and if she had homework issues, one of them was always around to help. So <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> Dad needs some of her liver, recovering alcoholic or not, she’s gonna do it. She's not even thinking about the Chief's upcoming merger – and the fact that recovering from a major surgery will put her on the bench, out of the game, for at least a month. Lexie doesn't blink, because family isn't an obligation to her like it is {{for a lot of people}} - [...] it's a gift." [...] The scene in which Meredith offers her liver to Thatcher was originally intended to rekindle their relationship. Bans later changed this, following a request from Pompeo, and offered her insight: ...|$|E
2500|$|The place Button-Bright, Cap'n Bill, and Trot {{have arrived}} in, Jinxland, {{is cut off}} from the rest of Oz by a range of high {{mountains}} and a bottomless crevice. [...] The kingdom has had a turbulent recent history. The rightful king of Jinxland, King Kynd, was removed by his prime minister Phearse, who was in turn removed by his prime minister Krewl who now rules over the land. [...] An unpleasant but wealthy citizen named Googly-Goo seeks to marry King Kynd's daughter, Princess Gloria; however, she is in love with Pon, the current gardener's boy, who is the son of the first usurper Phearse. King Krewl and Googly-Goo hire a witch named Blinkie to freeze Gloria's heart so that she will no longer love Pon. Cap'n Bill happens on this plot, and to keep him from interfering, Blinkie turns him into a grasshopper. [...] She then freezes Gloria's heart. [...] Googly-Goo proposes to her, but <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> heart is frozen, she does not love anyone at all, including Googly-Goo, whose proposal she scornfully declines.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{the death}} of Iyasu II, his son Iyoas took the throne and rivalry {{exploded}} between {{the mother of the}} late Emperor and his widow. Empress Mentewab had been crowned co-ruler when her then underage son had succeeded her husband. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> son was gone, she believed that she was entitled to remain as co-ruler. [...] However, Iyasu's widow, Welete Bersabe (known as Wubit) of the Oromo, strongly believed that it was her turn to take the leading role at the court of her son Iyoas as her mother-in-law had done during the previous reign. [...] The young Emperor took the side of his mother against his grandmother. [...] Empress Mentewab gathered her relatives from her native Qwara and their forces flooded into Gondar to support her claims. [...] When news of the arrival of the Qwaran troops arrived, Welete Bersabe also summoned her relatives from Yejju, and throngs of soldiers arrived from that district to uphold her claims. [...] The city of Gondar was swamped by these two tense armies, and a bloodbath seemed imminent.|$|E

60|$|Here Christie {{thought to}} slip away, {{feeling that it}} was no place for her <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> errand was done. But Mrs. Carrol called her back.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to Christine <b>now</b> <b>that</b> possibly <b>her</b> husband had {{thought better of}} obtruding himself upon her company {{within an hour of}} revealing his existence to her, and had decided to pay a more formal visit next day. She therefore adopted Mrs. Wake's suggestion and retired.|$|R
6000|$|The {{girl was}} <b>now</b> aware <b>that</b> <b>her</b> visitor {{was hoping to}} gain some further information, and so curtly answered: [...] "I've never seen my father since that night the {{soldiers}} came and took him away to the fort. And {{my mother told me}} he died down in Texas." ...|$|R
60|$|And then Bertram skulked off--or endeavoured {{rather to}} do so; for Mrs. Wilkinson {{detected}} {{him in the}} act, and stopped him. She had said nothing hitherto about his matrimonial or non-matrimonial affairs.

6000|$|... "Ma'am--Miss Eve--Mrs. Effingham!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} {{as soon as}} her young {{mistress}} entered, afraid of saying too much, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> nursling had become a married woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and I {{shall be}} able to boast of having had quite a little adventure," [...] said Minnie, who, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> anxiety was ever, began to feel elated.|$|E
6000|$|... "The drop {{has made}} it overflow. She has {{repressed}} more than was good for her, and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> guard is broken down, she gives way under the whole weight." ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>now</b> noticed <b>that</b> <b>her</b> fellow-traveller {{kept his}} head and his whole person as snugly back in the corner, out of her way, as it was {{possible}} to do.

6000|$|It was thus, {{and only}} <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> {{he began to}} know the real nature of the woman whom he had succeeded in making his own, and of whom he found <b>now</b> <b>that</b> even <b>her</b> own friends would attempt to rob him. 'I will bear it,' he said, as he embraced her. 'I will bear it, if I can, like a man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The undisguised amusement, {{mingled with}} relief, that had overspread Barker's face during this lively recital might have pricked the {{conscience}} of Mrs. Horncastle, {{but for some reason}} I fear it did not. But it emboldened her to go on. [...] "I said I promised <b>her</b> <b>that</b> I would see she wasn't disturbed; but, of course, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> YOU, <b>her</b> HUSBAND, have come, if"-- ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} the countess summoned her {{subjects}} {{to meet in the}} courtyard of the castle, and told them that <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> husband was dead there was none to defend her lands.|$|E
60|$|The girl smiled wanly. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> {{face and}} hands were clean, Nat {{saw that she was}} a pretty little thing, and would have been prettier had not her hair been cut quite short.|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> {{mother was}} absent she wore fearlessly the shining bracelet. About her throat she {{fastened}} with delighted vanity the little necklace, declaring, with one more loving glance into the mirror, {{that she was}} ready.|$|E
60|$|I could {{distinguish}} the sound clearly enough <b>now</b> to know <b>that</b> <b>her</b> quick, feminine perception had not deceived <b>her,</b> and <b>that</b> {{it was indeed}} caused by a running man.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the last}} scene Sapphire works in her father's garden, with her neighbour's dog, Sadie, staying {{with her on}} trial, lying beside her.

Sapphire realises <b>that</b> she is <b>now</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>her</b> father is alive.|$|R
60|$|When I {{was called}} to breakfast the next morning I saw that the table was laid with covers for two. In a moment my hostess entered and bade me good-morning. We {{sat down at the}} table; and the elderly woman waited. I could <b>now</b> see <b>that</b> <b>her</b> face was the color of a shop-worn lemon.|$|R
60|$|Then the {{beautiful}} woman arose and {{stepped down from}} the table to the floor; and if Gebhart thought her beautiful before, he thought her a thousand times more beautiful <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> eyes looked into his.|$|E
60|$|She chided {{herself for}} her mistrust of him; {{was it not}} natural that he should wish to rule? How proud was she <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> last act of {{absolute}} power should be the satisfaction of his desire.|$|E
60|$|Myeerah's story {{elicited}} {{cheers and}} praises from all. She was entreated to tell another, but smilingly shook her head. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> shyness had worn off {{to some extent}} she took great interest in the jest and the general conversation.|$|E
