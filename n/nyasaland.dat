5|$|In 1944, the <b>Nyasaland</b> African Congress (NAC) {{was formed}} by the Africans of <b>Nyasaland</b> to promote local {{interests}} to the British government. In 1953, Britain linked <b>Nyasaland</b> with Northern and Southern Rhodesia in what was the Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland,</b> often called the Central African Federation (CAF), for mainly political reasons. Even though the Federation was semi-independent, the linking provoked opposition from African nationalists, and the NAC gained popular support. An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. Hastings Banda, a European-trained doctor working in Ghana who was persuaded to return to <b>Nyasaland</b> in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause. Banda {{was elected president of}} the NAC and worked to mobilise nationalist sentiment before being jailed by colonial authorities in 1959. He was released in 1960 and asked to help draft a new constitution for <b>Nyasaland,</b> with a clause granting Africans the majority in the colony's Legislative Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, in {{the face}} of African opposition, Britain {{consolidated}} the two Rhodesias with <b>Nyasaland</b> (Malawi) in the ill-fated Central African Federation, which was essentially dominated by Southern Rhodesia. Growing African nationalism and general dissent, particularly in <b>Nyasaland,</b> persuaded Britain to dissolve the Union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While multiracial democracy was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland,</b> however, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the rebellion, most of the {{remaining}} insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across the Shire Highlands, towards Portuguese East Africa, from where they hoped to head north to German territory. Chilembwe was seen by a patrol of <b>Nyasaland</b> police and shot dead on 3 February near Mlanje. Many other rebels were captured; 300 were imprisoned following the rebellion and 40 were executed. Around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the <b>Nyasaland</b> border.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Southern Rhodesia {{entered into}} a federal union with Northern Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> to form the Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland.</b> Upon union, a blue ensign with a unified badge was adopted to replace the {{respective}} previous flags. Southern Rhodesia was represented in the federation's flag by a red lion {{that had previously been}} on their old flag.|$|E
5|$|Scouting in {{the former}} Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> started in 1909 when the first Boy Scout troop was registered. Scouting grew quickly and in 1924 Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> sent a large {{contingent}} to the second World Scout Jamboree in Ermelunden, Denmark. In 1959, Rhodesia hosted the Central African Jamboree at Ruwa. In 2009, Scouts celebrated 100 years of Scouting in Zimbabwe and hundreds of Scouts camped at Gordon Park, a Scout campground and training area, as part of these celebrations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Nyasaland</b> African Congress (NAC) was {{particularly}} vocal about increased African {{representation in the}} <b>Nyasaland</b> Legislative Council, demanding in September 1957 an African majority in the council. Nyasaland's inclusion in the federation was never a goal of its proponents, it was there primarily {{because it was not}} economically viable by itself. Welensky did not understand or appreciate the party's goal of increased African representation or secession when it relied on the federation for its well being.|$|E
5|$|The area of Africa {{now known}} as Malawi was settled by {{migrating}} Bantu groups around the 10th century. Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as <b>Nyasaland,</b> a protectorate of the United Kingdom, became a protectorate within the semi-independent Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland.</b> The Federation was dissolved in 1963. In 1964 the protectorate over <b>Nyasaland</b> was ended and <b>Nyasaland</b> became an independent country under Queen Elizabeth II with the new name Malawi. Two years later it became a republic. Upon gaining independence it became a one-party state under the presidency of Hastings Banda, who remained president until 1994, when he lost an election. Arthur Peter Mutharika is the current president. Malawi has a democratic, multi-party government. The country has a Malawian Defence Force that includes an army, a navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is pro-Western and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several international organisations, including the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the African Union (AU).|$|E
5|$|Worrying {{that the}} {{rebellion}} might rapidly reignite and spread, the colonial authorities instigated arbitrary reprisals against the Nyasa population, including mass hut burnings. All weapons were confiscated and fines of 4 shillings per person were levied in the districts {{affected by the}} revolt, {{regardless of whether the}} people in question had been involved. The colonial government also begun attacking the rights of missionaries in <b>Nyasaland</b> and banned many independent churches, including Kitawala, from <b>Nyasaland,</b> and placed restrictions on other African-run churches. Public gatherings, especially those associated with African-initiated religious groups, were banned until 1919. Fear of similar uprisings in other colonies, notably Northern Rhodesia, also led to similar repression of independent churches and foreign missions beyond <b>Nyasaland.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did not itself achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in <b>Nyasaland</b> history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in <b>Nyasaland</b> and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, Welensky was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland.</b> He had earlier wanted an amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia with a constitution similar to that of Southern Rhodesia (that had granted responsible government to the white Rhodesians). After the British Government rejected this idea, he set about the creation of a federation, and against his judgement, the small colony of <b>Nyasaland</b> was included. His main wish for amalgamation, and later federation, was primarily so the complementary economic strengths of the Rhodesias could be put to best use. He felt that the colonies were missing out on the post-war economic boom.|$|E
5|$|She {{was devastated}} by her husband's death and retired to Scotland. However, {{after a meeting}} with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, she broke her {{retirement}} and resumed her public duties. Eventually she became just as busy as queen mother as she had been as queen consort. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> with Princess Margaret. She laid the foundation stone of the University College of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> – the current University of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> formed the Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> in August 1953, Huggins became the amalgamated body's first Prime Minister. Salisbury was {{designated}} the Federal capital, and the United Party renamed itself the United Rhodesia Party. Garfield Todd {{took over as}} Southern Rhodesia's Prime Minister. Huggins headed the Federal government for three years, then retired in November 1956 after a combined 23 years as a national leader. The United Rhodesia Party merged with the Federal Party to become the United Federal Party (UFP) in November 1957, and the liberal Todd was voted out of office by the more right-wing members of his party four months later, in February 1958. He was replaced by Sir Edgar Whitehead. Todd led {{his own version of}} the United Rhodesia Party against the UFP and the Dominion Party in June the same year, but failed to win a single seat—the UFP won 17 of the 30 seats, with the Dominion Party taking the remainder.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{was appalled}} when Britain made India {{independent}} in 1947—he {{held that the}} British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, a British colony in southern Africa that had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> alongside Northern Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland.</b> Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.|$|E
5|$|The1982Commonwealth Gameswere held inBrisbane,Queensland,Australia. Forty-six nations {{participated in}} the Brisbane Games with a new record total of 1,583 athletes and 571 officials. As hosts, Australia headed the medal table leading the way ahead of England, Canada, Scotland and New Zealand respectively. Zimbabwe made its first {{appearance}} at the Games, having earlier competed as Southern Rhodesia {{and as part of}} Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland.</b>|$|E
5|$|With new constitutions {{in place}} for the territories, {{elections}} were held throughout 1961–62, with Welensky's UFP being beaten in each one. In <b>Nyasaland,</b> the African nationalist Malawi Congress Party won a huge majority and Banda set about lobbying the British Government for the break-up of the federation and the independence of <b>Nyasaland</b> as Malawi. In Northern Rhodesia, neither the UFP nor the two African nationalist parties held a majority, but the African nationalists united to push for independence. Welensky hoped to get a display of confidence in federation, so he dissolved parliament in mid-1962 and held elections. While his party won a huge victory, it did so because it was completely unopposed. Neither the recently formed Rhodesian Front (RF) nor the African nationalist parties bothered to contest it.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{broke out}} in July 1914. By September 1914, the war had spread to Africa as the British and Belgians began a long {{military}} campaign against the German colonial army in German East Africa. In <b>Nyasaland,</b> the major effect {{of the war was}} massive recruitment of Africans to serve as porters in support of the Allied armies. Porters lived in extremely poor conditions which left them exposed to disease and mortality rates among them during the campaigns were high. At the same time, the recruitment of porters created a shortage of labour which increased the economic pressures on Africans in <b>Nyasaland.</b> Millenarians at the time believed that World War I would be a form of Armageddon, which they believed would destroy the colonial powers and pave the way for the emergence of independent African states.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{government}} {{was startled by}} Britain's announcement in October 1963 that <b>Nyasaland</b> would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised {{that it was going}} to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after <b>Nyasaland.</b> The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.|$|E
5|$|In {{international}} affairs {{the most dramatic}} event during Douglas-Home's premiership was the assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963. Douglas-Home, clearly moved, broadcast a tribute on television. He had liked and worked well with Kennedy, and did not develop such a satisfactory relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement {{on the question of}} British trade with Cuba. Under Douglas-Home the colonies of Northern Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> gained independence, though this was as a result of negotiations led by Macleod under the Macmillan government.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia did {{not appear}} at the Olympics again until 1960, {{although}} Rhodesian athletes {{had the option of}} competing internationally for South Africa. Leonard Hall, for example, won a gold medal in the welterweight division of the 1930 British Empire Games under the South African banner. By the time of the 1960 Summer Olympics, Southern Rhodesia was part of the Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> (which included what is now Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) that entered the Games under the banner of Rhodesia. Fourteen athletes — nine men and five women — took part in six sports: track and field, boxing, diving, sailing, shooting, and swimming. Competing in the Flying Dutchman class, sailors Alan David Butler and Christopher Bevan finished fourth, which was Rhodesia's best result under that name. After the Federation dissolved in 1963, <b>Nyasaland</b> became Malawi, while Northern and Southern Rhodesia began competing separately. The North entered the Games as Northern Rhodesia, but left under the flag of Zambia, while the South remained Southern Rhodesia. It sent 25 men (including its field hockey squad) and four women; both the field hockey team and the Flying Dutchman crew finished 11th, while no individual athlete placed better than 17th.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} full {{dominion}} status was then regarded {{as something of}} a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland,</b> two protectorates directly administered from London, with the hope of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.|$|E
5|$|Behind the scenes, Welensky and the Rhodesians {{had been}} courting the Conservatives, while the native Africans {{had been doing}} the same with Labour. A British general {{election}} was held in 1951 and the Conservatives gained power. Labour, mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both Northern Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests, had been lukewarm at best {{to the idea of}} federation, and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation. After the election, the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only {{with the support of the}} Conservatives, with both Liberal and Labour Parties now opposed.|$|E
5|$|Born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) to an Afrikaner {{mother and}} a Lithuanian Jewish father, he moved to Northern Rhodesia, became {{involved}} with the trade unions, and entered the colonial legislative council in 1938. There, he campaigned for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia (the latter under white self-government, the former under the colonial office). Although unsuccessful, he succeeded {{in the formation of}} the Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland,</b> a state within the British Empire that sought to retain predominant power for the white minority while moving in a progressive political direction, in contrast to apartheid South Africa.|$|E
5|$|By late 1915, British {{forces in}} the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland,</b> on German East Africa's {{south-western}} flank, were severely stretched. Disease was a constant curse, decimating the ranks. Francis Drummond Chaplin, the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 askaris, and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would {{foot the bill for}} the organisation of this enterprise. After this was resolved in April 1916—the Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British Colonial Office—recruitment began in May.|$|E
5|$|Chilembwe {{also sought}} {{support for his}} {{uprising}} from the German forces in German East Africa, on Nyasaland's far northern border, hoping that a German offensive from the north combined with a native insurrection in the south might force the British out of <b>Nyasaland</b> permanently. On 24 January, he {{sent a letter to}} the German Governor by courier through Portuguese East Africa. The courier was intercepted and the letter was never received. During the latter stages of the East African Campaign, after the German invasion of Portuguese East Africa, the German colonial army actually helped to suppress anti-Portuguese rebellions, among the Makombe and Barue peoples, worrying that African uprisings would destabilise the colonial order.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins {{was born}} in Nairobi, then in British Kenya, on 26 March 1941. He {{is the son of}} Jean Mary Vyvyan (née Ladner) and Clinton John Dawkins, who was an {{agricultural}} civil servant in the British Colonial Service in <b>Nyasaland</b> (now Malawi). His father was called up into the King's African Rifles during World War II and returned to England in 1949, when Dawkins was eight. His father had inherited a country estate, Over Norton Park in Oxfordshire, which he farmed commercially. Dawkins considers himself English and lives in Oxford, England. Dawkins has a younger sister.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Paton began {{construction}} of a wool factory at Darlington and a Rayon factory at Carrickfergus, both jobs were completed in 1951. In 1946 Paton {{was put in charge}} of an economic survey of Syria which required him to traverse the country by aircraft and car. The report, issued in 1947, recommended port, water infrastructure and irrigation improvements and the {{construction of}} a hydroelectric power station on the Euphrates River. Paton undertook a similar survey in Lebanon from 1947 to 1948. He was also involved in a report on the possibility of running a railroad from Northern Rhodesia to Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and <b>Nyasaland.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Banda's Malawi Congress Party (MCP) {{gained a}} {{majority}} in the Legislative Council elections and Banda became Prime Minister in 1963. The Federation was dissolved in 1963, and on 6 July 1964, <b>Nyasaland</b> became independent from British rule and renamed itself Malawi. Under a new constitution, Malawi became a republic with Banda as its first president. The new document also formally made Malawi a one-party state with the MCP as the only legal party. In 1971, Banda was declared president-for-life. For almost 30 years, Banda presided over a rigidly authoritarian regime, which ensured that Malawi did not suffer armed conflict. Opposition parties, including the Malawi Freedom Movement of Orton Chirwa and the Socialist League of Malawi, were founded in exile.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia first participated as Rhodesia in the Olympic Games in 1928, when it {{sent two}} boxers to Amsterdam, {{both of whom}} were {{eliminated}} in their second bout. The dominion did not appear at the Games under a Rhodesian banner until 1960, when it sent a fourteen-athlete delegation as part of the Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland.</b> In Rome, two sailors, Alan David Butler and Christopher Bevan, finished fourth, which was Rhodesia's best result until it became Zimbabwe in 1980. Southern Rhodesia sent 29 competitors, including a field hockey team, to the 1964 Summer Games, which was its last Olympic appearance under the Rhodesian banner.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia's main {{contribution}} to the Burma Campaign in terms of manpower {{was made by the}} Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR), a regiment of black troops led by white officers that joined the front at the end of 1944. The colony also made a significant {{contribution to}} the Commonwealth forces' command element in Burma, providing white officers and NCOs to the 81st (West Africa), 82nd (West Africa) and 11th (East Africa) Divisions, made up of units from Nigeria, the Gold Coast, the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, <b>Nyasaland,</b> Northern Rhodesia and the Congo. Almost every African battalion in Burma had white Rhodesian officers and NCOs attached; some were over 70% Rhodesian-led.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion, The Rhodesian Light Infantry, {{commonly}} the Rhodesian Light Infantry (1RLI or RLI), {{was originally}} formed in 1961 as a regiment {{of the army}} of the Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland.</b> Raised as a light infantry unit at Brady Barracks, Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia, the Regiment served in the Rhodesian Bush War as part of the Rhodesian Security Forces between 1964 and 1979, from 1965 under the unrecognised governments of Rhodesia and latterly, {{during the second half of}} 1979, Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The RLI remained active during an interim period under British control and then, from April 1980, within the armed forces of Zimbabwe, before disbanding on 31 October 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Chartered Company's native commissioners {{began to}} fear a {{possible}} tribal rebellion during early 1915. Herbert Taylor, the chief native commissioner, believed that foreign missionaries were secretly encouraging rural black people {{to emulate the}} Chilembwe revolt in <b>Nyasaland,</b> and telling them (falsely) that the British were exterminating the natives there. There were few actual attempts to topple the administration in Southern Rhodesia, but the Company still took precautions. Aware that Mashona svikiro (spirit mediums) had been instrumental in inciting and leading insurgencies against Company rule during the late 1890s, the native commissioners enacted new legislation designed to imprison any svikiro who gained significant popularity.|$|E
5|$|The Chilembwe {{uprising}} was {{a rebellion}} against British colonial rule in <b>Nyasaland</b> (modern-day Malawi) in January 1915, led by John Chilembwe, an American-educated Baptist minister, whose radical evangelical views of racial injustice {{may also have}} been influenced by millenarian Christian. Based around his church in the village of Mbombwe in the south-east of the country, the revolt was centred on the black middle class and encouraged by grievances against the colonial system, including forced labour, discrimination and the new demands on the indigenous population caused by the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
5|$|The flag of Southern Rhodesia was a blue ensign, later {{changed to}} a sky-blue ensign, with the coat of arms of Southern Rhodesia on it. The flag was in use in Southern Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe) during 1923–53 and 1963–65. It was also used by the unrecognised Rhodesia between 1965 and 1968. The flag was {{initially}} used unofficially internally before being approved for use outside of the colony by the Colonial Office in 1937. The colour was changed to sky blue in 1964 to protest the treatment of Southern Rhodesia after its inclusion in the failed Federation of Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland.</b>|$|E
5|$|The1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Gameswere held inPerth,Western Australia,Australia. Thirty-five {{countries}} sent a {{total of}} 863 athletes and 178 officials to Perth. Jersey was amongst the medal winners for the first time, whilst British Honduras, Dominica, Papua and New Guinea and St Lucia all made their inaugural Games appearances. Aden also competed by special invitation. Sarawak, North Borneo and Malaya competed {{for the last time}} before taking part in 1966 under the Malaysian flag. In addition, Rhodesia and <b>Nyasaland</b> competed in the Games as an entity for the first and only time.|$|E
5|$|A NAC {{meeting was}} held outside Blantyre on 25 January. It was {{alleged that the}} meeting {{discussed}} in detail {{a plan for the}} overthrow of the territorial government and the massacre of the territory's whites and any blacks who collaborated with them. (although a subsequent Royal Commission found there was insufficient evidence to make such a claim). Welensky obtained the meeting's proceedings in early February and decided to act, calling a meeting of the federal and territorial governments. Federal troops were deployed to <b>Nyasaland</b> on 21 February, the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency on 3 March and the nationalist leaders were arrested and flown to jails in Southern Rhodesia. In the subsequent fortnight, riots broke out and troops used force to end the violence. Almost 50 people died in the unrest.|$|E
