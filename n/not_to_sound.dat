500|$|One of the {{noticeable}} differences from Music Box and Carey's previous albums is its sound. The album {{was described by}} Afanasieff as a softer and more pop-oriented album, [...] "filling the songs with air", and allowing far more space in the overall sound. Another noticeable change is in the album's production. When Mariah Carey was released, critics took notice of its [...] "overly produced" [...] and [...] "studio perfect" [...] quality, where in comparison, Emotions maintains a [...] "raw, live sound." [...] Music Box however, falls in between the two, a decision made by Carey during the album's production. She would layer each track with live backing vocals, so <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> too overly produced, but still kept the inclusion of musical synthesizers.|$|E

500|$|Well, I {{actually}} had the idea, I wrote {{the story about}} what it is actually like to be in the Service, and it does take a lot of physical strength, but now that I've been through it – and even just for the three days I was there, [...] a lot of mental strength. We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community. <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> weird, but it seems like the heart of America.

A little lamb says, [...] "I know nothing, I was born yesterday". At the river bank, Gerda begs the river to take her in a row boat to Kay. She gives her new red shoes to the river, and her boat is guided down the stream {{to the home of}} a kind, old sorceress. She comes out of her garden to the trumpeting and drumming of four toy soldiers, who stand at her gate as sentinels. The old woman uses her crook to pull Gerda's boat to shore. She takes Gerda into her garden of eternal summer with sparkling flowers. In her house, the old woman puts Gerda to sleep by combing her hair. She wants Gerda to stay with her and forget Kay, but Gerda awakes when the old woman falls asleep. Gerda remembers Kay, but when she gets to the gate she finds that outside the garden it is already fall. She begs the toy soldier sentinels <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> their bugles and drums to awaken their mistress, and they comply.|$|E
2500|$|When Sam Carter {{joined the}} band to replace Matt Johnson, drummer Dan Searle had {{commented that the}} lyrics Carter wrote drew from more {{personal}} experience than those of his predecessor. The lyrics of Hollow Crown focus {{on a number of}} themes, with some songs dealing with everyday life like sitting in a car with friends or angst against girls, while some other songs, particularly [...] "Early Grave", [...] "Follow the Water" [...] and [...] "In Elegance", were written about Carter's growing dependence on cannabis and him [...] "struggling against his own instincts and self-destructive obsessions". Two songs featured on Hollow Crown – [...] "Dead March" [...] and [...] "Left with the Last Minute" [...] – feature [...] "call and response-type" [...] lyrics about a stalker and their victim's response to being stalked, respectively. For the lyrics of Daybreaker, Carter and Tom Searle collaborated on writing, focusing on what they believed to be [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes, such as the critique of negative aspects of religion and society. Carter and Searle collaborated again on the lyrics of Lost Forever // Lost Together, and in an attempt <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like a [...] "broken record", they no longer only addressed political issues, but also focused on themes that everyone can relate to.|$|E

[...] This voice John calls the word, the word that was with the Father before he made the world, and that at this very time was heard to walk in the garden of Adam: Therefore John also saith, this voice was in the beginning; that is, in the garden with Adam, {{at the beginning of his}} conversion, as well as of the beginning of the world (John 1:1).|$|E

And, as all languages perfect themselves by a gradual process of desynonymizing words originally equivalent, I have cherished the wish {{to use the word}} 'poesy' as the generic or common term, and to distinguish that species of poesy which is not 'muta poesis' by its usual name 'poetry;' while of all the other species which collectively form the Fine Arts, there would remain this as the common definition,--that they all, like poetry, are to express intellectual purposes, thoughts, conceptions, and sentiments which have their origin in the human mind,--not, however, as poetry does, by means of articulate speech, but as nature or the divine art does, by form, colour, magnitude, proportion, or by sound, that is, silently or musically.|$|E

6000|$|Maggie {{had liked}} her to understand, {{so far as}} this was possible; but had not been slow to see {{afterwards}} how the possibility was limited, when one came to think, by mysteries she was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound.</b> This inability in her was indeed not remarkable, inasmuch as the Princess herself, as we have seen, was only {{now in a position}} to boast of touching bottom. Maggie lived, inwardly, in a consciousness that she could but partly open even to so good a friend, and her own visitation of the fuller expanse of which was, for that matter, still going on. They had been duskier still, however, these recesses of her imagination--that, no doubt, was what might at present be said for them. She had looked into them, on the eve of her leaving town, almost without penetration: she had made out in those hours, and also, of a truth, during the days which immediately followed, little more than the strangeness of a relation having for its chief mark-- whether to be prolonged or not--the absence of any [...] "intimate" [...] result of the crisis she had invited her husband to recognise. They had dealt with this crisis again, face to face, very briefly, the morning after the scene in her room--but with the odd consequence of her having appeared merely to leave it on his hands. He had received it from her as he might have received a bunch of keys or a list of commissions--attentive to her instructions about them, but only putting them, for the time, very carefully and safely, into his pocket. The instructions had seemed, from day to day, to make so little difference for his behaviour--that is for his speech or his silence; to produce, as yet, so little of the fruit of action. He had taken from her, on the spot, in a word, before going to dress for dinner, all she then had to give--after which, on the morrow, he had asked her for more, a good deal as if she might have renewed her supply during the night; but he had had at his command for this latter purpose an air of extraordinary detachment and discretion, an air amounting really to an appeal which, if she could have brought herself to describe it vulgarly, she would have described as cool, just as he himself would have described it in any one else as [...] "cheeky"; a suggestion that she should trust him on the particular ground since she didn't on the general. Neither his speech nor his silence struck her as signifying more, or less, under this pressure, than they had seemed to signify for weeks past; yet if her sense hadn't been absolutely closed to the possibility in him of any thought of wounding her, she might have taken his undisturbed manner, the perfection of his appearance of having recovered himself, for one of those intentions of high impertinence by the aid of which great people, les grands seigneurs, persons of her husband's class and type, always know how to re-establish a violated order.|$|E
