50|$|Folio Number: Every page of {{a journal}} is numbered. This number {{is known as a}} <b>folio</b> <b>number.</b> <b>The</b> <b>folio</b> <b>number</b> is used as a cross {{reference}} between the journal and the ledger accounts. <b>The</b> use of <b>folio</b> <b>numbers</b> makes it easy to refer back from the ledger account to the journal entry or forward from the journal entry to the ledger account. In addition, folio numbers are a check that all journal entries have been recorded in the ledger system.|$|R

50|$|The Sharp Scale was {{devised by}} Henrietta Sharp Cockrell as an {{objective}} and scientific {{way to measure}} the opacity of paper, particularly of manuscript <b>folios,</b> 'in <b>the</b> field' without specialized equipment. A practical application of the technique {{could be done in}} a museum or library setting. To apply <b>the</b> method, <b>the</b> <b>folio</b> is first held at a distance of 15 cm from a 60 watt light source (such as an unshaded table lamp). A dowel (or pencil) is held behind and against it, creating a silhouette. Folios are then added until the outline of the pencil is no longer visible. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> of <b>the</b> <b>folios</b> needed to obscure the silhouette of the pencil is recorded.|$|R
40|$|The Padua-trained {{medical doctor}} Hartmann Schedel (1440 – 1514) of Nuremberg is today {{perhaps best known}} for his Liber Chronicarum, printed in Latin and German (Weltchronik) in 1493 with an ambitious {{programme}} of xylographies. Thanks to his well-spent study years in Padua (1463 – 1466), he also {{played an important role in}} the dissemination of Italian humanism north of the Alps, as witnessed, for example, by his important collection of inscriptions and Humanist texts. His rich library, consisting of manuscripts, both autographs and written by others, and printed books, was bought from his family by H. J. Fugger of Augsburg (1531 – 1598) in 1552. Fugger’s library was passed to the Bavarian Court Library in 1571 and is now housed at the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich. This article details one of the autograph manuscripts, the clm 490, containing medical texts. It gives direct access to Hartmann at work on his library, carefully writing out the contents in his all’antica hand, <b>numbering</b> <b>the</b> <b>folios,</b> providing a list of contents, presenting authors in short biographies and, last but not least, scrupulously dating and often localizing the sections copied...|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} the {{manuscript}} up until the early 17th century is unknown. It {{became part of the}} collection of the Imperial Library in Vienna between 1601 and 1636. In this period, the court librarian Sebastian Tengnagel registered it under the title Historia Hungarica de VII primis ducibus Hungariae auctore Belae regis notario ("Hungarian History of the First Seven Princes of Hungary Written by King Béla's Notary"). Tengnagel also added <b>numbers</b> to both <b>the</b> <b>folios</b> and <b>the</b> chapters. The codex was bound with a leather book cover, impressed with a double-headed eagle, in the late 18th century. The manuscript, which was transferred to Hungary in 1933 or 1934, is held in the Széchényi National Library in Budapest.|$|R

5000|$|Macbeth {{was first}} printed in <b>the</b> First <b>Folio</b> of 1623 and <b>the</b> <b>Folio</b> is <b>the</b> only {{source for the}} text. Some {{scholars}} contend that <b>the</b> <b>Folio</b> text was abridged and rearranged from an earlier manuscript or prompt book. [...] Often cited as interpolation are stage cues for two songs, whose lyrics {{are not included in}} <b>the</b> <b>Folio</b> but are included in Thomas Middleton's play The Witch, which was written between the accepted date for Macbeth (1606) and the printing of <b>the</b> <b>Folio.</b> Many scholars believe these songs were editorially inserted into <b>the</b> <b>Folio,</b> though whether they were Middleton's songs or preexisting songs is not certain. It is also widely believed that the character of Hecate, as well as some lines of the First Witch (4.1 124-31), were not part of Shakespeare's original play but were added by <b>the</b> <b>Folio</b> editors and possibly written by Middleton, though [...] "there is no completely objective proof" [...] of such interpolation.|$|R

50|$|It was {{not until}} 1616, the year of Shakespeare's death, that Ben Jonson defied {{convention}} by issuing a folio collection of his own plays and poems. Seven years later <b>the</b> <b>folio</b> volume Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories & Tragedies appeared; this edition is now called <b>the</b> First <b>Folio.</b> It contains 36 plays, 18 of which were printed for the first time. Because Shakespeare was dead, <b>the</b> <b>folio</b> was compiled by John Heminges and Henry Condell (fellow actors in Shakespeare's company), and arranged into comedies, histories and tragedies. <b>The</b> <b>Folio</b> is no more a definitive text than the quartos; many of the plays in <b>the</b> <b>folio</b> omit lines {{that can be found}} in quarto versions, and include misprints and textual corruption.|$|R
40|$|This Doctor of Philosophy {{submission}} {{consists of}} a folio of original compositions with an accompanying critical commentary. The compositions in <b>the</b> <b>folio</b> draw on <b>the</b> inspiration {{of a number of}} composers associated with the “Western Classical” tradition, as well as the influence of other musical styles and traditions such as Jazz. The commentary explores various aesthetic principles, musical influences and technical compositional approaches that stimulated the development towards an individual compositional output. A focus of the commentary is {{to draw attention to the}} unique synthesis of significant musical influences as evidenced in <b>the</b> <b>folio,</b> thereby elucidating a gradual development towards the attainment of a personal compositional style during candidature. <b>The</b> <b>folio</b> {{consists of a}}n eclectic collection of works, including many vocal works, chamber works and orchestral pieces. A seminal chamber work in <b>the</b> <b>folio,</b> Le Tombeau de Monk, exhibits the synthesis of several influential composers and styles. Also included in <b>the</b> <b>folio</b> is an extended symphonic work for combined orchestral and choral forces, Symphony for a Busy World, which represents the culmination of many compositional features that were developed throughout candidature. To provide background and perspective to <b>the</b> <b>folio</b> of compositions, <b>the</b> commentary highlights a number of influential compositional techniques and idiosyncrasies with regard to thematic development and harmonic language, as well as specific features of rhythm, orchestration and vocal writing. Detail regarding these compositional processes is provided, discussing the influence of particular compositional approaches relevant to the body of works in <b>the</b> <b>folio</b> within a music history context, whilst also identifying the application of compositional processes and approaches encountered in <b>the</b> <b>folio...</b>|$|R
25|$|At one time, it {{was thought}} that the Quarto {{represented}} a separate revision of the play by Shakespeare. However, since the Quarto contains many changes that can only be regarded as mistakes, it is now widely believed that the Quarto was produced by memorial reconstruction. It is thought likely that the Quarto was collectively produced by a company of actors remembering their lines. It is unknown why the actors did this, but it may have been to replace a missing prompt book. <b>The</b> <b>Folio</b> is regarded as having much higher authority than the Quarto, but because <b>the</b> <b>Folio</b> edition was collated by the printers against a Quarto (probably Q3), some errors from the Quarto found their way into <b>the</b> <b>Folio.</b> Some parts of <b>the</b> <b>Folio</b> (<b>the</b> beginning of Act III and much of Act V) are clearly copied, with little change, direct from <b>the</b> Quarto. <b>The</b> <b>Folio</b> also has its own corruptions and omissions, and corrections have to be supplied, where possible, from the Quarto.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> First <b>Folio</b> text of 1623 (F1), {{under the}} title The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus, is based {{primarily}} on the Q3 text (which is why modern editors use Q1 as the control rather than the usual practice in Shakespeare of using <b>the</b> <b>Folio</b> text). However, <b>the</b> <b>Folio</b> text includes material found in none of the quarto editions, primarily Act 3, Scene 2 (also called the 'fly-killing scene'). It is believed that while Q3 was probably the main source for <b>the</b> <b>Folio,</b> an annotated prompter's copy was also used, particularly in relation to stage directions, which differ significantly {{from all of the}} quarto texts.|$|R
