2500|$|Faragher {{was very}} sad {{to leave the}} island, but {{he tried to keep}} up to date with it as best as he could through letters and by reading The Isle of Man Examiner, sent to him each week {{courtesy}} of Roeder. He wrote in thanks to Roeder, commenting sadly that [...] "I am not longing for much but a sight of the sea." [...] He composed a lot of poetry whilst first at his son's, until illness overtook him. His son wrote that: [...] "He has been writing verse since he came here until his head got bad, and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> he shall write no more." [...] One of the most striking poems of this period comments on his sorrow at the decline of Manx culture: ...|$|E
2500|$|The April 5, 2008 Saturday Night Live {{show was}} the first time an episode hosted by Walken did not have a [...] "Continental" [...] sketch or a {{monologue}} in which he sang and danced. This episode, however, did include one sketch titled [...] "Meet the Family", which spoofs many of Walken's idiosyncrasies. The sketch depicts a fictional Walken family reunion, where all of Christopher's relatives have his mannerisms and speech patterns, and sport his trademark pompadour hairstyle. In order of appearance, the other Walkens are Christopher's cousin Stanley (Bill Hader); Stanley's brother John (Jason Sudeikis); John's son Scott (Andy Samberg) and daughter Maxine (Amy Poehler) (who carries a doll that also has a pompadour); Nathan (Fred Armisen), a gay relative for whom [...] "flamboyance" [...] means dressing all in black and running his finger around the rim of a cosmo glass; Uncle Richard (Darrell Hammond) and Aunt Martha (Kristen Wiig), who think that The Deer Hunter was hilarious, and who are hosts of a Nigerian foreign exchange student named Oleki (Kenan Thompson). When he came to live with them, Oleki—who has absorbed all of the Walken Family traits—could not speak any English. But <b>now</b> (<b>he</b> <b>says)</b> he [...] "talks like a normal teenaged American boy". The biggest laugh of the sketch occurs when Christopher expresses his sympathies for Scott's teenaged attitude: [...] "I appreciate your situation. For a Walken, adolescence is a difficult time. You feel like you're the only normal person in a school full of nutjobs." [...] Scott's response: [...] "Wow! It's like you're lookin' right into my noggin!" [...] (Will Forte also appears as a waiter {{at the beginning of the}} sketch, but does not do a Walken impression.) ...|$|E
