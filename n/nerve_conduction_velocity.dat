25|$|Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is {{the most}} common form of {{hereditary}} neuropathy and can be further subdivided into two types: Type 1: demyelinating, and Type 2: axonal. Measurement of chronaxie and rheobase for these diseased nerves has concluded that electrophysiologically, a patient with demyelinating (Type I) CMT demonstrates slow <b>nerve</b> <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity,</b> frequently accompanied by reduced amplitudes of motor and sensory action potentials; moreover, axonal (Type II) CMT can be attributed to impaired interaction between Schwann cells and axons. Changes in excitability measures are typically universal and vary little between patients, and this is likely due to the diffuse distribution of demyelination, suggesting changed cable properties associated with short internodes.|$|E
25|$|Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an {{antioxidant}} {{that is made}} naturally {{by human}} cells. It can also be administered in capsules or {{can be found in}} foods such as red meat, organ meats, and yeast. Like other antioxidants, it functions by ridding the body of harmful free radicals that can cause damage to tissues and organs. It has {{an important role in the}} Krebs cycle as a coenzyme leading to the production of antioxidants, intracellular glutathione, and nerve-growth factors. Animal research has also uncovered the ability of ALA to improve <b>nerve</b> <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity.</b> Because flavors are perceived by differences in electric potential through specific nerves innervating the tongue, idiopathic dysgeusia may be a form of a neuropathy. ALA has proven to be an effective treatment for burning mouth syndrome spurring studies in its potential to treat dysgeusia. In a study of forty-four patients diagnosed with the disorder, one half was treated with the drug for two months while the other half, the control group, was given a placebo for two months followed by a two-month treatment of ALA. The results reported show that 91% of the group initially treated with ALA reported an improvement in their condition compared to only 36% of the control group. After the control group was treated with ALA, 72% reported an improvement. This study suggests that ALA may be a potential treatment for patients and supports that full double blind randomized studies should be performed.|$|E

Objective: To determine whether repetitive tasks performed for long hours by computer operators can lead to peripheral neuropathy as measured by <b>nerve</b> <b>conduction</b> studies of upper extremities. Material And METHODS: We performed <b>nerve</b> <b>conduction</b> tests on 50 computer operators in two study groups.

Conclusions: The results of <b>nerve</b> <b>conduction</b> studies showed that early subclinical distal axonal involvement was present in BD patients. Sensoriel nerves were predominantly involved.
