40|$|This paper {{provides}} a choice theoretic, general equilibrium {{account of the}} balance of <b>payments</b> <b>adjustment</b> process and the determination of national price levels in a world comprised of countries populated by rational households. Balance of <b>payments</b> <b>adjustment</b> dynamics arise in the equilibrium of this model from the precautionary saving behavior of risk-averse households who self-insure against random productivity fluctuations by accumulating, via balance of payments surpluses in productive periods, buffer stocks of domestic money which can be drawn down to finance payments deficits, and thus a less variable profile of consumption relative to output, when productivity is unexpectedly low. Precautionary saving is shown to exhibit the partial-adjustment-to-target behavior typically postulated in the monetary approach literature. The existence of a rational expectations equilibrium in which the distribution of international reserves among central banks is stationary is established.

The analytical framework employed is an econometric methodology, which encompasses wide a range of tests for stationarity, cointegration and specification of an error correction model. Using data obtained from the Nigerian economy covering the period of 1970 to 2004, result of over-parameterized error correction model show significant causational relationships in the two models. Specifically, from the values of the coefficient of the current and past (lag) level of exchange rate in the two models, the paper knots balance of <b>payments</b> <b>adjustment</b> to regime of exchange rate stability in Nigeria.

Hume, likewise the whole generation of classical political economists coming after him, failed to see the impact of then strong British economy on economic variables {{of the rest of the}} world and in effect he developed a model for a small economy. Although the authorship of the quantitative monetary equation is ascribed to him, Hume did not represent pure monetarism, i. e. neutrality of money. He was well aware of the transition period, during which a change in money stock affect the real economics variables. For this reason it is necessary to abandon the constant real product model. Variability of the real product in the presented models makes it possible to create different stable levels of money stock and the real product in accordance with the initial conditions. The authors are of the opinion that the balance of <b>payment</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism can thus be source of instability of the real sector of the economy.

40|$|The {{relationships}} among the balance of payments and other macroeconomic variables in the Korean economy for the period 1961 - 85 are analyzed in this study. Theoretical studies {{on the effects of}} government policies on the economy and the balance of payments were conducted under both the Keynesian and monetary approaches. The Keynesian approach concentrates on the commodity and capital market adjustment factors and does not focus on the money market factors, whereas the monetary approach considers the balance of <b>payments</b> <b>adjustments</b> as a symptom of money market disequilibrium alone. The basic assumptions of those two approaches, taken seperately, are not fully relevant to the Korean economy, which has unemployed resources, a high proportion of non-traded goods to traded goods, and monetary effects of balance of payments changes. Therefore, a model combining monetary and real factors to explain the short-run behavior of Korea 2 ̆ 7 s balance of payments in a single framework is developed. The empirical results of the combined model show that its explanatory power is much higher than either of the two models taken separately.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} effect of {{graduate}} medical education sponsorship on hospital operating costs over a seven-year period, to test for a longitudinal association between teaching intensity and cost, and to determine whether the indirect medical education (IME) <b>payment</b> <b>adjustments</b> made under Medicare's Prospective Payment System are appropriate. DATA SOURCES: Medicare cost and payment data from the Hospital Cost Report Information System and other related HCFA files, from FFY 1989 through 1995. The study population consists of all short-stay hospitals (approximately 5, 000) participating in Medicare and receiving case payments by diagnosis-related groups. STUDY DESIGN: The original cost functions used to develop indirect medical education <b>payment</b> <b>adjustments</b> under PPS are re-estimated with panel data. Specification changes are included based on findings from critiques of the original hospital cost model. Additional variations on the model are explored to test for differences by hospital status, to control for {{the effect of}} additional disproportionate share and outlier payments, and to isolate the effects of improved case-mix measurement on model results. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fixed effects regression produces no evidence of a significant within-hospital association between increased sponsorship of medical residents and increased cost per case. In models designed to capture a cross-sectional association, operating costs are positively related to teaching activity, but the association shows a decline in strength over time. In all years, the strength of the association is significantly greater among hospitals eligible for disproportionate share adjustments and among major teaching hospitals. Controlling for secular trends of increased teaching intensity results in a pattern of declining cross-sectional teaching coefficients that supports a theory that observed teaching effects are the result of unmeasured case severity. CONCLUSIONS: A significant but declining cost differential is observed between teaching and nonteaching hospitals. The association appears to be related to hospital and patient characteristics that cannot be controlled using currently available case-mix and wage indices. Longitudinal models do not provide evidence to support a <b>payment</b> <b>adjustment</b> formula that allows individual hospitals to recompute their IME adjustment rates as their teaching ratios rise or fall from year to year. Cross-sectional findings suggest that re-estimations of the teaching effect may be appropriate when significant improvements occur in Medicare case-mix measurement...|$|R

40|$|This paper, {{written as}} a chapter for a Handbook of International Economics, reviews {{developments}} {{in the theory of}} international monetary economics from the late 1960 's through the early 1980 's. Following a review of the operation of the monetary mechanism of balance of <b>payments</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{in the context of the}} Mundell-Fleming model, the paper reviews the more modern analysis of the dynamics of balance of <b>payments</b> <b>adjustment</b> under fixed exchange rates and of exchange rate determination under flexible exchange rates. Beginning with a simple exposition of the monetary mechanism, the model is then extended to incorporate sluggish wage and output adjustments, endogenous monetary policy and sterilization operations, multiplicity of tradable and nontradable goods, large countries, capital mobility and portfolio balance. The review then turns to an exposition of exchange rate theory, starting with the monetary approach to exchange rate determination. Issues discussed in this context include purchasing power parities, nontraded goods, the real exchange rate, currency substitution and the interaction between real and monetary factors in effecting exchange rates. The paper proceeds with a presentation of a more general framework that views the question of exchange rate determination as part of the general theory of the determination of asset prices, and which highlights the unique role of expectations. The general framework is then applied to characterize the interaction between the balance of payments and the equilibrium real exchange rate. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of some empirical issues of exchange rate analysis. ...|$|R
