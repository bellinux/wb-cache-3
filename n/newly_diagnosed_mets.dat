40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the impact of <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> atrial fibrillation (AF) on future major adverse cardiac events (MACE). AF {{is the most common}} form of cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with several other cardiovascular (CV) events. Little is known about whether <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> AF is an independent factor for future MACE, especially in patients without such a history. We evaluated data from the National Health Insurance Research Database, which represented a retrospective cohort of 713, 288 adults in Taiwan from 2006 to 2010. Individuals with previous MACE were excluded. <b>Newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> AF patients were identified by assigning International Classification of Diseases codes. Propensity score matching adjusted for gender, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Cox proportional hazard models estimated future MACE ratios. We compared a total of 3, 737 patients with <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> AF and 704, 225 patients without. After matching, there was no difference in baseline demographic characteristics in patients across <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> AF and non-AF groups. The result showed that <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> AF in multivariate analysis were associated with increased incidents of MACE (hazard ratio: 3. 11 - 3. 51 in different models) and mortality. <b>Newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> AF without other CV risk factors had 8. 45 times the risk of developing future MACE than healthy adults.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To monitor HIV- 1 {{transmitted}} {{drug resistance}} (TDR) in a well defined urban area with large access to antiretroviral therapy {{and to assess}} the potential source of infection of <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> HIV individuals. METHODS: All individuals resident in Geneva, Switzerland, with a <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> HIV infection between 2000 and 2008 were screened for HIV resistance. An infection was considered as recent when the positive test followed a negative screening test within less than 1 year. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by using the maximum likelihood method on pol sequences including 1058 individuals with chronic infection living in Geneva. RESULTS: Of 637 individuals with <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> HIV infection, 20 % had a recent infection. Mutations associated with resistance {{to at least one}} drug class were detected in 8. 5 % [nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 6. 3 %; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 3. 5 %; protease inhibitors, 1. 9 %]. TDR (P-trend = 0. 015) and, in particular, NNRTI resistance (P = 0. 002) increased from 2000 to 2008. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 34. 9 % of <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> individuals, and 52. 7 % of those with recent infection were linked to transmission clusters. Clusters were more frequent in individuals with TDR than in those with sensitive strains (59. 3 vs. 32. 6 %, respectively; P < 0. 0001). Moreover, 84 % of <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> individuals with TDR were part of clusters composed of only <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> individuals. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of the HIV transmission networks using phylogenetic analysis shows that <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> HIV infections are a significant source of onward transmission, particularly of resistant strains, thus suggesting an important self-fueling mechanism for TDR...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the occurrence of subclinical atherosclerosis, evaluated by carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) in subjects with <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> type 2 diabetes. Methods: A total of 167 subjects, 50 <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> type 2 diabetic subjects and 117 non-diabetic subjects were included in the study. Obese and overweight <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> type 2 diabetic patients were matched for age and BMI with obese and overweight non-diabetic subjects. Only postmenopausal women were selected. The following biomarkers were analyzed: fasting glucose, HbA 1 c, fasting insulin, fasting proinsulin, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin, leptin, hs-CRP, urine albumin/creatinine ratio. 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was performed in all subjects. Ultrasound imaging was used to evaluate IMT of the common carotid artery. Results: CIMT was greater in <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> type 2 patients compared to non-diabetic subjects. When analyzed by BMI, the difference regarding CIMT between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects was significant only in overweight subjects, in both sexes. In univariate analysis in men with <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> type 2 diabetes, CIMT was positively correlated with age, SBP, triglycerides, leptin and negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol and in women CIMT was positively correlated with SBP and leptin. Independent determinants of CIMT in patients with <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> type 2 diabetes were in men age (β = 0. 556, p = 0. 0028) and log leptin (β = 0. 393, p = 0. 049) and in women systolic blood pressure (β = 0. 48, p = 0. 026).

We aimed to analyze retention on the first AED for 2 years in <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> cryptogenic partial epilepsy patients in clinical practice and whether the presence of epileptiform discharges on the initial EEG was a predictor {{of the failure of}} retention on the first AED. MethodsFor the purpose of this study, we retrospectively reviewed epilepsy database. On the Epilepsy Database, we found 495 <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> epilepsy patients who had been followed up for at least 2 years. Of these 495 <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> epilepsy patients, 172 patients had cryptogenic partial epilepsy. The outcome of this study was the retention rate for the first AED for 2 years. In addition, we analyzed the retention on first AED according to {{the presence or absence of}} epileptiform discharges on the initial EEG using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. ResultsOverall, retention rate on the first AED for 2 years was 51 %. The main lesion of retention failure was a lack of tolerance. The presence of epileptiform discharges on the initial EEGs was significantly related to the failure of retention on the first AED (p= 0. 003). ConclusionsIn <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> cryptogenic partial epilepsy, overall retention on the first AED was not significantly different from that in <b>newly</b> <b>diagnosed</b> partial epilepsy.
