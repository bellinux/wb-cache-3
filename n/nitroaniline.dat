25|$|The {{synthesis}} of NanoPutian’s lower body begins with <b>nitroaniline</b> {{as a starting}} material. Addition of Br2 in acetic acid places two equivalents of bromine on the benzene ring. NH2 is an electron donating group, and NO2 is an electron withdrawing group, which both direct bromination to the meta position relative to the NO2 substituent. Addition of NaNO2, H2SO4, and EtOH removes the NH2 substituent. The Lewis acid SnCl2, a reducing agent in THF/EtOH solvent, replaces NO2 with NH2, which is subsequently replaced by iodine upon the addition of NaNO2, H2SO4, and KI to yield 3,5-dibromoiodobenzene. In this step, the Sandmeyer reaction converts the primary amino group (NH2) to a diazonium leaving group (N2), which is subsequently replaced by iodine. Iodine serves as an excellent coupling partner for the attachment of the stomach, which is executed through Sonogashira coupling with trimethylsilylacetylene to yield 3,5-dibromo(trimethylsilylethynyl)benzene. Attachment of the legs replaces the Br substituents with 1-pentyne through another Sonogashira coupling to produce 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-(trimethylsilylethynyl) benzene.
