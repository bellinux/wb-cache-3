Today the growth of cities tends to be implemented through the transformation of existing buildings, aimed at raising the quality level or transfer new quality to buildings through the integration of new features and new benefits, especially those of energy, in a historical moment in which the challenge is lowering {{the impact of}} human actions on <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> In this context, various European interventions of building transformation and volumetric additions are intended to integrate new features or facilities or to build new housing units in order to provide an economic incentive for upgrading the overall building performance.

40|$|Atmospheric ammonia (NH 3) {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to soil acidification and eutrophication of <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystem</b> leading to e. g. reduced biodiversity (Erisman et al. 2007, Environmental Pollution, Stevens et al. 2004, Science, Sutton et al. 2009, Biogeoscience). In order to assess these impacts, quantifying the magnitude of the NH 3 flux in the biosphere atmosphere system is essential. Model simulations using the Danish Ammonia Modelling System (DAMOS) have recently indicated that particular forest ecosystems are exposed to critical load exceedances of N (Geels et al., not yet submitted). However, there are relatively few datasets of atmospheric NH 3 fluxes available for forests which can contribute verifying model results. The atmospheric dry deposition of NH 3 for the beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest, Lille Bøgeskov, in Sorø, Denmark, is investigated using the high resolution micrometeorological measuring technique, Relaxed Eddy Accumulation (REA), for 26 October – 11 November 2010. Measurements of atmospheric NH 3 concentrations and fluxes are compared to local-scale model simulations using the Danish Ammonia Modelling System (DAMOS). It was found that long-term measured and modelled atmospheric mean concentrations of NH 3 agreed well within the range of 0. 56 - 0. 68 g NH 3 -N m- 3, however, observed emission fluxes of up to app. 0. 8 g NH 3 -N m- 2 s- 1 after leaf fall were not represented by DAMOS because the model system does not consider vegetative and soil NH 3 emissions from non-agricultural areas (Skjøth et al. 2011, ACPD). New atmospheric NH 3 flux measurements for Lille Bøgeskov have been conducted throughout 2011 and these data are presented and discussed in relation to the 2010 data of atmospheric NH 3. Future studies aim to improve the description of dry deposition of NH 3 for vegetative surfaces in local-scale models whereby the NH 3 vegetative emission and its contribution to the atmospheric NH 3 concentration and flux is considered...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the method of}} identifying the most vulnerable territories under exogenous processes caused by aridification/humidification. It {{is based on the}} assumption that some forms and types of relief increase resistance of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> to external influences, while other kinds of relief make them vulnerable. The relationship between landscape and moistening (ground and climatic) is of great importance to plains which have groundwater close to the surface. We have used morphometric analysis to divide the territory into hydromorphic and automorphic landscapes. Hydromorphic territories are those that are affected by additional surface moistening and groundwater, while automorphic landscapes are less dependent on groundwater under normal atmospheric moisture. The territory is ranked according to the degree of vulnerability by expert evaluation method. The developed approach is based entirely on using GIS software (ArcGIS 10. 2. 1) and processing the DEM SRTM. As a result, two models of vulnerability of <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> to exogenic processes on Baraba Plain (Western Siberia) have been created for both aridification and humidification cases. The opportunity to estimate the vulnerability is the novel feature for these models of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> in both regional and local scales.

Based on a simple linear extension of past trends, the anticipated next doubling of global food production would be associated with approximately 3 -fold increases in nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization rates, a doubling of the irrigated land area, and an 18 % increase in cropland. These projected changes would have dramatic impacts on the diversity, composition, and functioning of the remaining natural ecosystems of the world, and on their ability to provide society with a variety of essential ecosystem services. The largest impacts would be on freshwater and marine ecosystems, which would be greatly eutrophied by high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus release from agricultural fields. Aquatic nutrient eutrophication can lead to loss of biodiversity, outbreaks of nuisance species, shifts in the structure of food chains, and impairment of fisheries. Because of aerial redistribution of various forms of nitrogen, agricultural intensification also would eutrophy many <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and contribute to atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases.

The effects, both in magnitude and direction, of UV-B radiation on trace-gas emissions and mineral nutrient cycling are species specific and operate on a number of processes. These processes include changes in the chemical composition in living plant tissue, photodegradation (breakdown by light) of dead plant matter, including litter, release of carbon monoxide from vegetation previously charred by fire, changes in the communities of microbial decomposers, and effects on nitrogen-fixing microorganisms and plants. Long-term experiments are in place to examine UV-B effects on carbon capture and storage in biomass within <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Studies in <b>natural</b> aquatic ecosystems have indicated that organic matter is the primary regulator of UV-B penetration.

Increased UV-B has positive and negative impacts on microbial activity in aquatic ecosystems that can affect carbon and mineral nutrient cycling as well as the uptake and release of greenhouse and chemically reactive gases.

In this context, we introduce the concepts of potentiality of a territory using Potential Natural Vegetation mapping for conservation prioritization. A Gap analysis of Natura 2000 network in Itay was performed to evaluate the representativeness of the Potential Natural Vegetation types. In this context, the PNV map, reflecting the diversity and spatial arrangement of the <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> can be considered as an appropriate proxy of environmental and biogeographical diversity of Italy.

We used NOTG, a new 3 D, process-based, and individual-based model specifically developed to study the importance of the spatial structure on the carbon and water cycles of complex ecosystems. It incorporates processes involved in the energy, carbon, and water cycles at the tree (radiation interception, photosynthesis, phenology, allocation, senescence, transpiration), and soil (soil moisture, soil organic matter decomposition) levels. It is designed to handle various plant phenological types (deciduous, non opportunistic evergreen, and opportunistic evergreen), and a comprehensive description of plant C pools. The model is designed to study water and carbon fluxes at the stand scale over one to a few years. In this study, NOTG was parameterized for the Font-Blanche forest and two five-year simulations were made using either the full 3 D representation, or a simplified 1 D representation. Comparison of model outputs against observations at the tree, soil, and ecosystem scales, showed a much better accuracy when using the 3 D representation. This illustrates the dependence of plant and ecosystem function to the above- and below-ground spatial structures, and the usefulness of such detailed models when dealing with structurally complex ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Alternative {{policies}} to address {{global climate change}} are being debated in many nations and within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To help provide objective and comprehensive analyses {{in support of this}} process, we have developed a model of the global climate system consisting of coupled sub-models of economic growth and associated emissions, natural fluxes, atmospheric chemistry, climate, and <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> The framework of this Integrated Global System Model is described and the results of sample runs and a sensitivity analysis are presented. This multi-component model addresses most of the major anthropogenic and natural processes involved in climate change and also is computationally efficient. As such, it can be used effectively to study parametric and structural uncertainty and to analyze the costs and impacts of many policy alternatives. Initial runs of the model have helped to define and quantify a number of feedbacks among the sub-models, and to elucidate the geographical variations in several variables that are relevant to climate science and policy. The effect of changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels on the uptake of carbon and emissions of methane and nitrous oxide by land ecosystems is one potentially important feedback which has been identified. The sensitivity analysis has enabled preliminary assessment of the effects of uncertainty in the economic, atmospheric chemistry, and climate sub-models as they influence critical model results such as predictions of temperature, sea level, rainfall, and ecosystem productivity. We conclude that uncertainty regarding economic growth, technological change, deep oceanic circulation, aerosol radiative forcing, and cloud processes are important influences on these outputs. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} concentration {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{is of a great}} interest for scientists since the largest contribution to Earth total radiative forcing is caused by the increase in the {{atmospheric concentration}} of CO 2 since 1750 (IPCC 2013). Indeed, from 1750 to 2011, anthropogenic CO 2 emissions have released 555 gigatons of carbon (GtC) that accumulated within different ecosystems and mainly in the atmosphere (240 GtC), 160 GtC have accumulated in <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and 155 GtC have been taken up by the ocean (IPCC 2013). Two processes lead to the transfer of CO 2 from the atmosphere to the ocean: the physical and the biological carbon pumps (Fig. I. 1). First, the physical carbon pump is initialized by the surface ocean, which constantly exchanges gases and heat with the low atmosphere. The solubility of CO 2 in seawater increases when temperatures decrease. Thus, in the high latitudes, low temperatures, strong winds, and waves favour the transfer of CO 2 into the ocean. Then, CO 2 is exported beneath the ocean surface via the sinking of the cold CO 2 -rich waters. This physical removal of CO 2 is also called the “solubility pump”. When these cold waters return to the surface ocean and warm up again, they release CO 2 to the atmosphere. Secondly, the organic biological carbon pump is initialized in the surface ocean by phytoplankton, which assimilates carbon (C) via photosynthesis, converting CO 2 and water in organic matter and oxygen (Fig. I. 1). This process removes aqueous CO 2 from the euphotic layer, where light penetrates sea surface, and leads to the storage of around 20...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{denitrification}} {{is considered}} the most un-constrained process in the global N cycle due to uncertain in situ N 2 flux measurements, particularly in <b>natural</b> and semi-natural <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> 15 N tracer approaches can provide in situ measurements of both N 2 and N 2 O simultaneously, but their use has been limited to fertilized agro-ecosystems due {{to the need for}} large 15 N additions in order to detect 15 N 2 production against the high atmospheric N 2. For 15 N–N 2 analyses, we have used an “in-house” laboratory designed and manufactured N 2 preparation instrument which can be interfaced to any commercial continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS). The N 2 prep unit has gas purification steps and a copper-based reduction furnace, and allows the analysis of small gas injection volumes (4  µL) for 15 N–N 2 analysis. For the analysis of N 2 O, an automated Tracegas Preconcentrator (Isoprime Ltd) coupled to an IRMS was used to measure the 15 N–N 2 O (4  mL gas injection volume). Consequently, the coefficient of variation for the determination of isotope ratios for N 2 in air and in standard N 2 O (0. 5  ppm) was better than 0. 5  %. The 15 N gas-flux method was adapted for application in natural and semi-natural land use types (peatlands, forests, and grasslands) by lowering the 15 N tracer application rate to 0. 04 – 0. 5  kg  15 N ha − 1. The minimum detectable flux rates were 4  µg N m − 2  h − 1 and 0. 2  ng N m − 2  h − 1 for the N 2 and N 2 O fluxes respectively. Total denitrification rates measured by the acetylene inhibition technique in the same land use types correlated (r [*]=[*]  0. 58) with the denitrification rates measured under the 15 N gas-flux method, but were underestimated by a factor of 4, and this was partially attributed to the incomplete inhibition of N 2 O reduction to N 2, under a relatively high soil moisture content, and/or the catalytic NO decomposition in the presence of acetylene. Even though relatively robust for in situ denitrification measurements, methodological uncertainties still exist in the estimation of N 2 and N 2 O fluxes with the 15 N gas-flux method due to issues related to non-homogenous distribution of the added tracer and subsoil gas diffusion using open-bottom chambers, particularly during longer incubation duration. Despite these uncertainties, the 15 N gas-flux method constitutes a more reliable field technique for large-scale quantification of N 2 and N 2 O fluxes in <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> thus significantly improving our ability to constrain ecosystem N budgets...|$|R

The first (CLE) scenario reflects implementation of current air quality legislation around the world, while the second (MFR) represents a more optimistic case in which all currently feasible technologies are applied to achieve maximum emission reductions. We contrast these scenarios with the more pessimistic IPCC SRES A 2 scenario. Ensemble simulations for the year 2000 are consistent among models and show a reasonable agreement with surface ozone, wet deposition, and NO 2 satellite observations. Large {{parts of the world}} are currently exposed to high ozone concentrations and high deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems. By 2030, global surface ozone is calculated to increase globally by 1. 5 +/- 1. 2 ppb (CLE) and 4. 3 +/- 2. 2 ppb (A 2), using the ensemble mean model results and associated +/- 1 sigma standard deviations. Only the progressive MFR scenario will reduce ozone, by - 2. 3 +/- 1. 1 ppb. Climate change is expected to modify surface ozone by - 0. 8 +/- 0. 6 ppb, with larger decreases over sea than over land. Radiative forcing by ozone increases by 63 +/- 15 and 155 +/- 37 mW m(- 2) for CLE and A 2, respectively, and decreases by - 45 +/- 15 mW m(- 2) for MFR.

To determine the effectiveness of policies aimed at the reduction of emission of ammonia, nitrous and nitrogen oxide, nitrate leaching and nitrogen runoff, {{it is essential to}} have information on the fate of nitrogen in both agricultural and non-agricultural soils on a regional and national scale and its inherent uncertainties. In this paper, the authors quantified the uncertainties in the emission, uptake, accumulation, denitrification, leaching and runoff of nitrogen at a national scale and for specific land use–soil type combinations. Furthermore, they identified which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty in the emission of ammonia to the atmosphere and the leaching / runoff to groundwater and surface water. To gain quantitative insight into the propagation of the uncertainty, a model was developed representing all crucial processes in the nitrogen chain by simple process descriptions. Uncertainties were quantified for the Netherlands as a whole, including terrestrial systems, both agricultural and non-agricultural land, and aquatic systems Enhanced levels of nitrogen in the environment may have several adverse effects, including decreased plant species diversity in (semi) <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> eutrophication of surface waters, pollution of ground-water due to nitrate leaching and global warming due to nitrous and nitrogen oxide (N 2 O and NOx) emissions. To determine the effectiveness of policies aimed at the reduction of emission of ammonia (NH 3), N 2 O and NOx, nitrate (NO 3) leaching and nitrogen (N) runoff, it is essential to have information on the fate of nitrogen in both agricultural and non-agricultural soils on a regional and national scale and its inherent uncertainties. In this paper, we quantified the uncertainties in the emission, uptake, accumulation, denitrification, leaching and runoff of nitrogen at a national scale and for specific land use-soil type combinations. Furthermore, we identified which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty in the emission of ammonia to the atmosphere and the leaching/runoff to groundwater and surface water. To gain quantitative insight into the propagation of the uncertainty, a model was developed representing all crucial processes in the N chain by simple process descriptions. Uncertainties were quantified for the Netherlands as a whole, including terrestrial systems, both agricultural and non-agricultural land, and aquatic systems. For agricultural and non-agricultural land, plots were distinguished, consisting of a multiple of 500 3 500 m and of 250 3 250 m grid cells, respectively, with unique combinations of soil use, soil type and groundwater table class that were derived from existing digital maps. Model parameters were assigned by using relationships with soil type, groundwater level class and land use. The uncertainty was quantified by means of a Monte Carlo analysis, whereas statistical approaches were used to identify which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty of the fate of nitrogen. The 90 % confidence interval for the fluxes of N compounds to air, groundwater and surface water (in Gg N. yr(- 1)) ranged between 102 and 194 for ammonia emission, between 18 and 51 for N 2 O emissions, between 32 and 108 for NO 3 inflow to groundwater and between 2 and 38 for N inflow to surface water. The uncertainty in NH 3 emission was mainly caused by the uncertainty in the NH 3 emission fractions for animal manure, whereas the uncertainty in N 2 O emission was mainly due to the uncertainty in the fractions relating total nitrification and denitrification to N 2 O emissions. The uncertainty in inflow to groundwater and runoff to surface water was mainly caused by the uncertainty in denitrification in the soil and in upper groundwater and in non-agricultural soils also by the N accumulation in the soil. In view of the need to monitor and evaluate the impact of N reduction policies and measures, it is essential to put more effort in activities yielding a reduction of these large uncertainties, such as additional data gathering and process research under field circumstances...|$|R

Next we compare these research output magnitudes for case-studies in cropland and ASNNT ecosystems with estimates of the total economic value (TEV) of either system. For applications 1) and 3) the magnitude of research output for ASNNT ecosystems between 1991 - 2005 is greater than for cropland and research into the former is increasing {{at a faster rate}} over time compared to the latter. Given that the TEV of ASNNT ecosystems is 82 times greater than the TEV of cropland we deem these trends in research output as desirable under the assumption that value and research should be interdependent. However for application 2), although research into ASNNT ecosystems is increasing at a faster rate compared to cropland, total research output between 1991 - 2005 is greater for cropland. We conclude that increased research output which focuses on ASNNT ecosystems in this particular application should be a priority, given the high TEV of ASNNT ecosystems relative to cropland. ...|$|R

The major objectives were to delineate areas potentially affected by depostition of nitrogen and sulphur compounds, to estimate the severity of acidification and eutrophication problems, and to identify research and data gaps. The results indicate that the critical loads for acidification and eutrophication are exceeded in 6 - 15 % and 7 - 18 % of the global area of natural and semi-natural ecosystems, respectively. Currently, most serious risks are found in the heavily industrialised regions of eastern USA, Europe and the Former Soviet Union, but risks were also found for parts of South America, large parts of ASIA and parts of Western, Eastern and Southern Africa. Scenario analysis shows that both acidification and eutrophication risks could significantly increase in the second group of regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{prospect}} of human-induced global warning has received centerstage attention from ecologists concerned about future ecosystems. While such ef-fects deserve critical analysis, they are best {{understood in the}} context of natu-ral climate change. Anthropogenic atmospheric effects are often discussed as if background climates were stable (Mahlman 1997).

40|$|We {{performed}} a gap analysis of protected area networks in Italy {{to assess the}} representativeness of potential natural vegetation (PNV) types of the European Natura 2000 network compared with the National Protected Area network. In this context, the PNV map, reflecting the diversity and spatial arrangement of the <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> {{can be considered as}} an appropriate proxy of environmental and biogeographical diversity of Italy. In this country, 775 protected areas are registered in the Official List of Protected Areas (OLPA), 2281 sites are listed as Sites of Community Interest and 590 as Special Protection Areas, constituting the Natura 2000 network. The adopted conservation target considered that any PNV type included for less than the 10 % in the PAs network (OLPA, Natura 2000) was defined as a gap in the system. In particular we defined four categories of PNV protection: any PNV types with a representation of less than 10 % in both the OLPA and N 2000 was defined as a “total gap” (i. e., under-protected); any PNV type with a representation of less than 10 % in either the OLPA or the N 2000 was defined as a “partial gap”; any PNV type with a representation of between 10 and 50 % in both the OLPA and N 2000 was defined as “protected”; lastly, any PNV type with a representation of more than 50 % in both the OLPA and N 2000 was defined as “widely-protected”. Digital overlays of PNV and PAs networks were separately {{performed a}}nd statistics produced, indicating the current state of protection of Potential Natural Vegetation types in the two networks (OLPA and Natura 2000). We found that more than 59 % of PNV types recognized on the Italian territory is not protected by the OLPA network. On the contrary, regarding Natura 2000 network, 68 % of PNV types are protected, accounting for 27 % more than OLPA. Compared to the National network of OLPA, the European network Natura 2000 is characterized by a larger percentage of territory in terms of area (18 % of the Italian territory for Natura 2000 vs 10 % of OLPA) but also by a smaller size of the sites, allowing for a more coherent distribution and efficiency in the protection of habitat remnants (68 % PNV types protected by Natura 2000 vs 41 % by OLPA). The proposed PNV approach can help guiding decisions on where and how to spend scarce conservation management resources...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that N transformations in <b>natural</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are regulated by: (1) climatological and geomorphological conditions; (2) soil physics and chemistry; and (3) {{quality and quantity}} of soil organic matter. Consequently, spatial variability of N transformations within experimental plots have been related to fine-scale heterogeneity of these regulating factors, e. g. spatial differences in micro-climate. However, it has also been argued that spatial differences in the composition of the microbial community, which can be the result of stochastic events, may be an important source of spatial heterogeneity of decomposition processes. The aim of our study was to detect to what extent net N mineralization and nitrification can vary in soil samples as a result of differences in the composition of a simple microbial community of acid forest soils. This community consisted of two species of chitin decomposers, a mycelium- forming fungus and a rod-like bacterium, and two species of nitrifying bacteria. Characterization of the chitin decomposers in liquid cultures demonstrated two important differences between the fungus and the bacterium: (1) chitin-N mineralization by the bacterium was much slower than that by the fungus, and (2) the bacterium showed an antibiotic-type of inhibition against the nitrifying bacteria whereas the fungus did not. The effect of differences in the composition of the chitinolytic community on N mineralization and nitrification was studied using environmentally controlled incubations of the microorganisms in Petri-dishes containing purified sand with solid chitin or its soluble monomer, N-acetylglucosamine, as substrate. As seen in liquid cultures, the differences in chitin-N mineralization between series of sand incubations of either the fungus or the bacterium were considerable. Surprisingly, chitin-N mineralization in sand that had been inoculated with both chitinolytic decomposers. was relatively slow. This was most likely due to mycolytic activity of the bacterium against the fungus. Variation of N mineralization within series of identical inoculation, consisting of 10 replicates, was generally low (CV 200 %), especially those in which the chitinolytic bacterium was present. This high variability of nitrification was most likely due to instability of the antibiotic compound in sand. In conclusion, the results show that spatial variability in the composition of a simple microbial community and interactions therein can be an important source of small- scale heterogeneity of N transformations. The relevance of these results for the field situation is discussed. [KEYWORDS: Nitrogen mineralization; spatial variability; heterogeneity; ph; microorganisms; ecosystems; chemistry; pasture...|$|R
40|$|Carbon (C) {{emissions}} {{resulting from}} power generation has been implicated {{as a contributor}} to global warming. To offset increases in atmospheric CO 2 we must better exploit the <b>natural</b> capacity of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> to accumulate carbon. Lands exploited for coal production may offer the potential for storage of significant amounts of C on sites that are currently disturbed and underutilized. Evidence from sites reclaimed without excessive site compaction demonstrates the great potential for forest production on post-mining lands. Under optimal conditions forest production on reclaimed mines can exceed that of unmined sites. More typically, however, mine reclamation carried out {{in accordance with the}} Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), forfeits the potential to accumulate C on surface mined lands. Mine spoil handling, placement and compaction, result in shallow soils that are low in nutrients and organic material. Forest establishment and growth are limited by the xeric, nutrient poor conditions. Societal pressure to allow recovery of Southern Appalachian forest ecosystems and to realize potential benefits of carbon storage will require greate...|$|R
