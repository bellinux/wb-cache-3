40|$|When {{subjects}} are intentionally preparing a curved trajectory, they {{are engaged in}} a time-consuming trajectory planning process that is separate from target selection. To investigate the construction of such a plan, we examined the effect of artificially shortening <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> on the performance of intentionally curved trajectories using the Timed Response task that enforces initiation of movements prematurely. Fifteen subjects performed obstacle avoidance movements toward one of four targets that were presented 25 or 350 ms before the “go” signal, imposing short and long <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> conditions with mean values of 170 ms and 493 ms, respectively. While trajectories with short <b>preparation</b> <b>times</b> showed target specificity at their onset, they were significantly more variable and showed larger angular deviations from the lines connecting their initial position and the target, compared to the trajectories with long <b>preparation</b> <b>times.</b> Importantly, the trajectories of the short <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> movements still reached their end-point targets accurately, with comparable movement durations. We hypothesize that success in the short <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> condition is a result of an online control mechanism that allows further refinement of the plan during its execution and study this control mechanism with a novel trajectory analysis approach using minimum jerk optimization and geometrical modeling approaches. Results show a later agreement of the short <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> trajectories with the optimal minimum jerk trajectory, accompanied by a later initiation of a parabolic segment. Both observations are consistent with the existence of an online trajectory planning process. Our results suggest that when <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> is not sufficiently long, subjects execute a more variable and less optimally prepared initial trajectory and exploit online control mechanisms to refine their actions on the fly...|$|R

Different case studies have been made depending upon the occurrence of shortages. The models have been illustrated by numerical data.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the problem {{of an increase in}} product returns for a company that produces plastic films for flexible packaging. Among the factors that have resulted in the increase of returned products are defects in the films caused by the poor manipulation of materials and, above all, the hard point in the coils caused by excessive extruder <b>preparation</b> <b>time,</b> causing the extrusion head to overheat as well as uneven extrusion. Extrusion is a key process in the production of plastic materials as it transforms polypropylene and additives into plastic sheets. The delay in the <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> caused by machine operators leads to the overheating of the extrusion head and, therefore, defective products that are ultimately returned to the company by customers.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Background: A {{full time}} {{child-care}} program {{is expected to}} provide at least one-half to two-thirds of a child's daily nutrient requirements. As such, child-care settings have been acknowledged as an important setting for the assurance of children's nutrition and {{for the prevention of}} childhood obesity. It has been suggested that an increase in the use of in-house food preparation in child-care settings could improve the nutrient profile of menus and decrease food costs. However, a limited number of studies have examined the effect of meal <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> on nutritional quality and food expenditure in the general population, and no studies have assessed this relationship in child-care settings. Objective: To investigate the association between meal <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> and food expenditure and nutritional quality of menus in family child-care homes. Methods: Fifty-nine family child-care providers participated in this study. Participants recorded time spent in meal preparation and menus served over a period of five consecutive days of operation, and collected receipts for food items purchased. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of breakfast and lunch <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> with each - food expenditure, and nutritional quality of the menu adjusting for covariates. Nutritional quality of the menu was quantified using mean adequacy ratio (MAR), sodium Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) ratio, percent calories from sugar, and percent calories from trans fat. Results: There was no observed relationship between breakfast <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> and food expenditure (p = 0. 499), although there was an inverse trend between lunch <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> and lunch food expenditure (p = 0. 110). There was no statistically significant relationship between breakfast or lunch <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> and indicators of nutritional quality of the menus. There was a direct trend between breakfast <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> and percent of calories from trans fat (p = 0. 073) and a direct trend between lunch <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> and MAR (p = 0. 073). Conclusion: In this sample, there is insufficient evidence to posit that there is a relationship between time spent in food preparation and food expenditure or measures of the nutritional quality of menus. Future research is needed to understand the role of time spent in food preparation in determining food expenditure and nutritional quality of the menus served at family child-care homes...|$|R

40|$|When sensory {{feedback}} is perturbed, accurate movement is restored {{by a combination}} of implicit processes and deliberate re-aiming to strategically compensate for errors. Here, we directly compare two methods used previously to dissociate implicit from explicit learning on a trial-by-trial basis: 1) asking participants to report the direction that they aim their movements, and contrasting this with the directions of the target and the movement that they actually produce, 2) manipulating movement <b>preparation</b> <b>time.</b> By instructing participants to re-aim without a sensory perturbation, we show that re-aiming is possible even with the shortest possible <b>preparation</b> <b>times,</b> particularly when targets are narrowly distributed. Nonetheless, re-aiming is effortful and comes at the cost of increased variability, so we tested whether constraining <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> is sufficient to suppress strategic re-aiming during adaptation to visuomotor rotation with a broad target distribution. The rate and extent of error reduction under <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> constraints were similar to estimates of implicit learning obtained from self-report without time pressure, suggesting that participants chose not to apply a re-aiming strategy to correct visual errors under time pressure. Surprisingly, participants who reported aiming directions showed less implicit learning according to an alternative measure, obtained during trials performed without visual feedback. This suggests that the process of reporting can affect the extent or persistence of implicit learning. The data extend existing evidence that restricting <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> can suppress explicit re-aiming, and provide an estimate of implicit visuomotor rotation learning that does not require participants to report their aiming directions...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: In {{the initial}} {{preparation}} stage, before feeding worms with organic wastes, the wastes are pre-composted for some time. This was done {{so that the}} thermophilic phase of organic wastes degradation is passed, no harm is done to the worms which are sensitive to high temperatures, production of fertilizer faster is quicker, and biological contamination is reduced. The length of this <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> is important {{with regard to the}} quality of the compost obtained, the vermicomposting process, and space and facilities needed. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> of food wastes on the vermicomposting process without any preliminary action or continuous aeration. Materials and Methods: The Eisenia Foetida species was used for vermicomposting. Food waste <b>preparation</b> <b>times</b> of 0, 6, 12 and 18 days were attempted, and factors such as pH, C%, N%, C/N ratio, and the process rate were monitored during the process. Results: The lowest and highest final C/N ratios were seen on days 6 and 18 of preparation, respectively. The data also showed that the highest reduction (64. 93) in this ratio was observed on 6 day and the lowest (36. 56) on day 18. Conclusion: On the basis of these findings it can be concluded that there is a significant difference among various food waste <b>preparation</b> <b>times</b> with regard to C/N ratio (p-value< 0. 05), the <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> is effective on the C/N ratio, and the most appropriate length of <b>time</b> for <b>preparation</b> is 6 - 12 days...|$|R
