5000|$|The {{main idea}} of 'coincidence detection' in signal {{processing}} {{is that if}} a detector detects a signal pulse in the midst of random noise pulses inherent in the detector, there is a certain probability, , that the detected pulse is actually a <b>noise</b> <b>pulse.</b> But if two detectors detect the signal pulse simultaneously, the probability that it is a <b>noise</b> <b>pulse</b> in the detectors is [...] Suppose [...] Then [...] Thus the chance of a false detection is reduced by the use of coincidence detection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It {{is shown}} in this paper that the optimum {{position}} of interleaved repeaters for minimum delay and noise is not the midpoint as commonly practiced. A closed-form solution for the optimum position has been derived in this paper and verified by simulation. Bidirectional buses with the optimum interleaved repeater position are compared to commonly used bidirectional buses and shown to provide an improvement greater than 50 % in the propagation delay and bit-rate per unit area. The area of the induced <b>noise</b> <b>pulse</b> on victim lines is shown to be zero indicating that the aggressor lines are virtually static with the optimum repeater position. The presented optimum repeater positioning also provides lower <b>noise</b> <b>pulse</b> amplitude as well as lower sensitivity of propagation delay and <b>noise</b> <b>pulse</b> peak to segment length variation, compared to commonly used midway repeater positioning.

40|$|One of {{the ways}} in which {{statistical}} dependence is manifested between frequency and amplitude deviations produced by a white noise perturbing an FM wave, is examined: it is shown that the <b>noise</b> <b>pulses</b> present on instantaneous frequency have a correspondence, probability near 1, with analogous negative pulses on the amplitude deviation. A detailed study on this fact is reported. An amplitude-phase correlation FM demodulator is proposed which, exploiting the above phenomenon, largely eliminates the effect of <b>noise</b> <b>pulses</b> on output, though giving rise to some non-linear distortion of the demodulated signal.

40|$|Several {{kinds of}} photomultipliers {{are widely used}} in astroparticle physics {{detectors}} to measure Cherenkov light in media like water or ice. In neutrino telescopes the key element of the detector is the optical module, which consists {{of one or more}} photodetectors inside a transparent pressure-resistant glass sphere.

The KM 3 NeT collaboration has developed an innovative design of an optical module composed by 31 photomultipliers (PMTs) of 3 -inch diameter housed in a 17 -inch glass shpere.

40|$|Abstract—A {{quantum theory}} for the <b>noise</b> of optical <b>pulses</b> in {{actively}} mode-locked lasers is presented. In {{the presence of}} phase modulation and/or group velocity dispersion, the linear operator that governs the time evolution of the pulse fluctuations inside the laser cavity is not Hermitian (or normal) and the eigenmodes of this operator are not orthogonal. As a result, the eigenmodes have excess noise and the noise in different eigenmodes is highly correlated. We construct quantum operators for the pulse photon number, phase, timing, and frequency fluctuations. The nonorthogonality of the eigenmodes results in excess <b>noise</b> in the <b>pulse</b> photon number, phase, timing, and frequency. The excess noise depends on the frequency chirp of the pulse and is present only at low frequencies in the spectral densities of the <b>pulse</b> <b>noise</b> operators.

The measurements have been taken in an urban environment in the frequency band corresponding to channel 69 for DVB-T and the lower channel in the UMTS band. To analyse the impulsive noise it has been modelled as a pulse train where the pulse amplitude, pulse duration and elapsed time between pulses are considered random variables.

The key differences between static noise and static timing analyses, namely the injection of noise, accurate noise window propagation and register sensitive window computation are the contributions of this work. We demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} approach in two industrial designs by achieving 5 X reduction in functional noise failures over noise propagation without considering timing of the composite <b>noise</b> <b>pulse</b> envelope, and 30 X reduction in functional noise failures over net based noise failure metrics...|$|E

Masking by the noise decreased: (i) {{with an increase}} in tone pulse duration; (ii) with a shortening of the <b>noise</b> <b>pulse</b> duration; and (iii) as the interval between tone and noise pulses was increased f rom o to 3 50 ms. The effect of the noise was independent of whether the noise led or followed the pure tone. It is suggested that the most significant factor affecting masking was the duration of the interval between tone and noise, and that the site for the interactions between signals is central to the inner ear...|$|E
