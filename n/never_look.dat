She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, {{revealing}} the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee {{into the woods and}} <b>never</b> <b>look</b> back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.|$|E

Her records show she left school with a good mark only in needlework in primary school. After primary school, she moved along with her brother to Bucharest, where {{she worked as a}} laboratory assistant before getting a job at a textile factory. She joined the Romanian Communist Party in 1939 and met 21-year-old Nicolae Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu was instantly attracted to her which, reportedly, made him <b>never</b> <b>look</b> at another woman in a romantic manner. Their relationship was interrupted by Ceaușescu's frequent stints in prison, but they finally married on 23 December 1947.|$|E

25|$|At Pocono, Earnhardt started {{eighth and}} stayed inside the Top 10 {{most of the}} afternoon. On the last restart, he was behind Brad Keselowski. In a {{reversal}} of the events at Las Vegas, with 5 laps to go, Keselowski tried to move behind the lap down car of Danica Patrick {{to get a piece of}} trash off his grille, which caused Earnhardt to slip by and <b>never</b> <b>look</b> back en route to his first victory at Pocono and second of the season. The win marked the first time since 2004 that he had won multiple races in a season. The next week at Michigan, Earnhardt started inside the Top 5, but finished 7th, after several cars had different pit strategies. The next week at Sonoma, saw Earnhardt have his statistical best road course finish, staying in the top ten for most of the race, and finished 3rd. The following week at Kentucky, Earnhardt finished 5th.|$|E

Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic dubbed it a [...] "classic" [...] and concluded: [...] "Punk, hard rock, indie, and even metal fans owe it to themselves to hear this.

500|$|The title [...] "Disneyland {{with the}} Death Penalty" [...] {{refers to the}} subject of the article, the Southeast Asian {{city-state}} of Singapore, whose strictly guarded sterility Gibson describes with horror. After opening the article with the Disneyland metaphor, Gibson cites an observation attributed to Laurie Anderson that virtual reality [...] "would <b>never</b> <b>look</b> real until they learned how to put some dirt in it" [...] in relation to the immaculate state of the Changi Airtropolis, [...] Singapore's international airport. Beyond the airport, he notes that the natural environment has been cultivated into [...] "all-too-perfect examples of itself", such as with the abundance of golf courses. Singaporean society is a [...] "relentlessly G-rated experience", controlled by a government akin to a megacorporation, fixated on conformity and behavioural constraint and with a marked lack of humour and creativity.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the reception for Crane's poetry, The Red Badge of Courage was welcomed with acclaim after its publication by Appleton in September 1895. [...] For the next four months the book was in the top six on various bestseller lists around the country. [...] It arrived on the literary scene [...] "like a flash of lightning out of a clear winter sky", according to H. L. Mencken, who was about 15 at the time. [...] The novel also became popular in Britain; Joseph Conrad, a future friend of Crane, wrote that the novel [...] "detonated... with the impact and force of a twelve-inch shell charged with a very high explosive." [...] Appleton published two, possibly three, printings in 1895 {{and as many as}} eleven more in 1896. [...] Although some critics considered the work overly graphic and profane, it was widely heralded for its realistic portrayal of war and unique writing style. [...] The Detroit Free Press declared that The Red Badge would give readers [...] "so vivid a picture of the emotions and the horrors of the battlefield that you will pray your eyes may <b>never</b> <b>look</b> upon the reality." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{political}} mettle and ambitions for {{her husband}} were however to be more severely tested following the Liberal victory. Rosebery was, as expected, offered a position in Government by Gladstone. It had been rumoured that the position of Viceroy of Ireland or a cabinet place would be proffered, {{but it turned out}} to be the job of Under Secretary of the India Office. Rosebery immediately declined the post, giving as his reason that it would appear that he was being repaid for running Gladstone's campaign (as though the Viceregal position would not). When pressed further he cited ill health—he had been suffering from scarlet fever during the Midlothian campaign and now also appeared to be suffering a minor nervous breakdown. Political leaders urged Lady Rosebery to influence him, but she defended his decision, while stressing that his deterioration in health was only temporary. She had to be careful—if it appeared her husband had declined the offer on the grounds that it was too lowly, it would give substance to the claims being made that he was conceited and petulant. Whatever the truth, and it may be Rosebery's own explanation that he [...] "disliked hard work," [...] Lady Rosebery continued to solicit Gladstone for a job for Rosebery within the cabinet. In August 1880, when Gladstone told her firmly that [...] "There is nothing I can give him," [...] she claimed she had not been seeking a cabinet post and Gladstone had misunderstood her. At the same time she was canny enough to mention that Sir William Harcourt and Sir Charles Dilke, both radicals opposed to Gladstone's policies, were [...] "visiting them" [...] and [...] "thoughtful." [...] Lady Rosebery also began to befriend those politicians such as Lord Northbrook who empathised with her husband, while others such as Lord Granville and Lord Hartington she identified as aloof. She dismissed Lord Spencer with [...] "I can <b>never</b> <b>look</b> on him as a great motive power, besides he does not mention Archie [...] to me." [...] This was the same Lord Spencer who had advised the Prince and Princess of Wales against visiting the homes of wealthy Jews.|$|E

2500|$|When the US {{establishment}} {{celebrated the}} 20th {{anniversary of the}} fall of the Berlin Wall in November 2009, Chomsky said this commemoration ignored a forgotten human rights violation that occurred only one week after that event. On November 16, 1989, the US-armed Atlacatl Battalion in El Salvador assassinated six leading Latin American Jesuit priests, he explained. He contrasted the US' [...] "self-congratulation" [...] of the Berlin Wall destruction with the [...] "resounding silence" [...] that surrounds the assassination of these priests, contending that the US sacrifices democratic principles for its own self-interest, and without any self-criticism it tends to [...] "focus a laser light on the crimes of enemies, but crucially we make sure to <b>never</b> <b>look</b> at ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not yet {{formally}} {{nominated for}} the Vice Presidency, John Edwards took the stage at the Convention to give the first major national speech of his political career.

The theme of Edwards's address was the divide between the [...] "two Americas," [...] his populist message throughout the primary campaign and now one embraced by Kerry. He tied the division to his own roots in North Carolina, and introduced his family to the audience. Edwards addressed his parents from the podium: [...] "You taught me the values that I carry in my heart: faith, family, responsibility, opportunity for everyone. You taught me that there's dignity and honor in a hard day's work.

I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I <b>never</b> <b>look</b> at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation {{to say something about}} how people think and behave. One of the things to understand is that most historians <b>never</b> <b>look</b> at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think you would have to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Republican candidates, running {{concurrently}} {{with the}} 1964 federal election, were {{undermined by the}} unpopularity of Barry Goldwater, the Republican challenger for the US Presidency, {{and the leader of}} their political ticket. Not long before election day, Goldwater scheduled a visit to Las Vegas. Laxalt's advisors told him he should [...] "duck" [...] Goldwater as they feared any association with the Arizona Senator would spell trouble. Laxalt, who often described Goldwater as his [...] "political Godfather", reportedly told his aides, [...] "Listen, Barry Goldwater is my friend. If I snubbed him now, I could <b>never</b> <b>look</b> him in the face again. I would rather lose." [...] The Laxalt-Goldwater meeting on the tarmac was splashed on the front pages of local newspapers. (Goldwater lost Nevada by 28,000 votes.) [...] Still, the Laxalt-Cannon race remained far closer than expected. As he watched the returns come in from his home in Carson City, Laxalt was stunned when one of the television networks actually declared him the winner.

We must not repeat the {{mistakes}} of the pre-war years, by behaving as though the enemies of peace and order are armed with only good intentions." [...] Recalling the incident in a 1967 interview, he declared, [...] "I am still unrepentant about Suez. People <b>never</b> <b>look</b> at {{what would have happened if}} we had done nothing. There is a parallel with the 1930s. If you allow people to break agreements with impunity, the appetite grows to feed on such things. I don't see what other we ought to have done. One cannot dodge. It is hard to act rather than dodge." [...] In his 1967 interview (which he stipulated would not be used until after his death), Eden acknowledged secret dealings with the French and [...] "intimations" [...] of the Israeli attack. He insisted, however, that [...] "the joint enterprise and the preparations for it were justified in the light of the wrongs it [...] was designed to prevent."
