RESULTS: Highest TWA exposures (well above RELs) were found for nurses and anaesthesiologists in ORs in CH – Shtip, because of high workload in substandard conditions. TWA exposures in CH – Kochani {{were found to be}} significantly lower although in substandard conditions, mostly due to lower workload. TWA exposures found in ORs in ENT UC – Skopje is within RELs due to good work practices and proper ORs equipment.

He is believed to have delivered much of his primary material to the Venetian cartographer Grazioso Benincasa, as Benincasa went on to produce an atlas in 1468, depicting the West African coast with remarkable accuracy.|$|R

The analysis focused on item level results of each individual interview, and aggregated results across each round of interviews.

In the following discussion, the interpretive analysis of data will: (1) discuss findings related to the 12 scripted verbal probes; (2) report on common or unique themes reflecting beliefs or ideas that emerged from respondents; and (3) present key issues that were identified and compared across both the Urdu and English language surveys.|$|R

The widespread use of cloud computing has opened up new challenges by introducing different types of trust scenario. The lack of confidence in trusting information flow in cloud has become common, as users fear of losing control of their own data (like personal, financial, health). To overcome this type data lose we applying new concept to rectify it. This new concept helps to keep on tracing the real information about users and it is named as CIA (Cloud Information Accountability). The objective center of the framework approaches the logging action for the user’s data or information and also for their policies in the services. Some bars in the <b>logging</b> <b>options</b> we search for another way to get the cloud services in effective manner so we introduce the JAR (Java ARchives) capabilities in this paper. JAR helps the user or consumer to transfer the information from one place to another place. In JAR method don’t have edit option for the user’s data or information. In this paper, we mainly propose the provenance controls technique. This technique helps the user to read or write the information in the user end. Our proposed approach in the cloud service provides the efficient and effective works shown through the demonstration and experimental analysis...|$|R
