5000|$|The UIC {{introduced}} a uniform numbering system for their members {{based on a}} 12-digit number, largely known as UIC number. The third and fourth digit of the number indicated the owner, or more precisely {{the keeper of the}} vehicle. Thus each UIC member got a two-digit owner code. With the introduction of <b>national</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>registers</b> this code became a country code. Some vehicles had to be renumbered as a consequence. The Swiss company BLS Lötschbergbahn had the owner code 63. When their vehicles were registered, they got numbers with the country code 85 for Switzerland and the VKM BLS.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} and practical aspects of introducing environmental road tax for motor <b>vehicles</b> <b>registered</b> in the Czech Republic. The article analyses requirements to be met by this type of tax and reviews its functions. Further it analyses practical aspects {{in the sense of}} existence of data that is needed for accomplishing the task to find an ideal form of environmental tax. Based on these foundations, the authors identified a suitable model of taxation of motor <b>vehicles</b> <b>registered</b> in 2000 and after. Another aim was finding proper variables as regards the need of calculation of theoretical emission data in motor <b>vehicles</b> <b>registered</b> in the Czech Republic before 2000. The proposed model is expected to use emission limits as declared in technical documentation of motor <b>vehicles</b> <b>registered</b> after 2000 and theoretical limits calculated by means of variables of engine capacity and time in older motor vehicles despite the fact that these variables provide explanation for the analysed emission effect just in case of 58 % diesel engines, more precisely in case of 82 % petrol engines...|$|R
