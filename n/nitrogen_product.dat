40|$|International audienceThe {{nitrogen}} compounds in tars were investigated at temperature of 500 degrees C during the pyrolysis of three organic wastes (sewage sludge, food waste, wood) and their mixture, representatives {{of a common}} municipal waste. The analyses of both gaseous and condensed tars related the formation of up to respectively 14 and 72 {{nitrogen compounds}}, with widely forms of compounds. In gases, light nitriles (acetonitrile, propanenitrile) {{seemed to be the}} main products whereas, in condensed tars, several chemical families were represented: long chain nitriles and amides, pyrrolic and pyrrolidinic compounds and diketopiper-azines (DKPs). Moreover, several compounds, rarely previously detected, were observed, such as oximes. All those nitrogen compounds probably originated from proteins but also from fatty acids and sugars. The nature of those compounds was found to be only slightly influenced when wastes have similar nitrogen functionalities contents, such as food waste and sewage sludge. That would suggest that reaction pathways for nitrogen compounds are similar for such wastes. For wood, its low nitrogen content hindered the detection of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>products,</b> which could be also due to a different reaction pathway for nitrogen. The mixture of those wastes,had only slightly-effects on <b>nitrogen</b> <b>products</b> and thus on the reaction pathway.

In this endeavor, two different methods were investigated;One method was based on hydrolysis of the hemicelluloses in these materials with dilute solutions of mineral acids or salts followed by ammoniation with anhydrous ammonia of the hydrolysate. With corncobs, when 8. 25 percent sulfuric acid and a liquid/solid ratio of 2. 0 was used for hydrolysis, and ammoniation was carried out slightly above room temperature, a product was obtained containing 7. 4 percent total nitrogen of which 4. 2 percent was organic <b>nitrogen</b> (<b>Product</b> A), With the same hydrolysis conditions and an ammoniation temperature of 249 °C, a product was obtained containing 9. 5 percent nitrogen of which 56 percent was organic <b>nitrogen</b> (<b>Product</b> B). In Product A, 86. 4 {{percent of the total}} nitrogen was water-soluble, and in Product B only 17. 6 percent was water-soluble. Normal and concentrated superphosphates or dilute phosphoric acid in the hydrolysis step did not result in as much organic nitrogen an sulfuric acid;The second method involved the ammoniation of the cellulosic materials with anhydrous ammonia. By this process, a product containing 4. 6 percent total nitrogen was obtained with corncobs at a temperature or 300 °C (Product C). In this product, all the nitrogen was organic and none of it was water-soluble;Small-scale engineering equipment for producing Product A was built and tested. Products were made which were essentially the same as those prepared on a laboratory scale;An evaluation of Products A, B, and C as fertilizer materials was made. Tests were made to determine chemical stability, hygroscopicity and caking characteristics. These tests showed that Products A, B, and C could be used in mixed fertilizers. Greenhouse plant-growth tests were carried out. Product A proved to be better than Milorganite, a commercial nitrogen fertilizer made from sewage, and was almost an good as ammonium sulfate, Products B and C did not compare well with Product A ammonium sulfate, or Milorganite in the plant-growth tests; however, under different conditions of a longer growing season, these two products might be better;A preliminary cost analysis indicated that Product A might compete with ammonium sulfate and could easily undersell Milorganite;It is recommended that further pilot plant work be carried out on the production of Product A...|$|E

Sediments from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 164 deep holes (Sites 994, 995, and 997) also exhibit linear ammonium profiles above the top of the gas hydrate zone (~ 200 mbsf) (Paull, Matsumoto, Wallace, et al., 1996, doi: 10. 2973 /odp. proc. ir. 164. 1996). We hypothesized that a possible cause of linear ammonium profiles was diffusion of ammonium from a concentrated ammonium source at depth. We further reasoned that if this ammonium were produced by microbial fermentation reactions at depth, that a comparison of the nitrogen isotopic composition of sedimentary organic nitrogen and the nitrogen with pore-water ammonium would test this hypothesis.

Sap bleeding from detached nodules carried 80 % of its nitrogen as asparagine and less than 1 % as 4 -methyleneglutamine. Pulse-feeding nodulated roots with 15 N 2 gas showed asparagine to be the principal <b>nitrogen</b> <b>product</b> exported from N 2 -fixing nodules. Maintaining root systems in an N 2 -deficient (argon:oxygen, 80 : 20, v/v) atmosphere for 3 days greatly depleted asparagine levels in nodules. 4 -Methyleneglutamine represented 73 % of the total amino nitrogen in the xylem sap of non-nodulated plants grown on nitrogen-free nutrients, but relative levels of this compound decreased and asparagine increased when nitrate was supplied. The presence of 4 -methyleneglutamine in xylem exudate {{did not appear to}} be associated with either N 2 fixation or nitrate assimilation, and an origin from cotyledon nitrogen was suggested from study of changes in amount of the compound in tissue amino acid pools and in root bleeding xylem sap following germination. Changes in xylem sap composition were studied in nodulated plants receiving a range of levels of 15 N-nitrate, and a 15 N dilution technique was used to determine the proportions of accumulated plant nitrogen derived from N 2 or fed nitrate. The abundance of asparagine in xylem sap and the ratio of asparagine:nitrate fell, while the ratio of nitrate:total amino acid rose as plants derived less of their organic nitrogen from N 2.

Rate increases of up to 38 -fo 1 d resulted from dimethyl substitution at the C-SNO carbon. Electron donation from the methyl groups increased the proton affinity of the NITROSO sulfur, which was shown by computational methods to be the initial step in the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Only minor changes were observed in k obs due to N -acetylation, and activation energies of 25. 7 ± 1. 7 and 23. 7 ± 1. 3 kcal/mole were measured for S -nitroso- N -acetylated-cysteine and S -nitroso- N -acetylated-penicillamine, respectively. Acid-catalyzed GSNO decomposition at pH 2. 0 exhibited a sigmoidal decomposition curve typical of autocatalytic processes. Based on strong inhibition on removal of HNO 2, N 2 O 3, or oxygen from the solutions, a chain-reaction mechanism is proposed in which N 2 O 3 is the chain carrier. Reaction is initiated by HNO 2 formation on hydrolysis of the S-NO bond via nucleophilic attack at the nitroso N, and the overall reaction generates GSO 3 H, GSOSG, GSO 2 SG, in addition to HNO 2 as decomposition products. Base-catalyzed GSNO hydrolysis was found to occur mainly via nucleophilic attack at the nitroso N forming a nitrosated disulfide intermediate that produces GSSG, GS(NO) S -, and a sulfur-free glutathionyl derivative as the GSX products NO 2 - was the main <b>nitrogen</b> <b>product.</b> The percent distribution of the GSX products varied with the OH - and GSNO concentrations. N 2 O was also detected and glutathionyl sulfenic acid GSOH was trapped with dimedone. Thus, base-catalyzed GSNO hydrolysis also proceeded via initial OH - attack at the nitroso sulfur forming nitroxyl (HNO), although this appears to be a minor pathway under our experimental conditions. S -Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) undergoes denitrosation at neutral pH in the presence of excess glutathione (GSH) even when protected from light and metal-catalyzed decomposition. The major glutathionyl product from these reactions is GSSG, and minor products include GS(O) NH 2, GSN(OH) H, and GSOH. Detection of GS(O) NH 2 and N 2 O suggests that HNO is generated during the reaction. Retardation of GSNO decomposition on addition of dimedone suggests that the mechanism is partially autocatalytic. The in-source fragmentation of reduced glutathione (GSH), S -nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in a Z-spray ESI source was investigated. The results show that the cone voltage is the major contributor to in-source GSX fragmentation. Cone-voltage-induced fragmentation of the three compounds was pH-dependent, and occurred via loss of H 2 O and cleavage of the peptide bonds into b and y ions. Loss of NH 3 was observed only for GSH at pH 2. 5. Homolytic cleavage of the S-NO bond preceded fragmentation of the glutathionyl moiety, forming a GS + radical cation that yields fragment ions unique to GSNO. The results can be used to improve the detection and interpretation of mass spectra of samples containing mixtures of GSX compounds. Direct measurement of underivatized S -nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using mobile phases at neutral pH and employing UV spectrophotometric (HPLC/(UV) and electrospray mass spectrometric (HPLC/ESI-MS) detection. Using UV detection, the method is robust and exhibits good linearity in the range of 0. 2 - 100 oM GSNO with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0. 2 oM GSNO.

40|$|The {{principle}} aim of {{this study}} was to gain an understanding of the conditions and processes governing the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND). SND is the process that combines nitrification and denitrification in the same reactor (at the same time) under fully aerobic conditions. From various studies, two main hypotheses, one physical and one biological, have been proposed to explain SND (Simultaneous Nitrification and Denitrification). Significant research has been performed on the biological aspects, whereas relatively little is known about the physical explanation. Therefore, further investigations of physical explanation on SND (Simultaneous Nitrification and Denitrification) are carried out in this thesis. To fulfill this principal objective, two major tasks were preformed: experimental studies and model development. The experimental investigation was conducted using lab scale sequencing batch reactors (SBR). The operating conditions of the reactors were varied corresponding to the aim of each experiment. The influent wastewater was collected from the effluent of an anaerobic pond at an abattoir wastewater treatment plant. The main experimental studies focused on three factors, the effect of soluble organic carbon, floc size and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, on the SND activity. The results revealed that all these factors had a significant influence on the degree of SND achieved. Almost 50 % of inorganic nitrogen lost by SND (Simultaneous Nitrification and Denitrification) could be achieved when operating at a soluble COD:TKN ratio of 6. A dramatic increase in SND activity to 85 % was found when this ratio reached 10. With a soluble COD:TKN ratio of 15, complete nitrogen removal by SND could be achieved. The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) was equally strong. SND could completely occur at very low DO concentrations (0. 2 mg/L). However, the nitrogen removal in this range was substantially limited by the low nitrification rate. To improve the nitrification rate but still achieve effective denitrification, a DO concentration of around 0. 4 - 0. 5 mg/L seems to be an optimal value to maintain a significant degree of SND. In this range, the nitrification rate reached 50 % of the rate found at DO of 1. 1 mg/L and 60 % SND activity was achieved. The effect of bacterial floc size on SND was also quite remarkable. It was found that an SBR operating with a median floc size of 80 mm could achieve 80 % SND, whereas the SND activity decreased to only 50 % after the median floc size was reduced to 40 mm in the following treatment cycle. A complete nitrogen balance over the whole process was performed to confirm the occurrence of SND in such systems. Under typical operating conditions, it was found that the nitrogen gas was the major <b>nitrogen</b> <b>product</b> of the treatment process (approximately 58 % of the total output). 14 % of nitrogen was assimilated to biomass whereas 23 % of nitrogen at the end of the process was in the soluble form (organic nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate and ammonium). The mathematical dynamic model was developed to gain a better understanding of SND in the situation that is difficult to investigate experimentally. The overall model structure can be divided into 4 main areas : 1. a micro level model for a single floc 2. the reaction rates for a single floc size 3. the reaction rates for the entire reactor considering the floc size distribution 4. a macro model for the whole reactor including the operational changes throughout the cycle. It was found that the model can predict the SND behavior well for the system operating under typical influent characteristics (SCOD:TKN of 10). However, poor predictions were found at different levels of SCOD:TKN. Two crucial reasons can be given. Firstly, this model did not include intracellular carbon storage by bacteria. Secondly, many parameters, especially floc and microorganism characteristics (i. e. intra floc biomass distribution, growth and decay of the microorganism, etc.) could not be determined or estimated accurately. However, under normal operating conditions of this study, the model advances the fundamental understanding of SND process in activated sludge system. The simulation results showed that both floc diameter and liquid phase concentration are important factors influencing the internal floc concentrations. It was also predicted that an anoxic microzone, caused by oxygen diffusion limitation, potentially occurs in the floc center. This microzone therefore enhances denitrification activity inside the floc. A number of major conclusions can be drawn from this thesis: 1. SND potentially occurs as a result of physical phenomenon 2. high soluble COD is beneficial to SND activity 3. suitable floc size distribution (with more large flocs) can enhance SND 4. major nitrogenous product of the treatment process is nitrogen gas 5. dissolved oxygen optimization is critical to get good nitrification rate and SND...|$|E
40|$|Supercritical water (SCW) is an {{effective}} solvent {{for the destruction of}} organic compounds by oxidation. Because both organics and oxygen have high solubility in water above its critical point (To = 374 °C (647 K), Pc = 221 bar), they can be reacted together in a single phase which avoids mass transfer limitations. At typical operating conditions (T= 450 to 650 °C, P = 240 to 300 bar) for supercritical water oxidation (SCWO), H-C-N compounds are rapidly and completely oxidized to water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and nitrous oxide. The destruction of organic compounds in SCWO takes place primarily through free radical pathways rather than the ionic pathways that dominate in liquid water. This is because SCW acts as a nonpolar solvent with a dielectric constant ranging from 1. 2 at T= 650 °C and P = 250 bar to 2. 5 at T= 450 °C and P = 250 bar as compared to ambient water which has a dielectric constant equal to 80. The ion product of water, K, similarly drops to between 10 - 8 and 102 ° over this temperature range as compared to the ambient value of 10 - 14. Typically, SCWO has been studied by the analysis of either the oxidation of single model compounds to determine detailed kinetic mechanisms or by the oxidation of complex simulated waste streams to measure DRE levels. (cont.) While kinetic rates and mechanisms are accurately determined by the analysis of pure compounds, this approach fails to characterize the co-oxidation effect: a phenomenon observed in mixed waste streams where refractory compounds oxidize more rapidly in the presence of labile compounds. The purpose of this research is to provide a quantitative mechanistic understanding of co-oxidation rate enhancement in supercritical water. This understanding is vital for the application of predictive elementary reaction rate models developed for individual model compounds to the analysis of mixed waste streams. By combining the two well-characterized, validated SCWO models for ethanol and MPA, mechanistic insight into the interaction of the two compounds in SCW is possible. This insight into the mechanism of co-oxidation could then be used to assist in the development and validation of an elementary reaction rate mechanism for ammonia. (cont.) The co-oxidative effect of ethanol on methylphosphonic acid (MPA, or PO(OH) 2 CH 3) was characterized for a range of MPA concentrations (0. 1 to 1. 0 mM) and ethanol concentrations (0 to 2. 4 mM) for temperatures of 473 °C and 528 °C, a pressure of 245 bar, and stoichiometric oxygen for the complete combustion of both organic compounds. Low concentrations of ethanol (0. 1 and 0. 3 mM) were found to have no statistically significant effect on MPA conversion for an initial MPA concentration of 1. 0 mM, but higher concentrations of ethanol caused an increase in the conversion of MPA at T= 473 °C, P = 245 bar, and r = 9 s from 14 ± 2 % without ethanol present to 29 - 2 % with 1. 0 mM ethanol and 39 ± 2 % with 2. 4 mM ethanol. The increase in MPA conversion was more pronounced at shorter residence times. Decreasing the initial concentration of MPA at a constant initial ethanol concentration of 1. 0 mM, T= 473 C, P = 245 bar, and = 9 s resulted in an increase in MPA conversion from 29 ± 2 % at 1. 0 mM MPA to 41 ± 2 % at 0. 1 mM MPA. At T = 528 C and P = 245 bar, the initial concentration of MPA had a much greater effect on MPA conversion than the initial concentration of ethanol. (cont.) A supercritical water co-oxidation elementary reaction rate mechanism was constructed from submechanisms for MPA and ethanol with updated kinetic rate parameters for H 202 and HOCO' chemistry. The co-oxidation mechanism accurately reproduces the experimentally observed conversion trend of the refractory MPA component as a function of initial concentration of the labile ethanol component. The increase in MPA conversion with increasing ethanol concentration is predicted to be caused by the increased concentration of hydroperoxy radicals (HO 2 ') produced by ethanol oxidation. An analysis of the major organophosphorus reaction fluxes indicated that the co-oxidative effect would increase the conversion of MPA but not change the rate of formation of methane. An experiment using a model formaldehyde/methanol mixture as a co-oxidant was conducted to confirm this prediction. (cont.) The co-oxidative effect of ethanol on ammonia oxidation in supercritical water was studied for a range of temperatures (655 - 705 C), initial ammonia (1 to 3 mM), ethanol (0 to 1. 0 mM), and oxygen concentrations (0. 7 to 5. 0 mM), corresponding to fuel equivalence ratios ranging from 0. 9 to 2. 2. With a stoichiometric amount of oxygen available for complete oxidation, the addition of ethanol on an equivalent molar basis was found to increase ammonia conversion from 20 % to 65 % at initial concentrations of 1 mM for each reactant, T= 700 C, P 246 bar, and X = 2. 5 s. Nitrous oxide was produced in much larger quantities for ammonia-ethanol co-oxidation than for ammonia oxidation. Based on fractional yields of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>product,</b> this amounted to 40 to 75 % for co-oxidation with ethanol versus 4 to 13 % without ethanol present. A co-oxidation model was constructed from submechanisms for ammonia combustion at atmospheric pressure conditions and ethanol oxidation in supercritical water. The initial mechanism poorly reproduced experimental ammonia conversion data and was not able to consistently match nitrous oxide production as a function of temperature over a range from 655 to 700 C. In order to improve model predictions, the low-pressure NH 2 +NOx submechanism was replaced with a submechanism that included the H 2 NNOx adduct species that are expected to be stabilized in the high-pressure supercritical water environment. Thermochemical and kinetic parameters for the adduct species were estimated with quantum chemical calculations using Gaussian 98 with the CBS-Q method. The explicit treatment of the H 2 NNOx adducts resulted in nitrous oxide yield predictions that correctly reproduced experimental trends. (cont.)

Greening aa Nitric oxide (NO) {{is an important}} mediator of biologi-cal functions in the airways [1], regulating airway smooth muscle contractility, mucus secretion from airways mu-cus glands and vasodilatation and mediating inflammatory responses [2]. Central {{to the formation of}} NO and its reac-tive <b>nitrogen</b> <b>products</b> is the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) which has been characterized in almost all cells within the airways [3]. Expression of one of the isoform of NOS (inducible NOS (iNOS)) {{has been shown to be}} in-creased in the airway epithelium of asthmatics [4] and NO in the exhaled air of these patients has also been seen to b...|$|R

40|$|Electron {{paramagnetic}} resonance spectra {{have been}} observed from the products of gaseous microwave electric discharges frozen at 4. 2 [degrees]K. The gases investigated were N 2 and NH 3. The spectrum of the frozen <b>nitrogen</b> discharge <b>products</b> plainly indicates the presence of atomic nitrogen whose half life in the solid is greater than ten hours. Dilution of the nitrogen in an inert matrix of argon is found to cause considerable line broadening. When the <b>nitrogen</b> discharge <b>products</b> are passed over mercury prior to condensation, a complex spectrum of 11 lines is obtained. The spectrum of NH 3 discharge products indicates the presence of atomic nitrogen and hydrogen. Data concerning the presence of NH and NH 2 radicals are not conclusive. A description of the apparatus and techniques developed for these experiments is included. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Inhibition of {{inflammation}} and free radical {{formation in the}} cochlea {{may be involved in}} antioxidant treatment in acute acoustic trauma. Procedure. Chinchilla were exposed to 105 dB sound pressure level octave band noise for 6 hours. One group of chinchilla was treated with antioxidants after noise exposure. Auditory brainstem responses, outer hair cell counts, and immunohistochemical analyses of biomarkers in the cochlea were conducted. Results. The antioxidant treatment significantly reduced hearing threshold shifts, outer hair cell loss, numbers of CD 45 + cells, as well as 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal and nitrotyrosine formation in the cochlea. Conclusion. Antioxidant treatment may provide protection to sensory cells by inhibiting formation of reactive oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>products</b> and migration of mononuclear phagocytes in the cochlea. The present study provides further evidence of effectiveness of antioxidant treatment in reducing permanent hearing loss...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{evaluate}} the frequency and nature of renal lesion in patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. According to clinical, laboratory and sonographic data renal damage is observed in 2 / 3 {{of the number of}} patients that is associated with the presence of the pathology of myocardium, joints, lungs and peripheral nervous system, with the severity of integrated extrarenal signs of the disease, and kidney failure is diagnosed in every second observation, nephrotic syndrome — in every sixth one. Morphological lesion of glomeruli, tubules and stroma of the kidneys resembles primary mesangioproliferative or mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis with severe tubulointerstitial component. Renal function and the rate of progression of nephropathy influence the levels of high molecular weight proteins in the urine (fibronectin, b 2 -microglobulin) and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>products</b> (uric acid, nitrites), as well as physical and chemical surface features of urine...|$|R
40|$|The {{breakdown}} of organic nitrogen in soil {{is a potential}} rate-limiting step in nitrogen cycling. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are root symbionts that might improve the ability of plants to compete for organic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>products</b> against other decomposer microbes. However, AM uptake of organic nitrogen, especially in natural systems, has traditionally been difficult to test. We developed a novel quantitative nanotechnological technique to determine in situ that organic nitrogen uptake by AM fungi can occur {{to a greater extent}} than has previously been assumed. Specifically, we found that AM fungi acquired recalcitrant and labile forms of organic nitrogen. Moreover, N enrichment of soil reduced plot-scale uptake of these compounds. Since most plants host AM fungi, AM use of organic nitrogen could widely influence plant productivity, especially where N availability is relatively low. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Retiring from Swift in {{accordance}} with its age-65 retirement policy, Jarvis had overseen sweeping changes in the meat packing industry and within Swift & Company. Under his leadership, the company diversified into such fields as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>products</b> and potash; investment in the company's insurance complex as well as increasing Swift's adhesive plants to twenty-five located in the United States, Canada, and England. In addition, Swift substantially developed specialized services for hotels, restaurants, and other institutions. Overseas, Swift went into a variety of ventures on a joint basis with local partners in other countries. Jarvis was a strong advocate for the company's research and development department. At the time of his retirement on 1 December 1967, the company was in the process of moving 300 scientists into a new multi-million dollar research center located at Oak Brook, Illinois. Jarvis was succeeded as chief executive of the company by Robert W. Reneker.|$|R
