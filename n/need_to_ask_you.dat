Al Yamaan son of Ubaidillah said: “I saw Yahya son of Umme Taweel {{standing}} in al Kunase (a place in Kufa, Iraq) and he {{shouted at the}} top of his voice: Oh servants of Allah, we are innocent from what you are hearing. Whoever curses Ali then upon him is the curse of Allah. And we disassociate ourselves from ale marwan and whatever they worship other than allah. then he lowers his voice and says: Do not sit with the ones who curse the guardians of Allah and whoever doubts the matter that we are upon then do not start the debates with them. and if your brothers <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for help then you have already betrayed them! Then he reads: Surely we have prepared for the oppressors a fire, the curtains of which shall encompass them about; and if they cry for water, they shall be given water like molten brass which will scald their faces; evil the drink and ill the resting-place.” ...|$|R

I don't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> any more questions. I don't {{want any more}} explanations. If {{you want to keep}} this out of the police court, you will do exactly as I tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] Quest replied. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth, I find that I shall not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> those questions, after all. A {{messenger}} from the police-station has been here. He says {{they have come to}} the conclusion that a very well-known gang of New York criminals are in this thing. We know how to track them down all right." ...|$|E

[...] and once more she looked at me, adding, [...] "Don't be ashamed, for you {{remember}} that I have {{been in touch with}} hidden things and am not quite as other women are.

Purchase t-shirts, jackets, bag, or need for fashion in general done by face to face between sellers and buyers. Sometimes difficult to obtain the desired goods in other cities. Not to mention if the sales lot. With the state's fast-paced and rapidly evolving technology, we need a support system online purchases. By leveraging the sophistication of this technology, greatly simplify the buying and selling. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} do research online purchasing system so that the existence of information systems is becoming more popular in the community. Electronic Commerce is the process of buying, selling, transferring or exchanging of products in the form of goods and services via computer networks including the Internet. With this technology we can buy goods according distro catalogs and goods we can buy wherever we are. The development of this technology is called electronic orders (e-order), web-based so it can be accessed anywhere and anytime without having to come to the reservation. This study uses a method comparison study. By observing the sale of an existing system first, to see its shortcomings, and then add the features that did not exist.

For you've hit it; you've driven the centre, you've plugged the bulls-eye of my dream. Now I'll {{tell you the}} whole thing, and you'll understand it. I don't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to keep it to yourself, because you'll see that the project will prosper all the better for being kept in the background till the right time.

40|$|Amber Whittaker {{went to see}} {{her family}} {{physician}} about a sore throat. Amber, 19, and her family have been patients of Dr Christine Nowak for 15 years. The Whittakers and Dr Nowak {{are members of the}} same evangelical church, Riverwood Community Church, and they have grown to be friends over the past few years. Dr Nowak examined Amber, performed a rapid strep test, which was positive, and informed her that she had a streptococcal pharyngitis. “Try not to kiss any boys this week, ” Dr Nowak said with a smile. “Actually, now that you mention it, ” Amber said, “that’s something I wanted to ask you about. My boyfriend and I have been together {{for more than a year}} now, and we’ve been talking seriously about marriage. ” “That’s great! I’m glad to hear things are going well, ” Dr Nowak said. “Well, that’s not all: we feel we’re ready to start having sex, and I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to write me a prescription for birth control pills. ” Dr Nowak paused for a moment, then explained, “You know, Amber, I appreciate you sharing this with me, but I imagine you know how I feel about premarital sex. As your doctor, friend, and fellow Christian, I think this is an unwise decision, and I can’t in good conscience help you do something I think is wrong. ” “But doctor, we’ve both thought about it, and we love each other, so why put it off any longer?” “As a physician, ” Dr Nowak replied, “I’m committed to doing what’s in my patients’ best interest. And I believe, based on the Scriptures we both read and on our common understanding of God’s nature and purposes for us, that sex is the consummation of a spiritual union between husband and wife. Sex is created by God to be enjoyed in the context of marriage, and saving it for that moment makes it all the more special. I realize that’s difficult, and it’s not what our culture at large believes. But if we call ourselves Christians, we need to carry our beliefs into every aspect of our identity? including something as personal as our sexuality. ...|$|E
40|$|Your {{success in}} {{implementing}} effective energy education will hinge upon your ability <b>to</b> identify local <b>needs</b> and adapt educational materials <b>to</b> meet those <b>needs.</b> Developing a needs assessment involves answering the following questions: • Who should be assessed? Who is the programming attempting to inform, influence, or persuade? Be specific {{in identifying the}} audience you wish to assess and ultimately impact. Programming efforts may draw “the general public, ” but you should know your target audience. If you are attempting to address multiple segments in the community (agricultural producers, homeowners, business owners, etc.) be aware of developing differing programming strategies for each and asking different questions in the assessment process <b>to</b> establish their <b>needs.</b> • What do you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know? What questions <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be <b>asked?</b> Can <b>you</b> change the situation? Before designing an assessment tool, determine what you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know in order to plan programming. As an example, {{you might want to}} know the motivation behind your audience’s interest in energy – are they worried about rising energy prices? Are they concerned about environmental issues? Are they curious about educational projects that might be done in the community? Understanding the underlying interests in energy will aid in tailoring programming efforts. Use the E 3 A Map in this guide and the Importance Scale Survey to help! • How do members of your target audience prefer to learn about energy? Program planning should consider the venue of educational efforts. Would your audience prefer to attend a class? View a webinar from home? Listen to a pod cast? Have a one-on-one discussion about their needs? Understand audience preferences as you design your programmatic plan. • When would your audience prefer to learn about energy? Take some time to learn about audience preferences (seasonality, time of day, time of week, etc.) ...|$|R
