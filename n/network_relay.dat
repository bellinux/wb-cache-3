This paper shows how to obtain the {{capacity}} of modular additive noise of an arbitrary single-input-single-output (SISO) <b>relay</b> <b>network.</b> The arbitrary SISO <b>relay</b> <b>network</b> is a <b>network</b> where the <b>relays</b> are interconnected {{with each other in}} various combinations. Its capacity is obtained by using a quantize-and-forward (QAF) strategy at each relay node. This paper considers all channels as discrete memoryless channels. In order to obtain the capacity of an arbitrary SISO <b>relay</b> <b>network,</b> this paper simplifies the network in terms of a parallel and serial <b>relay</b> <b>network</b> and finds the capacity. First, the capacity expression for a parallel <b>relay</b> <b>network</b> is obtained. In a parallel <b>relay</b> <b>network,</b> the source is transmitted to all relays; then each relay, using a QAF strategy, forwards the source to the destination. Second, the capacity expression for a serial <b>relay</b> <b>network</b> where the <b>relays</b> are interconnected serially is obtained.

50|$|DARPA {{conducted}} the first {{demonstration of the}} whole PCAS system with the U.S. Marine Corps on 27 March 2015 during the Talon Reach training exercise. The exercise {{was the first time}} the air component was integrated with the ground component in use operationally since 2013, dubbed Kinetic Integrated Low-cost SoftWare Integrated Tactical Combat Handheld (KILSWITCH), combining PCAS-Ground's better navigation, situational awareness, fire coordination, and communications with PCAS-Air's weapons management, ISR, and communications systems on a Smart Launcher Electronics (SLE) device. During the demonstration, ground forces used an Android tablet to identify a target and sent its position to an MV-22 Osprey, which fired an inert AGM-176 Griffin missile from 4.5 mi and scored a direct hit. In a situation where air support would take 30 minutes or more if called using paper maps and voice instructions, DARPA's objective was to reduce it to six minutes, and the demonstration achieved a hit in only four minutes. In another part of the exercise, two groups of Marines coordinated a night attack using PCAS-Ground. One group launched an AeroVironment Switchblade UAV to provide surveillance and <b>network</b> <b>relay</b> capabilities, which synced to both groups' KILSWITCH tablets to give them the locations of friendly and enemy forces. PCAS-Air's modular design allows it to work with almost any aircraft. The first tests conducted with U.S. Air Force A-10s took place from April through June 2015. Flying 50 sorties, 10 involved live-fire engagements that were carried out within six minutes, where JTACs commanded airstrikes with as few as three clicks on a specially configured Android tablet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — {{future generations}} of {{cellular}} communications require higher data rates and more reliable transmission link. Cooperative communications have a great significant in modern communications as they improve the information transmission between the source and the destination by using the relays. The relaying schemes are Amplify-and-Forward (AF) in which the relay sends an amplified copy of its receive signal and consequently serves as a repeater. In contrast, for Decode-and-Forward (DF) the relay performs a complete decoding of the receive signal and transmits the re-encoded message. This paper is a complete study of cooperative systems, analyzing its performance and comparing the use of two protocols amplify and forward (AF) and decode and forward(DF) with single and multi relays scenarios by measuring bit error rate using matlab.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we derive the {{capacity}} of the de-terministic <b>relay</b> <b>networks</b> with <b>relay</b> messages. We consider a network which consists of five nodes, four of which can only communicate via the fifth one. However, the fifth node is not merely a relay as it may exchange private messages with the other network nodes. First, we develop an upper bound on {{the capacity}} region based on the notion of a single sided genie. In the course of the achievability proof, we also derive the deterministic capacity of a 4 -user <b>relay</b> <b>network</b> (without private messages at the relay). The capacity achieving schemes use a combination of two network coding techniques: the Simple Ordering Scheme (SOS) and Detour Schemes (DS). In the SOS, we order the transmitted bits at each user such that the bi-directional messages will be received at the same channel level at the relay, while the basic idea behind the DS is that some parts of the message follow an indirect path to their respective destinations. This paper, therefore, serves to show that user cooperation and network coding can enhance throughput, even when the users are not directly connected to each other.

40|$|Abstract: Direct {{application}} of network coding at the physical layer- physical layer network coding (PNC) - is a promising technique for two-way relay wireless networks. In a two-way relay <b>network,</b> <b>relay</b> nodes {{are used to}} relay two-way information flows between pairs of end nodes. This paper proposes a precise definition for PNC. Specifically, in PNC, a relay node does not decode the source information from the two ends separately, but rather directly maps the combined signals received simultaneously to a signal to be relayed. Based on this definition, PNC can be further sub-classed into two categories- PNCF (PNC over finite field) and PNCI (PNC over infinite field) - according to whether the network-code field (or groups, rings) adopted is finite or infinite. For each of PNCF and PNCI, we consider two specific estimation techniques for dealing with noise in the mapping process. The performance of the four schemes is investigated by means of analysis and simulation, assuming symbol-level time synchronization only. I...|$|E
