5000|$|Night {{flushing}} (also {{known as}} night ventilation, <b>night</b> <b>cooling,</b> night purging, or nocturnal convective cooling) is a passive or semi-passive cooling strategy that requires increased air movement {{at night to}} cool the structural elements of a building. Unlike free cooling, which assists in chilling water, night flushing cools down the thermal mass. To execute night flushing, the building envelope typically stays closed during the day, causing excess heat gains to be stored in the building's thermal mass. The building structure acts as a sink through the day and absorbs heat gains from occupants, equipment, solar radiation, and conduction through walls, roofs, and ceilings. At night, when the outside air is cooler and not too humid, the envelope is opened, allowing cooler air {{to pass through the}} building so the stored heat can be dissipated by convection. This process reduces the temperature of the indoor air and of the building's thermal mass, allowing convective, conductive, and radiant cooling to take place during the day when the building is occupied. Night flushing is most effective in climates with a large diurnal swing, i.e. a large difference between the daily maximum and minimum outdoor temperature. For optimal performance, the nighttime outdoor air temperature should fall below the daytime comfort zone limits of 22 C and 60% relative humidity. For the night flushing strategy to be effective at reducing indoor temperature and energy usage, the thermal mass must be sized sufficiently and distributed over a wide enough surface area to absorb the space's daily heat gains. Also, the total air change rate must be high enough to remove the internal heat gains from the space at night.There are three ways night flushing can be achieved in a building: ...|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{emission}} reduction and energy efficiency are highly important {{goals for the}} built environment, and society as a whole. One way that the building sector works with improving energy efficiency is advanced control of, among other things, airflow, heating, cooling and solar shading. When these control systems are installed {{there is often a}} possibility to gather historical data, and this study examines the possibility to use that data in combination with a building energy simulation to analyse the systems control and find potential improvements. <b>Night</b> <b>cooling,</b> to decrease the cooling need in buildings by over-ventilating at night with cool outdoor air, was used {{as an example of a}} systems control function to be evaluated and potentially improved. A case study was carried out, where the <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> function in an office building located in Göteborg was examined. As a first step a building energy simulation was done using post processed control systems data as input, and the simulation was calibrated to come as close as possible to the measured behaviour of the building. As a second step different alterations to the <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> control were evaluated using the calibrated model. The alterations were evaluated by comparing three different indicators for energy efficiency; bought energy, electricity cost and specific energy use according to Swedish building regulations. This was done to investigate if prioritizing different indicators would lead to different optimal <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> strategies. The study suggests that the building performance for all indicators can be improved, even though the studied building is new and built with a high aim when it comes to control and energy efficiency. Proposed alterations are to make sure that the active cooling is completely disabled during <b>night</b> <b>cooling,</b> and to limit the airflow to avoid the peak when the <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> initiates. There are some differences between the results of the different indicators, but for this studied building the difference is not large enough to lead to different <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> strategies...|$|E

Alternatively, up-front research on how to engineer best a generic night cooled office – as in this work – can thrust the application of <b>night</b> <b>cooling.</b> A fully automated configuration of data sampling, geometry/grid generation, CFD solving and surrogate modelling, generates several surrogate models. These models relate the convective heat flow in a night cooled landscape office to the ventilation concept, mass distribution, geometry and driving force for convective heat transfer.

40|$|<b>Night</b> <b>cooling</b> attracts growing interest. However, {{building}} designers still {{hesitate to}} apply <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> {{because of the}} important but hard-to-predict convective heat transfer by night. This heat transfer mechanism depends on the driving force, fluid motion and heat transfer surface and, thus, on the room/system design. Unfortunately, studies addressing this for <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> regimes are scarce. In response, this study, held in a PASLINK cell, investigates how the ventilative cooling rate, thermal mass and the supply/exhaust configuration affect the convective heat transfer. The analysis is based on airflow data, such as temperature and velocity, and the related convective heat flux. The results indicate the air supply/exhaust configuration is particularly important in case of heterogeneously distributed thermal mass. Next to it, correlations {{should not be used}} when the setup and the convection regime differ a lot from those of the corresponding experiments...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of daytime and nighttime passive ventilation cooling strategies for Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo. A new simulation method for cross-ventilated wind driven airflow is presented. This method decouples the airflow model from the thermal model allowing for fast real weather simulation of the building thermal performance. The simulation is performed on a six-story, isolated, suburban apartment building, considered to be typical of the three cities. The performance of the two natural ventilation strategies on this building is compared. The impact on {{the performance of}} different types of construction is assessed for the <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> ventilation strategy. The results show that <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> is superior to daytime ventilative cooling in the three cities. <b>Night</b> <b>cooling</b> can successfully replace air conditioning systems for {{a significant part of the}} cooling season in Beijing and Tokyo. For Shanghai, neither of the two passive ventilation systems can be considered successful. In both Beijing and Tokyo the application of <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> may cause condensation in partitions. The use of heavyweight partitions does not show a noticeable improvement over normal construction (using 10 cm concrete partitions). On the other hand, the lightweight case shows a noticeable degradation in system performance. Therefore, the normal structural system is the best option. The use of carpet has a very negative impact on <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> performance, and is therefore not advised. by Guilherme Carrilho da Graça. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|A new quasi-steady-state {{assessment}} method of mechanical <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> for calculating the cooling demand of non- esidential buildings is developed. In {{accordance with the}} calculation methodology proposed in the European standard EN 13790, the impact of <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> is calculated by a ventilation heat transfer coefficient which is, on its turn, determined by the heat capacity of air per volume and the air flow rate alongside a temperature adjustment factor, a time fraction of operation and an adjustment factor for dynamic effects. Dynamic simulations of a generic small and large office building and a school building determine these adjustment factors. The time fraction of operation is function of the losses to gains ratio. The temperature adjustment factor is constant and equal to 1. The adjustment factor for dynamic effects depends on the accessible thermal mass of the building structure. Comparing the new calculation method to dynamic simulation results of the same buildings, shows a non-linear and uncertain correspondence. The dynamic effects, which are essential for <b>night</b> <b>cooling,</b> are insufficiently considered in the new {{assessment method}} as described in EN 13790.

40|$|Periodically {{since the}} two oil crisis in the 1970 s, {{there has been a}} focus in Sweden on {{reducing}} the energy use in buildings. This focus has evolved into the building regulations used today. With the stricter energy requirements and the interest from society in environmental issues {{there is a need to}} use more optimized control systems for cooling and ventilation. <b>Night</b> <b>cooling</b> is an example of this. The purpose of <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> is to decrease the cooling need in buildings by ventilating at night with cold outdoor air. The thesis uses case studies to examine if it is possible to optimize <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> set points and time schedules regarding energy consumption and indoor climate for two retail stores in Göteborg. The optimizations were done with genetic algorithms, neural networks and building energy models, based on logged control data for the two stores. The study suggest that the energy consumption could be reduced with 15 % for both facilities with the optimized control settings compared to the original. The project also shows that even unoptimized <b>night</b> <b>cooling</b> has benefits to energy consumption. The sensitivity analysis shows that a reduction around 10 % for similar buildings are plausible with the optimized settings from the case studies. The projects concludes that the use of logged control data in combination with genetic algorithms and neural networks is an efficient way for both calibration and optimization of building energy models. The industry moves towards an increase of available logged control data. As such, it is important to be able to properly utilize the data for improving the accuracy of building energy simulations.
