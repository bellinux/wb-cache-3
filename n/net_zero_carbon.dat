40|$|Abstract. A {{zero-energy}} building, {{also known}} as a <b>zero</b> <b>net</b> energy (ZNE) building, net-zero energy building (NZEB), or <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> building, is a building with <b>zero</b> <b>net</b> energy consumption and <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions annually. Buildings that produce a surplus of energy over the year may be called “energy-plus buildings ” and buildings that consume slightly more energy than they produce are called “near-zero energy buildings ” or “ultra-low energy houses”. Traditional buildings consume 40 % of the total fossil fuel energy in the US and European Union and are significant contributors of greenhouse gases. The <b>zero</b> <b>net</b> energy consumption principle is viewed as a means to reduce carbon emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels and although zero energy buildings remain uncommon even in developed countries, they are gaining importance and popularity...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} UK's {{effort to}} combat climate change, deep cuts in carbon {{emissions}} will be required from existing housing over the coming decades. The viability of achieving such emission cuts for the UK social housing sector has been explored through {{a case study of}} Peabody, a housing association operating in London. Various approaches to stock refurbishment were modelled for Peabody's existing stock up to the year 2030, incorporating insulation, communal heating and micro-generation technologies. Outputs were evaluated under four future socio-economic scenarios. The results indicate that the Greater London Authority's target of a 60 % carbon emission cut by 2025 can be achieved if extensive stock refurbishment is coupled with a background of wider societal efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The two key external requirements identified are a significant reduction in the carbon intensity of grid electricity and a stabilisation or reduction in householder demand for energy. A target of achieving <b>zero</b> <b>net</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions across Peabody stock by 2030 can only be achieved if grid electricity becomes available from entirely zero-carbon sources. These results imply that stronger action is needed from both social landlords and Government to enable deep emission cuts to be achieved in UK social housing.

40|$|The energy {{performance}} and greenhouse gas impact of homes {{has been at}} the forefront of Australian climate change mitigation policy discussion for several decades. Various levels of government have acted to improve the energy and carbon efficiency of new homes through planning and building regulatory instruments. Most recently the Building Code of Australia has been used to introduce minimum energy efficiency standards for new homes at 4 stars in 2003, 5 stars in 2006 and 6 stars in 2010. But while improving the performance of long-lived assets such as new homes is a commonly used policy of developed nations, the relatively poor energy and greenhouse performing existing housing stock will continue to have a significant impact on global greenhouse gas emissions for many decades. The concept of <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> homes has been in the Australian policy debate since that target was set by the United Kingdom Government for new homes in 2007, with the policy commencing in 2016. And while the focus of the policy debate to date has been centred on the construction of new homes, can the same concept of <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> homes realistically be applied to the existing housing stock? Very little information is available about the practical implementation of <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> retrofits on existing Australian homes, and therefore little is known about the value of the concept in reducing the greenhouse gas emission impact of the existing building stock. The research question was consequently framed as - can the utilisation of commonly available renewable energy and energy efficient technologies allow an existing home to be retrofitted to be operationally carbon neutral? This research project aims to provide additional information into the national climate change mitigation debate through the careful and detailed examination of the practical application of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies to an existing home...|$|E
40|$|For {{newly built}} houses and renovations European and {{national}} ambitions prescribe increasing levels of energy performances, even including achieving the passive house standard, <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> energy or <b>carbon</b> neutral houses. For highly energy-efficient renovation, project information from first demonstration projects is now becoming available. This paper examines experiences of demonstration projects with improved energy performance, {{in order to}} diffuse these experiences to reach other innovators and the early adopter market. Innovation diffusion theory is used to analyse examples of residential renovations using passive house technologies. Further the paper examines challenges and opportunities for the diffusion of demonstrated solutions to an early adopter market. Detailed case studies show that passive house retrofit, as well as low energy retrofit, need more holistic approaches, higher skill competence and strong process coordination. The results show that it is technically feasible to reach outstanding energy performance in renovation. However, social, political and economical issues remain important barriers to reach a more substantial market share. In particular {{there is a need}} to cluster energy efficiency principles to focus on substantial energy savings.

40|$|For {{newly built}} houses {{national}} ambitions prescribe increasing levels of energy performances, even including achieving <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> energy or <b>carbon</b> neutral houses. This is in large {{contrast with the}} lack of quality in many building processes. The building regulations, processes and control will have to be reshaped to support these ambitions, taking into account a development of performance guarantees in the building sector. Passive houses have to reach a target energy demand for heating less than 15 kWh/m 2 a and a total primary energy demand less than 120 kWh/m 2 a. Quite some examples of houses (and other buildings) in various countries show that it is technically feasible to reach this performance. In most of these countries also some form of quality assurance and certificates for these houses exist. In this paper we describe the possible changes of building processes due to the introduction of the passive house concept, and the urgency of reliable quality assurance to adequately reaching the energy ambitions and to assure quality issues at the same time. We illustrate this with passive house certification schemes from some European countries. This leads to some conclusions about the role and content of passive house certificates in the coming years. 1...|$|R
