5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed <b>now</b> <b>as</b> secondary to tissue damage.|$|E
