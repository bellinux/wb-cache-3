5|$|The abacus, {{also called}} a {{counting}} frame, is a calculating tool {{that was in}} use centuries before {{the adoption of the}} written modern <b>numeral</b> <b>system</b> and is still widely used by merchants, traders and clerks in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere; it dates back to at least 2700–2300BC, when it was used in Sumer.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} {{in the middle of}} the trade network of the ancient world, the cultural and social landscape of the city was complex, as the inhabitants had to deal with traders and envoys who brought with them different customs from distant regions.

5|$|The {{earliest}} attested {{examples of}} mathematical calculations {{date to the}} predynastic Naqada period, and show a fully developed <b>numeral</b> <b>system.</b> The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain. Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations.|$|E
25|$|The decimal <b>numeral</b> <b>system</b> (also called base-ten {{positional}} <b>numeral</b> <b>system,</b> {{and occasionally}} called denary) {{is the standard}} system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers.

25|$|In computers, {{the main}} numeral systems {{are based on}} the {{positional}} system in base2 (binary <b>numeral</b> <b>system),</b> with two binary digits, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three (octal <b>numeral</b> <b>system)</b> or four (hexadecimal <b>numeral</b> <b>system)</b> are commonly used. For very large integers, bases232 or 264 (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the machine word) are used, as, for example, in GMP.|$|E
25|$|Digits are {{the entire}} set of symbols used to {{represent}} numbers. In a particular <b>numeral</b> <b>system,</b> a single digit represents a different amount than any other digit, although the symbols in the same <b>numeral</b> <b>system</b> might vary between cultures.|$|E

The binomial systems have wide range of applications in the information transmission, processing, and storage due to their error-detection capabilities. In this paper, the binomial <b>numeral</b> <b>systems</b> are well-defined, their prefix and compactness properties are established. Algorithms of generating binomial coding words (non-uniform and uniform) are presented, as well as an enhanced procedure of construction of constant weight Boolean combinations based upon the non-uniform binomial coding words. The correctness of this procedure is also established...|$|R

The Egyptians invented the first ciphered <b>numeral</b> <b>system,</b> and the Greeks followed by mapping their counting numbers onto Ionian and Doric alphabets.

25|$|Examples are Brahmi numerals, Greek numerals, Hebrew numerals, Roman numerals, and Chinese numerals.

25|$|The unary {{notation}} can be abbreviated {{by introducing}} different symbols for certain new values.
