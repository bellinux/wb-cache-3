This paper proposes and exemplifies a sociology of algorithms that is (i) historical, in that it demonstrates path-dependence {{in the development of}} automated markets; (ii) ecological (in Abbott’s sense), in that it shows how automated high-frequency trading (HFT) is both itself an ecology and also is shaped by other linked ecologies (especially those <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> <b>venues</b> and <b>of</b> regulation); and (iii) “Zelizerian, ” in that it highlights the importance of boundary work, especially of efforts to distinguish between (in effect) “good ” and “bad ” actors and algorithms.

This paper evaluates the impact <b>of</b> dark <b>trading</b> and fragmentation in visible order books on liquidity.

We find that fragmentation in visible order books improves global liquidity, whereas dark trading has a detrimental effect. In addition, local liquidity is lowered by fragmentation in visible order books, which suggests that the benefits of fragmentation are not enjoyed by market participants who resort only to the traditional market. dark trading; fragmentation; liquidity; market microstructure...|$|R

We focus on the duration of time between order submission and finding a match for trade execution. An autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model is specified using the Burr distribution. Given the price competitiveness of an order, duration is increasing in order size. Because of this longer duration for large orders on the EB, large traders will prefer the direct dealing market to the brokerage. We also find that the greater the depth of the market, the shorter the duration of orders of all sizes. This result is consistent with traders clustering in time to submit orders so as to increase the probability of finding a match...|$|R

30|$|There {{are other}} reasons as well. The SEC adopted decimalized prices in 2000.

Furthermore, my dissertation investigates the impact of investor protection change on the liquidity distribution of cross-listed stocks. Chapter 1 studies how global institutional investors' selection <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> <b>venues</b> influences the liquidity distribution of cross-listed stocks on 19 target ("host") markets around the world. I document strong empirical evidence indicating that institutional investors gravitate towards markets that are more geographically, culturally, and economically proximate. However, institutional investor's familiarity preference abates in the selection <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> <b>venues</b> when the target exchange does not furnish detailed rules on trading practices. Chapter 2, co-authored with G. Andrew Karolyi, studies the impact of abrupt change in the U. S. investor protection laws on the location <b>of</b> stock <b>trading</b> for firms with U. S. cross-listings. The U. S. Supreme Court's ruling {{in the case of}} Morrison vs. National Australia Bank in June 2010 communicates that civil liability for securities fraud applies only to securities listed on U. S. markets and to security transactions taken place in the U. S. We investigate whether and how the <b>trading</b> volume distribution <b>of</b> U. S. cross-listed stocks changed around the U. S. Supreme Court's ruling on the Morrison case. Our results indicate that for U. S. cross-listed foreign firms, the U. S. market share <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> volume has increased after the Morrison decision. Chapter 3, co-authored with G. Andrew Karolyi, examines {{the influence of}} global institutional investors on excess comovement in stock returns using cross-listed stocks around the world. We find that the return differentials between the cross-listed and its ordinary home market share, though small, exhibit excess comovements relative to market index returns, the home and the target market returns. Furthermore, we examine whether institutional investors exert significant influence on excess comovement in the returns of long-short positions that consist of a crosslisted and its counterpart home market shares with respective market index returns. We find that institutional investors domiciled in home country intensify the excess comovement in long-short position returns with the home market returns. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R

Here, different sets of real-world rules are analyzed with regard to transactional efficiency. Economic analyses are used to compare the effects of different rules, and are underpinned by a detailed analysis of relevant rules in the United States, the European Union, France, Sweden and England & Wales. Several normative conclusions can be drawn. Best execution rules that impose an agency duty on brokers do not seem to contribute in a discernible way to increased transactional efficiency. In contrast, disclosure rules that require both brokers and <b>trading</b> <b>venues</b> to provide ex post information about execution quality, and about how client orders have been routed, may contribute to mitigating the information asymmetry between brokers and clients. The compliance costs associated with such rules are outweighed by the positive effects on transactional efficiency.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{widespread}} concern {{over the growth of}} new &# 145;dark&# 146; <b>trading</b> <b>venues</b> in equity markets. It is important to understand the implications of these changes for market quality and the impact <b>of</b> different <b>trading</b> rules, in respect of dark pools, on the relative competitive positions <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> <b>venues.</b> Compared to exchange <b>trading,</b> dark <b>venues</b> are characterised by pre-trade opacity, exemptions from fair access requirements and the frequent use of sub-penny pricing. This dissertation shows that these unique features influence the ability of new and existing <b>trading</b> <b>venues</b> to compete for order flow and may have long term consequences for market quality. First, I investigate the role of sub-penny pricing in the competition for order flow between venues that differ on the basis of tick size regimes. I find that order flow migrates to dark venues offering sub-penny pricing when prices are constrained by the minimum 0. 01 USD tick size on the exchange. The implication of the finding is that larger minimum tick sizes generally put <b>trading</b> <b>venues</b> at a competitive disadvantage notwithstanding the benefits of discouraging free-riding. Second, I show that dark venues may use their unique features to attract uninformed clients, resulting in a segregation of informed and uninformed order flow. As a result, dark market fragmentation is associated with lower market quality, evidenced by higher transaction costs and lower price efficiency. However, the execution of large transactions on dark venues does not harm market quality. Third, I test whether non-displayed limit order books are more attractive to informed traders than crossing networks that cross only at the midpoint because traders can use discretionary pricing to reduce non-execution risk. The results show that trades executed at non-discretionary prices are more informed than trades executed at the midpoint of the National Best Bid and Offer. This dissertation contributes to the long-standing debate on market fragmentation versus market consolidation. The results also have policy implications for market regulators, who are required by their published mandates to assure themselves before approving market design changes that the changes enhance market quality, taking account of both market efficiency and market integrity...|$|R
