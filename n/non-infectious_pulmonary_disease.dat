We studied the risk factors responsible for more severe Chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> Identifying them would help to work against progression to more severe disease as well as prevention. Methods: A prospective cross sectional study was done in outpatient clinic of Jinnah postgraduate medical center from December 2010 to December 2011. All patients fulfilling the criteria for Chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> were taken in study. Patients with less than five pack years smoking with other risk factors for Chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> were evaluated. Results: Out of total 90 patients, 74 (82. 2 %) had mild chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> and 16 (17. 7 %) had moderate to severe chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> Patients with single biomass exposure were found to have mild chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> except those having mosquito coil exposure.

40|$|BACKGROUND: oropharyngeal {{dysphagia}} {{in patients}} with chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> PURPOSE: patients with Chronic Obstructive <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Disease</b> (COPD) can be vulnerable to respiratory incompetence {{that may lead to}} swallowing impairment. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the relationship between Chronic Obstructive <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Disease</b> and oropharyngeal dysphagia. Forty-seven articles were retrieved relating to Chronic Obstructive <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Disease</b> and dysphagia. Each article was graded using evidence-based methodology. Only 7 articles out of the 47 addressed oropharyngeal swallowing disorders {{in patients with}} Chronic Obstructive <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Disease.</b> This review found few studies that documented the relationship between oropharyngeal swallowing disorders and Chronic Obstructive <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Disease.</b> There were no randomized control trials. CONCLUSION: although the evidence is not strong, it appears that patients with Chronic Obstructive <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Disease</b> are prone to oropharyngeal dysphagia during exacerbations. Future studies are needed to document the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in homogeneous groups of patients with Chronic Obstructive <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Disease,</b> and to assess the relationship between respiration and swallowing using simultaneous measures of swallowing biomechanics and respiratory function.

Chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> now affects both men and women almost equally. Despite this, there remains an outdated perception of chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> as a male-dominated disease. Primary care physicians {{play a central role in}} overseeing the multidisciplinary care of women with chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> Many women with chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> delay seeking medical assistance, due to fear of stigmatization or dismissing symptoms as a 'smoker's cough'.

There has been no study on the {{adherence to}} GOLD guidelines for COPD treatment in Turkey. Objectives: To investigate the rates of adherence to GOLD 2010 guidelines for COPD treatment among pulmonologists. Design: A multi-center, cross-sectional, observational study {{was carried out in}} eleven pulmonary outpatient clinics across Turkey. Adherence to GOLD was evaluated through hospital records. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Results: Study included 719 patients (mean age: 62. 9 ± 9. 7 years; males 85. 4 %) of whom 16 was classified as GOLD Stage I, 238 as II, 346 as III, and 119 as IV, and only 59. 5 % received appropriate treatment. Rates of guideline adherence varied across GOLD stages (I, 6. 3 %; II,  14. 7 %;  III,  84. 4 %; and IV, 84 %). Causes of inappropriate therapies were overtreatment (Stage I, 100 % and Stage II, 91. 1 %), undertreatment (Stage III, 3. 3 % and Stage IV, 10. 9 %) and lack of treatment (Stage II, 3. 8 %; Stage III, 2. 3 %; and Stage IV, 5. 9 %). The most preferred regimen (43. 4 %) was long-acting β 2 -agonist-inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting muscarinic antagonist. Overall, 614 patients (89 %) received treatment containing inhaled corticosteroid. Conclusion: Pulmonologists in Turkey have low rates of adherence to GOLD guidelines in COPD treatment.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of abnormalities of pulmonary function among 156 relatives of 61 {{patients with chronic}} obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> {{was found to be}} significantly higher than the prevalence in a control group of their spouses. No relationship of this increased familial prevalence to alpharantitrypsin deficiency could be demonstrated. This provides further evidence that at least some chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> may be genetically determined and that this may be independent of alpha^antitrypsin deficiency. Heredity and smoking probably contribute about equally to the likelihood of developing chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> SEVERAL reports of families with a multiple occur-rence of chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> have appeared in the medical literature (1 - 5). Such familial prevalence raises the question of a genetic cause. It is difficult to assess the significance of multiple cases in isolated families in view of the frequent occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmo-nary disease in the general population. One survey of family histories taken from chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> patients showed a significantly higher {{prevalence of}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> when com-pared with a control group (4). Such a survey may contain an inherent bias due to an increased aware-ness of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> among other family members when the person being interviewed has the disease. In addition, more recent reports have emphasized the association among a marked deficiency of a serum glycoprotein, alphai-antitrypsin, and chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> (6 - 14). Since this protein deficiency is genetically determined, it has raised the question as to whether most familial emphysema can be accounted for by alphai-antitryp-sin deficiency.

40|$|Introduction: Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is {{responsible}} for {{a large portion of}} non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections worldwide. Host factors such as active malignancy, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> (COPD) and bronchiectasis increase the risk of MAC infection. However, the relationship between previously treated lung cancer with subsequent development of MAC <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> and treatment outcomes have not been previously studied. Methods: We retrospectively identified all patients with lung cancer and MAC <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> documented in medical records at Mayo Clinic between January 2005 and October 2016. Patients who were diagnosed with MAC <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> before or at the time of lung cancer diagnosis were excluded. Patients meeting all inclusion criteria underwent chart review for prior oncologic treatments, clinical characteristics, and MAC treatment response. Results: We identified 13 patients with MAC <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> and prior lung cancer, including 4 men and 9 women. Eight patients had structural lung disease that can predispose to MAC <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease,</b> including bronchiectasis (23. 0 %) and COPD (46. 2 %). Four (30. 8 %) had no apparent immunosuppression or other risk factor(s) for MAC <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> Primary <b>pulmonary</b> malignancies included pulmonary carcinoid, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Ten (76. 9 %) patients were started on antimicrobial treatment for MAC, and 8 (61. 5 %) patients completed MAC treatment with 6 (46. 1 %) patients achieving symptomatic improvement. Conclusion: MAC <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> in previously treated lung cancer can occur without apparent risk factors for this NTM infection. Symptomatic improvement with MAC antimicrobial therapy appears to be lower than expected but comorbidities might influence outcomes in this patient population...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PMT) is {{the primary}} cardiac consequence of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> It develops as alveolar hypoxia of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease,</b> coupled with vasoactive and mitogenic substances released from pulmonary endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells damaged by the primary disease process, mediates arterial vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling to raise pulmonary vascular resistance. Independent of the underlying <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease,</b> PHT produces clinical signs of respiratory distress, exercise intolerance, syncope, and right heart failure. Diagnosis of PHT is made by estimation of pulmonary artery pressures by means of continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographic assessment of tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitant flow velocity. Treatment of PHT is directed at the underlying <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> but may also aim to attenuate pulmonary artery pressure and limit the clinical sequelae of PHT. No treatments are of proven benefit in veterinary patients; irrespective {{of the nature of}} the inciting <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease,</b> the prognosis is often grave...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Depression necessitating {{assistance}} from health professionals has a lifetime prevalence of 10 %. Chronic disease increases comorbidity with mood and/or anxiety disorders. Patients with chronic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> present with severely impaired functionality, chronic somatic and psychogenic pain, require frequent hospitalizations {{and have a}} dependency upon medical and nursing personnel. In the present study we assessed anxiety and depression in patients hospitalized for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> in a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> hospital. Methods We assessed anxiety, using the Spielberger state-trait anxiety scale, and depression, using the Beck Depression Inventory, in 132 patients with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> Results A total of 49. 2 % of the sample had moderate or severe depression and 26. 5 % had anxiety. Women had higher depression and anxiety scores than men (t test, p Conclusion Depression and anxiety are very prevalent in patients with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease,</b> especially chronic disease. This may {{be a very important}} negative factor in patients' adaptation to the chronic course of their disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background. Chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> is a {{widespread}} pathology, {{and the problem of}} its diagnostics is still of current interest. Objective. To determine the principles of lectin receptors expression and distribution in patients with chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> during remission and exacerbation. Methods. For lectinhistochemical investigations biopsy material from 54 patients with chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> was used. All patients were subdivided into 2 groups: 25 at remission phase, 29 – at exacerbation. Direct lectinhistochemical method was used. Results. Wheat germ lectin (WGA) increases its affinity for squamous metaplasia; elderberry lectin and Snail lectin are reduced by epithelial cells while maintaining the reaction in areas of proliferation of bronchial epithelium in acute chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> Konkanavalin A lectin in most cases had weakly positive reaction on luminal surface of epithelial cells during remission of chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> Conclusion. The presence of wheat germ lectin and konkanavalin A in epitheliocytes of segmental bronchi reveals the formation of a chronic inflammation...|$|R
