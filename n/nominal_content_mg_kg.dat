40|$|Lichen species (Hypogymnia physodes and Evernia prunastri) {{were used}} for {{biomonitoring}} of atmospheric pollution with heavy metals in copper mine vicinity, {{in the eastern part}} of the Republic of Macedonia. The contents of 18 elements were analyzed by atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-AES) and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). For data processing basic statistical methods and multivariate exploratory (factor and cluster analysis) techniques were applied. Three geogenic and one anthropogenic group of elements were singled out from factor analysis, Copper and lead were associated as anthropogenic factor. The same associations of elements were confirmed with cluster analysis. Maps of spatial distribution of elements from anthropogenic group showed increase content for the anthropogenic elements only in close vicinity of mine. The maximum values for Cu <b>content</b> (130 <b>mg</b> <b>kg,</b> 1) and Pb <b>content</b> (120 <b>mg</b> <b>kg,</b> 1) were obtained. The study showed that long distance distribution of these elements was not established. The collected lichens species showed high retention power for accumulation of anthropogenic group of elements compared to moss species sampled from the same study area (r= 0. 86 and r= 0. 68).

Although some edaphic parameters (e. g. soil acidity) have also been suggested as determinants in the spatial distribution of alpine vegetation, there is little background on the importance of soil chemical properties in altitudinal gradients, particularly in the high Andes. The present study determined whether soil chemical properties affect spatial distribution and abundance of alpine plants in an altitudinal gradient in the Andes of central Chile, emphasizing metal content. A direct gradient analysis took place at Yerba Loca Natural Sanctuary (YLNS), based on a geobotanical sampling conducted in 73 sites distributed from 1970 to 3330 m a. s. l. According to a Canonical Correspondence Analysis, the main soil chemical factors that explain the pattern of compositional variation of high Andean vegetation are, besides altitude, total soil copper (Cu) content, percentage of soil organic matter, and available phosphorus and nitrogen. An analysis of shoot Cu content conducted in 19 plant species found in sites with highest soil Cu <b>contents</b> (. 250 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 21) showed high levels of Cu in their shoots (. 100 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> 21).

These effects can be related to the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist behavior of Dextromethorphan and GABA-receptor agonist property of midazolam...|$|R
40|$|Background: Since 1988 anaesthesiologist {{have proved}} that {{induction}} dose of propofol {{is sufficient to}} intubate patient without muscle relaxants. Propofol is unique in having property to suppress airway reflexes {{better than any other}} agent. Therefore study was undertaken to evaluate clinically acceptable intubating conditions with different doses of propofol without muscle relaxants. Patients and Methods: 90 ASA grade I and II patients posted for elective surgery requiring general anesthesia divided randomly into group I (propofol 2 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1); group II (2. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1); groupIII (3 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1). Premedication with inj. Glycopyrollate, inj. Ranitidine, Inj. Ondensetron; inj. Midazolam and inj. fentanyl was done. After waiting for 5 minutes, induction dose of propofol was given followed by inj. lignocaine 90 seconds prior to intubation. Intubating conditions were assessed and hemodynamic changes were recorded at various levels. Results: Ideal intubating conditions were obtained in 96. 7 %of patients in group II (2. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 propofol) and 100 % in group III (3 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 propofol).

Subsequently an analysis {{was carried out}} (after 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of storage) of the finished meat products stored {{over the course of}} their intended shelf life at ambient temperature of 4 °C. Determination of phthalates was conducted by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with UV detection at a wavelength of 224 nm on the Zorbax Eclipse C 8 column. The content of phthalates in the final product was below the limit of quantification. According to the Regulation of the Commission (EU) No. 10 / 2011, the specific migration limit of products intended for food contact is 1. 5 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 of food simulant for DEHP and  0. 3 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 for DBP. After filling and the first day of storage of the meat product, four package samples release the said phthalates to an extent that it exceeded the limits of the Commission Regulation (EU) No. 10 / 2011. Already after the seventh day of storage, all samples (with the exception of sample 2 for DBP) exceeded SMLs.

40|$|Abstract Background The study aims to {{determine}} the nutritional value of hemp seed expressed by the oil content and by the concentration of metals (Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cd), for five varieties of monoecious and dioecious hemp seeds approved in Romania, comparative with the concentration of these metals in the soil. Results The content of oil in hempseed registers a slight decrease in the production records of 2011, losses due to drought {{and low levels of}} precipitation during the growth period. The greatest loss is found in Diana monoecious variety (26. 54 - 20. 82 %) followed by Zenit varieties (27. 37 - 22. 97 %), Armanca (29. 27 - 25. 32 %), Silvana (28. 89 - 25. 04 %) and Denise (26. 96 - 25. 30 %). Siccative hemp oil has a yellowish green color and an iodine index of 140 – 156 g I 2 / 100 g oil. Hemp seed are rich in mineral based Ca (144 – 955 mg/ 100 g seed), Mg (237 – 694 mg/ 100 g seed), K (463 – 2821 mg/ 100 g seed), Fe (1133 - 2400 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1), Mn (63 – 110 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) and Zn (42 - 94 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1). For the soil the following macroelements concentrations were determined: Ca (2100 – 2520 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1), <b>Mg</b> (320 – 376 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) and K (232 – 257 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1). Mn (156 – 197 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) and Zn (54 – 67 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) remain within normal limits for Romania. The soils in the experience area contain large amounts of Fe (19000 – 20430 <b>mg.</b> <b>kg</b> - 1). The presence of K in large quantities determines the accumulation of large quantities of Fe in the soil. Conclusion Hempseed belonging to the five Romanian varieties are rich source of nutrients (Ca, Mg, K) and unsaturated oil easily digestible by the body, but the presence of Cd concentrations above the upper limit puts a question mark over the use of seeds in various food products. Hemp extracts easily certain metals from the soil.

The protective and ameliorative effects of diphenhydramine on the signs of dichlorvos poisoning were examined and compared with those of atropine. Plasma and whole brain cholinesterase activities of chicks treated with diphen¬hydramine and/or dichlorvos were measured by an electrometric method. Results: Diphenhydramine at 10 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, intramuscularly (i. m.) im¬mediately after oral dosing with dichlorvos increased the oral LD 50 value of the insecticide from 6. 49 to 17. 14 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, whereas atropine at 2 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, i. m. increased it to 22. 55 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1. The oral dosing of dichlorvos at 8 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 caused acute signs of cholinergic poisoning in the chicks. The best effective dosage of diphenhydramine was at 10 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, i. m. immediately after the oral dichlorvos dosing, which significantly in¬creased the latencies to onset of signs of poisoning and significantly prevented the 2 h and 24 h lethalities. Diphenhydramine also significant¬ly decreased the occurrence of signs of poisoning and reduced total toxicity score in the chicks. Diphenhydramine, similar to atropine, given at times of - 15, 0 and + 5 min relative to the time of dichlorvos dosing also ameliorated dichlorvos-induced poisoning in the chicks to vary¬ing extents.
