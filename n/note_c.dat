25|$|In {{the key of}} C major {{the first}} degree of the scale, called the tonic, is the <b>note</b> <b>C</b> itself, so a C major chord, a triad built on the <b>note</b> <b>C,</b> may be called the one chord of that key and notated in Roman numerals as I. The same C major chord {{can be found in}} other scales: it forms chord III in the key of A minor (A–B–C) and chord IV in the key of G major (G–A–B–C). This {{numbering}} lets us see the job a chord is doing in the current key and tonality.|$|E
25|$|The C–C–G–C–E–G tuning uses {{some of the}} {{harmonic}} sequence (overtones) of the <b>note</b> <b>C.</b> When an open-note C-string is struck, its harmonic sequence begins with the notes C, C, G, C, E, G, B, C. This overtone-series tuning was modified by Mick Ralphs, who used a high C rather than the high G for “Can’t Get Enough” on Bad Company. Ralphs said, “It needs the open C to have that ring,” and “it never really sounds right in standard tuning”. Ralphs wrote these songs in the key of G on a guitar in Open-G tuning.|$|E

25|$|None {{of these}} parts, {{except for the}} root, {{directly}} refer to the notes forming the chord, but to the intervals they form {{with respect to the}} root. For instance, Caug7 is formed by the notes C–E–G–B. However, its name and symbol refer only to the root <b>note</b> <b>C,</b> the augmented (fifth) interval from C to G, and the (minor) seventh interval from C to B. The interval from C to E (a major third) is inferred, as an augmented triad is inherently major.). A set of decoding rules is applied to deduce the missing information.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequently}} encountered chords are triads, so called because they consist of three distinct notes: further notes may {{be added to}} give seventh chords, extended chords, or added tone chords. The most common chords are the major and minor triads and then the augmented and diminished triads. The descriptions major, minor, augmented, and diminished are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal quality. Chords are also commonly classed by their root note—so, for instance, the chord C major may {{be described as a}} triad of major quality built on the <b>note</b> <b>C.</b> Chords may also be classified by inversion, the order in which the notes are stacked.|$|E
25|$|Triads {{consist of}} three notes; the root or first note, the third, and the fifth. For example, the C major scale {{consists}} of the notes C D E F G A B: a triad can be constructed on any note of such a major scale, and all are minor or major except the triad on the seventh or leading-tone, which is a diminished chord. A triad formed using the <b>note</b> <b>C</b> itself consists of C (the root note), E (the third note of the scale) and G (the fifth note of the scale). The interval from C to E is of four semitones, a major third, and so this triad is called C Major. A triad formed upon the same scale but with D as the root note, D (root), F (third), A (fifth), on the other hand, has only three semitones between the root and third and is called D minor, a minor triad.|$|E

500|$|Major-thirds tuning {{facilitates}} playing chords with closed voicings. In contrast, standard tuning {{would require}} more hand-stretching to play closed-voice seventh chords, and so standard tuning uses open voicings for many four-note chords, for example of dominantseventh chords. By definition, a dominant seventh is a four-note chord combining a major chord and a minor seventh. For example, the C7 seventh chord combines the C-major chord {C,E,G} with B. In standard tuning, extending the root-bass C-major chord (C,E,G) to a C7 chord (C,E,G,B) would span six frets (3–8); such seventh chords [...] "contain some pretty serious stretches {{in the left}} hand". An illustration shows this C7 voicing (C,E,G,B), which would be extremely difficult to play in standard tuning, besides the openly voiced C7-chord that is conventional in standard tuning: This open-position C7 chord is termed a second-inversion C7 drop2 chord (C,G,B,E), because the second-highest <b>note</b> (<b>C)</b> in the second-inversion C7 chord (G,B,C,E) is lowered by an octave.|$|E

2500|$|As the [...] "Notes" [...] {{section of}} the music braille chart above {{indicate}}s, a single symbol shows both the pitch and rhythmic length of a note. [...] For instance, dots 1,4,5 indicate an eighth note (or 128th <b>note)</b> <b>C.</b> Every rhythm symbol in braille music does double duty—8th notes and 128th notes use the same symbols, as do quarter notes and 64th notes, half notes and 32nd notes, and whole notes and 16th notes. [...] Beginners first learn the most common rhythmic value (8th, quarter, half, and whole notes). [...] For advanced users there is never rhythmic ambiguity because the context, including time signature and bar lines, makes the intended rhythmic value clear. [...] For instance, in a measure of 4/4 time that includes only the symbol with dots 1,3,4 (whole or 16th rest), context says the symbol must indicate a whole rest.|$|E

With the help of only two notes (D and B) the major triad changes into the Phrygian mode that is very typical for the flamenco, whereas the tremolo-like ornamentation of the leading D supports this effect. Then the line descending to G (motif c) establishes the key for the further improvisations. This key is called maqam Hijaz Kar Kurd and has the following (simplified) structure: ...|$|E
2500|$|Physically and functionally, the {{auditory}} system of an absolute listener {{does not appear}} to be different from a non-absolute listener. Rather, [...] "it reflects a particular ability to analyze frequency information, presumably involving high-level cortical processing." [...] Absolute pitch is an act of cognition, needing memory of the frequency, a label for the frequency (such as [...] "B-flat"), and exposure to the range of sound encompassed by that categorical label. Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing colors, phonemes (speech sounds) or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli. Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color blue by the frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that is perceived as light, it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify, for example, the <b>note</b> <b>C.</b> Absolute pitch may also be related to certain genes, possibly an autosomal dominant genetic trait, though it [...] "might be nothing more than a general human capacity whose expression is strongly biased by the level and type of exposure to music that people experience in a given culture." ...|$|E
