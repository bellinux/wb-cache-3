30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 6, the three filters {{based on the}} NLM filter {{performed}} well on images with low noise variance (σ = 10). The differences in performance of these filters are difficult to distinguish in the restored images for low <b>noise,</b> but <b>inspection</b> of images with high noise in Figure 7 showed that the denoising effects of the NPCA-NLM filter and PCA-NLM filter were almost identical, except for slight blurring of the output from the PCA-NLM filter. However, the impact of noise on the standard NLM filter was clearly visible, and the restored images contained considerable noise spots.|$|R

Traditional concepts to estimate the penetration depth basing on plane wave propagation into a conducting halfspace cannot describe the real depth of inspection achievable by state-of-the-art sensors and instruments. The paper presents a more fruitful concept for estimating the <b>noise</b> limited <b>inspection</b> depth. Here, the traditional parameters like frequency, probe dimensions, conductivity and permeability are analysed in combination with all sources of noise and disturbances in eddy current technique. New low frequency eddy current probes of inductive and magneto-resistive type are presented and characterised. These probes combine deep penetration with comparatively small size and good spatial resolution. 1...|$|R
30|$|In this study, a {{modified}} LBP with OTSU method {{has been proposed}} for better identification of texture in ultrasound images of liver in which uncertainty is introduced by inherent <b>noise.</b> The proposed <b>inspection</b> technique was evaluated on a real dataset of 44 templates of 44 cirrhotic liver and 6 templates of 6 normal liver ultrasound images. The promising results achieved in detecting cirrhotic liver. SVM classifier has given the accuracy of 95.45  % for cirrhotic liver and 100  % for normal liver. Similarly, KNN has given the accuracy of 97.72  % for cirrhotic liver and 83.3  % for normal liver. The sensitivity is 97.2  % and specificity is 83.3  %. In the future study; the performance of this technique can be investigated on ultrasound images to classify different stages of cirrhotic liver.|$|R
40|$|An {{image is}} never <b>noise</b> free. Visual <b>inspection</b> {{of a part}} from its image is {{therefore}} affected by image errors. Understanding how image errors affect measurement precision is therefore critical for accurate inspection. Existing visual inspection methods either setup a highly controlled environment to minimize image errors or simply ignore image errors. They therefore suffer from limited accuracy and lack of robustness. In this paper, we lay out a statistical framework that allows to explicitly handle image errors and characterize their impact on measurement precision. A hierarchical model is also proposed to model manufacturing and measurement errors. Based on the model, a Bayesian technique is introduced to statistically infer the geometric tolerances of a manufactured part. 1. Introduction Geometric tolerancing of machined parts requires first constructing tolerance zones from the data points and then inferring the geometric tolerances from the constructed tolerance zones. Since an [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the evaluation of safety measures inside three electrical thermal power plants in Sudan. It also presents valuable information about areas of power plants, at which safety is strengthened, and areas of weakness and where, more corrective safety actions are required to enhance safety. The paper also has focused on the occupational health of employees inside power plants and, how can power plants employees, be trained to be ever safety cautious. The tools used in study included: questionnaires, field <b>Inspection,</b> <b>noise</b> level measurement and interviews with key employees in these plants. The evaluation results indicated that the overall safety performance index – which is estimated to be 0. 56 –is below the recommended safety index, and that safety inside thermal power plants in Sudan is an issue of a great concern. This requires the attention and direct intervention of higher authorities to tak...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of evaluation of safety measures inside electrical thermal power plants in Sudan. Safety in power plants is categorized in two types. One type is related to safety outside power plants, specifically pollution resulting from burning fossil fuels, while the other type is related to safety inside power plants, specifically safety of employees and the power plant itself. The current study is concerned with second category. The tools used in study included: questionnaires, field <b>Inspection,</b> <b>noise</b> level measurement and interviews with key employees in these plants. The evaluation results indicated that the overall safety performance index – which is estimated to be 0. 56 – is below the recommended safety index, and that safety inside thermal power plants in Sudan is an issue of a great concern, and requires the attention and direct intervention of higher authorities to take further corrective actions to rectify the current situation...|$|R
40|$|Sigma {{phase is}} a {{deleterious}} one {{which can be}} formed in duplex stainless steels during heat treatment or welding. Aiming to accompany this transformation, ferrite and sigma percentage and hardness were measured on samples of a UNS S 31803 duplex stainless steel submitted to heat treatment. These results were compared to measurements obtained from ultrasound and eddy current techniques, i. e., velocity and impedance, respectively. Additionally, backscattered signals produced by wave propagation were acquired during ultrasonic inspection as well as magnetic Barkhausen <b>noise</b> during magnetic <b>inspection.</b> Both signal types were processed via a combination of detrended-fluctuation analysis (DFA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The techniques used were proven {{to be sensitive to}} changes in samples related to sigma phase formation due to heat treatment. Furthermore, there is an advantage using these methods since they are nondestructive. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. FUNCAPCNPqCAPESUF...|$|R
40|$|Visual Computing Systems (VCS) and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have teamed, {{through a}} Phase 1 Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) {{grant from the}} US Department of Energy (DOE), to develop an advanced, {{low-cost}} motor/alternator drive system suitable for Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) applications. During Phase 1, system performance and design requirements were established, design concepts were generated, and preliminary motor/alternator designs were developed and analyzed. ORNL provided mechanical design and finite element collaboration and Lynx Motion Technology, a spin-off from VCS to commercialize their technology, constructed a proof-of-concept axial-gap permanent magnet motor/alternator that employed their Segmented Electromagnetic Array (SEMA) with a survivable design speed potential of 10, 000 rpm. The VCS motor/alternator was successfully tested in ORNL`s Motor Test Tank using an ORNL inverter and ORNL control electronics. It was first operated as an unloaded motor to 6, 000 rpm and driven as an unloaded generator to 6, 000 rpm. Output from the generator was then connected to a resistance bank, which caused the loaded generator to decelerate to 3, 860 rpm where data was collected. After about 4 - 1 / 2 minutes, the test was terminated because of an impact <b>noise.</b> Subsequent <b>inspection</b> and operation at low speeds did not reveal {{the source of the}} noise. Electrical performance of the motor was excellent, encouraging continued development of this technology. Phase 2 efforts will focus on further design development and optimization, manufacturing development and prototype construction, testing, and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether auditory, speech perception and phonological skills are tightly interrelated or independently contributing to reading. We assessed {{each of these}} three skills in 36 adults with a past diagnosis of dyslexia and 54 matched normal reading adults. Phonological skills were tested by the typical threefold tasks, i. e. rapid automatic naming, verbal short term memory and phonological awareness. Dynamic auditory processing skills were assessed by means of a frequency modulation (FM) and an amplitude rise time (RT); an intensity discrimination task (ID) was included as a non-dynamic control task. Speech perception was assessed by means of sentences and words in noise tasks. Group analysis revealed significant group differences in auditory tasks (i. e. RT and ID) and in phonological processing measures, yet no differences were found for speech perception. In addition, performance on RT discrimination correlated with reading but this relation was mediated by phonological processing and not by speech in <b>noise.</b> Finally, <b>inspection</b> of the individual scores revealed that the dyslexic readers showed an increased proportion of deviant subjects on the slow-dynamic auditory and phonological tasks, yet each individual dyslexic reader does not display a clear pattern of deficiencies across the levels of processing skills. Although our results support phonological and slow-rate dynamic auditory deficits which relate to literacy, they suggest that at the individual level, problems in reading and writing cannot be explained by the cascading auditory theory. Instead, dyslexic adults seem to vary considerably in the extent to which each of the auditory and phonological factors are expressed and interact with environmental and higher-order cognitive influences...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic echoes {{from small}} or subtle defects in metals may be masked by {{competing}} “noise” echoes which {{arise from the}} scattering of sound by grains or other microstructural elements. Algorithms for estimating the detectability of such defects consequently require quantitative models for microstructural noise. In previous work [1, 2] we introduced an approximate noise model for normal-incidence immersion inspections using tone-burst pulses, and we used the model to estimate signal/noise ratios for brittle (hard-alpha) inclusions in titanium alloys. In the present work we consider an extension of that <b>noise</b> model to <b>inspections</b> using broadband incident pulses. Like its predecessor, the broadband noise model neglects multiple scattering events, and applies to low-noise, low-attenuation materials. The broadband model provides an expression for the root-mean-square (rms) average amplitude of a given spectral component of the noise, computed on a finite time interval greater than {{the duration of the}} pulse. The model can be used to analyze backscattered noise to extract a Figure-of-Merit (FOM) for noise severity which is a property of the specimen and is independent of the measurement system. Conversely, if the FOM of the specimen is known, the model can be used to predict average noise spectral characteristics and average noise levels for various inspection scenarios...|$|R
40|$|RASAT is {{the second}} Turkish Earth Observation {{satellite}} which was launched in 2011. It operates with pushbroom principle and acquires panchromatic and MS images with 7. 5 m and 15 m resolutions, respectively. The swath width of the sensor is 30 km. The main {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the radiometric and geometric quality of RASAT images. A systematic validation approach for the RASAT imagery and its products is being applied. RASAT image pair acquired over Kesan city in Edirne province of Turkey are used for the investigations. The raw RASAT data (L 0) are processed by Turkish Space Agency (TUBITAK-UZAY) to produce higher level image products. The image products include radiometrically processed (L 1), georeferenced (L 2) and orthorectified (L 3) data, as well as pansharpened images. The image quality assessments include visual <b>inspections,</b> <b>noise,</b> MTF and histogram analyses. The geometric accuracy assessment results are only preliminary and the assessment is performed using the raw images. The geometric accuracy potential is investigated using 3 D ground control points extracted from road intersections, which were measured manually in stereo from aerial images with 20 cm resolution and accuracy. The initial results of the study, which were performed using one RASAT panchromatic image pair, are presented in this paper...|$|R
