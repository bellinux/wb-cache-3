This could be seen as a {{discouraging}} result, because a game need not have efficient equilibria; e.g., a ballot could result in an alternative <b>nobody</b> <b>really</b> wanted in the first place, yet everybody voted for.|$|E
25|$|When Bond flies the new Gilbert XF-120 fighter, {{he finds}} {{dangerous}} structural problems that threaten its imminent acceptance by the Air Force. However, <b>nobody</b> <b>really</b> believes {{his claim that}} he did not subject the fighter prototype to stresses beyond its design specifications, especially H. G. Gilbert (Ralph Moody), the head of the company that built the fighter. When the general tries to replicate Bond's maneuvers, nothing untoward happens. Afterward, Bond sees Banner nearly collapse in the locker room, but Banner shrugs off the incident.|$|E

25|$|The {{sandwich}} {{is named}} after The Great Gatsby, a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. <b>Nobody</b> <b>really</b> knows when or how the concept came about (even though many falsely laid {{claim to be the}} originators because of its popularity) except that it originated in various factories in and around in the 70s. It is believed that the workers from factories in and around Cape Town would share lunches and thus created sandwiches from whatever they had for lunch that day. As the French loaf allowed for extra filling space, they would prefer to use these over traditional bread slices that way it could also be easier shared amongst co-workers. A Gatsby is thus better enjoyed when shared and best served in its largest form.|$|E
25|$|In South America, Argentina was {{the first}} country to produce it, with Marisol Otero as Belle, Juan Rodó as Beast, Diego Jaraz as Gaston, Gustavo Monje as LeFou, Pablo Lizaso as Lumière, Mónica Nuñez as Mrs. Potts, Omar Pini as Cogsworth, Alejandra Radano as Babette and Rodolfo Valss as Maurice. It ran from November 26, 1998, at the Teatro Ópera in Buenos Aires until August 15, 1999, before opening again in 2010. Brazil was the second country to host the musical. Disney had plans {{to bring it to}} the country in 1999, after the success in Argentina, but <b>nobody</b> <b>really</b> knew if it would work. Three years later, in 2002, Beauty and the Beast finally opened in Brazil at Teatro Abril, one of the biggest theaters in the country. It was a huge hit, for more than one and a half years, it was {{presented}} with Kiara Sasso playing Belle and Saulo Vasconcelos playing the Beast. In 2009, a new Belle and a new Beast were cast, Lissah Martins and Ricardo Vieira, as the musical came back to Brazil, Kiara Sasso was playing Maria in The Sound of Music. Beauty and the Beast remained for six months at Teatro Abril. Even though the play was brought back as a way to try to recoup some of the money lost in Brazil's version of Miss Saigon, this second incarnation of Beauty and the Beast failed to create any critical buzz, or to be a box office success.|$|E

In 31 games with Oklahoma, he hit [...]333 with 37 hits, 10 home runs, and 31 RBI.

500|$|Anton Chekhov in {{his plays}} The Seagull, Uncle Vanya and Three Sisters {{describes}} the tortured emotional states of doctors who {{at some point}} in their careers have turned their back on conscience. In his short stories, Chekhov also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in The Fit describes it as a [...] "dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair... in his breast, under the heart" [...] and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in From a Case Book calls it an [...] "unknown, mysterious power... in fact close at hand and watching him." [...] Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to Sakhalin to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: [...] "Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of Sakhalin, the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot help but wonder why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because <b>nobody</b> <b>really</b> knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that they stood in greater need of help that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters. Russian literature has always focused on questions of conscience and was, therefore, a powerful force in the moulding of public opinion." ...|$|E
