"Yes, {{she was an}} {{excellent}} and an ill-used woman," [...] said Mr. Fairscribe, his eye fixed like mine on the picture--"She left our family not less, I dare say, than five thousand pounds, and I believe she died worth four times that sum; but it was divided among the <b>nearest</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin,</b> which was all fair." ...|$|E

60|$|The Trackless simply {{nodded his}} head in assent. After this he {{seemed to me to}} sink back in a sort of {{brooding}} lethargy, as if indisposed to pursue the subject. I left him to go to my uncle, in order to relate what had just passed. Mr. Roger Littlepage was as much astonished as I had been myself, at hearing that one so aged should have detected us through disguises that had deceived our <b>nearest</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin.</b> But the quiet penetration and close observation of the man had long been remarkable. As his good faith was of proof, however, neither felt any serious apprehension of being betrayed, as soon as he had a moment for reflection.|$|E

60|$|Besides {{the acts}} of Indulgence, another and most tyrannical measure, already mentioned, had been {{introduced}} to crush if possible the Presbyterians. Letters of intercommuning were issued against {{a great number of}} the most distinguished Presbyterians, including several ladies of note, by which they were proscribed as rebels and cut off from all society. A price, amounting in some instances to 500 pounbds sterling, was fixed on their heads, and every person, not excepting their <b>nearest</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin,</b> was prohibited from conversing with or writing to them, or of aiding with food, clothes, or any other necessary of life, on pain of being found guilty of the same crimes as the intercommuned persons.|$|E
60|$|The Mpongwe {{have also}} some peculiarities in their notions of justice. If a man murder another, the {{criminal}} is put to death, {{not by the}} <b>nearest</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin,</b> as amongst the Arabs and almost all wild people, but by the whole community; this already shows an advanced appreciation of the act and its bearings. The penalty is either drowning or burning alive: except {{in the case of}} a chief or a very rich man, little or no difference is made between wilful murder, justifiable homicide, and accidental manslaughter- -the reason of this, say their jurists, is to make people more careful. Here, again, we find a sense of the sanctity of life the reverse of barbarous. Cutting and maiming are punished by the fine of a slave.|$|E
6000|$|She {{did think}} of it that night, very long and painfully. The {{arguments}} of her relatives seemed ponderous as opposed to her own inconsequent longing for escape from galling trammels. If she had stood alone, the sentiment that {{she had begun to}} build but was not able to finish, by whomsoever it might have been entertained, would have had few terrors; but that the opinion should be held by her <b>nearest</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin,</b> to cause them pain for life, was a grievous thing. The more she thought of it, the less easy seemed the justification of her desire for obscurity. From regarding it as a high instinct she passed into a humour that gave that desire the appearance of a whim. But could she really set in train events, which, if not abortive, would take her to the altar with Viscount Mountclere? ...|$|E

"Now, {{when did}} you arrive, how did you arrive, what is the last news from Scotland, which of the {{branches}} of the Drummonds do you belong to, and how <b>near</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> are you to the marshal?

60|$|Leaving, for {{the present}} at least, to better historians than myself the general subject of the Teutonic immigrations; the conquest of North Gaul by the Franks, of Britain by the Saxons and Angles, of Burgundy by the Burgundians, of Africa by the Vandals, I shall speak rather of those Teutonic tribes which {{actually}} entered and conquered Italy; and first, of course, of the Goths. Especially interesting to us English should their fortunes be, for {{they are said to}} be very <b>near</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> to us; at least to those Jutes who conquered Kent. As Goths, Geats, Getae, Juts, antiquarians find them in early and altogether mythic times, in the Scandinavian peninsula, and the isles and mainland of Denmark.|$|R

[...] That was Pfalz-Neuburg's logic: none of the best, I think, in {{forensic}} genealogy. His tenth point was perhaps rather weak; but he had possession, co-possession, and the nine points good. The other Two Sisters, by their Sons or Husbands, claimed likewise; but not the whole: [...] "Divide it," [...] said they: [...] "that surely is the real meaning of Karl V.'s Deed of Privilege {{to make such a}} Testament.

60|$|Deringham {{slightly}} accentuated {{part of the}} sentence, {{and again}} a faint tinge of colour crept {{into the face of}} the girl and vindictiveness into her eyes, for she understood him. The man who had on his deathbed bequeathed Carnaby to his grandson had driven out the young man's father years ago, and approaching dissolution had possibly somewhat clouded his faculties when he made the will. Deringham, who had married into the Alton family, and figured as a legatee, was, {{with the exception of the}} disinherited, the <b>nearest</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin,</b> and it had been generally expected that Carnaby would fall to his daughter; but perhaps in an endeavour to treat both sides fairly, its dying owner had, in the face of his lawyer's protests, inserted one clause which, for financial reasons, rendered a second union between the houses of Alton and Deringham distinctly advisable. There was, however, a high spirit in the girl, and she looked at her father steadily.|$|E
60|$|Among the absurdities {{that have}} been {{circulated}} on this subject of feudality, it has been pretended that the well-known English statute of quia emptores has prohibited fines for alienation; or that the quarter-sales, fifth-sales, sixth-sales, etc., of our own leases were contrary {{to the law of}} the realm, when made. Under the common law, in certain cases of feudal tenures, the fines for alienation were an incident of the tenure. The statute of quia emptores abolished that general principle, but it in no manner forbade parties to enter into covenants of the nature of quarter-sales, did they see fit. The common law gives all the real estate to the eldest son. Our statute divides the real estate among the <b>nearest</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin,</b> without regard even to sex. It might just as well be pretended that the father cannot devise all his lands to his eldest son, under our statute, as to say that the law of Edward I. prevents parties from bargaining for quarter-sales.

5000|$|In the Quran piety {{is defined}} as: 2:177 True piety does not consist in turning your faces towards the east or the west - but truly pious is he who {{believes}} in God, and the Last Day; and the angels, and revelation, and the prophets; and spends his substance - however much he himself may cherish it - upon his <b>near</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin,</b> and the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the beggars, and for the freeing of human beings from bondage; and is constant in prayer, and renders the purifying dues; and pious arethey who keep their promises whenever they promise, and are patient in misfortune and hardship and in time of peril: it is they that have proved themselves true, and it is they, they who are conscious of God.|$|R

The Dogs stand ready on the Banks, and so soon as ever they spye their Enemy, rush all at once into the Water, and engage him.

60|$|The funeral did {{not occur}} until {{the day after the}} arrival of John Wallingford, who accidentally heard of the death that had {{occurred}} in the family, and came uninvited to attend the obsequies, as has been mentioned.

Thus are we constituted!--we will quarrel over a grave even, a moment that should lay open eternity to our view, with all its immense consequences and accompaniments, in order to vindicate feelings and passions that can only interest us, as it might be, for a day. Fortunately I knew nothing of the offence that was taken at the time, nor did I see any of my kinsmen but John Wallingford that evening; his presence in my room being owing altogether to a certain self-possession and an à plomb that caused him to do very much as he pleased in such matters.|$|E
6000|$|The {{result of}} the {{domestic}} policy of David was to bring all accessible territory under {{the social and political}} system of western Europe, [...] "the Feudal System." [...] Its principles had been perfectly familiar to Celtic Scotland, but had rested on a body of traditional customs (as in Homeric Greece), rather than on written laws and charters signed and sealed. Among the Celts the local tribe had been, theoretically, the sole source of property in land. In proportion as they were <b>near</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> to the recognised tribal chief, families held lands by a tenure of three generations; but if they managed to acquire abundance of oxen, which they let out to poorer men for rents in kind and labour, they were apt to turn the lands which they held only temporarily, [...] "in possession," [...] into real permanent property. The poorer tribesmen paid rent in labour or [...] "services," [...] also in supplies of food and manure.|$|R
60|$|WISE. I {{question}} {{not that}} at all, for so Mr. Badman {{used to do}} when any man told him of his faults; he used to think himself wiser than any, and would count, as I have hinted before, {{that he was not}} arrived to a manly spirit that did stick or boggle at any wickedness. But let Mr. Badman and his fellows laugh, I will bar it, and still give them good counsel (Luke 16:13-15). But I will remember also, for my further relief and comfort, that thus they that were covetous of old served the Son of God himself. It is their time to laugh now, that they may mourn in time to come (Luke 6:25). And I say again, when they have laughed out their laugh, he that useth not good conscience to God and charity to his neighbour in buying and selling, dwells next door to an infidel, and is <b>near</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> to Mr. Badman.|$|R
2500|$|According to Sunnis, Fadak {{was a piece}} <b>of</b> land, <b>near</b> Khaiber, where Jews lived. Fadak was conquered by Muhammad.
