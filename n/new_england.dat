5|$|Welsh Quakers, Baptists and Methodists {{settled in}} the Welsh Tract of Pennsylvania. While some Welsh colonists like Roger Williams, left to found Rhode Island, Anne Hutchinson founded a seed {{settlement}} in New York. Rhode Island was not initially counted as part of <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> having been excluded from the <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Confederation, but later joined the Dominion of <b>New</b> <b>England.</b> Thus, {{the definition of the}} Middle Colonies sometimes changed and overlapped with Rhode Island's colonial boundaries. After joining the Dominion of <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> however, Rhode Island was permanently thought of as a <b>New</b> <b>England</b> colony. New York's initial possession of parts of Maine ensured a close relationship with other <b>New</b> <b>England</b> colonies like Vermont and a continuing <b>New</b> <b>England</b> influence in the colony.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Carol {{produced}} hurricane and gale force winds across <b>New</b> <b>England.</b> Strong winds from Hurricane Carol destroyed nearly 40% of the apple, corn, peach, {{and tomato}} crops from eastern Connecticut to Cape Cod. Overall crop damage {{was estimated at}} $22.25million. The hurricane destroyed several thousand homes in <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> {{many of which were}} destroyed from the waters or the powerful winds. Overall, 11,785families were directly impacted by the hurricane, including 9,720houses that were damaged and 1,545that were destroyed. High winds left over 150,000people without power in <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> potentially as many as one-third of all of <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> and many residents also lost phone service. The hurricane also destroyed 3,500cars and 3,000boats in the region. Heavy rainfall from the storm caused traffic accidents, but only minor flooding.|$|E

5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were four}} of the {{thirteen}} colonies in British America, located between the <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Colonies and the Southern Colonies.

5|$|The largest {{change has}} been the {{downgrading}} of the former through route of <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Street in favour of a new north–south road, Fleet Street, which diverges to the west. This has allowed {{a large part of}} <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Street to be narrowed, pedestrianised and provided with cycle lanes. In contrast, Cheapside is expected to take a much higher volume of traffic, as it becomes the main east-west route in the <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Quarter, taking traffic between London Road and Fleet Street, the main north–south road. Two new roads, Stroudley Road and Billinton Road, have been built {{to the west of the}} new Fleet Street, between there and the railway line. These give access to the car park, Bellerbys College and a new pick-up and drop-off point immediately outside the side entrance to the station. Two new pedestrianised squares—Ann Square and <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Square—have also been created within the core site.|$|E
