5|$|Following {{the success}} of A Moment with You, Wong Fu was {{approached}} to create a second film called Sleep Shift. However, the project was abandoned after producers disagreed with casting an Asian male in the film's lead role. Since {{the end of its}} first tour, Wong Fu has created music videos for rising artists and continued producing short films. The group's merchandise line, which included original T-shirt designs, was launched in conjunction with the 2007 film Just a <b>Nice</b> <b>Guy.</b> The short film The Spare was featured at the 2008 San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, and two additional short films—At Musing's End and A Peace of Home—were shown at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival Short Films Corner. In September 2009, Wong Fu released the short film Poser!, a mockumentary {{on the history of the}} peace sign.|$|E

50|$|Glover's {{premise is}} that <b>nice</b> <b>guys</b> have been {{conditioned}} by their childhoods and by society {{to believe that they}} will be successful only if they make everyone happy and never cause any problems for others. However, this desire for approval results in self-loathing. In other words, <b>nice</b> <b>guys</b> want approval, but don't think they deserve it. This creates internal frustration, since <b>nice</b> <b>guys</b> never try to obtain what they want in life. In addition, the <b>nice</b> <b>guy's</b> desire to obtain approval from everyone (especially women), causes him to actually behave in very un-nice ways. This includes dishonesty (about themselves) and passive-aggressive behavior ("being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not following through...").|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence, and filmed in Malibu, California, {{during the week of}} October 29, 2002.

He told me what the song was about, but in a [...] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it". Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. [...] "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a <b>nice</b> <b>guy</b> and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a <b>nice</b> <b>guy</b> does." [...] The music video for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was released onto the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003.|$|E

The film received average reviews, however, A.O. Scott of the New York Times, reported that the performances by both Sarsgaard and Parker [...] "provide a rough grain of authenticity, capturing the blunted affect and aimless neediness of people in their 20s struggling to navigate a world of material abundance and impoverished emotional possibility." [...] Scott concluded in his recap that Sarsgaard made his character [...] "seem like a genuinely <b>nice</b> <b>guy,</b> too innocent to grasp the sleaziness of his bargain with Florence." ...|$|E

500|$|Benson {{followed}} Gardner's {{pattern of}} setting Bond {{in the contemporary}} timeframe of the 1990s and, according to Jeremy Black, had more echoes of Fleming's style than John Gardner, he also changed Bond's gun back to the Walther PPK, put him {{behind the wheel of}} a Jaguar XK8 and made him swear more. James Harker noted that [...] "whilst Fleming's Bond had been an Express reader; Benson's is positively red top. He's the first to have group sex... and the first to visit a prostitute", whilst Black notes an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner. In a 1998 interview Benson described his version of Bond as a more ruthless and darker character, stating that [...] "Bond is not a <b>nice</b> <b>guy.</b> Bond is a killer... He is an anti-hero." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2012, {{as part of}} {{an ongoing}} series of live {{dramatic}} readings of film scripts being staged with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), director Jason Reitman cast black actors in the originally white cast: Laurence Fishburne as Mr. White; Terrence Howard as Mr. Blonde; Anthony Mackie as Mr. Pink; Cuba Gooding Jr. as Mr. Orange; Chi McBride as Joe Cabot; Anthony Anderson as <b>Nice</b> <b>Guy</b> Eddie (Joe Cabot's son); Common as both Mr. Brown and Officer Nash (the torture victim of Mr. Blonde), and Patton Oswalt as Holdaway (the mentor cop who was originally played by a black actor in the film).

500|$|Jackie Chan {{contacted}} Benny Chan {{shortly after}} the release of New Police Story to discuss plans for a new action film. Chan stated {{that he did not want}} to play the typical <b>nice</b> <b>guy</b> role that has been the staple of his previous films. Eventually, Benny Chan and scriptwriter Alan Yuen came up with a daring idea: Chan will play Thongs, a petty criminal who has fallen out with his family over his gambling habit. Benny Chan had originally intended for Jackie to play a full-fledged villain, who [...] "hits women and burns people with cigarettes". However, the script was toned down to appease the Chinese censors, who found the character to be too evil. Nevertheless, for only the third time in his acting career, Chan plays a character who is sentenced to prison.|$|E

When his World War II colleague Bernard Montgomery visited the farm, Eisenhower commented to Montgomery [...] (speaking as military commander to military commander) that he would have fired a subordinate that would initiate Pickett's Charge. Many Southerners saw this as disrespect toward Robert E. Lee, and protested. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev visited the farm in September 1959, and was [...] "grandfathery" [...] to the Eisenhower grandchildren.

500|$|Bandslam was The Washington Post's critic choice, {{having a}} perfect score of 4/4 stars. Bandslam was somehow {{associated}} with High School Musical {{in a couple}} of reviews. However, the reviews concluded the comparisons positively, saying that Bandslam was [...] "actually a lot quirkier than the posters would have you believe." [...] New Jersey's local newspaper, The Star Ledger says that the plot is nicely skewed: [...] "Basically, it's the standard teen picture – girl torn between bad boy and <b>nice</b> <b>guy</b> – with a gender switch." [...] Michael Phillips of The Los Angeles Times praised the film by saying: [...] "Bandslam is a pretty good movie given that the odds of it having been a pretty bad movie were steep." [...] Critic Andy Webster of The New York Times said that Bandslam may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it does offer intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable.|$|E
