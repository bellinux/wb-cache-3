The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main <b>natural</b> <b>organic</b> <b>polymer,</b> cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then washed in water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable parchment paper its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{applied a}} {{combination}} of inorganic mesoporous silica material, frequently used as drug carriers, and a <b>natural</b> <b>organic</b> <b>polymer</b> alginate (ALG), to establish a sustained drug delivery system for the poorly water-soluble drug Indomethacin (IND). Mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSNs) were synthesized using an organic template method and then functionalized with aminopropyl groups through postsynthesis. After drug loading into the pores of aninopropyl functionalized MSNs (AP-MSNs), IND loaded AP-MSNs (IND-AP-MSNs) were encapsulated by ALG through the ionic interaction. The effects of surface chemical groups and ALG layer on IND release were systematically studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption, zeta-potential analysis and TGA analysis. The surface structure and surface charge changes of the ALG encapsulated AP-MSNs (ALG-AP-MSNs) were also investigated. The results showed that sustained release of IND from the designed drug delivery system was mainly due to the blockage effect from the coated ALG. We believe that this combination will help designing oral sustained drug delivery systems for poorly water-soluble drugs...|$|E

The inhibition efficiencies of Kraft lignin (KL) and Soda lignin (SL) on the corrosion of mild steel in 3. 5 % (w/v) sodium chloride at two levels of pH have been evaluated by weight loss method, electrochemical techniques and surface analysis using 50 - 800 ppm (w/v) inhibitor concentration at 25 °C. Both KL and SL can perform as good inhibitors for the above-mentioned system. The KL gave maximum inhibition efficiencies of 95 and 92 % for pH 6 and pH 8, respectively at high concentrations of inhibitor, whereas SL gave 97 and 95 % inhibition efficiencies for pH 6 and pH 8, respectively at 800 ppm of inhibitor concentration. Polarization studies confirmed that KL and SL are mixed type inhibitors. Both KL and SL obey Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm at two levels of pH and 25 °C. FT-IR and surface analyses confirmed that the surface of mild steel was affected by the adsorption of lignin onto the surface to form ferric-lignin compounds.

40|$|Rapid {{industrial}} and commercial expansion {{in recent years}} has created the need for more land. One of the op-tions to create more land is to reclaim ex-mining land. Ex-mining land contains numerous mined out lakes and ponds. Numerous methods are available to fill these lakes and ponds. The ex-mining land consists of a variety of materi-als, such as sand, clay, slime and organic peat. A new land-fill method, which is economically competitive, technologi-cally feasible and will not contribute to any environmental problems, was developed. It is based on flocculation of slurry slime with <b>Natural</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Polymer</b> (NOP) or Poly Vinyl Acetate (PVC), mixed with residual soil and usage of the flocculated slurry slime as part of the fill material. The physical and geotechnical properties of the floccu-lated slurry were assessed by laboratory tests, including pH and Eh measurements, acid neutralization capacity de-termination, hydraulic conductivity and comparison and cost analysis with conventional fill materials, such as sands. The flocculated slurry slime was slightly alkaline, with pH 8. 4, Eh value of 171 mV, negligible ANC, and hy-draulic conductivity of 8 x 10 – 5 - 7 x 10 – 4 m/s. It was also found that the material is unlikely to cause significant change in redox conditions of the subsurface environment over a long-term period. The proposed method is more feasible as compared to other methods in comparison and cost analysis.

40|$|Carboxymethyl {{cellulose}} (CMC) is a polysaccharide {{which is}} widely used in many industrial sectors including food, textiles, paper, adhesives, paints, pharmaceutics, cosmetics and mineral processing. It is a <b>natural</b> <b>organic</b> <b>polymer</b> that is non-toxic and biodegradable. These properties make it ideal for industrial applications. However, {{a general lack of}} understanding of the interaction mechanism between the polysaccharides and solid surfaces has hindered the application of this polymer. In this work, adsorption of CMC at the solid–liquid interface is investigated using adsorption and electrophoretic mobility measurements, FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopy, AFM and molecular modeling. CMC adsorption on talc was found to be affected significantly by changes in solution conditions such as pH and ionic strength, which indicates the important role of electrostatic force in adsorption. The pH effect on adsorption was further proven by AFM imaging. Electrokinetic studies showed that the adsorption of CMC on talc changed its isoelectric point. Further, molecular modeling suggests a helical structure of CMC in solution while it is found to adsorb flat on the solid surface to allow its OH groups to be in contact with the surface. Fluorescence spectroscopy studies conducted to investigate the role of hydrophobic bonding using pyrene probe showed no evidence of the formation of hydrophobic domains at talc–aqueous interface. Urea, a hydrogen bond breaker, markedly reduced the adsorption of CMC on talc, supports hydrogen bonding as an important factor. In FTIR study, the changes to the infrared bands, associated with the C–O stretch coupled to the C–C stretch and O–H deformation, were significant and this further supports the strong hydrogen bonding of CMC to the solid surface. In addition, Langmuir modeling of the adsorption isotherm suggests hydrogen bonding to be a dominant force for polysaccharid...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Colloidal {{materials}} and suspended solids cause turbidity in water. To remove turbidity, clarification method is used that includes processes of coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation. Due {{to the long}} duration of coagulation process, coagulant aids are applied. Despite the favorable efficiency of synthetic polyelectrolytes as a coagulant aid, due to their harmful effects on human health, in this process, <b>natural</b> <b>organic</b> <b>polymers</b> are used instead. Materials and Methods: In this research, the use of tragacanth as a <b>natural</b> <b>organic</b> coagulant aid was studied instead of synthetic polymers in water turbidity removal along with alum and poly aluminum chloride. To compare the experiments with natural conditions, Karun River water was analyzed. To complete these studies, the effects of several factors such as tragacanth concentration, the concentration of alum and poly aluminum chloride, and pH changes in average and low turbidity were investigated. Optimum pH for turbidity removal was determined by jar testing. Results: The {{results showed that the}} best pH to remove turbidity was from 5. 5 to 7, with the efficiency of 97. 3 %. At pH = 6 and at the concentration of 30 mg/L, poly ammonium chloride had maximum efficiency (90 %). Using tragacanth with concentrations of 1 and 4 mg/L along with alum at a concentration of 40 mg/L leads to turbidity removal of 81. 75 %. Conclusion: Using 2 and 4 mg/L of tragacanth, a significant removal efficiency is achieved in low and average turbidity. pH = 7 leads to the most efficient use of tragacanth coagulant aid...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFlocculants {{are widely}} used in {{numerous}} industrial domains (food-processing industry, mineral industries, chemical industries, water purification, wastewater treatment) to im-prove the solid/liquid separation in water-containing fine par-ticles. Thanks to the addition of flocculants, particles gather together and form flocs that improve the materials aggregation and wastewater clarification. At the molecular level, floccu-lants can be mineral <b>polymers</b> or <b>natural</b> <b>organic</b> <b>polymers,</b> but synthetic <b>organic</b> <b>polymers</b> constitute the main flocculants. Generally, they are anionic polyacrylamides produced by polymerisation of acrylamide and the anionic co-monomer, the sodium acrylate. Monomers are only partially eliminated during polyacrylamide preparation and remain {{at the state of}} tracks in the end product. According to Smith et al. (1996), the residual content in monomers varies between 0. 05 and 5 %. Sodium acrylate presents no harmfulness like the polyacryl-amide (Stephens, 1991). However, as the acrylamide is con-sidered as a carcinogenic molecule, mutagen and reprotoxic (Molak, 1991), all polyacrylamides (PAMs) used within the European Union are required to contain less than 0. 1 % (w/w) of residual acrylamide (AMD) (European Parliament 1999) unless they are classified and labelled as a category 2 carcin-ogen (European Parliament 2006). More stringent thresholds are also set depending on additional regulations covering specific uses like, for example, when PAM-based flocculants are used for the treatment of drinking water (no more than 0. 05 % of residual AMD). The potential risks on environment and health are thus linked to the spreading of acrylamide and polyacrylamide degradation products in the natural environment. Two levels of spreading have to be considered: – The water: about 95 % of the polymers adsorb on th...|$|R
30|$|Chemical {{admixtures}} {{are used}} in the production of concrete in order to achieve various durability properties. Khayat (1998) reviewed the use of viscosity-enhancing admixtures such as water soluble synthetic and <b>natural</b> <b>organic</b> <b>polymers.</b> Polymers used as admixtures are said to enhance the joining of the mixing constituents as a result of intertwining polymer film which, according to Chung (2004), produces concrete of better mechanical and durability characteristics. Chemical admixtures are used as high range water reducer admixtures (HRWRA) and have impacted on the rheological and mechanical behaviour of cement-based systems. This allows for a latent time that permits casting of concrete in excellent condition. These chemical admixtures are oil based, non-renewable products such as polynaphthalene sulphonate (PNS), polycarboxylate (PC) and polyacrylate (PA). They contain formaldehyde which when accidentally or intentionally released into the environment may result in undesirable environmental toxic effects (Crépy et al. 2011; Akindahunsi et al. 2013). Recently, interest has been developing in the use of organic admixtures to modify various properties in concrete because they are available in abundance; their preparation is not so sophisticated. They are renewable materials, therefore contributing to sustainable green construction. The use of organic admixtures including starch and its derivatives to modify different properties of cement and concrete has been reported by various authors such as: Luke and Luke (2000); Peschard et al. (2004); Crépy et al. (2011); Akindahunsi et al. (2011), (2012); Lasheras-Zubiate et al. (2012) among others.|$|R
