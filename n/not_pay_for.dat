5|$|Originally {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the structure was built by Walter Chrysler, {{the head of the}} Chrysler Corporation. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The building served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. Although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> its construction and never owned it, as Walter P. Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{having left}} TNA in June 2007, Konnan did not wrestle for AAA until October, and only {{wrestled}} in four matches during {{the remainder of}} the year, due to his aforementioned surgeries. Konnan returned to World Wrestling Council at WWC Euphoria Tour 2008 on January 6, 2008, with Ron Killings of the 3LiveKru, losing a tag team match against Eddy and Orlando Colon. In March 2008, Konnan sued TNA for racism and discrimination, alleging that while the company said that they would help pay for his hip replacement surgery, they did not. Konnan also claimed that TNA helped pay for Scott Steiner's operation, but did <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> Ron Killings's surgery from around the same time.|$|E
5|$|From 1963 to 1965, MRD was not {{directly}} involved in Formula One, and often ran works cars in other formulae. A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the Formula One works entry. Like other customers, BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at £3,000 per car, although it did <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with his distance from the Formula One operation and before the 1966 season suggested {{that he was no}} longer interested in producing cars for Formula One under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category. After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD to Ron Tauranac at the end of 1969, the works Formula One team was MRD.|$|E

5|$|On 18 November 2008, Microsoft {{announced}} plans for a free consumer security product, codenamed Morro. This development marked a change in Microsoft's consumer AV marketing strategy: instead of offering a subscription-based security product {{with a host of}} other tools, such as backup and a personal firewall, Morro would offer free AV protection with a smaller impact on system resources. Amy Barzdukas, senior director of product management for the Online Services and Windows Division at Microsoft, announced that Morro would not directly compete with other commercial AV software; rather it was focused on the 50 to 60 percent of PC users who did not have or would <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> AV protection. By 17 June 2009, the official name of Morro was revealed: Microsoft Security Essentials.|$|E

For the service to Oppdal, NSB had an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million and 21,000 passengers in 1998. The Meråker Line had about {{twice the number of}} passengers. The National Rail Administration stated that if any private companies wanted to operate the routes without subsidies, they were free to do so. As compensation, travelers between Trondheim and Rennebu and Oppdal with month passes were allowed to <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> seat reservations on the intercity services. Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality applied to the ministry to take over responsibility and purchase the commuter train services, so they could continue the service to Oppdal, but this was rejected by the ministry.|$|E

5|$|The Port Authority then {{proposed}} an inter-terminal rail connector at JFK in 1987. The connector, proposed {{as part of}} a $3 billion renovation of the three airports, would originate from a new five-story, $500 million transportation center, connecting all the terminals to that transportation hub. The two-track system would be able to accommodate 2,000 riders an hour and would also connect to another new structure, a $450 million terminal proposed by Pan American World Airways. The connector and transport hub were proposed to alleviate traffic at the airport, since during the previous year, all three airports had experienced an unusually large increase in passenger counts and were now accommodating 1.5 to 2 times their design capacity. This construction was proposed in conjunction with the JFK Expressway, which was already under construction. Architect Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners created a design for the terminal and the proposed people mover system. However, the Port Authority withdrew its plans for the large transport hub in 1990 after opposition from the airlines there, which could <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the costly renovation.|$|E
