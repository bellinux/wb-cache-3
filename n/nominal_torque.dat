40|$|An {{adaptive}} perturbation control {{can track}} a time-based joint trajectory {{as closely as}} possible for all times over a wide range of manipulator motion and payloads. The adaptive control is based on the linearized perturbation equations in the vicinity of a nominal trajectory. The highly coupled nonlinear dynamic equations of a manipulator are expanded in the vicinity of a nominal trajectory to obtain the perturbation equations. The controlled system is characterized by feedforward and feedback components which can be computed separately and simulta neously. Given the joint trajectory set points, the feedforward component computes the corresponding <b>nominal</b> <b>torques</b> from the Newton-Euler equations of motion to compensate for all the interactions between joints. The feedback component, consisting of recursive least square identification and an optimal adaptive self-tuning control algorithm for the linearized system, computes the perturbation torques which reduce the position and veloc ity errors of the manipulator along the nominal trajectory. Because of the parallel structure, computations of the adaptive control may be implemented in low-cost microprocessors. This adaptive control strategy reduces the manipulator control prob lem from a nonlinear control to controlling a linear control system about a desired trajectory. Computer simulation results demonstrated its applicability to a three-joint PUMA robot arm...|$|R
40|$|Design issues, dynamic modeling, {{trajectory}} planning, {{and feedback}} control problems are presented for robot manipulators having components with mechanical flexibility, either concentrated {{at the joints}} or distributed along the links. The chapter is divided accordingly in two main parts. Similarities or {{differences between the two}} types of flexibility are pointed out wherever appropriate. For robots with flexible joints, the dynamic model is derived in detail by following a Lagrangian approach and possible simplified versions are discussed. The problem of computing the <b>nominal</b> <b>torques</b> that produce a desired robot motion is then solved. Regulation and trajectory tracking tasks are addressed by means of linear and nonlinear feedback control designs. For robots with flexible links, relevant factors that lead to the consideration of distributed flexibility are analyzed. Dynamic models are presented, based on the treatment of flexibility through lumped elements, transfer matrices, or assumed modes. Several specific issues are then highlighted, including the selection of sensors, the model order used for control design, and the generation of effective commands that reduce or eliminate residual vibrations in rest-to-rest maneuvers. Feedback control alternatives are finally discussed. In each of the two parts of this chapter, a section is devoted to the illustration of the original references and to further readings on the subject...|$|R

The simulations have been compared to measurements on an open site 12 kW prototype. A parameter study with the model illustrates the impact of shaft torsional spring constant, generator rotor inertia, generator inductance, and dc-link capacitance.

To stabilize the ECB’s torque generation property, this paper introduces the concept of anti-magneto-motive force to develop the ECB model on the fundamental of magnetic circles. In the developed model, the eddy current demagnetization {{and the influence of}} temperature which make the braking torque attenuation are clearly presented. Using the developed model of ECB, the external and internal characteristics of the ECB are simulated through programming by MATLAB.

40|$|This article {{presents}} reference-model-based control {{design for a}} 10 degree-of-freedom bipedal walking robot, using nonlinear gain scheduling. The main goal is to show concentrated mass models {{can be used for}} prediction of the required joint torques for a bipedal walking robot. Relatively complicated architecture, high DOF, and balancing requirements make the control task of these robots difficult. Although linear control techniques can be used to control bipedal robots, nonlinear control is necessary for better performance. The emphasis of this work is to show that the reference model can be a bipedal walking model with concentrated mass at the center of gravity, which removes the problems related to design of a pseudo-inverse system. Another significance of this approach is the reduced calculation requirements due to the simplified procedure of <b>nominal</b> joint <b>torques</b> calculation. Kinematic and dynamic analysis is discussed including results for joint torques and ground force necessary to implement a prescribed walking motion. This analysis is accompanied by a comparison with experimental data. An inverse plant and a tracking error linearization-based controller design approach is described.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a passive magneto-thermo-mechanical {{coupling}} is conceived and developed. The {{system is designed}} to engage and disengage auxiliary devices such as a vacuum pump from an internal combustion engine. The coupling increases the transmissible torque of a magnetorheological (MR) clutch, under particular environmental conditions, i. e. for temperature below 20 °C. At low temperatures the torque requirements become significantly greater than the <b>nominal</b> operating <b>torque,</b> due to the very low viscosity of the oil in the driven device (vacuum pump). The ON–OFF operation of the thermo-mechanical coupling {{is the result of}} two conventional compression springs and two opposing shape memory alloy (SMA) springs. At low temperature the conventional springs keep the coupling engaged, while, if the temperature rises over 90 °C, the SMA springs disengages the coupling. At normal operation temperatures, the SMA coupling is disengaged, allowing for the MR clutch to operate as the primary clutch. The SMA springs were designed considering the particular constitutive properties of the material and the equilibrium of the system. A prototype of the mechanical coupling was manufactured considering the geometry of the MR clutch. The experimental results obtained with the prototype, in terms of relative axial position of the two halves of the coupling, appeared in fairly good agreement with the model...|$|R

We {{present an}} {{experimental}} validation of a recently proposed {{solution to the}} prob-lem of finding the input torque command that provides rest-to-rest motion in a given time for a one-link flexible arm.

40|$|A two-degree-of-freedom {{dynamic model}} is {{constructed}} {{to simulate the}} instantaneous crank kinematics and total mechanical losses arising in a multicylinder gasoline engine coupled to a dynamometer. The simulation model is driven using specified cylinder gas pressures, and loaded by <b>nominal</b> brake <b>torque</b> and total friction losses. Existing semi-empirical torque loss models (based on calibrated single-cylinder diesel engine data) are used {{to account for the}} instantaneous friction losses in the piston-ring assembly, in bearings, and in auxiliaries. The model is specialized to the simulation of crank kinematics and matched brake torque for a three-cylinder in-line direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engine, without a gearbox. This allows the total friction loss to be separated from the brake torque for an engine not fitted with the very large number of sensors otherwise needed to calibrate analytical friction models. An equivalent simulation model is also constructed using GT-Crank, which excludes explicit reference to friction. In using both models to simulate steady state operation at a specified mean engine speed, the output torque is matched by iteration. The GT-Crank model necessarily compensates for internal losses by exaggerating the total output torque. Both simulation models are compared with measured crank kinematics and brake torque obtained from a dynamometer-loaded I 3 DISI engine. The paper shows that by comparing the matched output torque from simulation with the measured output torque from the engine, the proposed model gives a very good high-speed prediction of the total mechanical losses. At low speed, the instantaneous model is still not accurate. It is also shown, however, that apart from the no-load condition, use of an average torque to compensate for friction (as in GT-Crank) is wholly acceptable for simulating instantaneous crank kinematics. This is the first reported instance of a simulation model (which includes the partic...|$|R
40|$|Inferring {{temporal}} derivatives (like {{velocity and}} acceleration) from a noisy position signal {{is a well-known}} challenge in control engineering, due to the intrinsic trade-off between noise filtering and estimation bandwidth. To tackle this problem, {{in this paper we}} propose a new approach specifically designed for periodic movements. This approach uses an adaptive oscillator as fundamental building block. It is a tool capable of synchronizing to a periodic input while learning its features (frequency, amplitude, …) in dedicated state variables. Since the oscillator's input and output are perfectly synchronized during steady-state regime, a non-delayed estimate of the input temporal derivatives can be obtained simply by deriving the output analytical form. Pending a (quasi-) periodic input signal, these temporal derivatives are thus synchronized with the actual kinematics, while the signal bandwidth can be arbitrarily tuned by the intrinsic dynamics of the oscillator. We further validate this approach by developing an impedance-based strategy for assisting human walking in the LOPES lower-limb exoskeleton. Preliminary results with a single participant give rise to three main conclusions. First, our method indeed provides velocity and acceleration estimates of the participant's joint kinematics which are smoother and less delayed with respect to the actual kinematics than using a standard Kalman filter. Second, closing the human-robot loop with a high-gain impedance field depending on the acceleration is not possible with a Kalman filter approach, due to unstable dynamics. In contrast, our approach tolerates high gains (up to 70 % of the <b>nominal</b> walking <b>torque),</b> showing its intrinsic stability. Finally, no clear benefit of the acceleration-dependent field with respect to a simpler position-dependent field is visible regarding the reduction of metabolic cost. This last result illustrates the challenge of designing sound assistive strategies for complex tasks lik- walking...|$|R
40|$|Quietness and reliability, {{together}} with efficiency and lightweight design, are key requirements {{to compete in}} current mechanical industry. Within the latter, gearboxes {{play an important role}} as the usual choice to transmit mechanical power with high energy density, especially when using cylindrical involute gears. Noise and vibration performance are strongly influenced by tooth microgeometry modifications. Typical modifications are applied along the profile and the lead of the teeth. Profile modifications mainly compensate for tooth deflections; lead modifications mainly compensate for angular misalignments. Both modification types yield optimal performance at a given operating condition (e. g. <b>nominal</b> transmitted <b>torque</b> under ideal alignment), minimizing the meshing excitation. One key operating condition for the gear pair is represented by the instantaneous centre distance between the gears. Centre distance variations affect mainly the pressure angle for the transmitted contact force, the total contact ratio and the active tooth height. Furthermore after a change in centre distance, the contacting surfaces on the tooth flanks shift with respect to each other; this yields a mismatch with respect to the theoretical start for the tooth profile modifications. A precision gear test rig, where operating conditions can be varied and tightly controlled, is used in this paper to evaluate the effects of centre distance variations on the dynamic behaviour of a spur gear pair. The dynamic behaviour is characterized relying on the so-called Static Transmission Error (STE). Spectral analysis of the STE provides an indication of the internal excitation generated by gear meshing. Results show that the STE is sensitive to small changes in centre distance (in the order of 0. 1 % of the nominal value). In particular, it is also observed that the transmitted torque for obtaining minimum STE peak to peak value changes significantly {{as a function of the}} centre distance. status: submitte...|$|R

40|$|Below-knee {{amputation}} {{is associated}} with higher energy expenditure during walking, partially due to difficulty maintaining balance. We previously found that once-per-step push-off work control can reduce balance-related effort, both in simulation and in experiments with human participants. Simulations also suggested that changing ankle inversion/eversion torque on each step, in response to changes in body state, could assist with balance. In this study, we investigated the effects of ankle inversion/eversion torque modulation on balance-related effort among amputees (N = 5) using a multi-actuated ankle-foot prosthesis emulator. In stabilizing conditions, changes in ankle inversion/eversion torque were applied so as to counteract deviations in side-to-side center-of-mass acceleration {{at the moment of}} intact-limb toe off; higher acceleration toward the prosthetic limb resulted in a corrective ankle inversion torque during the ensuing stance phase. Destabilizing controllers had the opposite effect, and a zero gain controller made no changes to the <b>nominal</b> inversion/eversion <b>torque.</b> To separate the balance-related effects of step-to-step control from the potential effects of changes in average mechanics, average ankle inversion/eversion torque and prosthesis work were held constant across conditions. High-gain stabilizing control lowered metabolic cost by 13 % compared to the zero gain controller (p = 0. 05). We then investigated individual responses to subject-specific stabilizing controllers following an enforced exploration period. Four of five participants experienced reduced metabolic rate compared to the zero gain controller (− 15, − 14, − 11, − 6, and + 4 %) an average reduction of 9 % (p = 0. 05). Average prosthesis mechanics were unchanged across all conditions, suggesting that improvements in energy economy might have come from changes in step-to-step corrections related to balance. Step-to-step modulation of inversion/eversion torque could be used in new, active ankle-foot prostheses to reduce walking effort associated with maintaining balance...|$|R
40|$|Exoskeletons {{comprised}} of rigid load-bearing structures {{have been developed}} for many years, but a new paradigm is to create “exosuits ” that apply tensile forces to the body using textiles and utilize the bodys skeletal structure to support compressive forces. Exosuits are intended to augment the musculature by providing small to moderate levels of assistance at appropriate times in the walking cycle. They have a number of substantial benefits: with their fabric construction, exosuits eliminate problems of needing to align a rigid frame precisely with the biological joints and their inertia can be extremely low. In this paper, we present a fully portable hip-assistance exosuit that uses a backpack frame to attach to the torso, onto which is mounted a spooled-webbing actuator that connects {{to the back of the}} users thigh. The actuators, powered by a geared brushless motor connected to a spool via a timing belt, wind up seat-belt webbing onto the spool so that a large travel is possible with a simple, compact mechanism.

40|$|During its 5 year mission, the Kepler {{spacecraft}} {{has uncovered}} a diverse population of planetary systems with orbital configurations ranging from single-transiting planets to systems of multiple planets co-transiting the parent star. By comparing the relative occurrences of multiple to single-transiting systems, recent analyses have {{revealed a significant}} over-abundance of singles. Dubbed the "Kepler Dichotomy," this feature has been interpreted as evidence for two separate populations of planetary systems: one where all orbits are confined to a single plane, and a second where the constituent planetary orbits possess significant mutual inclinations, allowing only a single member to be observed in transit at a given epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that stellar obliquity, excited within the disk-hosting stage, can explain this dichotomy. Young stars rotate rapidly, generating a significant quadrupole moment which torques the planetary orbits, with inner planets influenced more strongly. Given <b>nominal</b> parameters, this <b>torque</b> is sufficiently strong to excite significant mutual inclinations between planets, enhancing the number of single-transiting planets, sometimes through a dynamical instability.
