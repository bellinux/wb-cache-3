The structural analyses by neutron and x-ray diffraction indicate that, despite the lattice parameters remaining unchanged within the experimental accuracy, around 30 % of the <b>nominal</b> Li <b>content</b> actually enters the structure. Also the transition temperature is only weakly affected by Li substitution, but its relationship with the residual resistivity and magnetoresistivity data is compatible with a picture where π bands are filled with holes and/or affected by disorder, as predicted by theory.

Data fits based on the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer two-band model yield the zero-temperature limit of both λ and superconducting gaps: we find that λ(0) increases weakly and quickly saturates with increasing x, whereas Δπ(0) and Δσ(0) decrease with x. This analysis suggests that lithium substitution induces disorder mainly in the π band.
