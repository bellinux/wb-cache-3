50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the first nanoparticles, {{specifically}} <b>nanoceramics</b> were formed, using sol-gel. This process {{was replaced by}} sintering in the early 2000s and then by microwave sintering. None of these techniques proved suitable for large scale production.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nanoceramics</b> were {{discovered}} in the early 1980s. They were formed using a process called sol-gel which mixes nanoparticles within a solution and gel to form the nanoparticle. Later methods involved sintering (pressure and heat). The material is so small that it has basically no flaws. Larger scale materials have flaws that render them brittle.|$|E
50|$|Nanoceramic {{is a type}} of {{nanoparticle}} that {{is composed}} of ceramics, which are generally classified as inorganic, heat-resistant, nonmetallic solids made of both metallic and nonmetallic compounds. The material offers unique properties. Macroscale ceramics are brittle and rigid and break upon impact.

Inside the boxes are suspectors that absorb microwaves at room temperature to initialize the sintering process. The microwave heats the suspectors to about 600 °C, sufficient to trigger the <b>nanoceramics</b> to absorb the microwaves.|$|E

The specialists assess XADO as the major player in the Russian market of imported and domestic antifriction materials as well, actively occupying almost all major regions of the Russian Federation. The company’s share of the market is 24%, whereas in the segment of <b>nanoceramics</b> it is up to 90%.|$|E
50|$|One {{process for}} making <b>nanoceramics</b> varies is the sol-gel process, {{also known as}} {{chemical}} solution deposition. This involves a chemical solution, or the sol, made of nanoparticles in liquid phase and a precursor, usually a gel or polymer, made of molecules immersed in a solvent. The sol and gel are mixed to produce an oxide material which are generally a type of ceramic. The excess products (a liquid solvent) are evaporated. The particles desires are then heated in a process called densification to produce a solid product. This method could also be applied to produce a nanocomposite by heating the gel on a thin film to form a nanoceramic layer {{on top of the}} film.|$|E

There has been intensive {{research and development}} on the <b>nanoceramics</b> and nanoceramic composites for various mechanical, electrical, chemical, optical, magnetic, and biomedical applications. This paper is to review the current achievements in the fabrication and characterisation of various <b>nanoceramics</b> and nanoceramic composites for biomedical applications. Double emulsion techniques {{have been developed to}} produce ceramic nanoparticles, which can be modified with organic, polymeric, and/ or biological species for gene delivery and drug delivery. <b>Nanoceramics</b> and nanoceramic composites in the bulk form are also made possible due to the development of new processing techniques such as magnetic pulsed compaction, ultrahigh pressure compaction, spark plasma sintering, etc., which ensure the full densification of ceramic nanoparticles without significant grain growth. <b>Nanoceramics</b> and nanoceramic composites exhibit unique processing, mechanical, and surface characteristics such as superplasticity, machinability, strength, toughness, bioactivity, etc. due to the fine grain size, abundant grain boundaries, controllable crystallinity, etc. Nevertheless, there are still needs to explore the nanostructure-property relationships and the interactions between <b>nanoceramics</b> and organic, polymeric, and biological systems in the nanometer scale...|$|E

40|$|Various materials, such as {{gold and}} {{tantalum}} oxide, have been researched {{for their use}} as radiation enhancers or “radiosensitisers” with high Z elements showing a high proficiency. Bismuth oxide <b>nanoceramics</b> have been utilised in many applications but their effectiveness as a high Z radiosensitiser {{has not yet been}} examined. The aim of this investigation was to assess the effectiveness of Bi 2 O 3 <b>nanoceramics</b> as radiation enhancers and to tailor the biochemical activity through oxygen deficiencies. These were tested on 9 L Gliosarcoma and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines. The <b>nanoceramics</b> were characterised using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy to confirm 50 - 80 nm nanoplatelet morphology and monoclinic crystal structure. The surfaces of the <b>nanoceramics</b> were then examined for atomic composition which showed oxygen reduction of 1. 25 weight% in the argon annealed nanoceramic. Different biological behaviours were observed between the two samples. The air annealed samples showing cytotoxicity, while the argon annealed samples demonstrated cell proliferation and biocompatibility for MDCK and 9 L respectively. Bioactivity was linked to the generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), with the effects dictated by available oxygen deficiencies and exposure time. The <b>nanoceramics</b> were then examined under 125 kV and 10 MV radiation energies. Under the 125 kVp energy, both the air and argon <b>nanoceramics</b> had the same calculated sensitisation enhancement ratio (SER). The more effective argon sample was examined under a 10 MV field and demonstrated an SER of 1. 25. The platelet structure of the <b>nanoceramics</b> results in a kV SER higher than other compounds published, but it hinders the 10 MV effectiveness due to the aggregate size trapping the produced electrons in the material. Future research would involve optimising the morphology for smaller platelets with increased oxygen deficiencies, examination at multiple radiation energies, and incorporation into a theranostic system...|$|E

40|$|Ceramic/polymer {{composites}} {{have been}} considered as third-generation orthopedic biomaterials due {{to their ability to}} closely match properties (such as surface, chemistry, biological, and mechanical) of natural bone. It has already been shown that the addition of nanophase compared with conventional (or micron-scale) ceramics to polymers enhances bone cell functions. However, in order to fully take advantage of the promising nanometer size effects that <b>nanoceramics</b> can provide when added to polymers, it is critical to uniformly disperse them in a polymer matrix. This is critical since ceramic nanoparticles inherently have a strong tendency to form larger agglomerates in a polymer matrix which may compromise their properties. Therefore, in this study, model ceramic nanoparticles, specifically titania and hydroxyapatite (HA), were dispersed in a model polymer (PLGA, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid) using high-power ultrasonic energy. The mechanical properties of the resulting PLGA composites with well-dispersed ceramic (either titania or HA) nanoparticles were investigated and compared with composites with agglomerated ceramic nanoparticles. Results demonstrated that well-dispersed ceramic nanoparticles (titania or HA) in PLGA improved mechanical properties compared with agglomerated ceramic nanoparticles even though the weight percentage of the ceramics was the same. Specifically, well-dispersed <b>nanoceramics</b> in PLGA enhanced the tensile modulus, tensile strength at yield, ultimate tensile strength, and compressive modulus compared with the more agglomerated <b>nanoceramics</b> in PLGA. In summary, supplemented by previous studies that demonstrated greater osteoblast (bone-forming cell) functions on well-dispersed nanophase ceramics in polymers, the present study demonstrated that the combination of PLGA with well-dispersed <b>nanoceramics</b> enhanced mechanical properties necessary for load-bearing orthopedic/dental applications...|$|E

Meanwhile, the development of an unconventional pressureless two-step sintering strategy enabling densification without grain growth provides a novel technology suitable for commercial production of nanograin ceramics. The particular interest concerning bulk dense nanograin ceramics is the manifestation of ferroelectricity, which remains a fundamental issue to be understood and exploited. Combining the best powder synthesis and optimized two-step sintering, high-density barium titanate (BT) and related nanograin ceramics have been fabricated to allow for a detailed determination of the size effect on nanometer-scale ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity of fundamental and industrial interest. These include dense ceramics of undoped BT with an average grain size down to 5 nm, and of (1 −x)BiScO 3 −xPbTiO 3 (BSPT) solid solutions with an average grain size down to 10 nm.

Enhanced emission intensity was also observed in the case of Nano PEG- 300 sample with respect to Nano PEG- 400 sample. Thus, increasing of PEG leads to decreasing of the emission intensity.
