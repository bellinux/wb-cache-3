5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her. Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in <b>Night</b> <b>Nurse</b> (1931).|$|E
5|$|Several {{more people}} are {{attacked}} and reduced to ash. A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian <b>night</b> <b>nurse</b> Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is gone when they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits the entity needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on their exposure levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and has been moving him around to both protect him and contain the entity. Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought the entity back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally able to solve the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over the phone that his brother and the entity cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, the entity escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop the entity from attacking another victim.|$|E

40|$|Introduction <b>Night</b> <b>nurses</b> carry overall nursing {{responsibility}} for approximately {{half the time}} that patients spend in hospital. However, there is a paucity of literature that focuses on nursing care provided at night. Aim The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate nursing care provided at night from the perspective of both nurses and patients. Methods The study, which had an evaluative and a comparative design, was carried out using the <b>Night</b> <b>Nursing</b> Care Instrument at a hospital in southern Sweden. Nurses (n = 178) on night duty were consecutively selected, while the patients (n = 356) were selected by convenience sampling. Results The results showed a statistically significant difference between nurses' assessments and patients' perceptions of the nursing care provided at <b>night</b> in <b>nursing</b> interventions (P < 0. 0001). In the areas of medical interventions and evaluation, no statistically significant differences were found between nurses and patients. For eight of 11 items, patients reported that they were satisfied (greater than or equal to 80 %) with the nursing care provided at night. Conclusions These findings suggest that <b>night</b> <b>nurses</b> need to improve their ability to assess patients' needs for <b>nursing</b> care at <b>night.</b> A first step in this direction is for them to become aware of how patients perceive <b>night</b> <b>nursing.</b> As a second step, nurses need to increase their knowledge of which nursing actions promote patients' rest at night...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{the duties}} and working {{conditions}} of registered, and enrolled nurses have previously been described from different perspectives, {{they have not been}} examined from the <b>night</b> <b>nursing</b> aspect. The aim {{of the study was to}} describe the <b>night</b> <b>nursing</b> staff's working experiences. Methods The design of the study is qualitative and descriptive. Interviews were conducted with 10 registered and 10 enrolled <b>nurses</b> working as <b>night</b> staff at a Swedish University Hospital. The interview guide was thematic and concerned the content of their tasks, as well as the working conditions that constitute <b>night</b> <b>nursing.</b> In addition, the interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis. Results The night duties have to be performed under difficult conditions that include working silently in dimmed lighting, and making decisions when fatigue threatens. According to the night staff, its main goals are to provide the patients with rest and simultaneously ensure qualified care. Furthermore, the <b>night</b> <b>nursing</b> staff must prepare the ward for the daytime activities. Conclusion The most important point is the team work, which developed between the registered and enrolled nurses and how necessary this team work is when working at night. In order for <b>nurses</b> working at <b>night</b> to be fully appreciated, the communication between day and night staff in health care organizations needs to be developed. Furthermore, it is important to give the night staff opportunities to use its whole field of competence. </p...|$|R

Katherine St. Asaph for PopDust described Lewis's interpretation of [...] "Hurt" [...] as being formulaic like a [...] "template", writing that it is something that American Idol and The X Factor winners and contestants seem do when covering a song. St. Asaph continued to explain her opinions with regard to Lewis and [...] "Hurt", writing [...] "For Leona, that's big notes in bigger arrangements, with a couple hushed sections for contrast." [...] She was also skeptical of Lewis's emotive abilities, writing [...] "Either she knows that quiet-to-loud arrangements and whispered vocals can simulate gravitas pretty well regardless of whether you’re thinking of pain or grocery lists, or she’s genuinely feeling something that comes out in her voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, Gable and Josephine Dillon were divorced. A {{few days}} later, he married Texas socialite Maria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham, nicknamed [...] "Rhea". After moving to California, {{they were married}} again in 1931, {{possibly}} {{due to differences in}} state legal requirements. [...] "His ears are too big and he looks like an ape", said executive Darryl F. Zanuck, then at Warner Bros., about Gable after testing him for the lead in the studio's gangster drama Little Caesar (1931). The same year, in <b>Night</b> <b>Nurse,</b> Gable played a villainous chauffeur who was gradually starving two adorable little girls to death, then knocked Barbara Stanwyck's character unconscious with his fist, a supporting role originally slated for James Cagney until the release of The Public Enemy abruptly made Cagney a leading man. After several failed screen tests for Barrymore and Zanuck, Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's Irving Thalberg. He became a client of well-connected agent Minna Wallis, sister of producer Hal Wallis and a very close friend of Norma Shearer.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 34 - 40) The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate whether the night shift increased the risk of obesity among nurses. The study examined different factors that might influence <b>night</b> shift <b>nurses</b> towards obesity, incorporating other research on obesity, <b>nurses,</b> <b>night</b> shift hazards, etc. Physical and biological factors that attributed to <b>nurses</b> working <b>night</b> shifts were also discussed. Research was conducted at a hospital in Southern California and included 17 day shift <b>nurses</b> and 51 <b>night</b> shift <b>nurses</b> as respondents. A self-report survey was used to collect quantitative data related to the health statuses of night and day shift nurses including their Body Mass Index (BMI), eating habits and food intakes, medical history, and supplement usage. SPSS was used for the analyses, and t-tests and chi-square measures compared day and <b>night</b> shift <b>nurses</b> on factors related to health. The study did not reveal significant differences between <b>night</b> shift <b>nurses</b> and day shift nurses based on BMI, exercise levels, food intakes, etc., presumably due to the limited sample size. However, <b>night</b> shift <b>nurses</b> reported a higher percentage of hemorrhoids, and day shift nurses reported a higher occurrence of hypertension.

Neither film was successful; nonetheless, Frank Capra chose Stanwyck for his Ladies of Leisure (1930). Numerous prominent roles followed, among them the children's nurse who saves two little girls from being gradually starved to death by Clark Gable's vicious character in <b>Night</b> <b>Nurse</b> (1931); [...] So Big!, as a valiant Midwest farm woman (1932); Shopworn 1932; the ambitious woman from [...] "the {{wrong side of the}} tracks" [...] in Baby Face (1933); the self-sacrificing title character in Stella Dallas (1937); Molly Monahan in Union Pacific (1939) with Joel McCrea; Meet John Doe, as an ambitious newspaperwoman with Gary Cooper (1941); the con artist who falls for her intended victim (played by Henry Fonda) in The Lady Eve (1941); the extremely successful, independent doctor Helen Hunt in You Belong to Me (1941), also with Fonda; a nightclub performer who gives a professor (played by Gary Cooper) a better understanding of [...] "modern English" [...] in the comedy Ball of Fire (1941); the woman who talks an infatuated insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) into killing her husband in Double Indemnity (1944); the columnist caught up in white lies and a holiday romance in Christmas in Connecticut (1945); and the doomed wife in Sorry, Wrong Number (1948). She also played a doomed concert pianist in The Other Love (1947); the piano music was played by Ania Dorfmann, who drilled Stanwyck for three hours a day until she was able to move her arms and hands to match the music. Stanwyck was reportedly one of the many actresses considered for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939), although she did not receive a screen test. In 1944 she was the highest-paid woman in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his days in}} the isolation ward, Lukwiya would sit {{with members of the}} WHO, CDC and other medical teams that had set up in the hospital compound to offer assistance and take blood samples that allowed them to map the course of the disease. [...] His main question for them was how to stop his staff members from becoming infected. [...] The likely explanation in most cases are momentary lapses. [...] Health workers at St. Mary's worked 14 hours shifts for weeks in a row while in layers of protective clothing that were stifling in the equatorial country. [...] All that would be required for infection is for a health worker to lose focus for a moment and, after touching a patient, slip a gloved finger under their mask to scratch an itchy nose or rub an eye. [...] One infected St. Mary's health worker who may have been infected in this way was nurse Simon Ajok. [...] In the early morning of 20 November, Ajok was in the Ebola ward and critical, bleeding from both his nose and gums. [...] Fighting to breathe, Ajok pulled off his oxygen mask and coughed violently, sending a fine spray of blood and mucus against the nearby wall. [...] He then astonished and terrified the night-shift by rising to his feet and staggering into the hallway. [...] The <b>night</b> <b>nurse</b> on duty called Dr. Lukwiya for help. [...] Woken out of bed, Lukwiya put on protective clothing, mask, cap, gown, apron and two pairs of gloves, but not goggles or a face shield to protect the eyes. [...] Explanations for this range from grogginess at being newly awoken or haste to reach a colleague that he had helped train. [...] While it will never be known for certain, the care for Simon Ajok, who died one hour after the physician arrived, is the most likely candidate for Lukwiya's infection.|$|E
2500|$|The Penguin Social History of Britain {{noted that}} [...] "by the 1920s {{newspapers}} {{were filled with}} advertisements for 'lingerie' and 'undies' {{which would have been}} classed as indecent a generation earlier". Thus, in Ben Travers' comic novel Rookery Nook (1923), a young woman evicted from home in her nightwear and requiring day clothes remarked, [...] "Combies. That's all right. But in the summer you know, we don't ...", while in Agatha Christie's thriller, The Seven Dials Mystery (1929), the aristocratic heroine, Lady [...] "Bundle" [...] Brent, wore only [...] "a negligible trifle" [...] under her dress; like many real life [...] "it girls" [...] of her class, she had been freed from the [...] "genteel expectations" [...] of earlier generations. In Hollywood the actress Carole Lombard, who, in the 1930s, combined feistiness with sexual allure, never wore a brassière and [...] "avoided panties". However, she famously declared that though [...] "I live by a man's code designed to fit a man's world ... at the same time I never forget that a woman's first job is to choose the right shade of lipstick" [...] Coincidentally, sales of men's undershirts fell dramatically in the United States when Lombard's future husband, Clark Gable, was revealed not to be wearing one in a famous motel bedroom scene with Claudette Colbert in the film It Happened One Night (1934). According to Gable, [...] "the idea was looking half-naked and scaring the brat into her own bed {{on the other side of}} the blanket [...] ". However, he [...] "gave the impression that going without was a vital sign of a man's virility" [...] More generally, the adoption by the American movie industry of the Hays Production Code in the early 1930s had a significant effect on how moral, and especially sexual, issues were depicted on film. This included a more conservative approach to matters of dress. Whereas the sort of scanty lingerie on show in some earlier productions (for example, Joan Blondell and Barbara Stanwyck in <b>Night</b> <b>Nurse,</b> 1931) had tended to reflect trends that, in the 1920s, defied convention and were regarded many young women as liberating, by the early years of the Depression such displays came to be regarded quite widely as undesirable. Developments in the late 1960s and 70s, when the strictures of the code were abandoned, followed a similar pattern, although, by then, it was often women themselves who were in the vanguard of resistance to sexualised imagery.|$|E

Results of the survey indicate that nurses who show a preference for night work and who selfselect these hours on a permanent basis are more likely to derive challenge from and express greater satisfaction with their work, than those on alternative day and night shifts. Further, there is a stable population of workers who choose night work above all other options as a source of personal satisfaction, freedom and challenge.
