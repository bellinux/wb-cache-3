At the ceremony, Obama praised Dylan's {{voice for}} its [...] "unique gravelly power that redefined <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> music sounded like {{but the message}} it carried and how it made people feel".|$|E
500|$|The {{season is}} {{structured}} into three [...] "pods" [...] {{based on its}} airing schedule: the first eight episodes, subtitled Ghost Rider; LMD (Life Model Decoy) for the subsequent seven episodes; and a third pod for the final seven episodes called Agents of Hydra. Elements and characters cross over between the different pods, but the sections [...] "definitely have a different feel" [...] from one another, as Tancharoen explained that 22 episodes [...] "is {{a long time to}} hold a big bad or a single plot line, especially for an audience", and for the past two seasons, the series was able to have two separated halves that [...] "allows us to introduce a big bad. And then, something happens and we rise somebody new ... Now, there's three of those." [...] "Financial considerations" [...] were also taken into account in creating the pods for the season, as using LMDs does not [...] "cost as much as setting a guy's head on fire via CGI". In terms of writing the [...] "complicated season", Whedon said the writers were [...] "aware that our fans are our fans and have spent some time with these characters and are clever and see things coming sometimes ... Part of our job is to create <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> we are presenting on plot, but letting the audience be one step ahead of us and being one step ahead of that." [...] He added that the writers knew that they wanted to tell a Ghost Rider story, an LMD story, and a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, and the hardest part was making each pod still fit together as a single season. The major connection ultimately became the Darkhold, which leads from the magic of Ghost Rider to the advanced science of LMD and then the Framework in Agents of Hydra. Ghost Rider also reappears in the final episode of the season, [...] "World's End", as an additional connection.|$|E

60|$|Somehow she {{saw through}} me, knew I was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> I pretended to be. But she never breathed her conviction. She championed me. I {{wanted to tell}} her the truth about myself because I {{believed}} the doubt of me alone stood in the way of my winning her.|$|E
60|$|Was her {{bitterness}} {{against the}} North <b>not</b> <b>just?</b> <b>What</b> a {{life had been}} Colonel Carvel's! It had dawned brightly. One war had cost him his wife. Another, and {{he had lost his}} fortune, his home, his friends, all that was dear to him. And that daughter, whom he loved best in all the world, he was perchance to see no more.|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't help--loving you, Russ," [...] she said. [...] "But {{to promise}} to marry you, that's different. Why, Russ, I {{know nothing about}} you, not even your last name. You're not a--a steady fellow. You drink, gamble, fight. You'll kill {{somebody}} yet. Then I'll not love you. Besides, I've always felt you're <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> you seemed. I can't trust you. There's something wrong about you." ...|$|E

In the meantime the automobile had gone on along {{the street to the}} post-office, where the two strange cadets went in to see about mail.|$|E

Their words are <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> everybody else says, {{though they may be}} spelled the same. If I were to live till my Hans got old, I should still see the boy in him.

50|$|R.S.

6000|$|... "Who {{can help}} thinking? Men do do so. It {{seems to me}} that that is the line of most young men who come to their {{property}} early. Why should I dare to think that my boy should be better than others? But I do; and I fancy that he will be a great statesman. After all, Mr. Finn, that is the best thing that a man can be, unless it is given him to be a saint and a martyr {{and all that kind of}} thing,--which is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> a mother looks for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can I do, Mr. Comfort? Of course I know he's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> {{he should}} be,--that is, for a clergyman. When I knew he hadn't come {{from any of}} the colleges, I never had any fancy for going to hear him myself. But of course I should never have left your church, Mr. Comfort,--not if anybody had come there. And if I could have had my way with Dorothy, she would never have gone near him,--never. But what could I do, Mr. Comfort? Of course she can go where she likes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing will persuade me that I didn't know {{everything}} about you, uncle. You are just exactly what I knew you would be in look, and voice, in manner and ways and everything. Of course, it is partly from what I remember, but I really did not see {{a great deal of}} you in those days; it is from your letters, I think, entirely that I knew all about you, and exactly what you were. Do you mean to say that I am <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> you thought I should be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no. My sister {{tells me}} I am always angry {{with people who}} do <b>not</b> say <b>just</b> <b>what</b> I like. But I hope I am not given to think ill of them. In the end I am usually obliged to think ill of myself for being so impatient." ...|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Sharp soon rose to depart. She had {{arranged}} {{to remain in}} town until the policy was paid. The commissioner did not detain her. She was a woman, and he did <b>not</b> know <b>just</b> <b>what</b> {{to say to her}} at present. Rest and time would bring her what she needed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why {{not have}} a great actress of our name, {{as well as an}} authoress, a minister, and an eminent publisher? We don't choose our talents, but we needn't hide them in a napkin because they are <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> we want. I say, let Jo have her way, and do what she can. Here am I to take care of her; and you can't deny you'd enjoy fixing her furbelows, and seeing her shine before the footlights, where you used to long to be. Come, mother, better face the music and march gaily, since your wilful {{children}} will [...] "gang their ain gait".' ...|$|E
6000|$|Barret, {{although}} kind, courteous, manly, sensitive, {{and reasonably}} careful, was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> {{he ought to}} have been. Although a hero, he was not perfect. He committed the unpardonable sin of turning a street corner sharply! A thin little old lady crossed the road at the same identical moment, slowly. They met! Who can describe that meeting? Not the writer, for he did not see it; more's the pity! Very few people saw it, for it was a quiet corner. The parties concerned cannot be said to have seen, though they felt it. Both went down. It was awful, really, to see a feeble old lady struggling with an athlete and a bicycle! ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--My {{health is}} <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> it should be; I have lost weight, pulse, respiration, etc., and gained {{nothing in the}} way of my old bellows. But these last few days, with tonic, cod-liver oil, better wine (there is some better now), and {{perpetual}} beef-tea, I think I have progressed. To say truth, I have been here a little over long. I was reckoning up, and since I have known you, already quite a while, I have not, I believe, remained so long in any one place as here in Davos. That tells on my old gipsy nature; like a violin hung up, I begin to lose what music there was in me; and with the music, I do not know what besides, or do not know what to call it, but something radically part of life, a rhythm, perhaps, in one's old and so brutally over-ridden nerves, or perhaps a kind of variety of blood that the heart has come to look for.|$|E

6000|$|... "Charlie Sloane {{will be a}} great comfort, of course," [...] agreed Anne sarcastically; whereupon {{both those}} irresponsible damsels laughed.

To be sure, Anne herself did not know that.|$|R
