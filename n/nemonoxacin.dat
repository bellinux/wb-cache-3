50|$|<b>Nemonoxacin</b> is a non-fluorinated {{quinolone}} antibiotic undergoing clinical trials. It has {{the same}} mechanism of action as fluouroquinolones; it inhibits DNA gyrase, preventing DNA synthesis, gene duplication, and cell division. At the end of 2016, it had reached market in Taiwan, Russia, the Commonwealth Independent States, Turkey, mainland China, and Latin America under the brad name Taigexyn. <b>Nemonoxacin</b> has completed phase 2 trials in the USA and has moved on to phase 3 trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted <b>nemonoxacin</b> qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) and fast track designations for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAP) and acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSI).|$|E
50|$|<b>Nemonoxacin</b> has a broad {{spectrum}} of activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and atypical pathogens, including activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (MIC90 1 g/ml) and vancomycin-resistant pathogens. However, it was less active against Gram-negative pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC90 values of 32, 16, and 32 g/ml, respectively. The new drug also is effective against C.difficile isolates that are resistant to other quinolones, and is more potent than levofloxacin or moxifloxacin.|$|E

Methods: Two independent, open-label, randomized, crossover studies were conducted in 24  (12 per study) healthy Chinese volunteers. In Study 1, each volunteer received a single oral dose of 500 mg of <b>nemonoxacin</b> alone or with 1. 5 g of probenecid divided into three doses within 25  hours. In Study 2, each volunteer received a single oral dose of 500 mg of <b>nemonoxacin</b> alone or with multiple doses of cimetidine (400 mg thrice daily for 7 days). The plasma and urine <b>nemonoxacin</b> concentrations were determined using validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry methods. Results: Coadministration of <b>nemonoxacin</b> with probenecid reduced the renal clearance (CLr) of <b>nemonoxacin</b> by 22. 6 %, and increased the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0 –∞) by 26. 2 %. Coadministration of <b>nemonoxacin</b> with cimetidine reduced the CLr of <b>nemonoxacin</b> by 13. 3 % and increased AUC 0 –∞ by 9. 4 %. Coadministration of <b>nemonoxacin</b> with probenecid or cimetidine did not significantly affect the maximum concentration of <b>nemonoxacin</b> or {{the percentage of the}} administered dose recovered in the urine. Conclusion: Although probenecid reduced the CLr and increased the plasma exposure of <b>nemonoxacin,</b> these effects are unlikely to be clinically meaningful at therapeutic doses.

It has a low propensity for selecting resistant pathogens than fluoroquinolones, since bacteria become resistant to <b>nemonoxacin</b> only when three different mutations occur in their quinolone resistance-determining regions. <b>Nemonoxacin</b> shows greater efficacy than most of the widely used fluoroquinolones in the murine model of systemic, pulmonary, or ascending urinary tract infection. <b>Nemonoxacin</b> has a sound PK profile in healthy volunteers. It rapidly reaches maximum concentration Cmax 1 – 2 hours after oral administration in the fasting state and has a relatively long elimination half-life of more than 10 hours, which is similar to fluoroquinolones. Approximately 60 %– 75 % of the administered dose is excreted in unchanged form via kidneys over 24 – 72 hours. Phase II and III studies of oral <b>nemonoxacin</b> and Phase II studies of intravenous <b>nemonoxacin</b> have been completed in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), before which the Phase I studies of oral and intravenous <b>nemonoxacin</b> indicated sound tolerance and safety with healthy volunteers. The published results demonstrate that an oral dose of either 500 mg or 750 mg <b>nemonoxacin</b> once daily for 7 days is as effective and safe as levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for 7 days. <b>Nemonoxacin</b> is well-tolerated in patients with CAP. The most common adverse events of oral administration are observed in the gastrointestinal and nervous system, the incidence of which is similar to levofloxacin treatment. The Phase III studies of intravenous <b>nemonoxacin</b> for treating CAP and oral <b>nemonoxacin</b> for diabetic foot infection has been registered with promising outcomes to be expected.

Detection of tcdA, tcdB, cdtA, and cdtB genes was performed using a multiplex PCR assay, and gyrA and gyrB genes of moxifloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates were sequenced. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole. Ninety-five (84 %) isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin, and the MIC 90 for <b>nemonoxacin</b> was 4 μg/ml.

Thirteen rep-PCR types were identified as a predominant rep-PCR type (type A; non-North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1 [NAP 1], -NAP 7, or -NAP 8) accounting for 52. 2 % (59 isolates). Nine of 18 moxifloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates belonged to the rep-PCR type A.
