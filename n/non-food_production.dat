The EU Strategy for Biofuels (2006) and the Biomass action plan (2005) set a clear signal that the EU wishes to establish and to support the bio energy-industry. The perceivable aim of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) consists in reducing food production and in enlarging the <b>non-food</b> <b>production.</b> Another driver for the attractiveness of bio-energy and bio-fuel production is the recent development of prices of crude oil and natural gas. Furthermore bio-energy is seen as one of the key options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and substitute fossil fuels. Agribusiness, Industrial Organization,...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally reed {{canary grass}} (Phalaris arundinacea L.) has been {{cultivated}} for forage, but currently is a new non-food crop in northern Europe. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate {{reed canary grass}} germplasm, elite and wild populations, for non-food, forage and seed production. An index composed of different agronomic traits was used to establish the best populations for each end-use. Populations were also ranked according to biomass or seed yield only. Non-food cultivars have not yet been developed, but results from this study suggest that some high biomass forage cultivars could be used in <b>non-food</b> <b>production.</b> However, local populations possessed a desirable combination of traits, including higher proportion of straw associated with high biomass yield. This study indicated that local populations could be used in non-food crop breeding together with elite material. Some evidence for the potential of populations for forage production was also noted, mainly through leaf area and leaf proportion measurements. High non-food or forage indices were associated with good seed production in some populations. Results help in selecting appropriate cultivars for non-food use, which is currently important as the cultivated area of reed canary grass for biofuel in Finland is anticipated to be 75 000 hectares by 2010. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{quest for}} {{renewable}} energy has intensified since the escalating price of crude petroleum in the recent years. Renewable energy such as biodiesel {{has the potential to}} replace petroleum-derived transportation fuel in the future. Biodiesel is defined as the mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils such palm oil, rapeseed and soybean. Currently, more than 80 % of the world biodiesel productions are from rapeseed oil. However, the cost of palm oil which is at least US$ 200 per tonne cheaper than rapeseed oil indicates that palm oil could be a more suitable and attractive candidate as the source of biodiesel compared to other vegetable oils. Although palm oil is known to be a multi-purpose vegetable oil with products ranging from food to biodiesel, {{there are a lot of}} issues surrounding palm oil production. Nevertheless, some of these issues reported in the literature were found to be misleading and are thus confusing the public perception on palm oil. Thus, the aim of this paper is to highlight and clarify the negative issues reported in the literature surrounding palm oil production. Apart from that, various policies or/and strategies that will lead to a more sustainable production and development of palm oil industries will also be proposed. Hence, palm oil will be able to become the leading vegetable oil in terms of food and <b>non-food</b> <b>production,</b> especially as the main source of renewable energy, biodiesel.

So far, the world food supply has been dependent on few of these crop plants mainly cereals. But today, the cereal deficit to meet global food requirements has encouraged the diversification of crops for both food and <b>non-food</b> <b>productions.</b> So, in some tropical climate regions, root and tuber crops have got attention to contribute a part in feeding the world.

40|$|Indirect {{land use}} change (ILUC) {{is a serious}} threat to the {{sustainability}} of bioenergy because of the extra GHG emissions (and other environmental impacts) it causes when feedstock production diverts other agricultural production and causes expansion onto high carbon stock lands. However, multiple measures exist {{to reduce the risk of}} ILUC. But these measures and their potential to mitigate ILUC are not yet well understood. Therefore, we assessed the ILUC-mitigation potential under three scenarios for possible developments in agricultural production and supply chains for a case study on maize production in Hungary for ethanol. Our results show that ILUC-risk mitigation is possible in all three scenarios: agricultural land demand is reduced by 3500 – 16000  km 2 in 2020 compared to the current situation (6 – 29 % of the agricultural area). This surplus land, is not needed anymore for food and feed production and can be used for biomass production for energy at a low risk of causing ILUC. For example, when maize is cultivated and converted to ethanol, this surplus land can provide 22 - 138  PJ of ethanol. This is equivalent to 10 – 60 % of the projected 2020 transport energy use in Hungary. Yield improvements of maize, other crops and livestock contributed most (55 – 90 %) to this low-ILUC-risk potential. To sustainably increase productivity and efficiency in the entire agricultural sector, an integrated approach to food and fuel (as well as other <b>non-food)</b> <b>production</b> is needed. Thereby, ILUC risk can be mitigated and is not an irreversible fact as often presented in previous studies...|$|E

As a result of this the use of different goods will grow drastically. A promising possibility to satisfy these needs is the increasing use of renewable bio-based raw materials. This trend is obvious everywhere in the world. The European agriculture is meeting new worldwide challenges in near future. The agriculture {{has to be able to}} meet the world food demand but also on other need of raw materials. The increasing use of non-food materials is in sight. The word “non-food ” is meaning flora or fauna origin raw materials which are produced, processed and manufactured for other use than food (MAF, 1995). The use of field biomass can grow to the amount which is not used in food production. It is obvious that food and nonfood production are integrated (Pehkonen, 1996). The increase of <b>non-food</b> <b>production</b> is possible in countries where the field area is larger than the use of it for food production. This is the situation in Finland and also in Estonia. There are some new industrial areas in Finland where integrated production has taken place. At the moment there is clearly more action in research and different pilot plants than in established industrial production. However, there are some examples of new industry.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the methodology for estimating the Russia’s consumer sector {{and the effect of}} its application. The monitoring procedure of the Russian consumer sector groups indicators into two units: the unit of the estimation of consumer goods and the services market estimation unit. The estimation unit of consumer goods is composed of two modules: food products and non-food products. This module offers two components that provide an estimation of the consumer sector: marketing (estimates the accessibility of retail trade and services for end users) and production (estimates the domestic manufacture). The results of the estimation show general improvements in the consumer sector in the period of 2000 – 2014, but overall development is evaluated as low. The analysis revealed that the financing is growing faster than the quality indices of development. As an example, the financing of agriculture has increased by 1. 5 times over 15 years (against comparable prices from 2000), while agricultural production has not changed. Another most pressing challenge is the weak differentiation of the Russian economy, as evidenced by the low rates of <b>non-food</b> <b>production</b> (availability of non-foods of own production remains at a low level and averages 20 %). The results of the estimation suggest the need to reform the regulation of the sector primarily concerning priorities for its development and improvement of financial and economic mechanisms to achieve them.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{is a vital}} {{macronutrient}} {{required to}} improve the agricultural yields but its excessive use as a fertilizer has resulted in pollution of water bodies leading to eutrophication. With no reserves of phosphorus source in Spain, increased dependence on phosphorus in agriculture have not only increased dependence on imports but also has raised concerns on its future availability as a resource. A Phosphorous Flow Analysis (PFA) was conducted for Spain for the year 2012 focusing on the food production and consumption systems. The results obtained were finally compared with PFA at both country level and continent level (EU- 27). To quantify food and non-food flows systems, country specific data were considered. The sectors covered were crop production (CP), animal production (AP), food processing (FP), <b>non-food</b> <b>production</b> (NF) and consumption (HC). The findings reveal that a total of 325 kt P was imported by Spain in 2012; 66 % of which was accumulated in markets stock of food and feed, fertilizers and non-food (91 kt P) while 33 % was lost to the environment through land-fill, losses to water bodies, land accumulation and incineration. The largest proportion of losses is associated with water bodies (44. 7 kt P) followed by agriculture and land accumulation (42. 1 kt P). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) received around 79. 5 kt P within wastewater, with 60 % being removed in sewage sludge. The 31. 7 kt P discharged within final effluent represented the 71 % of the total losses to water bodies.

Phosphorus flow studies {{can be used to}} analyze these challenges, providing insight into how society (re) uses and loses phosphorus, identifying potential solutions. Phosphorus flows were analyzed in detail for EU- 27 and its Member States. To quantify food system and non-food flows, country specific data and historical context were considered. The sectors covered were crop production (CP), animal production (AP), food processing (FP), <b>non-food</b> <b>production</b> (NF) and consumption (HC). The results show that the EU- 27 imported 2392 Gg P in 2005, half of which accumulated in agricultural soils (924 Gg) and half was lost as waste (1217 Gg). Net accumulation was 4. 9 kg P/ha/year ranging between + 23. 2 (Belgium) and - 2. 8 (Slovakia). From the system losses, 54 % was lost from HC in diverse waste flows and 28 % from FP, mainly through incinerated slaughter residues. The largest HC losses (655 Gg) were wastewater (55 %), food waste (27 %), and pet excreta (11 %). Phosphorus recycling rates were 73 % in AP, 29 % in FP, 21 % in HC and ~ 0 % in NF. The phosphorus use efficiencies showed that, relative to sector input, about 70 % was taken up by crops (CP), 24 % was retained in animals (AP), 52 % was contained in food products (FP), 76 % was stored in non-food materials (NF), and 21 % was recycled (HC). Although wide-ranging variation between countries, generally phosphorus use in EU- 27 was characterized by relatively (1) large dependency on (primary) imports, (2) long-term accumulation in agricultural soils, especially in west European countries, (3) leaky losses throughout entire society, especially emissions to the environment and sequestered waste, (4) little recycling with the exception of manure, and (5) low use efficiencies, because of aforementioned issues, providing ample opportunities for improvement...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the corporate structure in Finnish agriculture has remained behind that of other western states, as a large settlement project was realised in Finland after the wars; {{as a result of}} this, uninhabited areas housed new, small agricultural companies, and new arable land was developed. In the middle of the sixties, there were more than 300000 farms in Finland with more than one hectare land; the total sum of their fields amounted to 2, 7 million ha. Self-sufficiency with the most important foods was achieved in Finland during the fifties; since the sixties, overproduction has been a problem. From then until Finland joined the EU, the limitation of overproduction was a central element of Finnish agricultural policies. Closure of farms and fallow land received special subsidies. In the middle of the nineties, only 94 000 active farms rema ined, covering a total surface of roughly 2 million ha. Predictions say that, by the year 2005, the number of active farms will drop to half the number of when Finland joined the EU. The agricultural land will not shrink to the same extent, as the subsidisation policies of the EU which refer to the land require of the farmers that the fields belonging to closed farms are purchased or leased. In EU Finland, the best chances for successful production were seen in the keeping of dairy animals. However, the main focus of keeping dairy animals has, during the decades, wandered quite far to the North. In the fields along the southern and south- western coast, crops and some special plants are grown in the most suitable fields. The outlook for crop production are much worse than those of dairy production in green fields. It is certainly true {{that it is necessary to}} find alternative uses for the fields which are now longer required for traditional agriculture, so as to ensure that the best fields do not lie destitute and reduce the beauty of the landscape in the rural regions. It has never been popular in Finland to plant trees in the fields, although the state provides subsidies. On the other hand, there are considerably large forests in Finland, so that expansive additional forests in the unused fields would make the landscape in the rural regions even more monotonous. Biological farming, however, could be expanded in Finland. As is expressed in AGENDA 2000, the EU will continue to provide subsidies for biological farming and other diversification possibilities of agriculture. The fields which will no longer be used for traditional farming could also be used for the so-called <b>non-food</b> <b>production,</b> for example to grow energy and fibre plants. For example, by cultivating stalked plants, it would be possible to replace short-fibre deciduous trees, whose fibres are needed in the fine paper industry in addition to the coniferous tree fibres.

A current developmental trend in <b>non-food</b> rapeseed <b>production</b> on agricultural land shows that this new course is irreversible and is a great opportunity for agriculture. <b>Non-food</b> rapeseed <b>production</b> is focused on the production of biodiesel. Biodiesel has good environmental properties. Lower emissions are produced by the combustion of biodiesel than for diesel. In content of exhaust gas is observed a significant decrease of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulate matter and etc. The analysis of the literary knowledge on impacts of biodiesel on exhaust emissions, on regulated emissions, shows a reduction of 10. 1 % for particulate matter, of 21. 1 % for hydrocarbons, and 11. 0 % for carbon monoxide with the use of B 20. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) increased by 2. 0 %. Biodiesel was introduced into the European market in the 1988 s as B 100. The use of blends with content up to 5 % biodiesel has no significant impact on the emissions and their toxicity. An increased mutagenicity was observed with blends containing 20 %. Nevertheless, increased mutagenic effects were observed under specific conditions. Accordingly, the problem concerning blends of diesel fuel with biodiesel (B 20) should be investigated with high priority. No comprehensive risk assessment for diesel engine emissions from biodiesel and its blends is possible In regard to a comprehensive hazard characterization it is urged to develop a panel of standardized and internationally accepted protocols which allow a reliable assessment of possible health hazards which may arise from the combustion of new fuels compared to conventional diesel fuel. These methods should be robust and should reflect the various health hazards associated with diesel engine emissions to supplement data on regulated emissions. Methods for the generation of the exhaust and sample preparation should be harmonized. There is sufficient evidence supporting a causal relationship between diesel engine emissions and acute health effects, as are childhood asthma, non-asthma respiratory symptoms, impaired lung function, total and cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular morbidity.

40|$|No {{matter where}} it is, cities {{must find a}} way to grow sustainably. Food {{security}} should not be ignored when assessing the future of our cities. Food for cities will either have to be sourced from remote locations, or they will have to incorporate their own food-production. However, it is criticized that transportation of food from remote areas contributes to a variety of environmental impacts, e. g. increased use of energy, CO 2 emission. It is approved that an increase in food self-sufficiency rate can be an effective option to increase food security and reduce CO 2 emission. Recently, localized food production-consumption system strategies have received considerable attention in Europe, North America and Japan as a means of improving sustainability. A scientific question is how cities and the land areas needed to feed them scale in relation to city population density. Agricultural activities in the city play a vital role in provision the food, e. g. urban/peri-urban agriculture. But their products are still not enough for city need. The concept of 'city region'is necessary to consider 'sustainable city'because it integrates city and its hinterland where exist huge agricultural areas. Chinese city based on administrative boundary is an exact example of 'city region'which includes urban, suburban, and rural areas. Most Asian megacity regions are located in rich alluvial deltas that have long served as the "rice-baskets" of their respective regions. The largest Asian megacity regions are in China because of large boundary, so Chinese megacity regions make a vital contribution to Asian (and global) social and economic sustainable development. Among the Chinese megacity regions, Tianjin not only has a large territory, but a relevant large portion of agricultural areas. So the aim of this study is taken Tianjin city region as an example, to search for the 'sustainable city region'from the view point of food production. It hypnotizes that Tianjin city region will highly depend upon the local for its food provision generated from suburban and rural. Food self-sufficiency (SSR) and land areas are two indicators of localization of food production in city region. The study was carried out in China's national capital region, Tianjin, which is in the northeast part of the North China Plain and located on a low-lying alluvial plain along the mouth of the Hai River (38 ° 34 'N- 40 ° 15 'N and 116 ° 43 'E- 118 ° 04 'E). This area has not only experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization (including the famous Jing-Jin-Tang Industrial Belt), but it also has played a pioneering role as an urban development model for other Chinese cities. The main objectives of the study were (1) to identify the extent to which the region's food consumption depends on local production (Chapter 2); (2) to examine spatial-temporal and functional changes from 1993 to 2009 in terms of agricultural land use and food production in both suburban and rural areas of the city (Chapter 3); and (3) to explore whether the dependence of local consumption on local production could be improved based on the current trend of agricultural land use changes, in particular changes in paddy fields (Chapter 4). Furthermore, suggestions for how to promote a sustainable city region in Asia are discussed in Chapter 5. The main approaches were food flow analysis, landscape analysis by satellite image interpretation, and semi-structured and key informant interviews with local people. Chapter 2 examines the calculated food self-sufficiency ratio (CSSR) and observed food flow in Tianjin, divided into three areas (urban, suburban, and rural), as a case study to gain a better understanding of the extent to which a region's food consumption depends on its local production. The main objectives were to estimate the self-sufficiency within its administrative boundary by calculating a self-sufficiency ratio by the formula which is commonly used in China using statistical data at both the city region and local scales, to explore food flow at the regional scale from the information provided by local government authorities, and to observe real flows of the two primary types of arable crops (cereals and vegetables) from semi-structured household interviews at the local scale. The results show that Tianjin has experienced a rapid increase in CSSR since the 1980 s, and it appears to have the capacity to support the citizens within its borders. By 2007, the CSSR of major foods were relevant high; cereals were the lowest category which was below 100 %. Even with these high ratios, wholesalers, retailers and consumers have chosen to use and exchange products from distant areas, utilizing regional food flow. Local fresh vegetables can meet the demand in peak harvest season, farmers could still export some to other Chinese areas to increase revenue; however in off season, local fresh vegetables accounted for only 30 % of the vegetable market because of seasonality, whereas the other 70 % is supplied by other regions of China. Government imported around 70 % of total cereals consumption, not only for citizens, and also for others, e. g. stock in case of emergency. All cereal products consumed by the urban population are supplied by other regions. At the local scale, rural areas have had a surplus in all food categories studied since the 1980 s, and suburban areas have a history of high self-sufficiency for vegetables, poultry, and fish. However, a low degree of locally sourced product flow was observed. Most local cereal crops were consumed in agricultural production areas, but 50 % of vegetables produced in rural areas flowed outside of the region and did not support local consumption in Tianjin. Local agricultural production is the main driver of self-sufficiency and food flow. An accurate understanding of changes in land areas and the driving factors, especially the cereals and where the CSSRs changed dramatically, has important implications for the future of localization of food production and policy making. In Chapter 3, Landsat images are used to evaluate agricultural land use changes at the landscape scale in suburban and rural areas in Tianjin from 1993 to 2009, based on two case studies where experienced a dramatic decreasing CSSR of cereals. The main driving factors of the changes were investigated at the farm scale through a survey of local farmers. The image classification results showed an obvious loss of agricultural land since the early 1990 s in suburban areas, similar to what has occurred in other peri-urban areas in developing countries. Two other notable trends in land use, which differ from those of other peri-urban areas, were observed: (1) land was converted from the production of traditional perishable food to cereals, in this case, from vegetables to maize; and (2) there was a shift from cereals to <b>non-food</b> <b>production,</b> in this case, from paddy rice and maize to cotton. Areas for cereals production was decreased by 53 %. In rural areas, a similar shift from cereals to <b>non-food</b> <b>production</b> was noted during the study period, in this case, from rice and maize to cotton. Two other results, which differ from those of suburban areas, were found: (1) a relatively small amount of land had been converted from the production of cereals to fresh food, in this case, from maize to vegetables; and (2) recently, some land has shifted back from <b>non-food</b> <b>production</b> to the production of cereals, in this case, from cotton to rice. Areas for cereals production was decreased by 60 %. Through semi-structured household interviews, a scarcity of water was noted as an important problem for agriculture in Tianjin—this was found to be a primary factor for agricultural land use change both in suburban and rural areas. Beyond the limitation of clean water, suburban farmers had to adjust their agricultural activities by adapting to an insufficient amount of labor and the use of treated wastewater from urban areas for irrigation. Rural farmers'activities, however, were still driven by market mechanisms and government policies. Changes in local production have accounted for the trend of food self-sufficiency levels and contributed to the current regional and local pattern of food flow. Specialized vegetable production in rural areas generated an active flow from the rural areas of Tianjin to other Chinese regions, whereas the decreased production of paddy rice was only able to support consumption in the production areas themselves, so there was no local surplus to flow locally. Rice is the principle staple crop in Tianjin, and any deterioration of rice production systems would seriously impair food security. Increasing land area is one option to solve food deficit. Given some paddy fields in suburban were converted into developed areas, the possible to enlarge the production area for local consumption will be only in rural areas. Chapter 4 conducted a further study in rural areas to explore whether it would be possible to enlarge the production area for local consumption, in this case of paddy rice, to enhance food security and develop a more sustainable urban-rural system. Further understanding of the dynamics of the traditional rice-dominated agriculture area was undertaken both at the county and village level in rural areas through a comparative study of the planting area of recent annual crops, precipitation variability, and water flow. The manner in which the involved stakeholders attempt to cope with and adapt to a constantly changing environment was also determined through semi-structured and key informant interviews. With limited water flow from the outside and in response to recent historic precipitation variability, local people adjusted to both year-to-year variability and extreme events through collective and individual actions in the short term by changing planting areas and switching crops. Annual rainfall and water flow records show that a serious and continuous drought occurred during 1999 - 2003. The drought compelled farmers to shift paddy fields to field crops, and some irrigation and drainage systems were also destroyed. As they switched to less water-intensive crops (e. g. cotton), the farmers appeared to be making a relatively permanent adaptation to water stress, but in so doing, many have become more vulnerable through worsening pest and disease management and a low level of self-sufficiency. Although most villagers were willing to replant paddy rice, shifting land use back to paddy cropping to adapt to the more recent increased precipitation has not been common because of damaged irrigation and drainage systems and a lack of willingness of community leaders to maintain the systems as they previously did. Only farmers in a few villages, which maintained their properties well and had leaders who seemed aware of the importance of traditional crops, succeeded in switching back to paddy cropping again. Resilience building is important for local agricultural communities to improve the self-sufficiency. The possibility of enlarging the paddy rice production area will most likely be highly dependent on local institutions in initiating and supporting adaptations and participating in collective irrigation regimes. It was suggested that new institutional arrangements including collective irrigation regimes for rice production is necessary in order to establish localization of food production. From this study, in order to apply the localization of food production, the priority should be given to the production of rice which is the principal staple food for security. To improve rice production in Asian city region, it is important to consider both the climate fluctuation and collective irrigation regime.

To apply the results of this study, appropriate spatial boundary/size need to be considered to define the city region. 都市の持続可能性を高めるうえで、食料フローのローカライゼーション(地産地消) による域内食料自給率の向上は、食料安全保障の観点のみならず、輸送等にかかるエネルギー・二酸化炭素排出の削減を通じた低炭素社会実現の観点からもきわめて重要である。都市を取りまく農村は、食料供給をはじめとして、さまざまな生態系サービスを都市に対して提供することから、都市の後背地としての農村は都市環境の健全化をはかるうえで重要な役割を果たすことが期待されている。とりわけ、拡大を続けるアジアの大都市においては、周辺農村との食料・資源・エネルギー循環系の再構築を通じた、持続可能な都市圏形成と都市環境の健全化が喫緊の課題となっている。報告番号: 甲 27530; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(農学); 学位記番号: 博農第 3727 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学生命科学研究科生圏システム学専...|$|E
40|$|Pectin and lignin {{are both}} very {{important}} noncellulosic substances occurring in hemp fibers. The main task in preparing hemp fibers for textile applications {{is to remove}} these noncellulosic substances without damage to the fiber cellulose. Pectin and lignin in hemp before and after chemical processing are characterized by infrared spectroscopy. The influence of chemical processes, fiber regions, and alkaline boiling parameters on lignin and pectin removal are investigated in this paper. The {{results indicate that the}} alkaline boiling process is effective for removing pectin and lignin. There is no residual pectin in the fibers after the alkaline treatment, but there is a residual level of lignin. The concentration levels of both sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphite have significant effects on lignin removal, and there are variations in lignin properties and accessibility from the lower to the upper regions of the hemp stem.

The aim of this discussion paper is to explore consequences for land use and environment if biomass production will be expanded for non-food purposes in Austria. We assess the bio-physical and economic production potentials of energy crops and explore the trade-offs between bioenergy and food production on arable lands in Austria. In a policy experiment, we analyze how costly it is to expand domestic <b>non-food</b> biomass <b>production</b> by employing an integrated modeling framework using an elaborated set of bio-physical and economic data. The results indicate that an expansion of biomass production for first and second generation biofuels would imply significant adjustment costs for the agricultural sector. Furthermore, increasing feedstock production would have significant impacts on land use and fertilizer intensity levels. The economic analysis considers differences of regions and site conditions, which lead to higher opportunity costs, and hence, higher feedstock costs as assumed in previous studies. Subsidizing domestic biomass production likely leads to rising regional food and feed prices as well as factor prices (e. g. land renting) in a land constrained economy. land use competition, bioenergy, non-food and food crops, integrated modeling...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} analyse {{agricultural}} sector development in individual new EU member states {{with emphasis on}} capital stock value development in agriculture. The main objective is to identify the relationship between capital stock value development, and agricultural sector performance in the individual analysed countries. The results of the analysis are as follows. The agricultural sector has significantly changed its structure and position within the national economy of individual new EU member states in the 20 years since the early 1990 s. The size of the agricultural sector reduced {{in each of the}} analysed countries, resulting in a reduction {{in the value of the}} agricultural sector performance. Despite the significant reduction of the agricultural sector in many analysed, some became more efficient in terms of their agricultural sector performance. Individual country’s agricultural sectors became more effective and more competitive. Individual country’s agricultural sector size and performance development are closely related to capital stock value in agriculture. Both the agricultural sector structure, and agricultural sector production performance are closely related to available capital stock value. In line with the main objective of this paper, the most sensitive segments of the agricultural sector in relation to capital stock are livestock production, land development and the number of economically active persons in agriculture. Regarding sensitivity of agricultural production performance in relation to changes in capital stock value, the most sensitive are livestock <b>production</b> and <b>non-food</b> agricultural <b>production...</b>|$|R
40|$|Making our {{research}} {{more relevant to}} farmers has been {{the challenge of the}} last few years as prescriptive approaches have largely failed to increase farm level adoption of new technologies. In Eastern Uganda a partnership led by Africa 2000 Network has been developed to target technologies more accurately to farmers. The partners are Makerere University, NARO, ICRAF, TSBF/CIAT, Appropriate Technology Uganda (AT), Tororo local government, Department of Agriculture, UNFA, FOSEM, A 2 N, farmers, the District Agricultural Extension and the local administration. Farmer managed on-farm demonstrations of soil fertility replenishment technologies were used to evaluate technologies with farmers and to act as demonstration and training sites with farmers, NGO,s and extension personnel. Result highlights are presented for the use of Tithonia and legume cover crops. Incorporation of 50 % and 100 % of one season Mucuna and Canavalia fallow biomass was assessed to look at the fallow management options. Both incorporation rates of Mucuna and 100 % incorporation of Canavalia increased grain yields by more than 200 % compared to the control. Incorporation of 100 % rather than 50 % of the biomass produced in the plot did not significantly increase maize grain yields compared to the control. This would allow the farmer to produce the biomass in one place and to apply the biomass over twice the area, i. e. to use one part for incorporation and the other for biomass transfer or livestock feed. This is crucial where land sizes and fallow areas are small and little area is available for <b>non-food</b> crop <b>production.</b> Tithonia increased grain yields significantly in Kisoko sub-county only and farmers preferred to use it on high value crops where biomass transfer amounts, and hence labour requirements, are s [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The thesis explores {{differences}} among rural households in their allocation of labor {{to the different}} types of work – specifically food and <b>non-food</b> agricultural <b>production</b> and wage-jobs – and potentially related factors in the spatial transformation of a regionally distinct landscape: the densely populated settlements of scattered linpan housing in the Western Sichuan Plain around Chengdu, China. This study extends previous research that proposed indicators of agro-ecosystemic resilience based on landscape morphology in four communities exhibiting different degrees and types of change: (1) a traditional settlement form and a laissez-faire market-based practice of agriculture; (2) a traditional settlement form and an alternative community-supported agriculture (CSA) program; (3) a government-led Socialist New Countryside (SNC) redevelopment with a traditional field pattern and new housing in semi-concentrated settlements; and (4) an extreme example of SNC concentration of new housing and corporatized agricultural production. A new survey of residents in the first three of these communities finds that residents in the traditional settlements (1) and (2) tend to participate in a balance of agricultural production and wage-jobs, while residents of the SNC redevelopment tend to engage in only one or the other type of work. This finding helps further interpret data on household income, household expenditures and debt from the previous survey for the same communities. The findings imply that the linpan landscape, with its traditional agro-ecosystemic diversity and decentralized network of social and marketing relations, may support a more dynamic and locally responsive choice of livelihood for rural households, than the newer, more concentrated housing settlements do. The dynamic balance partly explains the mechanisms of resilience of the linpan landscape and suggests that planning should find ways of supporting development within the spatial framework of this landscape rather than replacing it with completely new settlements...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} and rheological properties of xanthan gum from crude glycerin fermentation, a primary by-product of the biodiesel industry with environmental and health risks, were evaluated. Batch fermentations (28 °C/ 250 rpm / 120 h) {{were carried out}} using crude glycerin, 0. 01 % urea and 0. 1 % KH 2 PO 4, (% w/v), and compared to a sucrose control under the same operational conditions, using Xanthomonas campestris strain 2103 isolate from Brazil. Its maximal production by crude glycerin fermentation was 7. 23 ± 0. 1 g·L- 1 at 120 h, with an apparent viscosity of 642. 57 mPa·s, (2 % w/v, 25 °C, 25 s- 1), 70 % and 30 % higher than from sucrose fermentation, respectively. Its molecular weight varied from 28. 2 to 36. 2 × 10 (6) Da. The Ostwald-de-Waele model parameters (K and n) indicated a pseudoplastic behavior at all concentrations (0. 5 to 2. 0 %, w/v) and temperatures (25 - 85 °C), while its consistency index indicated promising rheological properties for drilling fluid applications.

40|$|Botanical {{insecticides}} {{provide a}} multitude of chemistries {{for the development of}} new pest management products. Despite relatively low rates of expansion in botanically based pesticides, regulatory changes {{in many parts of the}} world are driving a renaissance for the development of new natural pest control products that are safer for human health and the environment. Africa is arguably the continent with the most to gain from developing natural plant-based pesticides. Hundreds of indigenous and exotic species with pesticidal properties have been reported from Africa through various farmer surveys and subsequent research, many of which have been confirmed to be active against a range of arthropod pests. Onfarm use of pesticidal plants, particularly among resource-poor smallholder farmers, is widespread and familiar to many African farmers. Until recently, the pyrethrum industry was dominated by East African production through small holder farmers, showing that <b>non-food</b> cash crop <b>production</b> of pesticidal plants is a realistic prospect in Africa when appropriate entrepreneurial investment and regulatory frameworks are established. This paper reviews the current status of research and commercialisation of pesticidal plant materials or botanically active substances that are used to control pests in Africa and establishes where major gaps lie and formulates a strategy for taking research forward in this area...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to find methods of making this side stream into extruded films, showing that products with a higher value can be produced. The study mainly considered the development of material compositions and methods of preparing and extruding the material. Wheat gluten was added as a supportive protein matrix material, together with glycerol as a plasticizer and urea as a denaturant. The extrudate was evaluated with respect to mechanical (tensile testing) and oxygen barrier properties, and the extrudate structure was revealed visually and by scanning electron microscopy. A denser, more homogeneous material had a lower oxygen transmission rate, higher strength, and higher extensibility. The most homogeneous films were made at an extruder die temperature of 125 - 130 Â°C. It is shown here that a film can be extruded with promising mechanical and oxygen barrier properties, the latter especially after a final compression molding step...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenges}} of an increasing world population accelerating food demand, biodiversity globally under threat, depleting natural resources, {{and the need}} to mitigate the effects of climate change, signal that new food for thought is needed for food and <b>non-food</b> biomass <b>production</b> systems. Sustainable intensification (SI) needs to be one element of the solution. It aims at the development of intensive agricultural systems that have minimal detrimental environmental and social effects. The VITAL project explores the transition process of European agriculture towards sustainably intensified production. This first deliverable report synthesising the results of task 1. 1 establishes the scientific framing of SI and the analytical approach of the project. We therefore analysed the literature using in-depth as well as systematic approaches and developed a conceptual-scenario framework of sustainable intensification. The aim is to establish an anchoring point to assess the implementation of SI at farm and regional scale and to enable an up-scaling of the results to the European level. The conceptual-scenario framework was validated by a group of regional stakeholders in order to ensure its applicability to practice and to develop a common science-practice understanding. We found that the understanding on what SI is and how it should be achieved varies in the literature and overlap with other concepts of sustainable agriculture, such as ecological intensification or agroecology, is debated. However, in this report we demonstrate that the discussed measures and concepts of sustainable intensification can be clustered alongside two dimensions: from the farm/local to the landscape/regional level and from land-use optimization to structural optimization. Using these two dimensions, we conceptualize four different scenarios of SI which we label sustainable intensification pathways (SIP). SIP I “Agronomic Development” and SIP II “Resource Use Efficiency” address land-use and structural optimization respectively on the farm level. On the regional scale we derive SIP III “Land Use Allocation” and SIP IV “Regional Integration”. The consulted local stakeholders were able to assign local solutions to each SIP. Based on the conceptual-scenario framework, an analytical line is drawn between SI implementation, evaluation and up-scaling defining the process of the project in a common analytical framework...|$|R
40|$|Purpose This paper aims to reveal, and {{contribute}} to an understanding of, the processes that connect learning and innovation networks in sustainable agriculture to elements of the mainstream agricultural regime. Drawing on the innovations and transition literature, the paper frames the analysis around niche-regime interaction using the notion of niche-regime compatibility. Design/Methodology/approach 17 Learning and Innovation Networks for Sustainable Agriculture (LINSA) (engaged in agricultural food <b>production,</b> <b>non-food</b> and rural development) were analysed. In line with the project’s transdisciplinary approach data were collected {{in a series of}} participatory workshops. Findings Five modes of LINSA-regime interaction are distinguished based on compatibility. The level of LINSA-regime compatibility influences the extent of the diffusion of LINSA ideas and practices into the regime. However, interaction processes within these modes reveal multiple and diverse connections between LINSA and regime entities suggesting a more complex relationship exists. Practical Implications A range of connecting processes and activities (for example, certification, exemption from regulation, facilitation of networking) can bring about effective LINSA-regime interaction and could be externally supported. Originality/Value Empirical evidence from 17 case studies provides valuable insights from a number of different contexts across Europe. By directing analysis of interaction at the level of LINSA (niche project), rather than at the macro level, the study offers an original perspective. It suggests that the transition to sustainable agriculture might be understood as a complex of interactive processes leading to a series of adaptive changes, rather than as regime change...|$|R
40|$|Rice is {{the staple}} food of {{almost half of}} the world population, and in excess 90 % of it is grown and {{consumed}} in Asia, but the disposal of rice straw poses a problem for farmers, who often burn it in the fields, causing health and environmental problems. However, with increased focus on the development of sustainable biofuel production, rice straw has been recognized as a potential feedstock for <b>non-food</b> derived biofuel <b>production.</b> Currently, the commercial realization of rice as a biofuel feedstock is constrained by the high cost of industrial saccharification processes needed to release sugar for fermentation. This study is focused on the alteration of lignin content, and cell wall chemotypes and structures, and their effects on the saccharification potential of rice lignocellulosic biomass. A recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population derived from a cross between the lowland rice variety IR 1552 and the upland rice variety Azucena with 271 molecular markers for quantitative trait SNP (QTS) analyses was used. After association analysis of 271 markers for saccharification potential, 1 locus and 4 pairs of epistatic loci were found to contribute to the enzymatic digestibility phenotype, and an inverse relationship between reducing sugar and lignin content in these recombinant inbred lines was identified. As a result of QTS analyses, several cell-wall associated candidate genes are proposed that may be useful for marker-assisted breeding and may aid breeders to produce potential high saccharification rice varieties...|$|R
40|$|Background Lignocellulosic biomass {{has been}} {{investigated}} as a renewable <b>non-food</b> source for <b>production</b> of biofuels. A significant technical challenge to using lignocellulose {{is the presence of}} microbial growth inhibitors generated during pretreatment processes. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are potential precursors for lipid-based biofuel production. Rhodococcus opacus MITXM- 61 is an oleaginous bacterium capable of producing large amounts of TAGs on high concentrations of glucose and xylose present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. However, this strain is sensitive to ligonocellulose-derived inhibitors. To understand the toxic effects of the inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, strain MITXM- 61 was examined for tolerance toward the potential inhibitors and was subjected to adaptive evolution for the resistance to the inhibitors. Results We investigated growth-inhibitory effects by potential lignocellulose-derived inhibitors of phenols (lignin, vanillin, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde (4 -HB), syringaldehyde), furans (furfural and 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -furaldehyde), and organic acids (levulinic acid, formic acid, and acetic acid) on the growth and TAG production of strain MITXM- 61. Phenols and furans exhibited potent inhibitory effects at a concentration of 1 g L[superscript − 1], while organic acids had insignificant impacts at concentrations of up to 2 g L[superscript − 1]. In an attempt to improve the inhibitor tolerance of strain MITXM- 61, we evaluated the adaptation of this strain to the potential inhibitors. Adapted mutants were generated on defined agar media containing lignin, 4 -HB, and syringaldehyde. Strain MITXM- 61 [superscript SHL 33] with improved multiple resistance of lignin, 4 -HB, and syringaldehyde was constructed through adaptive evolution-based strategies. The evolved strain exhibited a two- to threefold increase in resistance to lignin, 4 -HB, and syringaldehyde at 50 % growth-inhibitory concentrations, compared to the parental strain. When grown in genuine lignocellulosic hydrolysates of corn stover, wheat straw, and hardwood containing growth inhibitors, strain MITXM- 61 [superscript SHL 33] exhibited a markedly shortened lag phase in comparison with that of strain MITXM- 61. Conclusion This study provides important clues to overcome the negative effects of inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydrolysates on TAG production of R. opacus cells. The findings can contribute to significant progress in detoxified pretreatment of hydrolysates and development of more efficient strains for industrial TAG fermentations of R. opacus using lignocellulosic biomass.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} challenges facing the world today is how to sustainably feed a growing population while conserving the ecosystem services we depend on. Coffee landscapes are an important site for research on agrifood systems because they reflect global-scale dynamics surrounding conservation and livelihood development. Within them, we find both what is broken in our global agrifood system, {{as well as the}} grassroots struggles that strive to change the system by building socio-ecologically resilient, sustainable livelihoods. Research shows that smallholder shade coffee farmers steward high biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services. At the same time, studies in the last decade demonstrate that many smallholder coffee farmers in Mesoamerica suffer annual periods of seasonal hunger, as well as pervasive poverty. This dissertation explores household livelihood strategies, with a particular emphasis on agroecology, and how they can contribute to build sustainable systems that secure food and maintain biodiversity in coffee communities of Chiapas, Mexico. Research was conducted using a mixed methods approach, which included the collection of quantitative and qualitative socio-ecological data through focus groups, surveys, semi-structured interviews, participant observation and plant inventories. Surveys were conducted with 79 households in 11 communities, all located within the buffer zone of a biosphere reserve. A stratified random sample of 31 households from these 79 were surveyed again to collect more in-depth data, including the collection of biophysical data in their subsistence and coffee land use systems. The following research questions were explored: 1) What are the major ecological, social, economic, and political drivers of seasonal hunger? 2) What is the relationship between agrobiodiversity (plant and livestock diversity) and food security (months of adequate household food provisioning and dietary diversity) ? 3) What household livelihood assets and strategies contribute to or limit food security and food sovereignty? Across the sample population, total agrobiodiversity and maize and bean production were strongly correlated with improved food security. Coffee income was not strongly correlated with improved food security, which suggests that income is used for priorities within the household other than food, despite seasonal food shortages. Results demonstrate the importance of balancing subsistence and commodity (i. e. coffee) production in these communities, where subsistence food serves as a risk management strategy to buffer against volatility in coffee prices, in addition to offsetting income that might be used for food towards <b>non-food</b> expenses. Subsistence <b>production,</b> which typically applies agroecological practices in this site, also holds important cultural and environmental value. The results of this research indicate that government policy and development practice should enable farmers to maintain the social, ecological and cultural processes that support the management of agrobiodiversity for subsistence and coffee...|$|R
