5|$|Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited is a 1999 {{biography}} of American General Samuel Chapman Armstrong and his associated normal school for freedmen, Hampton Institute, written by Robert Francis Engs {{and published by}} the University of Tennessee Press.

5|$|The Mardikh III {{population}} was predominately Semitic Amorite.

The Amorite Eblaites worshiped many of the same deities as the Eblaites of earlier periods, and maintained the sanctity of the acropolis {{in the center of the}} city. The third kingdom's iconography and royal ideology were under the influence of Yamhad's culture; kingship was received from the Yamhadite deities instead of Ishtar of Ebla, which is evident by the Eblaite seals of Indilimma's period.|$|E
