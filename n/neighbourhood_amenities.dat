40|$|Transport {{planning}} {{is an integral}} part of most Australian planning programs. This paper summarises research conducted at Griffith University in 2009 on teaching and learning in transport planning education. A detailed examination of learning objectives is used to frame the problem, drawn from course outlines in Australian and US planning programs. Where once transport planning education was narrowly focused on predicting and planning for roadway capacity, the subject now encompasses a wider set of problems including sustainability, equity, <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>amenity</b> and health (Handy et al. 2002 :piii). Learning objectives therefore include: understandings of planning theory, and how these relate to transportation planning; understandings of key concepts in transportation and land use planning; practical skills in capturing information on travel behaviour, in analysing that data, and in modelling and simulation to predict transport futures; and, other educational goals, including academic writing, statistical skill development, and presentation skills. The paper explores how these learning objectives can best be met, using examples provided by Frank (2002), Flyvberg (2001), Van Zuelen (2000) and Rose (2006). Recent changes to the Griffith University course in line with these approaches are then examined in detail, noting both their advantages and their significant limitations.

This multi-layered process examined: (1) the remains of the neighbourhood's ecological structure; (2) the existing infrastructure (including storm water, sewers, streets, etc.); (3) transit improvements and needs; (4) land use and zoning; (5) issues of crime; and (6) housing needs (especially problems in existing 2 storey apartments). The analysis led to three major physical design proposals which integrate new streets, parks and houses to create a safe, convenient and pedestrian-oriented neighbourhood through: (1) removing a deteriorating shopping mall and re-building a pre-existing wetland. The park created through this intervention reconnects the neighbourhood, 14 to its ecological structure and creates a <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>amenity,</b> attracting new investment interests; (2) building a neighbourhood transit node with limited bus way to downtown and commercial niche, which attracts new development and balances the needs of people, transit and cars; and (3) inserting distinct neighbourhood streets which act as armatures to focus the rehabilitation of existing apartments and the development of diverse new housing types. ...|$|R

Rental values are also useful in combination with sales values, where the rent–sales ratio provides an indication of the health, not only of the local housing market, but also the wider economy [15, 16].

40|$|This study proposes an {{alternative}} approach to estimate excess travel using activity diaries, extending it to non-work travel and capturing interhousehold variation. Central to this approach is a residential relocation exercise that helps to decompose the amount of travel by a household into two types of travel: required and excess travel. An empirical demonstration of the approach in North Carolina shows that on average 30 per cent of households' travel {{in the study area}} is in excess. Furthermore, lower levels of required and excess travel are found among households living in neighbourhoods with more compact development patterns, suggesting that households in such neighbourhoods are able to concentrate daily destinations in relatively smaller geographical areas and achieve better spatial co-ordination between residential and activity locations. Results also indicate that households make trade-offs between travel efficiency and <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>amenities</b> such as security and school quality, suggesting the importance of social dimensions in addressing transport problems. ...|$|E

The present paper examines such influences in a microscopic scale. In this study {{the role of}} socio-economic factors is also studies and {{compared to that of}} urban form. Two case-study neighbourhoods in west of Tehran are selected and considered, first of which is a centralized and compact neighbourhood and the other is a sprawled and centreless one. A Multinomial Logit Regression model is developed to consider the effects of socio-economic and land use factors on urban travel pattern. In addition, to consider the effective factors, cross-sectional comparison between the influences of local accessibility and attractiveness of the neighbourhoodcentres of the two case-study areas are undertaken. Also the causality relationships are considered according to the findings of the survey. The findings indicate significant effects of age and household income as socio-economic factors on transportation mode choice in neighbourhoods with central structure. One the other hand, no meaningful association between socio-economic or land use variables are resulted by the model for the sprawled case. The most effective land use concept in micro-scale is considered to be satisfaction of entertainment facilities of the neighbourhood. Also the descriptive findings show that the centralized neighbourhood that gives more local accessibility to shops and retail generates less shopping trips. In considering the causal relations, the study shows that providing neighbourhood infrastructures that increase or ease the accessibility to <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>amenities</b> can lead to higher shares of sustainable transportation modes like walking, biking, or public transportation use...|$|E

The provision of basic amenities and services to accommodate the increasing population is among the major challenge of successive government in Nigeria. The property or rental values are influenced by residents’ willingness to pay (WTP) for both <b>neighbourhood</b> and environmental <b>amenities</b> or characteristics. The aim of this dissertation is to evaluate the tenant willingness to pay for intangible environmental amenities in Anguwan Rogo-Anguwan Rimi Jos, Nigeria. A questionnaire survey was used with 389 household as total respondents, only 369 questionnaire were return and used for analysis. Among the 11 environmental variable, only 4 are found as amenities to be improved in the study area. Correlation {{analysis was used to}} find the relationship between monthly income and the willingness to pay for environmental variables. Among the 11 variables, only 3 seem to have significant relationship with the monthly income. This are electricity, household size and educational standard. The rental model was developed of willingness to pay environmental amenities using hedonic pricing concept, were the R value is 0. 98 and the adjusted R 2 value is 0. 96 meaning that 96 % of variance in WTP is predicted by all the 12 variables. The F value is 749. 71 which is statistically significant. Out of the 12 independent variable, 7 variables are statistically significant.

40|$|The {{vision of}} any housing {{policy is to}} provide liveable housing be it for the high, middle or low-income groups that are always underserved in terms of basic amenities. In the 21 st century, the nature of living {{conditions}} {{in most of the}} public housing estates in Nigeria and Niger state in particular seems to be not any better off. The quality of living places, or cities, neighbourhoods or housing estates are linked with their physical environment, safety, social cohesion and infrastructure provided in the area. Studying the residential neighbourhood quality of public housing estates, the people living there are important. People living in a particular place receive direct effects from the changes of environment and development in their area. They know whether their housing environment status is either good or bad or change from time to time. Housing encompasses all that is necessary to make a living in a particular place pleasurable, and not a burden. It is however seen {{as an extension of the}} human frame that should respond to the needs of its inhabitants. Thus, housing serves as one of the best indicators of a person’s standard of living. Considering the above, satisfaction with housing neighbourhood environment indicates an environment that meets the needs and aspirations of the users and dissatisfaction means the needs and aspirations of the users were not met. No housing programme or policy can be considered successful only in terms of quantity constructed. Equally as important are the suitability of the residential environment, facilities and services to the users. Therefore, this study examined neighbourhood living conditions in three public low-income housing estates using data derived from household survey involving 366 respondents out of 400 questionnaires distributed based on stratified proportional sampling technique. The structured questionnaires were distributed face-to-face and collected back after completion either immediately or the following day. The data sought through questionnaires include different dimensions and indicators of good neighbourhood quality (liveability) as elicited from the literature review. Based on desktop literature, the study used both subjective and objective measurements to investigate the liveability of the selected housing estates. Issues examined include the home environment, <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>amenities,</b> economic vitality, social environment and civic protection. The data analysis techniques used include descriptive statistics, factor analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM). The outcome of the perception of residents’ in these selected housing estates can give a clue to the quality of the environment and serves as a feedback to be injected to housing policy for future development. Further, it could be used as an improvement tool as the study reveals the situation of the estates investigated...|$|E
40|$|In New Zealand, the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) is {{the guiding}} {{legislation}} that sets {{out how the}} environment is managed. The territorial authorities are charged with regulating how the environment is managed in their jurisdiction. In order to effectively manage any resource, good and robust planning processes are required. Population change is the factor that has {{the greatest impact on}} the environment, {{and is one of the}} most challenging to regulate, thus for the territorial authority planners, knowing where and when infrastructure investment is most likely required is key to fulfilling their statutory requirement. This line of investigation has been driven by an ever increasing need for more spatially detailed projections of where and when changes are most likely to take place. The investigation and subsequent development of spatially detailed household projections transcends three territorial authorities in the lower Waikato river catchment situated in New Zealand. An agent-based model was developed in which the individual agents were households. The aim of the model was to produce a simplified simulation of the location choices made by the members of a household in a housing market that is governed by: councils’ infrastructure provision, household rents, transport costs and the benefit derived from the <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>amenities</b> and the environment. This model simulates the distribution of households over a twelve year period from 2013 to 2025. In the model the households were programmed to move to vacant properties in order to minimise their residential costs. Each time an agent moves this provides new potential options for all other households; thus the simulation runs and the households move until all households settle in their least cost locations, representing the distribution of households in 2025. The incorporation of multiple territorial authorities provides a more holistic approach than the prevailing approach which is based on disaggregating top level projection with the no further account of population movement outside the top-level migration assumption. The results of the model calibration indicate the model performs well with a 16. 6 % RMSE at the smallest spatial unit. The projected results produce growth patterns that fall within the expectations of planning staff of the councils. These staff members have affirmed the model’s and input assumptions, and indicate the outcomes to be both useful and plausible. The results demonstrate the relationship between the councils and their respective growth plan strategies. The scenarios developed demonstrate the relationship between the availability of vacant land and the cost to occupy a property, which ultimately impacts the flux of residents to or away from the city. With some broad assumptions and limitations, this model is distinctive in its approach as it is developed with the intention of being an applied tool to be used by the three councils. It has further distinction as modelling the behaviours of individual households rather than the behaviours of an entire population, which is the unique in New Zealand and amongst a few applied models of this nature world-wide (Triantakonstantis & Mountrakis, 2012) ...|$|E

However, it is often not clear what processes underlie the relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and individual health. In this study we explore the association between neighbourhood socio-economic status and self-rated health using the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Survey (n= 10, 892). We found that the association between neighbourhood deprivation and self-rated health was substantially reduced after adjusting for individual socio-economic status, but remained statistically significant. This suggests that the health effects of neighbourhood deprivation are partly contextual. We also found that the association between neighbourhood deprivation and self-rated health was further attenuated when controlling for perceptions of the neighbourhood and of housing problems, suggesting that these variables may play a role in mediating the health effects of neighbourhood deprivation. The implications of the results are that health policy should target 'places' as well as 'people'; and that policies aimed at improving the quality of housing, access to <b>amenities,</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> safety, and social cohesion may help to reduce health inequalities...|$|R

NSA measures are, however, susceptible to numerous methodological problems. We investigate one methodological issue, aggregation error, {{as it relates to the}} measurement of NSA. Aggregation error arises when, for the purpose of distance calculations, a single point is used to represent a neighbourhood, which in turn represents an aggregation of spatially distributed individuals. NSA to three types of recreational amenities (playgrounds, community halls, and leisure centres) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada is used to assess whether aggregation error affects NSA measures. The authors use exploratory spatial data analysis techniques, including local indicators of spatial association, to examine aggregation-error effects on NSA. By integrating finer resolution data into NSA measures, we demonstrate that aggregation error does affect NSA indicators, but that the effect depends on the type of amenity under investigation. Aggregation error is particularly problematic when measuring NSA to amenities that are abundant and have highly localized service areas, such as playgrounds. We recommend that, when analyzing NSA to these types of amenities, researchers integrate finer resolution data to indicate the spatial distribution of individuals within neighbourhoods better, and hence reduce aggregation error. ...|$|R

Methods Data from the cross-sectional Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Survey were analysed using multilevel modelling, with individuals nested within enumeration districts. In {{this study we}} used the responses of people under 75 years of age (n = 10, 892). The response rate of this subgroup was 62. 3 %. All individual responses were geo-referenced to the 325 census enumeration districts of Caerphilly county borough. Results The neighbourhood attributes of poor access to <b>amenities,</b> poor <b>neighbourhood</b> quality, neighbourhood disorder, lack of social cohesion, and neighbourhood deprivation were associated with the reporting of poor health. These effects were attenuated when controlling for individual and collective socio-economic status. Lack of social cohesion significantly increased the odds of women reporting poor health, but did not increase the odds of men reporting poor health. In contrast, unemployment significantly affected men's health, but not women's health. Conclusion This study shows that different aspects of the neighbourhood environment are associated with people's self rated health, which may partly reflect the health impacts of neighbourhood socio-economic status.

Neighbourhood walkability was evaluated through participant reports, in-field audits, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) -derived measures, and the Walk Score®. Relationships between walkability and daily steps were estimated using Bayesian longitudinal hierarchical linear regression models (n = 131). Participants who reported living in the most compared to the least walkable neighbourhoods completed 1345 more steps/day (95 % Credible Interval: 718, 1976; Quartiles 4 versus 1). Those living in the most compared to the least walkable neighbourhoods (based on GIS-derived walkability) completed 606 more steps per day (95 % CrI: 8, 1203). No statistically significant associations with steps were observed for audit-assessed walkability or the Walk Score®. Adults with type 2 diabetes who perceived their neighbourhoods as more walkable accumulated more daily steps. This suggests that knowledge of local neighborhood features that enhance walking is a meaningful predictor of higher levels of walking and an important component of neighbourhood walkability...|$|R
40|$|Background Victorian {{architecture}} and built {{form in the}} UK can be quite varied in its appearance, yet is often praised by scholars and the design professions for its durability, flexibility and adaptability to changing circumstances. Although not evidenced in the literature, such neighbourhoods also possess many of the qualities that are important for walkability. Aim The {{aim of the research}} was to ascertain whether UK neighbourhoods containing a moderate proportion of Victorian {{architecture and}} built form characteristics were more walkable than neighbourhoods with less, or no, Victorian architecture. Method Researchers selected 12 neighbourhoods in three UK cities (4 neighbourhoods in each city) with varying proportions of Victorian architecture and built form characteristics. Using the app-based version of the Irvine-Minnesota Inventory, which contains approximately 290 subjective and objective questions concerning walkability in the urban environment, approximately 40 streets in each neighbourhood were audited. The collected data then was analysed along 10 urban design categories – form, density, proximity, connectivity, parks and public spaces, pedestrian amenities, personal safety, traffic safety, aesthetics and recreational facilities – {{to determine the extent of}} each neighbourhood’s walkability. Results Within each city, the neighbourhoods with the highest proportion of Victorian architecture and built form characteristics were perceived to be the most walkable. Examining the urban design categories in more detail, these same neighbourhoods also had the best form and densities, conducive to walkability, and the closest proximity to relevant services and infrastructures. There were modest correlations between these <b>neighbourhoods</b> and pedestrian <b>amenities,</b> traffic safety and aesthetics. Conclusions Neighbourhoods containing at least a moderate amount of Victorian architecture and built form characteristics appear to foster walkability. As such, they offer design and policy lessons for urban planners and designers, architects, developers and local authorities as they look to create more liveable communities for the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to provide a clearer understanding of the non-shelter impacts of housing, and in particular of the possible processes by which aspects of housing may impact on aspects of schooling. The intention is not to prove a causal relationship, rather to shed light on mechanisms. To that end the approach taken is qualitative, involving in-depth semi-structured interviews with a sample of public housing tenants and a smaller group of educators. This thesis begins with an examination of previous research around this topic. This review identifies past studies that highlight the possible negative effects of transience as a contributor to isolation; the role that neighbourhood may play in encouraging or discouraging the valuing of schooling; a possible link between crowding and punitive parenting practices; and the impact that high housing costs can have on stress levels and therefore health. This thesis details research that builds on this earlier body of work. Given findings from earlier studies (in particular the importance of neighbourhood effects identified in some United States� studies), a sampling framework was developed to ensure a reasonable number of households who had experienced a change in neighbourhood as well as housing conditions. As well, an interview schedule was developed to provide a framework to ensure that possible pathways between housing and schooling identified in earlier research would be explored in these interviews. Public tenants were chosen as the population group from which to draw the interview sample, as this group have undergone a significant housing change (when they moved into public housing), and their income levels increase the chances of them having lived in poor quality housing in the past. A small number of interviews with educators were also conducted. Schools were chosen randomly from outer suburbs where poor quality housing and transience were expected to impact on school populations. As well an inner-city school in a gentrifying suburb was also selected for interview. These interviews identified four main themes � transience, housing <b>amenity,</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> and cost. Transience may be a significant problem for children who are already struggling in the school system, especially those who are receiving school based remediation. For these children, moving house may interrupt important remediation work at school, and may result in children falling further and further behind their peers. Also, transience may contribute to family stress levels which may impact on health and happiness, thereby reducing motivation and levels of school attendance. Housing amenity can impact on health, as a result of injuries related to poorly maintained or designed housing, from stress associated with noise and broken sleep, and from insect born illnesses due to the absence of insect screens. Possibly the most significant housing amenity related health impact seems to be due to the link between asthma, and dust and mildew. Neighbourhood seems to have {{the potential to be a}} significant positive and negative force in people�s lives. Supportive neighbours can make single parenting much less stressful, for example by helping with child-care, increasing the sense of safety, and reducing isolation. Hostile neighbours, on the other hand, can create levels of stress that may force adults and children indoors to avoid conflict. High housing costs can cause significant stress for families. For those who are already suffering from stress this additional pressure may contribute to stress related ill-health. As well, these families may not be able to afford to eat properly, and may not be able to afford to pay for extra-curricula activities such as school outings, dance classes etc. Poor diet may contribute to increased incidents of illness, and extra days missed from school. These insights suggest some changed approaches to the design and delivery of housing assistance in Australia, so as to maximise the non-shelter benefits of such interventions...|$|R
