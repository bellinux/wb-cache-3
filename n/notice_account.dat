40|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, police, magistrates, reformers {{and the press}} noticed {{a rising tide of}} {{juvenile}} crime. Child-stripping, the crime of stealing young children's clothes by force or deception, was an activity of this type which caused alarm among contemporaries. As the century progressed, improved policing, urbanization and Irish migration, allied to growing social concern, caused more cases of child-stripping to be <b>noticed.</b> <b>Accounts</b> by Dickens, Mayhew and others characterized child-stripping as an activity indulged in by old women who were able to make money by victimizing the weakest strata of society. However, research in the British Library's digitized newspaper collections as well as in parliamentary papers conclusively demonstrates that child-stripping, far from being the domain of Dickensian crones, was actually perpetrated by older children, notably girls, against children even younger than themselves. Despite widespread revulsion, which at times approached a ‘moral panic’ prompted {{by the nature of the}} crime, progressive attitudes largely prevailed with most child-stripping children being sent to reformatories or industrial schools in the hope of reforming their behaviour. This article thus conforms with Foucauldian notions of the switch from physical to mental punishments and aligns with the Victorians’ invention of children as a category of humanity that could be saved...|$|R

40|$|Self-representational {{theories}} of consciousness hold that a mental phenomenon is conscious if, and only if, it presents, among other things, itself. But in conscious perception one may lose oneself in the object perceived {{and not be}} aware of one’s perceiving. The paper develops a Brentano-inspired response to this objection. He follows Aristotle in holding that one is aware of one’s perceiving only ‘on the side’: when one perceives something one’s perception neither is nor can become observation of itself. I argue that the arguments Brentano gave for this claim in Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint are wanting. However, a promising argument emerges if one takes Brentano’s conception of <b>noticing</b> into <b>account...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor sexually and {{directly}} transmitted infectious diseases, social connections influence transmission because they determine contact between individuals. For pathogens that are indirectly transmitted by arthropod vectors, {{the movement of}} the vectors is thought to diminish the role of social connections. Results from a recent study of mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV), however, indicate that human movement alone can explain significant spatial variation in urban transmission rates. Because movement patterns are structured by social ties, this result suggests that social proximity may be a good predictor of infection risk for DENV and other pathogens transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Here we investigated the effect of socially structured movement on DENV transmission using a spatially explicit, agent-based transmission model. When individual movements overlap to a high degree within social groups we were able to recreate infection patterns similar to those detected in dengue-endemic, northeastern Peru. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that social proximity drives fine-scale heterogeneity in DENV transmission rates, a result that was robust to the influence of mosquito dispersal. This heterogeneity in transmission caused by socially structured movements appeared to be hidden by the diffusive effect of mosquito dispersal in aggregated infection dynamics, which implies this heterogeneity could be present and active in real dengue systems without being easily <b>noticed.</b> <b>Accounting</b> for socially determined, overlapping human movements could substantially improve the efficiency and efficacy of dengue surveillance and disease prevention programs as well as result in more accurate estimates of important epidemiological quantities, such as R 0...|$|R
40|$|In {{trying to}} prepare {{the account of the}} Myrtaceae for PULLE’s Flora of Suriname I soon found that a {{revision}} of the Myrtaceae of whole Guiana, especially of French Guiana, and preferably also of the Amazonian district, is necessary. The account would be of little value as long as our knowledge of the synonymy and the distribution of the species is so incomplete. The Myrtaceae of Guiana have been treated by BERG in Linnaea XXVII (1855 — 56) p. 1 — 512, XXIX (1858) p. 207 — 256 and XXX (1861) p. 647 — 713. Yet many species previously described from French Guiana, especially by AUBLET and by DE CANDOLLE, were not known to BERG. Moreover, BERG often based species on insufficient material, as has been pointed out by URBAN in his revision of the West Indian Myrtaceae in Engl. Bot. Jahrb. XIX (1895) p. 563. In this publication of URBAN the synonymy of several species common to the West Indies and Guiana is cleared up (Trinidad and Tobago are included in the West Indies). Another valuable contribution is SAGOT’s too little <b>noticed</b> <b>account</b> of the Myrtaceae of French Guiana in Annales Sciences Naturelles 6. 20 (1885) p. 181 — 198. But SAGOT apparently did not know BERG’s last publication in Linnaea XXX, in which RICHARD’s collection from French Guiana is treated. Thus SAGOT sometimes cites specimens of RICHARD without knowing that they must be duplicates of the types of one of BERG’s new species and his account remains very incomplete...|$|R

It is not absolutely true that even rank is entirely forgotten in French society, though I think it sufficiently so to prevent any deference to it from being offensive.

Exploring the methodological practice of a designer-researcher, this project is driven to adopt and adapt studio-based methods and reflection-based research interventions that will promote the synergetic relationship between speculation and reflection. In <b>noticing</b> and <b>accounting</b> for the designer’s reflective conversation with the research situation, the project proposes strategies for how the back talk of a reflective design practice might be productively amplified to establish resonance and facilitate the external consultation of practitioner-led research...|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} of demand loans and deposits {{is crucial in}} measuring a bank’s actual exposure to the interest rate risk in the banking book. The repricing gap model, the most popular approach to measure this kind of risk, {{is based on a}} maturity/repricing schedule, according to which interest-sensitive assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions are allotted into different time bands, based on their maturity or time remaining to their next repricing. Due to the possibility for the depositor (borrower) to withdraw (drain) the money without any <b>notice,</b> these <b>accounts</b> should be allotted in the “at sight” time band. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that bank interest rates are characterized by a sluggish and sometimes asymmetric reaction to changes in the market rates. To overcome this limit, we first develop an error correction model to study the interest rate pass-through for the Italian banking system, with specific regard to the retail bank interest rates on the sight deposits and on the overdraft accounts; then, we translate the response dynamic of the interest rates of these two items into coefficients that we use to allot them in the regulatory maturity ladder, thus making the distribution process much more realistic...|$|R
