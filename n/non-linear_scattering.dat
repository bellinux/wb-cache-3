40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} a theoretical model of ship interaction with heavy seas. In the model the <b>non-linear</b> <b>scattering</b> problem of wave-ship interaction is formulated and solved in the time domain {{on the basis of the}} weak scatterer hypothesis and with the use of the method of modal potentials. This results in a <b>non-linear</b> <b>scattering</b> problem with respect to the oncoming wave potential (and, therefore, amplitude), which is reduced to a quasi-linear form by means of the modal potentials method. In this way the conceptual framework of the practising naval architect i expanded to cover the non-linear and transient flow phenomena related to ship motions in waves. On that basis, an efficient numerical model is developed which utilizes the latest achievements in the development of methods for the computation of radiation potentials and forces, but does not require a super-computer processing capability.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between light and matter is usually modeled by approximating the material under study as a continuum. The {{magnitude of the}} material's polarization {{in the presence of}} an electric field is dependent on the atomic response via the well-known Lorentz-Lorentz relation. These continuous medium models can be used to see many light-matter effects including non-linear interactions. The goal of this thesis is to adapt and use novel computational methods to explore the microscopic origins of non-linear optical effects.
