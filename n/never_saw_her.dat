5|$|Napoleon and Marie Louise {{remained}} married {{until his}} death, {{though she did}} not join him in exile on Elba and thereafter <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> husband again. The couple had one child, Napoleon Francis Joseph Charles (1811–1832), known from birth as the King of Rome. He became Napoleon II in 1814 and reigned for only two weeks. He was awarded {{the title of the}} Duke of Reichstadt in 1818 and died of tuberculosis aged 21, with no children.|$|E
5|$|Albert and his elder brother, Ernest, {{spent their}} youth {{in a close}} {{companionship}} marred by their parents' turbulent marriage and eventual separation and divorce. After their mother was exiled from court in 1824, she married her lover, Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Polzig and Beiersdorf. She presumably <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> children again, and died of cancer {{at the age of}} 30 in 1831. The following year, their father married his own niece, his sons' cousin Princess Antoinette Marie of Württemberg; their marriage was not close, however, and Antoinette Marie had little—if any—impact on her stepchildren's lives.|$|E
5|$|Selena's {{family was}} interviewed by Julie Chen of The Early Show about Ones. Chen asked Selena's father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla Jr., about his {{intention}} to re-release her songs on Ones. Quintanilla, Jr. told Chen {{that because of the}} success of the 1997 biopic about Selena's life, many new fans know who she was. Chris Pérez, her widower, told Chen that the recording was released for Selena's new fans; building on the film's popularity, explaining that the family used the DVD to showcase the singer for those who <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> perform live.|$|E

5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, {{and in that}} summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When {{the time came to}} leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of his}} life, and he never remarried.|$|E
5|$|James's father, Darnley, {{was murdered}} on 10 February 1567 at Kirk o' Field, Edinburgh, perhaps in revenge {{for the killing}} of Rizzio. James {{inherited}} his father's titles of Duke of Albany and Earl of Ross. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her. In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in Loch Leven Castle; she <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> son again. She was forced to abdicate on 24 July 1567 in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half-brother, James Stewart, Earl of Moray, as regent.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was reached between Elizabeth's and Polish delegates in Sieradz on 26 February 1383. The queen dowager thereby proposed her youngest daughter Hedwig as Louis' successor in Poland, and absolved the Polish nobles from their 1382 oaths to Mary and Sigismund. She agreed to send Hedwig to be crowned in Kraków but requested that, in view of her age, she spend three more years in Buda following the ceremony. The Poles, entangled in a bloody civil war, initially conceded to the requirement, but soon found it unacceptable for their monarch to reside abroad for so long. At the second meeting in Sieradz, held on 28 March, they contemplated offering the crown to Hedwig's distant relative, Duke SiemowitIV of Masovia. They eventually opted against it, but at the third Sieradz meeting, on 16 June, Siemowit himself decided to lay claim to the crown. Elizabeth reacted by having an army of 12,000 men devastate Masovia in August, forcing him to drop his pretensions. Meanwhile, {{she realized that she}} could not expect the nobles to accept her request and instead resolved to delay Hedwig's departure. Despite continuous Polish demands to expedite her arrival, Hedwig did not move to Kraków until the end of August 1384. She was crowned on 16 October 1384. No regent was appointed, and the 10-year-old exercised her authority according to the advice of Kraków magnates. Elizabeth <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again.|$|E

He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life. Ada was not shown the family portrait of her father (covered in green shroud) until her twentieth birthday. Her mother became Baroness Wentworth in her own right in 1856.|$|E
25|$|The {{victims of}} the first attack, Jimmy Hollis and Mary Jeanne Larey, were the only victims to give a {{description}} of their attacker. They described him as being six feet tall with a white mask over his face with holes cut out for his eyes and mouth. Although Hollis believed {{he was a young}} dark-tanned white man under 30 years old, Larey believed he was a light-skinned African-American. The only other surviving victim was Katie Starks, but she <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> assailant. Since Hollis and Larey were the only survivors to give a description, it cannot be known if the killer wore a mask during the other attacks.|$|E

25|$|On 1 November 1541 Cranmer {{revealed}} {{these matters}} {{in a letter}} to the King. The King immediately ordered that the Queen be confined to her apartments, and <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again. The Dowager Duchess, hearing reports of what had happened while Catherine had been under her lax guardianship, reasoned that 'If there be none offence sithence the marriage, she cannot die for that was done before'. Unfortunately for the Queen and the Dowager Duchess, further investigations by Cranmer and the Council revealed that with the connivance of one of her attendants, Lady Rochford, Catherine had allegedly had an affair with Thomas Culpeper, one of the King's favourite gentlemen of the privy chamber, after her marriage to the King.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, eighteen-year-old Amber Murray {{placed an}} {{advertisement}} in the Sydney Morning Herald {{in search of}} a mother to adopt a baby boy. Murray was unable to care for her illegitimate son Horace, born on 30 May of that year, and offered to cover child support expenses. The Makins replied that they were willing to take care of Horace for ten shillings per week. Daughter Blanche Makin accepted an initial payment of three pounds and collected the child. John Makin continued to collect child support payments from Amber Murray while responding to her requests to see Horace with excuses. When Murray visited an address near Sydney the Makins had provided, the family had moved to Macdonaldtown, NSW, and could not be found. Murray <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> baby alive again.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again.|$|E

Adman Peter Rogers said, [...] "Claudette was extravagant; I <b>never,</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> question the price of anything." [...] In 1963, Colbert sold her residence in Holmby Hills (western Los Angeles), so Joel Pressman rented a small house in Beverly Hills.|$|R

500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews, the book met with criticism from adult film industry insiders, {{some of whom}} accused Lords of lying. Co-workers from that time such as John Leslie, Ron Jeremy, Ginger Lynn and Tom Byron said they <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> use drugs and insisted she was always fully aware of her actions.

500|$|While {{some historians}} believe that Oppenheimer had an extramarital affair with Tatlock {{while he was}} working on the Manhattan Project, others assert he met with Tatlock only once after he was picked to head the Los Alamos Laboratory in mid-June 1943. On June 14, 1943, Oppenheimer was in Berkeley to recruit David Hawkins as an {{administrative}} assistant. They went to a Mexican restaurant in her green 1935 Plymouth coupe, and spent the night together at her San Francisco apartment at 1405 Montgomery Street. All the while, U.S. Army agents, waiting in the street outside, had them under surveillance. [...] At that meeting she told him that she still loved him and wanted to be with him. He <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again.|$|E
500|$|Her parents' {{relationship}} was quarrelsome; Marguerite Louise took every chance to humiliate Cosimo. On one documented occasion, she branded him [...] "a poor groom" [...] {{in the presence}} of the Papal nuncio. The enmity between them continued until 26 December 1674; after all attempts at conciliation failed, a stressed Cosimo consented to his wife's departure for the Convent of Montmartre, France. The contract created that day revoked her privileges as a petite fille de France, and declared that upon her death all her assets were to be inherited by her children. Cosimo granted her a pension of 80,000 livres in compensation. She abandoned Tuscany in June 1675; Anna Maria Luisa <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again. Although Cosimo doted on his daughter, she was raised by her paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
