California eventually wound up in the Nixon column, 3.259 to 3.224 million, but Nixon still needed 50 electoral votes, which Illinois and Texas would have provided, with one to spare. As it turned out, Kennedy won by 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219, with conservative Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia receiving 15 (8 from Mississippi, 6 from Alabama and 1 from Oklahoma). In the popular vote, Kennedy won only 34.227 million to Nixon's 34.108 million, the closest election since 1888.|$|E

Jim Rutenberg reported in August 2016 that Hannity is [...] "not only Mr. Trump’s biggest media booster; he also veers into the role of adviser," [...] citing sources who said Hannity spent months offering suggestions to Trump and his campaign on strategy and messaging. Hannity responded to the report by saying, [...] "I’m not hiding the fact that I want Donald Trump to be the <b>next</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. ...
