On November 5, 1974, he was re-elected by a 57% to 43% margin, though he lost badly in Baltimore City and Baltimore County, where Mikulski was popular.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration.</b> The <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

During the <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid/volunteer armed force. He would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time.|$|E

He helped persuade the Kennedy and <b>Nixon</b> <b>administrations</b> to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I).|$|R
5|$|Lennon {{revealed}} a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism, {{he moved from}} London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by the <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{used the}} {{improving}} international environment {{to address the}} topic of nuclear peace. Following the announcement of his visit to China, the <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union.

5|$|The <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> {{skirted the}} Ineligibility Clause {{during its first}} year, when Nixon named Representative Donald Rumsfeld as Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969. Although the salary for that office had been {{increased}} to $42,500 during Rumsfeld's term in Congress, Rumsfeld was not paid a salary for the position. Rather, Rumsfeld was dually employed as Assistant to the President at the same $42,500 salary, a position presumably {{outside the scope of}} the Clause.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the Seymour clock, {{another had}} preceded {{it in the}} Oval Office's {{northeast}} corner during the Lyndon B. Johnson and early Richard <b>Nixon</b> <b>administrations,</b> from 1965 - 1969. All 85 clocks in the White House (including the 12 longcase clocks), were maintained and wound by John Muffler the White House's chief electrician and longest-serving employee. The chimes on all White House clocks have all been disabled since an order by Harry S. Truman, due {{to the difficulty of}} keeping them all synchronized.|$|R
5|$|Ford {{continued}} the détente policy {{with both the}} Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. Still in place from the <b>Nixon</b> <b>Administration</b> was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's December 1975 visit to that communist country. In 1975, the Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union, creating {{the framework of the}} Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis. In 1972 President Richard Nixon commissioned a comprehensive study from the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before 1981, the {{approval}} process of justices was usually rapid. From the Truman through <b>Nixon</b> <b>administrations,</b> justices were typically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the present, however, {{the process has}} taken much longer. Some believe this is because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past. According to the Congressional Research Service, the average numberof days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (or 2.3 months).|$|R

50|$|Although {{primarily}} {{to strengthen the}} military alliance with the United States, there were also financial incentives for South Korea's participation in the war. South Korean military personnel were paid by the United States federal government and their salaries were remitted directly to the South Korean government. Park was eager to send South Korean troops to Vietnam and vigorously campaigned to extend the war. In return for troop commitments, South Korea received {{tens of billions of}} dollars in grants, loans, subsidies, technology transfers, and preferential markets, all provided by the Johnson and <b>Nixon</b> <b>administrations.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1975, Jones {{registered}} as a Democrat, citing his disenchantment with the <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> and {{his desire to}} participate in Kentucky primary elections. At the time, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in Kentucky by a 2-to-1 margin. Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. named him {{to the board of}} directors for the University of Kentucky and the Chandler Medical Center. In the mid-1980s, Jones created the Kentucky Health Care Access Foundation to provide free health care to individuals who fell below the poverty line but did not qualify for Medicaid. Governor Martha Layne Collins chose Jones to chair her Medicaid Program Review Team and serve on her Council on Education Reform.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{political}} career began in 1969, {{as an intern}} for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard <b>Nixon</b> <b>Administration.</b> He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969–70. He held several positions {{in the years that}} followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} term, Nixon ordered an airlift to {{resupply}} Israeli {{losses in the}} Yom Kippur War, resulting in the restart of the Middle East peace process and an oil crisis at home. The <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> supported a coup in Chile that ousted the government of Salvador Allende and propelled Augusto Pinochet to power. By late 1973, the Watergate scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support. On August 9, 1974, he resigned {{in the face of}} almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he was issued a pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. In 20 years of retirement, Nixon wrote nine books and undertook many foreign trips, helping to rehabilitate his image into that of elder statesman. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994 and died four days later at the age of 81.|$|E
