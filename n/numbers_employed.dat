5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of the region, Sale's economy during the early-19th century was weak, a state of affairs which persisted until the arrival of the railway in the middle of the century. Despite the {{dominance}} of agriculture, there was a growing service industry; Sale and Ashton upon Mersey experienced a growth in <b>numbers</b> <b>employed</b> in retail and domestic services in the first half of the 19th century. By 1901, less than 20% of Sale residents were employed in agriculture. Employment was available in workhouses for those who could not find work elsewhere. Sale was part of the Altrincham Union, which ran the nearest work house in Altrincham.|$|E
25|$|In July 1943, the Germans {{launched}} Operation Citadel, in {{the region}} around Kursk, their last major offensive on the Eastern Front in the Second World War. It was the debut of the German Panther tank, although the <b>numbers</b> <b>employed</b> at Kursk were small and {{the brunt of the}} burden was carried by the Panzer III, StuG III, and Panzer IV. The campaign featured the largest tank battles in history. The high-water mark of the battle was the massive armour engagement at Prokhorovka, which began on 12 July, though the vast majority of armour losses on both sides were caused by artillery and mines, rather than tanks. Over 6,000 fully tracked armoured vehicles, 4,000 combat aircraft, and 2 million men are believed to have participated in these battles.|$|E
500|$|Jarrow {{began its}} {{development}} as a shipbuilding town with the establishment in 1851 of Palmer's shipyard {{on the banks of}} the River Tyne. [...] The first ship from the yard was launched in 1852, an iron-built and steam-powered collier; many more such carriers followed. In 1856 the yard began building warships, and was soon supplying many of the world's navies. With its associated iron and steel works, it became the largest shipbuilding centre in the country, employing thousands of men. Jarrow's population, at around 3,800 in 1850, had increased nearly tenfold to 35,000 by 1891. Palmer's was central to [...] Jarrow's economy, both for the <b>numbers</b> <b>employed</b> there and for the ancillary businesses that served the needs of both the yard and town.|$|E
5000|$|The 2007-2009 {{recession}} {{resulted in}} the <b>number</b> <b>employed</b> falling across all age groups except those aged 55 and over, which continued to increase steadily.

While the <b>number</b> <b>employed</b> in the 25-34 age group recovered to its pre-crisis (December 2007) level by January 2014 and continued to slowly rise, several under age 55 groups remained below pre-crisis levels as of May 2016.|$|R

The purpose of this survey was to ascertain answers to such questions as whether societies are becoming more or less equal, whether they are expanding or restricting opportunity for their citizens and whether they are offering the kinds of education that will enable nations {{to cope with the}} challenges of technological change. The aim was to study the trends, correlates and determinants of social mobility in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The researchers state that they would welcome requests for access to these data.

50|$|The {{decline of}} the {{industrial}} sector after 1970 saw a downturn in the <b>numbers</b> <b>employed</b> within it, which by 2001 was 3,344 in the steel industry, the mining sector having disappeared by 1990, but this was tempered by {{the growth of the}} banking sector from the 1960s, offering alternative employment and eventually greatly increasing the number of employees within this discipline, so the workforce in Luxembourg moved from predominantly ‘blue-collar’ to predominantly ‘white-collar’ {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century and beyond. At the same time, restructuring in the steel industry was beginning to affect <b>numbers</b> <b>employed</b> within it. Today, the steel industry accounts for 3.9% of the Luxembourgish workforce, and remains an important contributor to the economy, accounting for 29% of all exports. However, the {{decline of the}} steel industry in Luxembourg was not entirely negative, as the working population simply changed occupation and moved into the tertiary sector. By the 1990s Luxembourg was among the ‘top ten financial services centres in the world’.|$|E
