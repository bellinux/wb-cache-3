5|$|The other port lifeboat, {{with four}} crew on board, {{was picked up}} by the steamer Leichhardt at an island at the {{entrance}} to Whitsunday Passage two days after the disaster. The steamer immediately reversed course back towards the wreck, which she reached at approximately 3.30pm on Friday, 26 February. Gothenburg was a complete wreck; the funnel was gone and she had sunk to the eyes of the lower rigging. Leichhardts Chief Officer and four hands went alongside, but <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> her masts could be seen above the water except for the body of a naked man floating nearby. They assumed the other victims had been taken by sharks. Leichhardt searched for survivors until last light and then made way for Bowen where the alarm was raised.|$|E

25|$|Crashes {{were not}} uncommon, almost always in lakes. Reports {{were made of}} objects {{crashing}} into a lake, then propelling themselves across the surface before sinking, as well as ordinary crashes. The Swedish military performed several dives in the affected lakes shortly after the crashes, but found <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> occasional craters in the lake bottom or torn off aquatic plants.|$|E
25|$|Some mystics {{are said}} {{to have been able to}} perform miracles. But for many mystics, the miracles {{occurred}} to them. In the Middle Ages, one common form of mystical miracle, especially for women, was the Eucharistic miracle, such as being able to eat <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the communion host. Catherine of Genoa was an example of someone who experienced this type of miracle.|$|E

25|$|Benign {{myoclonus}} {{can occur}} in healthy individuals and is most commonly caused by <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> arbitrary muscle contractions. Myoclonus may develop in response to infection, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, head or spinal cord injury, stroke, stress, brain tumors, kidney or liver failure, lipid storage disease, chemical or drug poisoning, as {{a side effect of}} certain drugs (such as tramadol, quinolones, benzodiazepine, gabapentin, sertraline, lamotrigine), or other disorders.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{military}} equipment (cf. Roman military personal equipment), particularly armor, was more withstanding {{and far more}} ubiquitous, especially in the late Republican and Early Imperial era, than that of most of their opponents. Soldiers equipped with shields, helmets and highly effective body armor had a major advantage over warriors protected, in many cases, with <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> their shields, particularly in a prolonged engagement.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, {{notwithstanding}} {{the success of}} priests, astrologers and astronomers in predicting solar and lunar eclipses, the solstices and the equinoxes of the Sun and {{the period of the}} Moon, there was <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a set of algorithms to help them. Despite the great strides made in the development of geometry made by Ancient Greeks and surveys in Rome, we were to wait for another thousand years before the first equations of motion arrive.|$|E

25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I {{could think of}} <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't {{going to make it}} back.|$|E
25|$|The Barony of Gritzena was {{established}} ca. 1209, after {{the conquest of}} the Peloponnese by the Crusaders, {{and was one of}} the original twelve secular baronies within the Principality of Achaea. The various versions of the Chronicle of the Morea mention that the barony comprised four knight's fiefs, and was located in the region of Lakkoi (the upper Messenian plain, between Kalamata and Skorta), under a certain Lucas (Λούκας), of whom <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> his name is known.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly, {{it was her}} {{regime that}} was in trouble. She could not {{comprehend}} how Nwe's small band of men could have defeated the Pegu army. But she also realized from the open bickering between Zeik-Bye and Maru {{that she was in}} no position to organize another attack. She ordered an immediate upgrade of Pegu's moats and fortified walls. Zeik-Bye meanwhile kept Nwe apprised of the developments. By then, her authority was too weak. When Nwe and his small army appeared outside Pegu's walls on 10 December 1383, she could do <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> hunker down inside the city walls.|$|E
50|$|Merneferre Ay is {{sometimes}} confused with Ay, a ruler {{at the end}} of the 18th Dynasty (1549 - 1292 BC). However, both kings ruled in completely different dynasties and have <b>nothing</b> in common <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a similar name.|$|R

50|$|Self-sufficiency {{is a type}} of {{sustainable}} living in which <b>nothing</b> is consumed <b>other</b> <b>than</b> what is produced by the self-sufficient individuals.

25|$|Although the Shakespeare papers had {{prominent}} believers (including James Boswell), sceptics had questioned their authenticity {{from the}} beginning, {{and as the}} premiere of Vortigern approached, the press was filled with arguments over whether the papers were genuine or forgeries. On 31 March 1796, Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone published his own exhaustive study, An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments, about the supposed papers. His attack on the papers, stretching to more than 400 densely printed pages, showed convincingly that the papers could be <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> modern forgeries. Although believers tried to hold their ground, scholars were convinced by Malone's arguments.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> my scripts basically.|$|E
25|$|A year later, Portuguese {{reinforcements}} from Brazil {{forced the}} Dutch to surrender Luanda and withdraw from Angola in 1648. The new Portuguese governor, Salvador de Sá, sought terms with Kongo, demanding the Island of Luanda, {{the source of}} Kongo's money supply of nzimbu shells. Although neither Kongo nor Angola ever ratified the treaty, sent to the king in 1649, the Portuguese gained de facto control of the island. The war resulted in the Dutch losing their claims in Central Africa, Nzinga being forced back into Matamba, the Portuguese restored to their coastal position. Kongo lost or gained <b>nothing,</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the indemnity Garcia paid, which ended hostilities between the two rival powers. King Garcia II, after allowing the Portuguese to gain control over Luanda Island, switched the kingdom's currency to raffia cloth, seemingly negating the Portuguese gains.|$|E
50|$|Ouda, therefore, had {{no chance}} of {{defending}} himself in person, and was convicted under Egypt's emergency law, in effect since 1981, granting police sweeping powers of arrest. The stated basis of the prosecution was testimony given by Ouda's Egyptian cousin, Eid Suleiman, who was arrested for similar charges in 1999 and is also currently imprisoned. According to his family, Ouda he has done <b>nothing</b> wrong <b>other</b> <b>than</b> cross into Egypt without the proper documentation.|$|R

5000|$|Sean Flint was {{critical}} of the name choice, saying [...] "it describes absolutely <b>nothing</b> about it <b>other</b> <b>than</b> {{the fact that it}} may contain ducks".

25|$|The {{parliamentary}} {{agenda was}} obviously {{affected by the}} events of April 25. The day after the fire, a special meeting {{of the members of the}} Legislative Assembly was convened to meet at 10:00am in the hall of the Bonsecours Market, under the protection of British soldiers. On that day, the MPPs accomplished <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> appointing a committee responsible to report on the bills that were destroyed. Their report was presented to the House a week later on May 2. Lafontaine was not present that morning, because he assisted to the wedding of lawyer Amable Berthelot, his associate in law, who was marrying the adoptive daughter of judge Elzéar Bédard. The Legislative Assembly kept meeting at Bonsecours Market until May 7, after which date the parliament was convened in a building owned by Moses Judas Hayes on Place Dalhousie.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} {{production}} system, machines and apparatuses {{play an important}} role. What {{is referred to as}} capital is <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> these machines and apparatuses, together with materials and intermediate products consumed in the production process. Capital is the most important of factors, or one should say as important as labor. By the help of machines and apparatuses, the human being got a tremendous production capability. These machines, apparatuses and tools are classified as capital, or more precisely as durable capital, for one uses these items for many years. Their quantity is not changed at once. But the capital is not an endowment given by the nature. It is composed of goods manufactured in the production and often imported from foreign countries. In this sense, capital is internationally mobile and the result of past economic activity. The concept of capital as natural endowment distorts the real role of capital. Capital is a production power accumulated by the past investment.|$|E
25|$|After the {{storming}} of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, Mirabeau {{warned the}} Assembly of {{the futility of}} passing fine-sounding decrees and urged the necessity of action. Although the cause of liberty had triumphed, Mirabeau foresaw that the intervention of armed mobs would only drive the path of Revolution further and further along a destructive path of violence. He declared that the night of 4 August (when members of the Constituent Assembly took an oath to end feudalism) accomplished <b>nothing</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> to give the people immense theoretical liberty while providing them no practical freedom and overthrowing the old régime before a new one could be constituted. His failure to control the theorists demonstrated to Mirabeau that his eloquence could not enable him to guide the Assembly by himself, and that he must get additional support. He wished to establish a strong ministry {{in the manner of}} an English ministry. In his view, it should be responsible to an assembly chosen to represent the people of France better than the British House of Commons represented the common people of Great Britain.|$|E

5000|$|Gull {{noted that}} her {{emaciated}} appearance was more extreme than normally occurs in tubercular cases. His physical examination {{of her chest}} and abdomen discovered <b>nothing</b> abnormal, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a low pulse of 50, but he recorded a [...] "peculiar restlessness" [...] that was difficult to control. The mother advised that [...] "She is never tired". Gull {{was struck by the}} similarity of the case to that of Miss A, even to the detail of the pulse and respiration observations.|$|R
5000|$|Not all reviews were positive, however. John Hussey of Cult Fix criticised Clara's return, {{saying that}} [...] "Face the Raven was a poetic ending for Clara and it should’ve been left alone, not dragged out with timey-wimey nonsense." [...] He further {{went on to}} criticise the lack of {{resolution}} to the Hybrid Arc of the series, saying [...] "it added very little to the series and resulted in <b>nothing</b> spectacular, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> pure speculation; essentially back where we started." ...|$|R
