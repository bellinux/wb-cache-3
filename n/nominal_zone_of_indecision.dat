The groups were 88 University of Pittsburgh students and 79 Universidad del Pacifico, Peru, students. The <b>Indecision</b> Scale <b>of</b> the Career Decision Scale (CDS) {{was used to examine}} levels and types <b>of</b> career <b>indecision.</b> Cluster analysis was performed to determine groups with similarities in <b>indecision.</b> One-way analyses <b>of</b> variance found differences within levels <b>of</b> <b>indecision.</b> Two-way analyses <b>of</b> variance compared each of the cluster levels of the two groups.

Data from the Pittsburgh group showed a higher level <b>of</b> <b>indecision</b> per cluster than the group from Peru, suggesting that cross-cultural characteristics may influenc...|$|R
