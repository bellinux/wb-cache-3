By the end of October, a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showed Gillibrand winning 57-34%. Gillibrand won the November election 63–35%, carrying 54 of New York's 62 counties; the counties that supported DioGuardi did so by a margin <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> than 10%.|$|E

5|$|For {{a stable}} orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> than a week (7 days) {{in order to have a}} stable orbit.|$|E

5|$|Heating in Enceladus has {{occurred}} through various mechanisms ever since its formation. Radioactive decay in its core may have initially heated it, {{giving it a}} warm core and a subsurface ocean, which is now kept above freezing through an unidentified mechanism. Geophysical models indicate that tidal heating is a main heat source, perhaps aided by radioactive decay and some heat-producing chemical reactions. A 2007 study predicted the internal heat of Enceladus, if generated by tidal forces, could be <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> than 1.1 gigawatts, but data from Cassini's infrared spectrometer of the south polar terrain over 16 months, indicate that the internal heat generated power is about 4.7 gigawatts, and {{suggest that it is}} in thermal equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study assessing the project. Dahlgren {{is a doctor}} who promotes the Purification Rundown {{as a method of}} detoxification. The study claimed to find evidence both of elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. They questioned the premise that WTC rescue workers needed detoxification, citing studies that had found that their blood concentration of toxins was <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> than normal.|$|E
5|$|The United States Attorney for Washington then filed a suit {{to enforce}} the treaty rights of the tribe. The trial {{court held that the}} {{property}} rights of the Winans allowed them to exclude others from the property, including the Indians. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the tribe had reserved fishing rights when they ceded the property to the United States.

5|$|The closure problem {{takes as}} input a {{directed}} acyclic graph with weights on its vertices and seeks the minimum (or maximum) weight of a closure, a set of vertices with no outgoing edges. (The problem may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> generality, because {{in this case it}} is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph.) It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} classification, {{introduced by}} B. J. Gladman, B. G. Marsden and C. Van Laerhoven in 2007, uses 10-million-year orbit integration {{instead of the}} Tisserand parameter. An object qualifies as an SDO if its orbit is not resonant, has a semi-major axis <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> than 2000 AU, and, during the integration, its semi-major axis shows an excursion of 1.5 AU or more. Gladman et al. suggest the term scattering disk object to emphasize this present mobility. If the object is not an SDO as per the above definition, but the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 0.240, it is classified as a detached TNO. (Objects with smaller eccentricity are considered classical.) In this scheme, the disc extends from the orbit of Neptune to 2000 AU, the region {{referred to as the}} inner Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|More {{effective}} tactics {{had to be}} used {{if there}} were to be <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> resources for the Command. Two major changes adopted by Coastal Command were sweeps over convoy routes and sweeps against U-boat transit routes. According to German and Italian submarine logs, both were effective and denied them the chance of shadowing convoys on the surface. It also rapidly increased the chances of a kill. The transit tactic over the Bay of Biscay resulted in many air-to-air and air-to-submarine combats, reaching its peak in 1943. As it was, in 1940 the Command was credited with just two sinkings with Navy vessels, one sunk unaided, and two damaged. The damaged ships could have been sunk had proper weapons been available.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{designed}} to have a length <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> than a man's shoulder width, {{to allow it to}} be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an armored vehicle. To achieve this, the weapon's design uses the unconventional bullpup configuration, in which the action and magazine are located behind the trigger and alongside the shooter's face so that there is no wasted space in the stock. The P90's dimensions are minimized by its unique horizontally mounted feeding system, wherein the box magazine sits parallel to the barrel on top of the weapon's frame. The weapon overall has an extremely compact profile—it is the most compact fixed-stock submachine gun to be made. The standard version of the weapon has an overall length of 500mm (19.7in), a height of 210mm (8.3in), and a width of 55mm (2.2in).|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Gedi's structures were domestic residences made of thatched-roofed mud buildings concentrated between the outer and inner walls; however, the only buildings that survived {{to the present}} were constructed using coral stones extracted from the Indian Ocean. Although several of the buildings predate the fourteenth century, coral became a more common construction material for important structures and elite residences during that time period. All of the buildings at Gedi are single-story structures. The walls and other coral structures were constructed {{in a similar manner}} using lime mortar, with most foundations <b>no</b> <b>greater</b> than one foot in depth and filled with stones. Where foundations were used, they tended to be no wider than the wall they supported. There are several examples of non-utilitarian design elements. Doorways for the buildings consist of square framed pointed archways, with tombs and mosques containing spandrels and architraves that have been carved or inlaid with porcelain.|$|E
