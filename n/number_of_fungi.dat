5|$|New Zealand's {{geographic}} isolation for 80 million years and island biogeography has influenced {{evolution of the}} country's species of animals, fungi and plants. Physical isolation has not caused biological isolation, and this {{has resulted in a}} dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species. About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungi</b> recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic, but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand and 40% of these are endemic. The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps, or by southern beech in cooler climates. The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are tussock.|$|E

40|$|There is {{insufficient}} information {{available on the}} effect of temperature and other environmental factors on pests and the beneficial insects that are used to manage them. Using fungus gnats, and beneficials Steinernema feltiae and Atheta coriaria, on pansy as a model system, we found that increases organic matter content of soilless mixes and higher moisture content of soils increased the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungus</b> gnats produced. Lower temperatures extended the time to peak emergence <b>of</b> <b>fungus</b> gnats relative to warmer temperatures by approximately one month. Nematodes reduced the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungus</b> gnats produced under warm and cool temperatures, but the effect was greater under cool temperatures. On-farm trials <b>of</b> nematodes for <b>fungus</b> gnat management had variable results but anecdotally supported on-campus research.

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the type and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fungus</b> species including saprophyte, opportunistic and pathogen in the salt desert region of Ardestan township in 1375. Materials and methods: This descriptive study was conducted by Petri-dish trapping technique. 9 different locations were selected (saltiferous, salt desert forest, agriculture ground, fruit garden, city space, pigeon space, ranches space, poultry space, and canal wells including wild pigeon). From the first 5 locations 75 samples and from the other 4 locations 40 petri-dish were obtained. Results: Totally, 1051 fungus colonies were counted from 115 petir-dishes. The most common fungi were peniccilium spp., cladosporium spp., aspergillus spp., alternaria spp., and yeasts. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungus</b> colonies were as follow: at the evening 45. 5, in the morning 27. 7, and at noon 26. 8. Canal wells including wild pigeons had shown {{to have the most}} variable types <b>of</b> <b>fungi,</b> meanwhile, the biggest yeast colony numbers were isolated form this location. Furthermore, 3 fungus species similar to sporothrix schenchii were isolated from this site. Conclusion: The place of sampling and environmental factors may influence the <b>number</b> and type <b>of</b> <b>fungi</b> in the salt desert region. The biggest fungus colonies were isolated form ranches space and the smallest from salt march regions. Meanwhile, some fungi such as peniccilium spp., cladosporium spp., aspergillus spp., alternaria spp are able to grow even in unsuitable environmental conditions...|$|R

The participation of nitric oxide (NO), {{a product of the}} inducible nitric oxide synthase enzyme (iNOS), as an important fungicidal molecule against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis has been demonstrated. In order to further characterize the Oral Paracoccidioidomycosis (OP), we undertook an immunohistochemical study of iNOS+, CD 45 RO+, CD 3 +, CD 8 +, CD 20 +, CD 68 + cells and mast cells. The samples were distributed in groups according to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> viable <b>fungi</b> per mm². Our results showed weak immunolabeling for iNOS in the multinucleated giant cells (MNGC) and in most of the mononuclear (MN) cells, and the proportion of iNOS+ MN/MNGC cells in the OP were comparable to Control (clinically healthy oral tissues). Additionally, our analysis revealed a similarity in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> CD 4 + cells between the Control and the OP groups with higher <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungi.</b> These findings suggest that a low expression of iNOS and a decrease in the CD 4 + T cells in OP may represent possible mechanisms that permit the local fungal multiplication and maintenance of active oral lesions...|$|R
