500|$|After {{taking office}} in January 2006, Corzine's {{approval}} numbers were very low. Many polls {{seemed to indicate}} that much of this <b>negative</b> <b>polling</b> {{was a result of}} the 2006 New Jersey State Government shutdown. An April 26, 2006, polls from Quinnipiac University Polling Institute showed Corzine at a 15% approval with a 72% disapproval. A February 28, 2007, poll from Quinnipiac University showed Corzine at 50% approval with 34% disapproval. When Corzine released a controversial plan to monetize the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, his approval rating fell to 30% in January 2008.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} for a MFSFET (metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor {{field effect}} transistor) {{is very different}} than a conventional MOSFET and must be modeled differently. The drain current has a hysteresis shape {{with respect to the}} gate voltage. The position along the hysteresis curve is dependent on the last positive or <b>negative</b> <b>polling</b> of the ferroelectric material. The drain current also has a logarithmic decay after the last polling. A model has been developed to describe the MFSFET drain current for both gate voltage on and gate voltage off conditions. This model takes into account the hysteresis nature of the MFSFET and the time dependent decay. The model is based on the shape of the Fermi-Dirac function which has been modified to describe the MFSFET's drain current. This is different from the model proposed by Chen et. al. and that by Wu...|$|E
40|$|Donald Trump has {{consistently}} performed better politically than his <b>negative</b> <b>polling</b> indicators suggested he would. Although {{there is a}} tendency to think of Trump support as reflecting ideological conservatism, we argue that part of his support during the election came from a non-ideological source: The preponderant salience of norms restricting communication (Political Correctness – or PC – norms). This perspective suggests that these norms, while successfully reducing the amount of negative communication in the short term, may produce more support for negative communication in the long term. In this framework, support for Donald Trump was in part the result of over-exposure to PC norms. Consistent with this, on a sample of largely politically moderate Americans taken during the General Election in the Fall of 2016, we show that temporarily priming PC norms significantly increased support for Donald Trump (but not Hillary Clinton). We further show that chronic emotional reactance towards restrictive communication norms positively predicted support for Trump (but not Clinton), and that this effect remains significant even when controlling for political ideology. In total, this work provides evidence that norms that are designed to increase the overall amount of positive communication can actually backfire by increasing support for a politician who uses extremely negative language that explicitly violates the norm...|$|E

Clinton and Trump were the least popular likely candidates in the poll's history, while Sanders received a 43% positive, 36% <b>negative</b> rating. <b>Polls</b> showed that Democratic voters older than 50 preferred Clinton by a large margin but those under 50 overwhelmingly favored Sanders.|$|R
5000|$|The phrase [...] "The only {{poll that}} counts..." [...] {{is used by}} {{politicians}} to dismiss the importance of opinion polls and highlight the importance of polling day. It is particularly used {{as a response to}} questions about <b>negative</b> opinion <b>poll</b> results and is generally considered tongue-in-cheek or ironic. It is particularly well known as a feature of Australian politics where its inclusion in party-political briefings and instructions has caused controversy. The generally accepted continuation of the phrase is, [...] "...is the one on election day".|$|R

50|$|Every single poll from a {{relevant}} polling agency released since Sanader's departure showed SDP in the lead, {{often with a}} large margin. With the left making a joint appearance, every poll predicted the election would almost certainly result in {{the victory of the}} Opposition. On election night, at 7 pm when the polls closed, all three major networks released projections of the new Parliament, based on exit polls of over 25,000 people throughout the day. The projections showed Kukuriku with an insurmountable lead over the governing parties, winning 83 seats, well over the 76 needed to form a majority. HDZ-HGS-DC were projected to have 40 seats, not including the 3 seats from district XI which HDZ wins in every election, HSS 2, Labour and HDSSB both 6. Some 30 minutes later updated totals (30,000 polled) showed Kukuriku losing one seat to a regional party, but with 82 seats still winning a clear mandate. The reaction from the presumed victors was cautiously optimistic. Four years ago exit polls showed SDP leading, however by a narrow margin, but HDZ ultimately won 5 seats more in the ten districts. With a difference of 42, well beyond the statistical margin of error, there was little doubt who won the election, however reactions ranged from caution to disbelief. HDZ spokespeople claimed, as with every <b>negative</b> <b>poll,</b> conservative voters rarely participate in polling and expressed confidence in a more favorable result. Indeed, many members of the winning coalition were employing the press and their supporters to wait for official results, but claimed {{the difference between the two}} alliances was too great to be overcome. As 9 pm approached, the first actual results began to arrive, confirming the results of the exit polls, with few changes. As the vote count progressed, the preliminary results and especially the preliminary seat calculations varied. HSLS and HSP, both parliamentary parties since their foundation, received a number of votes close to the election threshold, but ended without representation. HSS barely won a single seat with its president, Josip Friščić, the only one who entered Parliament.|$|R

5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a <b>negative</b> push <b>poll,</b> but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|R
25|$|China Post {{reported}} that some polls {{have indicated that}} the public may be pleased with Chen's visit, with about 50% of the Taiwanese public considered Chen's visit having {{a positive effect on}} Taiwan's development, while 18 to 26% of the respondents thought the effect would be <b>negative.</b> In another <b>poll,</b> it suggested that 26% of the respondents were satisfied with the DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's handling of the crowds in the series of protests, while 53% of the respondents were unsatisfied. The same poll also showed that 33% of the respondents were satisfied with President Ma's performance at his meeting with Chen Yunlin, while 32% of the respondents were not satisfied.|$|R

500|$|The lockout {{prompted}} indifference {{among most}} American sports fans, {{who thought that}} greed was shown by both sides; the latter was a similar sentiment to what fans voiced during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. A CBS News–New York Times poll conducted in October 1998 showed that, while most fans' opinion of professional basketball was unaffected by the work stoppage, 29percent reported that their views had become more <b>negative.</b> The same <b>poll</b> showed that fans backed the NBPA in the dispute by a 36–29 margin, while the general public supported the owners 24percent to 22percent. One-quarter of basketball fans {{who responded to the}} poll stated {{that they did not know}} enough about the lockout to give an opinion, along with 45percent of the general public. Media members were frequently critical of the owners and players. Sportswriter Tony Kornheiser described the labor dispute as one [...] "between tall millionaires and short millionaires." [...] An article in Newsweek termed the lockout [...] "an incomprehensible and unconscionable dispute between rival gangs of millionaires". Time Bill Saporito believed that each side was damaged by the lockout, in terms of financial losses and negative publicity.

500|$|In an {{interview}} book released in 1992, midway through his second term, Weizsäcker voiced a harsh {{critique of the}} leading political parties in Germany, claiming that they took {{a larger role in}} public life than was awarded to them by the constitution. He criticized the high number of career politicians (Berufspolitiker), who [...] "in general are neither expert nor dilettante, but generalists with particular knowledge only in political battle". The immediate reactions toward this interview were mixed. Prominent party politicians such as Rainer Barzel and Johannes Rau criticized the remarks, as did Minister of Labour Norbert Blüm, who asked the president to show more respect towards the work done by party members. Former chancellor Helmut Schmidt, on the other hand, conceded that Weizsäcker was [...] "essentially right". While comments from politicians were mainly <b>negative,</b> a public <b>poll</b> conducted by the Wickert-Institut in June 1992 showed that 87.4 per cent of the population agreed with the president. Political commentators generally interpreted the remarks as a hidden attack on the incumbent chancellor Helmut Kohl, since Weizsäcker's relationship with his former patron had cooled over the years. In a column for the German newspaper Der Spiegel, chief-editor Rudolf Augstein criticized the president for his attack, writing: [...] "You cannot have it both ways: on the one hand giving a right and seminal political incentive, {{but on the other hand}} insulting the governing class and its chief".|$|R
5000|$|A {{former member}} of KSEB with {{generation}} project, K Radhakrishnan, opined that WGEEP report was biased and the project was eco-friendly doing minimum damage to environment and forests, though {{with the lack of}} computational model when rainfall is decreasing by the effect of El Niño. Electricity Pensioners Welfare Association a forum of senior power personnel of Kerala headed by K Radhakrishnan viewed the Gadgil panel report as unproductive and overly concerned about environmental issues. Of late The Central Water commission has given approval to the project if the project doesn't affect the ecological balance, could maintain a flow for the waterfalls without defacing it or doesn't bring out any socio-cultural disputes. In 2016, Kerala Chief minister and Minister for power, Pinarayi Vijayan has indicated that they will consider implementation of the project disregard of the public opinion that rises from emotional sentiment. Environmental activists opposing the project and even by Left sympathizers, criticized the government's proceedings, for making public announcements in the cabinet without any consensus on the issue and it shouldn't be based on winning any previous grudge or proving judgmental validity. When first the project came forward Communist party of Kerala was against this project and surveys conducted among people by television channels also <b>polled</b> <b>negative</b> response. The hydel project is also reported to be anti-people and only would harm the state’s interest when it takes away water from an existing irrigation system, which covers 20,000 acres of farmland downstream and about 5 lakh people reportedly depend upon the river for drinking and irrigation purposes. But experienced and retired inclined members of KSEB like K. Radhakrishnan, who have been campaigning for the implementation of the Athirappilly hydroelectric project for long and has welcomed the decision with overly exaggerated results like monthly 20 megawatts and if other issues could dismissed it could be topped over 40 megawatts per month according to the summer seasons while Power Survey Report, estimate the state’s power requirement to reach at 6500 MW by 2020. Former Principal Chief Conservator of Forest T M Manoharan, who was the Chairman of the Kerala State Electricity Board opposed the project citing the harm it could cause to the environment and ecology of the area. Other studies for the feasibility of the project was also negative like the report in 2007 by B S Vijayan, Kerala State Biodiversity Board also pointed out that the power project would adversely affect the ecology of the area. Jairam Ramesh, Former Environment Minister said this decision to be a [...] "perfect recipe for ecological disaster".|$|R
