5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} portion of reviews drew parallels between Carnivàle and David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks, a show in which Carnivàle actor Michael J. Anderson had previously appeared. Knauf did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> a stylistic link and made comparisons to John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath. When Lost began to receive major critical attention, Carnivàle and its type of mythological storytelling were compared to Lost story approach in several instances.|$|E

5|$|He {{was tried}} before Curiohaus war crimes court in Rotherbaum, in Court Number 5 on Monday, 11 October 1948. Knöchlein's defence hinged on {{the claim that}} he was not present at the massacre, {{although}} his lawyers did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> that the event took place. They also claimed that the British had used dumdum bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce; all of which were vigorously denied by the prosecution. Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognising Knöchlein.|$|E
5|$|Jim Caviezel's character, Carroll Oerstadt, {{seemed to}} mirror {{in several ways}} the story of Timothy McVeigh, a {{domestic}} terrorist who destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City with a bomb in 1995. Caviezel and Scott did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> this, and both admitted that the Oerstadt character was at least partly based on McVeigh. Ross Johnson of The New York Times also compared the ferry bombing at the film's beginning to the Oklahoma City bombing.|$|E
5|$|The law {{was used}} {{in at least one}} attempt to prosecute a non-Christian. In 1658 a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not the son of God and that the miracles {{described}} in the New Testament were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> having said such things, but argued that he had only been responding to questions asked of him. He was held for trial but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's assassin Godse made {{no attempt}} to escape and was seized by the witnesses. He was arrested. In the weeks that followed, his {{collaborators}} were arrested as well. Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if only he had a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E
5|$|However, Dot causes {{trouble for}} certain {{residents}} too, although not intentionally. She {{is responsible for}} the break-up of Saeed Jeffery's (Andrew Johnson) marriage to Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh). Due to the lack of lust in his marriage to Naima, Saeed begins visiting prostitutes. After continual pressure, Naima relents and finally consummates her marriage to Saeed, improving things between the couple (their marriage was arranged to begin with, much to their disliking), but their marital bliss is short-lived. Naima receives an anonymous letter from Dot, who has discovered Saeed's sordid exploits. Dot feels it is her Christian duty to inform Saeed's wife, and when Naima confronts Saeed, he does <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> it so she leaves him.|$|E

5|$|The American group wrote {{a scathing}} {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does <b>not</b> <b>deny.</b> They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that {{this was not the case}} and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (rutherfordium) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E
5|$|During Bure's playing career, much {{speculation}} surrounded Russian NHL {{players and}} their potential ties to the Russian mafia both as victims and associates. As Soviet players began defecting to the NHL, many cases of extortion began surfacing. The Russian mafia was targeting the players' families still living in Russia. Former teammate Alexander Mogilny {{was a victim of}} such an extortion attempt in 1994, while Bure was reported to have made payments totaling in the thousands of dollars to Russian extortionists in 1993. Three years later, in 1996, American sports network ESPN aired reports alleging Bure was a potential associate of the Russian mafia because of his relationship with friend and business partner Anzor Kikalishvili, known to both Russian and American police as a suspected criminal and possible Russian mob boss. Bure was revealed to hold a position as vice president in the sports company Twenty First Century Association, owned by Kikalishvili, and reportedly believed by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to be a mafia front worth at least US$100million in illicit funds. While Bure did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> his business and personal relationships with Kikalishvili, he refuted reports Kikalishvili was involved in any criminal activity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{decide not}} to get {{together}} officially until he breaks up with Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). On {{their way back to}} Scranton, they stop at Jessica's family's log cabin, where they encounter a bunch of Jessica's friends having a bachelorette party and drinking. Andy and Erin decide to bail, but Jessica returns from her morning run. After staying a while, Andy asks Jessica into the kitchen where she deduces that he is breaking up with her. Erin is surprised however when Jessica said that Andy told her he did not think Erin was relationship material. Andy does <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> saying that, instead opting to claim that he is gay and leaves awkwardly with Erin. In the car, Andy says he made those comments about Erin because he was with Jessica before Erin falls asleep. Andy decides to head back to the cabin to tell Jessica and her party that he broke up with her because he wanted to be with Erin and that she is relationship material, while Erin overhears. Jessica and her party chase Andy and Erin back to the car. Erin passionately kisses Andy inside the car while the party throws cake at them, prompting a quick getaway.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial began}} in the High Court of Justice on 30 January 1893, before Sir Henry Hawkins; Bottomley {{conducted}} his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for {{far less than the}} prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.|$|E
