5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made on electromyography (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. This involves the insertion of small needles into the nerves supplying several muscles, administering small electrical impulses through these <b>needles,</b> <b>and</b> measuring the electrical response of the muscle in question. Two EMG investigations can be characteristic in LEMS: compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and single-fiber examination.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic <b>needles,</b> <b>and</b> from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's mother {{apprentice}}d her son William to a tailor, James Selby. Andrew {{also became}} an apprentice in Selby's shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday. Johnson {{lived with his}} mother for part of his service, and one of Selby's employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills. His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. Even before he became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, Annette Gordon-Reed, suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the art as he threaded <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> cut cloth.|$|E

Specifically, an active localization scenario where the system directly controls the imaging system to actively localize the <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> target locations using intra-operative medical imaging (e. g., computerized tomography and ultrasound imaging) is explored. In the proposed method, the active localization problem is posed as an information maximization problem, where the beliefs for the <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> target states are represented and estimated using particle filters. The proposed method is also validated using a simulation study. I...|$|R

Then he brought the same end of the bar, first to the point, and then to the eye of the unmagnetic <b>needle,</b> <b>and</b> it attracted them both; so it was evident that there was a considerable difference, in reality, between the condition of the two, though {{there was no difference in}} external appearance.|$|R
5|$|The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police {{headquarters}} {{is situated in}} the Neoclassical-inspired Politigården building built in 1918–24 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices. In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms {{does not lead to}} prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and {{working its way}} up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies {{to the base of}} another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine <b>needles,</b> <b>and</b> may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E

The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan is a second-century Romano-British trulla apparently decorated as a souvenir for a soldier who had served on Hadrian's Wall, and probably made locally. A number of items were also found in the Sculptor's Cave, Coversea in Morayshire, including Roman pottery, rings, bracelets, <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> coins, some of which had been re-used for ornaments.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: HIV/AIDS {{has become}} one of {{international}} public health problem. An effective method to spread HIV/AIDS is through shared <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> syringe among Injecting Drug Users (IDUs). Many studies have been undertaken to know the effect of <b>Needle</b> <b>and</b> Syringe Program (NSP) to reduce the risk behaviours of IDUs in sharing <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> syringe among IDUs. NSP has been implemented in Palembang since 2009. However, there is no previous research to examine IDUs behaviours in using non sterile injection and syringe in Palembang. Therefore, a research is needed to be undertaken to know the effect of NSP on IDUs’ behaviours in using sterile needle an syringe. Objective: To identify association between seeking behaviours of NSP on IDUs’ behaviours in using sterile <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> syringe. Methods: This was a case control study with respondents recruited using snowball and purposive technique. Simple and multiple logistic regression tests were performed using statistics program (Stata version 10) to identify main association between NSP access status and behaviours of using non-sterile <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> syringe. Some possible confounders were also explored. Odds ratio, 95...|$|R

5|$|The fungus {{has been}} shown to provide a {{protective}} effect against heavy metal toxicity when associated with the host Pinus sylvestris, preventing copper accumulation in the <b>needles,</b> <b>and</b> protecting seedlings against cadmium toxicity. Owing to its frequent rate of sexual reproduction and the resulting extensive gene flow within populations, the fungus can rapidly evolve a trait to tolerate otherwise toxic levels of heavy metals in the environment. The genetic basis of this adaptation—intriguing to researchers investigating the bioremediation potential of metal-adapted plants and their fungal associates—are contained in the genome sequence of S.luteus, published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The fungus is saprobic, and so derives {{nutrients}} from breaking down dead plant material, such as leaves, bark, <b>needles,</b> <b>and</b> twigs, that {{has fallen to}} the ground. Fruit bodies are usually found growing in groups or scattered on leaf litter in beech and beech-hemlock forests {{during the summer and}} autumn, although it has been recorded growing on lawns. It is also often found under eastern North American oaks. The distribution includes the US states Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Michigan, and Vermont. It has also been collected in Quebec, Canada.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} sports, some {{competitors}} in cross-country skiing {{have chosen to}} enhance their performance through doping. Anti-doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari Isometsä, Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a blood plasma expander usually used {{to cover up the}} use of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO boosts the oxygen-carrying capability of hemoglobin. In addition, the team head coach left <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> drip bags at a public location near the Helsinki airport. At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Austrian cross-country skier Johannes Duerr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO. In 2007, The International Olympic Committee banned biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, and the cross-country skiers, Martin Tauber, Jürgen Pinter, Johannes Eder, Roland Diethart and Christian Hoffmann, from all future Olympic competition.|$|E

5|$|At the low altitudes {{at which}} Mir orbited {{there is a}} variety of space debris, {{consisting}} of everything from entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites, to explosion fragments, paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, coolant released by RORSAT nuclear powered satellites, small <b>needles,</b> <b>and</b> many other objects. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, posed {{a threat to the}} station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage {{to other parts of the}} station, such as the solar arrays. Micrometeoroids also posed a risk to spacewalking cosmonauts, as such objects could puncture their spacesuits, causing them to depressurise. Meteor showers in particular posed a risk, and, during such storms, the crews slept in their Soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should Mir be damaged.|$|E
5|$|In the Summer of 1999, a {{group of}} volunteers worked to restore and clean up the {{cemetery}} {{that led to a}} ceremony in October 1999 with more than 60 people in attendance. The article in The Day highlighted the difficulty in finding the cemetery which is located {{on the banks of the}} Pachaug River, in the village of Glasgo, located in the town of Griswold. Iva Arpin said that the town would repair the stone walls and that the Children of the American Revolution would return in the spring to continue their work on the cemetery. In 2002, the cemetery had undergone a significant restoration which included the unearthing and accounting for all the burial markers that had been strewn about the grounds. Arpin noted that some of the stones showed signs of vandalism. The Day described how some of the marker stones and monuments were covered in nearly a foot of pine <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> that the roots had uprooted the anchor stones causing the headstones to fall and break.|$|E
5|$|Seung Sahn {{was born}} in 1927 as Duk-In Lee (modern romanisation: Yi Deog'in) in Sunchon (순천), South Pyongan Province of {{occupied}} Korea (now North Korea) to Presbyterian parents. In 1944, he joined an underground resistance movement {{in response to the}} ongoing occupation of Korea by the Empire of Japan. He was captured by Japanese police shortly after, avoided a death sentence, and spent time in prison. Upon his release, he studied Western philosophy at Dongguk University. One day, a monk friend of his lent him a copy of the Diamond Sutra. While reading the text, he became inspired to ordain as a monk and left school, receiving the prātimokṣa precepts in 1948. Seung Sahn then performed a one-hundred day solitary retreat in the mountains of Korea, living on a diet of pine <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> rain water. It is said he attained enlightenment on this retreat.|$|E
40|$|Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) {{contains}} autologous growth factors, {{which could}} act synergistically with growth factors induced by skin needling {{in order to}} enhance the wound-healing response.

The objective {{of this study is to}} establish the effectiveness of the combined use of skin <b>needling</b> <b>and</b> PRP application in acne scarring treatment. Twelve patients affected with rolling acne scars were enrolled. Each patient underwent 2 sessions of treatments, each consisting of skin needling followed by PRP application on the right side of the face <b>and</b> skin <b>needling</b> alone on the left side of the face. Digital photographs of all patients were taken. Photographic data were analyzed by using the Sign Test (a,. 05). The study showed that the scars severity grade in all patients was greatly reduced on all of the face, but the improvement was more efficient on the side treated with both skin <b>needling</b> <b>and</b> PRP. Our study showed that the combined use of skin <b>needling</b> <b>and</b> PRP is more effective than skin needling alone in improving acne scars...|$|R
40|$|This {{guidance}} makes {{recommendations on}} <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> syringe programmes, including those provided by pharmacies and drugs services {{for adults and}} young people (including those under 16) who inject drugs, including image- and performance-enhancing drugs. The main aim of <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> syringe programmes {{is to reduce the}} transmission of blood-borne viruses and other infections caused by sharing injecting equipment, such as HIV, hepatitis B and C. In turn, this will reduce the prevalence of blood-borne viruses and bacterial infections, so benefiting wider society. Many <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> syringe programmes also aim to reduce the other harms caused by drug use and include: •	Advice on minimising the harms caused by drugs. •	Help to stop using drugs by providing access to drug treatment (for example, opioid substitution therapy). •	Access to other health and welfare services. The guidance is for directors of public health, commissioners, providers of <b>needle</b> <b>and</b> syringe programmes and related services, and those with a remit for infectious disease prevention. In addition, it may be of interest to members of the public. [See also, the NICE <b>Needle</b> <b>and</b> syringe programmes overview at the related URL link below...|$|R

5|$|The first {{reaction}} of the host tree is traced to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A phytotoxic secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and needles, causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of the <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> leaf drop. As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp boreholes {{are found in the}} central trunk. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with the needles becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. Unstressed trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic phloem pressure are preferentially attacked, with denser clusters of boreholes.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} usual {{filiform}} needle, other needle types include three-edged <b>needles</b> <b>and</b> the Nine Ancient Needles. Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a 17th-century invention adopted in China and the West).
