5000|$|Thudichum was {{a pioneer}} of British biochemistry, and a founder of [...] "brain chemistry". He is {{credited}} with conducting chemical analyses of over one thousand human and animal brains. In his research, he isolated and characterized numerous compounds of the brain, such as cephalin, sphingomyelin, galactose, lactic acid and sphingosine. In 1884 he explained his findings in a publication titled [...] "A Treatise on the Chemical Constitution of the Brain", a book that was widely criticized and rejected at the time {{by many in the}} scientific community. After his death, Thudichum's discoveries were realized to be important scientific contributions {{to the study of the}} chemical and molecular composition of the brain.Thudichum was the author of numerous works, including books on non-medical topics such as viticulture and cookery. He also devised a specialized <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum</b> that is still in use by physicians today. Since 1974 the [...] "Thudichum Medal Lecture" [...] is awarded in England for outstanding achievements in the field of neurochemistry, and at Yale University, the [...] "Thudichum Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship in Neuro-oncology" [...] was founded within the fields of cell biology, neurochemistry and adult stem cell research to support the study of brain tumors ...|$|E
40|$|Access to {{deep-seated}} brain lesions {{with traditional}} fixed and rigid brain retractors {{can be difficult}} without causing significant trauma to the surrounding brain. Tubular retractors offer an advantage of low retracting pressure. We developed a new inexpensive and simple tubular retractor which requires very small cortisectomy. The new tubular retractor {{was made up of}} silicone with inner diameter of 15, 18 and 23 mm and outer diameter of 17, 20 and 25 mm, respectively. This tube (1 mm thick) was cut in longitudinal direction. It was folded to make a small-diameter tube so that it could be introduced through a small cortisectomy. Margins of cortisectomy were gently and slowly retracted by Killian <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum.</b> Folded retractor, held by tissue forceps, was introduced inside the opened Killian <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum.</b> Tissue forceps and <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum</b> were removed leaving tubular retractor in place, which comes back to its normal tubular configuration after release. Surgery was performed using rigid Karl Storz 0 &# 176; telescope (30 cm long and 4 mm in diameter) or microscope. Near-total removals of intracerebral hematomas, 37 hypertensive and 3 traumatic, was done using this retractor without any complication...|$|E
40|$|Severe {{cardiovascular}} {{responses in}} the form of tachycardia and hypertension following <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum</b> insertion occur during sublabial rhinoseptal trans-sphenoid approach for resection of small pituitary tumours. We compare the effects of preoperative administration of clonidine (&# 945;- 2 agonist) and atenolol (&# 945;-blocker) over haemodynamic response, caused by speculum insertion during trans-sphenoid pituitary resection. We enrolled 66 patients in age range 18 - 65 years, of ASA I-II, and of either sex undergoing elective sublabial rhinoseptal trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. Group I (control) received placebo, group II (clonidine) received tablet clonidine 5 &# 956;g/kg, and group III (atenolol) received tablet atenolol 0. 5 mg/kg. The heart rate increased on speculum insertion and 5 and 10 minutes following speculum insertion as compared to the pre-speculum values in the control group, while no change in the heart rate was observed in other groups (P < 0. 05). There was a rise in the mean arterial pressure during and 5, 10, and 15 minutes after <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum</b> insertion in the control group, whereas it was not seen in other groups (P < 0. 05). We therefore suggest that oral clonidine and oral atenolol (given 2 hours prior to surgery) is an equally effective and safe method of attenuating haemodynamic response caused by <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum</b> insertion during trans-sphenoid pituitary resection...|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{multiple}} tubular retractors {{have replaced}} the old flat ones and are used in multiple indications and approaches. These retractors have the advantages of being less traumatic to the brain tissue and allow a wide field for manipulating different lesions [13]. We used a modified retractor similar to the <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum,</b> and this type gave us all {{what we need to}} wash, coagulate, and resect the hematomas safely. The operative time in the tubular group was shorter than that in the stereotactic group.|$|E
40|$|Obstruction of {{the female}} bladder neck has been treated in 9 cases by endourethral {{incision}} of the bladder neck anteriorly through an operating <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum</b> with very satisfactory results which compare very favourably with those of Y-V plastic reconstruction of the bladder neck in 8 similar cases. The advantages of the incisional technique are simplicity of the procedure, shorter operative time and postoperative stay, and absence {{of the need for}} blood transfusion; its complication rate is very low and the procedure may be repeated if necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{modified}} Henry {{approach to}} a biceps tendon repair allows a direct approach to the radial tuberosity although clear visualisation of it from this approach is difficult. It is particularly important to visualise the radial tuberosity well {{in order to avoid}} poor placement of the bone anchors, with the potential to give poor function of the biceps tendon. We have found using a Killian <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum</b> (Fig 1) allows excellent visualisation of the radial tuberosity while avoiding damage to surrounding structures (Fig 2). The radial tuberosity is directly visualised, minimising any risk of incorrect placement of drill holes for the anchor sutures...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty athymic nude (rnu/rnu) rats were intubated by direct visualizion of the larynx using a <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum</b> with an {{attached}} otoscope as a light source. A blunt, plastic covered stylet was introduced between the vocal cords as guide for a 16 -gauge intravenous catheter which {{was used as an}} endotracheal tube. Successful intubation was performed in 148 out of 150 animals (98. 7 %). Complications were encountered in 2 animals only (1. 3 %). Complications reported were airway injury and bleeding (one animal) and post-extubation stridor (one animal). Our rodent intubation technique is simple, cheap and easy to learn and uses readily available equipment. In addition, it has a high success rate, with very few complications. All this make it a favorable intubation technique {{that can be used in}} all animal laboratories...|$|E
40|$|Report of a Case A 59 -year-old man sought our {{attention}} for a dental abscess in the maxillary palatal site that was successfully treated with antibiotics.

40|$|To {{circumvent}} the disadvantages of endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy such as small rhinostomy size, high failure rate and expensive equipment, we hereby introduce a modified technique of non-endoscopic mechanical endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy (NE-MEDCR). Surgery is performed under general anesthesia with local decongestion {{of the nasal}} mucosa. A 20 -gauge vitrectomy light probe is introduced through the upper canaliculus until it touches the bony medial wall of the lacrimal sac. While directly viewing the transilluminated target area, a <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum</b> with a fiber optic light carrier is inserted. An incision is made vertically or in a curvilinear fashion on the nasal mucosa in the lacrimal sac down to the bone using a Freer periosteum elevator. Approximately 1 to 1. 5 cm of nasal mucosa is removed with Blakesley forceps. Using a lacrimal punch, the thick bone of the frontal process of the maxilla is removed and the inferior half of the sac is uncovered. The lacrimal sac is tented into the surgical site with the light probe and its medial wall is incised using a 3. 2 mm keratome and then excised using the Blakesley forceps. The procedure is completed by silicone intubation. The NE-MEDCR technique does not require expensive instrumentation and is feasible in any standard ophthalmic surgical setting...|$|E
40|$|Background: Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is the most}} common peripheral entrapment neuropathy. Limited incision techniques for carpal tunnel release are gaining popularity. The main advantages of these techniques are less scar load, less pillar pain, shorter recovery, and return-to-work time. However, the completeness of release, and risk of neurovascular injury are always a concern. We devised a method of limited incision release with two mini-incisions and use of <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum</b> and a probe. We aimed to evaluate the clinical and neurological outcome of this technique. Materials and Methods: Twenty seven cases (9 male and 18 female, age 28 – 56 years) of isolated CTS cases were enrolled in the study. A total of 33 hands (six bilateral) underwent limited incision carpal tunnel release. In this study, two mini-incisions were used and release was done with the help of <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum.</b> Evaluation preoperatively and in 6 months and at 1 -year postoperatively was done, namely, (a) clinical status examination, (b) motor testing using grip and pinch dynamometer, and (c) neurological outcome measure using nerve conduction study. Results: All the patients had good clinical and neurological outcome with no recurrence during followup. The first symptom to get relieved was night pains, with a mean of 4. 5 days (range 2 – 14 days). Compared to pain, improvement of sensory symptoms was delayed; the mean duration was 42. 8 days (range 30 – 90 days). Scar tenderness was present only for a mean duration of 9 days (range 7 – 21 days). The mean duration for patients to resume their daily activities was 12 days (range 7 – 28 days) and to work was 32 days (range 21 – 90 days). The hand grip showed mean values of 45. 12 ± 16. 16 g/mm 2 preoperatively, 62. 45 ± 18. 86 g/mm 2 at 6 months postoperatively, and 74. 87 ± 20. 35 g/mm 2 at 1 -year postoperatively. The key pinch showed mean values of 11. 27 ± 3. 51 g/mm 2 preoperatively, 20. 181 ± 3. 94 g/mm 2 at 6 months postoperatively, and 27. 96 ± 94. 42 g/mm 2 at 1 -year postoperatively. The tip pinch showed mean values of 8. 88 ± 2. 39 g/mm 2 preoperatively, 15. 393 ± 3. 25 g/mm 2 at 6 months postoperatively, and 19. 27 ± 4. 81 g/mm 2 at 1 -year postoperatively. The palmar pinch showed mean values of 14. 42 ± 2. 92 g/mm 2 preoperatively, 19. 303 ± 3. 62 g/mm 2 at 6 months postoperatively, and 22. 97 ± 4. 08 g/mm 2 at 1 -year postoperatively. Conclusion: Limited incision carpal tunnel release can be considered a feasible alternative to traditional open release and endoscopic release...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} novel {{modification}} of surgical technique to treat female urethral stricture (FUS) by a vaginal-sparing ventral buccal mucosal urethroplasty. Recurrent FUS represents an uncommon, though difficult clinical scenario to manage definitively. A variety of surgical techniques {{have been described}} to date, yet a lack of consensus on the optimal procedure persists. Materials and Methods: We present a 51 -year-old female with urethral stricture involving the entire urethra. Suspected etiology was iatrogenic from cystoscopy 17 years prior. Since then, the patient had undergone at least 25 formal urethral dilations and periods of self-dilation. In lithotomy position, the urethra was dilated to accommodate forceps, and ventral urethrotomy carried out sharply, exposing a bed of periurethral tissue. Buccal mucosa was harvested, and a ventral inlay technique facilitated by a <b>nasal</b> <b>speculum,</b> was used to place the graft from the proximal urethra/bladder neck to urethral meatus without a vaginal incision. Graft was sutured into place, and urethral Foley catheter inserted. Results: The vaginal-sparing ventral buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty was deemed successful as of last follow-up. Flexible cystoscopy demonstrated patency of the repair at 6 months. At 10 months of follow-up, the patient was voiding well, with no urinary incontinence. No further interventions have been required. Conclusions: This case describes a novel modification of surgical technique for performing buccal mucosal urethroplasty for FUS. By avoiding incision of the vaginal mucosa, benefits may include reduced: morbidity, urinary incontinence, and wound complications including urethro-vaginal fistula...|$|E
