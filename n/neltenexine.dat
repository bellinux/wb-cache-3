40|$|SummaryThe {{management}} of cough in adults with respiratory and non-respiratory illnesses is suboptimal and based mostly on clinical opinions rather than evidence. A systematic review {{was carried out}} assessing all trials in adult patients with respiratory and non-respiratory diseases (excluding cancer) that had chronic cough as primary or secondary outcome. A total of 1177 trials were retrieved and 75 met the criteria {{for inclusion in the}} review. The vast majority were in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cough was the primary outcome in less than one-quarter of the studies. The measurement of cough was variable, mostly using unvalidated scales or being part of an overall ‘symptoms’ score. Positive results were overall seen with the use of corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, mast cell stabilizers, ipratropium bromide, <b>neltenexine,</b> iodinised glycerol and lidocaine. Speech pathology training and symptom monitoring through SMS messages (accompanied by treatment adjustments) have also shown promise. Evidence for established anti-tussive agents such as codeine was scarce, with positive studies from the 1960 s, whilst more recent studies showed no effect in patients with COPD. Many studies had conflicting results. It is imperative that the {{management of}} cough and its evidence base be improved, using higher quality research designs and with cough being the primary outcome of trials...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundCough {{is often}} {{distressing}} {{for patients with}} pneumonia. Accordingly they often use over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications (mucolytics or cough suppressants). These might provide relief in reducing cough severity, but suppression of the cough mechanism might impede airway clearance and cause harm. ObjectivesTo evaluate the efficacy of OTC cough medications {{as an adjunct to}} antibiotics in children and adults with pneumonia. Search methodsWe searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 12, MEDLINE (January 1966 to January week 2, 2014), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1980 to January 2014), CINAHL (2009 to January 2014), LILACS (2009 to January 2014) and Web of Science (2009 to January 2014). Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children and adults comparing any type of OTC cough medication with placebo, or control medication, with cough as an outcome and where the cough is secondary to acute pneumonia. Data collection and analysisWe independently selected trials for inclusion. We extracted data from these studies, assessed them for methodological quality without disagreement and analyzed them using standard methods. Main resultsThere are no new trials to include in this review update. Previously, four studies with a total of 224 participants were included; one was performed exclusively in children and three in adolescents or adults. One using an antitussive had no extractable pneumonia-specific data. Three different mucolytics (bromhexine, ambroxol, <b>neltenexine)</b> were used in the remaining studies, of which only two had extractable data. They demonstrated no significant difference for the primary outcome of 2 ̆ 7 not cured or not improved 2 ̆ 7 for mucolytics. A secondary outcome of 2 ̆ 7 not cured 2 ̆ 7 was reduced (odds ratio (OR) for children 0. 36, 95...|$|E
