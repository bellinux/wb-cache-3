40|$|Posters P 2 : no. P 2. 203 Conference Theme: Advancing Behavior Change ScienceOBJECTIVE: Prolonged sitting {{has become}} a {{pervasive}} component of adults’ lives. New evidence indicates that prolonged periods of inactivity, induced through sitting, have detrimental health effects. While recent cross-sectional evidence suggests a link between physical activity and built environment in adults, there is little research exploring the relationship between sedentary behavior and the built environment. We estimated the strength and shape of associations of GIS-determined walkability components of individual residential buffer zones with accelerometer-assessed sedentary time. We also explored whether these associations varied by gender, study site and type of day (weekday versus weekend). METHODS: The Understanding of the Relationship between the Built environment And Neighborhood (URBAN) {{study was conducted in}} forty-eight neighborhoods across four cities (Waitakere, North Shore, Christchurch, Wellington) in New Zealand between August 2008 and October 2010. Neighborhoods were stratified on GIS-based walkability measures. The outcome measure was average daily minutes of sedentary time estimated from the hourly accelerometer data from 1762 participants (aged 41. 4 ± 12. 1; 58 % female). Participants wore an accelerometer for seven days. Sedentary time was operationalized as < 100 accelerometer counts per minute. The exposure measures were GIS-based walkability components (dwelling density, street connectivity, land use mix and <b>net</b> retail <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> ratio) for residential buffers of 500 m and 1000 m radii. Data were analyzed using Generalized Additive Mixed Models in R. RESULTS: No significant main effects of GIS-based walkability were found on sedentary time. However, significant <b>net</b> retail <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> ratio by gender and street connectivity by study site interaction effects were observed. Retail <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> ratio was negatively associated with sedentary time in women. This effect was stronger and significant only for 500 m residential buffers. Among participants from Christchurch only, an increase of 1 decile in street connectivity was associated with a decrease of over 5 minutes of sedentary time per day. This effect was observed for both residential buffer sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhoods with retail within close distance are associated with less sedentary time in female residents. The effects of street connectivity were location specific as a significant association was found for one city only...|$|R
40|$|We {{have known}} for years that the {{residential}} towers on Roška Street are absolutely the most problematic buildings in Ljubljana {{in terms of their}} seismic safety. We decided to propose the rehabilitation of these structures in line with a "new philosophy" according to which the building interiors are left unaffected, and all the necessary reinforcements are implemented externally. During rehabilitation works, the building is not deprived of its habitational function. We developed the "nothing within – all without" philosophy back in 1981 for the rehabilitation of a big hotel near Makarska (we also took out a patent for it then). It is also essential to note that, apart from adequate seismic reinforcement, we gain new residential <b>floor</b> <b>areas</b> which generally cover all rehabilitation costs. In the case of the residential towers on Roška Street, we envisaged additional reinforced concrete walls for the entire perimeter of the towers. These walls are "stabilised" with a 3 m wide console slab running all around each floor, thus adding approximately 65 sqm of additional <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> to every apartment, which amounts to a little more than the <b>net</b> apartment <b>floor</b> <b>area.</b> Before setting up the new additional perimeter walls, we place 15 cm of insulation in between which considerably reduces the use of heating energy and eliminates all "thermal bridges". The old perimeter walls are connected to the new ones by Ø 22 mm inox steel treenails (with weak thermal conductivity). Since the existing structures are no longer settling, all of the new perimeter walls will be founded on Jet-Grouted columns...|$|R

Built in the early 1990 s in the city center of Stuttgart the building Siedlungswerk provides office spaces for 135 employees on a <b>net</b> heated <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> without a parking garage (NGFr) of 5. 589 m?.

Users complained about high temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter especially during the morning hours. A short term monitoring of the indoor climate confirmed these problems. A comprehensive concept of improvement was implemented at the end of 2004 at a total cost of 250 T? including 100 T? for improvements in energy efficiency. The following year showed a reduction of 36 % in consumption of electrical energy and 49 % in gas consumption. The energy savings generate annual cost savings of 50 T?, which equals a return on invest in energy efficiency after two years.

40|$|Around 30 % of the European {{building}} stock was built before 1950, when no regulations about energy efficiency were in force. Since {{only a small}} part of them has been renovated by now, the energy performance of this {{building stock}} is on average quite poor, resulting in a significant impact on the energy balance of European countries, as confirmed by data published by ISTAT (Italian National Statistical Institute). However, energy retrofit in historic edifices is a quite demanding issue as any intervention must take into account the need to preserve existing building materials and appearances while also allowing reversibility and low invasiveness. As an example, in these buildings it is not possible to apply an ETICS (External Thermal Insulation Composite System), since this would alter the historic and architectural value of the façade. On the other hand, internal insulation would have the drawback of reducing the <b>net</b> useful <b>floor</b> <b>area,</b> which also implies a loss of economic value. Moreover, internal insulation may induce overheating risks and mold formation. In this paper, all these issues are investigated with reference to an existing historic building located in southern Italy, showing that a retrofit strategy aimed at energy savings and cost-effectiveness is still possible if suitable materials and solutions are adopted...|$|R

The tower attracted many rich and famous residents, including Johnny Carson, David Merrick, Sophia Loren, and Steven Spielberg. In total, Trump received $300 million from the sale of the condominiums, which more than offset the $200 million cost of construction. The tower was seen as [...] "something of a New York landmark" [...] as early as 1985.In 2006, Forbes magazine valued the 300,000 sq ft of office spaces at up to $318 million; the tower itself was valued at $288 million, since the Trump Organization had a $30 million mortgage on the property. , that mortgage had risen to $100 million. The valuation of the building rose from $490 million in 2014 to $600 million in 2015 due to increased rent payments by anchor store Gucci. This revaluation made the tower the single most expensive property within Trump's ownership. The next year, however, the tower's value dropped sharply from $630 million to $471 million, losing $159 million of valuation due to a 20% reduction in the tower's operating income and a further 8% decline in the overall value of real estate in Manhattan.
