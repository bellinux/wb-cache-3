25|$|Around 1770, a {{small group}} {{consisting}} of Spanish explorers decided that the Cosumnes River Preserve and other places within the Central Valley was a perfect pasture for grazing animals. Trappers came into {{the area around the}} preserve in the early 1800s but found that there was no place to settle and the fur trapping was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it.</b> The Mexican government started issuing land grants in 1844 and John Sutter who was a European immigrant {{was one of the first}} to colonize the Cosumnes River area. John Sutter founded the colony New Helvetia and soon some of his assistants moved out to the Cosumnes River Preserve area. Once the California gold rush started in 1848, many miners settled in along the Cosumnes River hoping to find gold and get rich. Once realizing that there wasn't very much gold in the region, they dammed the river and changed the landscape to grow hay, wheat, and various types of fruit. The Miwok people lost sources of food that they relied on and soon after villages and burial grounds were destroyed. Shortly after, the Miwok moved out of the region where the Cosumnes River Preserve is and in 1999, the last person to spoke Plains Miwuk died.|$|E
25|$|After {{finding out}} that Lucifer's gone and that Castiel is back, they find a fatally injured Chuck. As a result of Chuck's injuries, the sun is now dying and the world along with it. Realizing that the only chance {{for the world to}} survive is to kill the Darkness along with Chuck, the Winchesters begin {{gathering}} ghosts to create a bomb to destroy the Darkness. With the help of Billie the Reaper, they are able to get the needed souls which are inserted into Dean. Chuck sends Dean to Amara who has started to regret her actions and Dean convinces Amara that revenge is <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it.</b> Amara and Chuck reconcile and Amara heals Chuck of the damage she did to him. The two then leave the Earth, but not before Amara tells Dean she is going to give him what he wants most for helping her. At the bunker, Castiel is banished by a woman who identifies herself as Lady Antonia Bevell of the London chapter of the Men of Letters. Antonia tells Sam the Men of Letters have sent her to bring Sam in for punishment for his actions and fires her gun, apparently at Sam as he tries to talk her down. Making his way through the woods, Dean finds his resurrected mother.|$|E
500|$|The Atari 8-bit {{computer}} port of Donkey Kong contains {{one of the}} longest-undiscovered Easter eggs in a video game. Programmer Landon Dyer had his initials appear if {{the player}} died under certain conditions, {{then returned to the}} title screen. This remained undiscovered for 26 years until Dyer revealed it on his blog, stating [...] "there's an easter egg, but it's totally <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it,</b> and I don't remember how to bring it up anyway." [...] The steps required to trigger it were later discovered by Don Hodges, who used an emulator and a debugger to trace through game's code.|$|E

500|$|The {{testimony}} of Marshall and the Joint Chiefs rebutted many of MacArthur's arguments. Marshall emphatically declared {{that there had}} been no disagreement between himself, the President, and the Joint Chiefs. However, it also exposed their own timidity in dealing with MacArthur, and that they had not always kept him fully informed. Vandenberg questioned whether the Air Force could be effective against targets in Manchuria, while Bradley noted that the Communists were also waging limited war in Korea, having not attacked UN airbases or ports, or their own [...] "privileged sanctuary" [...] in Japan. Their judgment was that it was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to expand the war, although they conceded that they were prepared to do so if the Communists escalated the conflict, or if no willingness to negotiate was forthcoming. They also disagreed with MacArthur's assessment of the effectiveness of the South Korean and Chinese Nationalist forces. Bradley said: ...|$|E
500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do your club much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him." [...] Schmelz replied, [...] "Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube." ...|$|E
500|$|Determined {{to attend}} the meeting, Gates hired a special train {{to get to the}} meeting in Denver. [...] John Osgood was {{prepared}} for Gates' arrival. [...] He had obtained a Circuit Court injunction barring Gates and his associates from attending the meeting; the doors of Colorado Fuel and Iron were guarded by sheriff's deputies armed with shotguns. [...] Gates was angry about being refused entry to the meeting, but he became enraged when he learned he was described in the local Circuit Court as a [...] "high roller and a gambler". Gates returned to New York to try utilizing the Federal Court system there. [...] As the legal wrangles continued, the stock of the company began dropping in value; during this time Gates lost US$3 million, but still was unsure of his legal status with Colorado Fuel and Iron. Osgood announced he was willing to meet Gates halfway, but Gates declined the offer. [...] He accused Osgood of tampering with the courts and claimed that he would receive the legal ownership of the company he was due. [...] Apparently feeling that a long battle was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it,</b> Gates gave up the fight some weeks later and sold the shares, which eventually wound up with the Rockefeller family.|$|E

2500|$|As Díaz saw it, Indians impeded progress. It was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> {{to invest}} {{time and money}} to bring Indians out of their {{intellectual}} darkness and into a modern society through education. Díaz did not think Indians were biologically inferior to Europeans, but felt that centuries of subjugation had psychologically inhibited their ability to modernize. As mentioned in Creelman’s interview, Díaz claimed that Indians did not care to succeed because they could not see beyond the scope of a daily life. Indians needed a ruler to dictate their lives. However, this paternalistic approach to the Indian questioned turned from an issue of social welfare {{at the beginning of his}} presidency to one of indifference, so long as the economy kept progressing. On this point, Limantour and other científicos, played a great part because they “helped to alienate Díaz from the native peoples and this resulted in a growing indifference on the President’s part toward a wide sector of the population.” ...|$|E

A black stripper distracts him while an LSD sugar cube is dropped into his drink. Madigan, while {{under the influence of}} his spiked drink, is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man, and then shoved into women's clothing representative of the mammy archetype, adorned in blackface, and shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. While recovering from being drugged, he fires his gun randomly, and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, the Fire Nation {{arrives and}} Zhao begins his attack while Zuko begins {{his search for}} the Avatar on his own. After {{defeating}} Katara in a battle, Zuko captures Aang as he enters the Spirit World to find the Dragon Spirit {{to give him the}} wisdom to defeat the Fire Nation who tells him to let his emotions [...] "flow like water". Returning to his body, Aang battles Zuko before Katara freezes him. Before leaving to join the battle, Aang lowers the ice so that Zuko can breathe. As the battle escalates, Iroh watches Zhao capture the Moon Spirit, with which its Ocean Spirit counterpart had assumed the form of a fish. Despite Iroh's pleas, Zhao kills the Moon Spirit to strip all of the waterbenders of their ability to waterbend. Iroh, enraged by Zhao's disrespect for sacredness and by his actions to unbalance the world, reveals the extent of his mastery of firebending by using his chi to create huge flame jets from his wrists, scaring Zhao and his entourage of Fire Nation Soldiers out of the sacred cave. Yue explains to everyone that the Moon Spirit gave her life and, with Iroh's help, realises she can give her life back to the Moon Spirit as she dies in the process. With the tables turned, Zhao finds out Zuko survived. They almost fight before Iroh appears and tells Zuko it's <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it.</b> Zhao attempts one more time to kill Zuko with a massive blast of fire, which Iroh manages to deflect. Zhao is drowned by waterbenders after Zuko and Iroh leave him to his fate. Aang remembers his life before being trapped in the ice, including when he left his home, seeing his master's face. With his waterbending powers and his emotions [...] "flowing like water", Aang enters the Avatar State and raises the ocean into a gigantic wall to drive the armada back. Aang now fully embraces his destiny as the Avatar as he, Katara and Sokka prepare to continue their journey to the Earth Kingdom to find an earthbending teacher for Aang. The Fire Lord learns of the defeat; angry over the betrayal of his brother Iroh and the failure of his eldest son Zuko, he tasks his youngest daughter, Zuko's sister, Azula to stop the Avatar from mastering Earth and Fire before the arrival of Sozin's Comet.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 August 1941, a French Communist Pierre Georges assassinated the German {{naval officer}} Anton Moser in the Paris Metro, {{which was the}} first time the {{resistance}} had killed a German. The German Military Governor General Otto von Stülpnagel promptly had three people shot in retaliation for Moser's assassination who had nothing to do with his killing. General Stülpnagel announced on 22 August 1941 that for every German killed, he would execute at least ten innocent French people in retaliation and that all Frenchmen in German custody were now hostages. On 30 September 1941 Stülpnagel issued the [...] "Code of Hostages" [...] ordering all district chiefs to draw lists of hostages to be executed in the event of further [...] "incidents" [...] with a special emphasis on French Jews and people known for Communist or Gaullist sympathies. On 20 October 1941, Obersleutnant Karl Friedrich Hotz, the Feldkommandant of Nantes was assassinated on the streets of Nantes while the military lawyer Dr. Hans-Gottfried Reimers was assassinated in Bordeaux on 21 October. The Wehrmacht immediately shot 50 French people who had nothing to do with Hotz's assassination in retaliation in Nantes and announced if the assassin did not turn himself in by midnight of 23 October, another 50 would be shot. The assassin did not turn himself in and so another 50 hostages were shot. One of those shot at Nantes was Léon Jost, a former Socialist deputy and one legged veteran of the First World War who was already serving a three-year prison sentence for helping Jews to escape into Spain. The same day, the Feldkommandant of Bordeaux had 50 French hostages shot in that city in retaliation for Reimers's assassination. The executions of hostages in Nantes and Bordeaux started a debate about the morality of assassination that lasted until the end of the occupation with many French people arguing that since the Germans were willing to shoot so many innocent people in reprisal for killing only one German that it was <b>not</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> and others contending that to cease assassinations would mean giving in to German terror, that it would prove that terror worked and the Germans could brutally push the French around in their own country. General de Gaulle went on the BBC's French language service on 23 October to ask that PCF to call in their assassins, saying that killing one German would not change the outcome of the war one iota and that too many innocent people were being shot by Germans in reprisals. As the PCF did not recognize de Gaulle's authority, the Communist assassins continued their work under the slogan [...] "an eye for an eye", and so the Germans continued to execute anywhere between 50–100 French hostages for every one of their numbers slain by the Communist assassins.|$|E
