5|$|Since January 1691 Marlborough {{had been}} in contact with the exiled JamesII in Saint-Germain, anxious to obtain the {{erstwhile}} King's pardon for deserting him in 1688a pardon essential for the success of his future career in the <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> unlikely event of a Jacobite restoration.|$|E
5|$|God by {{a sudden}} {{conversion}} subdued and brought my mind to a teachable frame, which was more hardened in such matters than {{might have been expected}} from one at my early period of life. Having thus received some taste and knowledge of true godliness, I was immediately inflamed with so intense a desire to make progress therein, that although I did <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> leave off other studies, yet I pursued them with less ardour.|$|E
5|$|In 1706, the Elector of Bavaria was {{deprived}} of his offices and titles for siding with Louis against the Empire. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with {{command of the}} imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> successful, partly because he was deceived by his ally, the Duke of Marlborough, into a diversionary attack, and partly because Emperor Joseph I appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes {{thought that he had}} acquitted himself well. In 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector in recognition of, or because of, his service. George did not hold Marlborough's actions against him which he understood were part of a plan to lure French forces from the main attack.|$|E

5|$|In a long {{article in}} Le Figaro in July 1856, Offenbach traced {{the history of}} comic opera. He {{declared}} that the first work worthy to be called opéra-comique was Philidor's 1759 Blaise le savetier, and he described the gradual divergence of Italian and French notions of comic opera, with verve, imagination and gaiety from Italian composers, and cleverness, common sense, good taste and wit from the French composers. He concluded that comic opera had become too grand and inflated. His disquisition was a preliminary to the announcement of an open competition for aspiring composers. A jury of French composers and playwrights including Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, Charles Gounod and Eugène Scribe considered 78 entries; the five short-listed entrants were all asked to set a libretto, Le docteur miracle, written by Ludovic Halévy and Léon Battu. The joint winners were Georges Bizet and Charles Lecocq. Bizet became, and remained, a devoted friend of Offenbach. Lecocq and Offenbach took a dislike to one another, and their subsequent rivalry was <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> friendly.|$|E
5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers and sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases {{it is not clear that}} tulips were to blame. This is <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between buyers and sellers. Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 40 {{years of}} service, Eichelberger retired with {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} general on 31 December 1948. In 1950, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where {{he lived with his}} wife Em {{for the rest of his}} life. He suffered from a number of health problems, including hypertension and diabetes, and had his gall bladder removed. His name appeared in a series of articles for the Saturday Evening Post on his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific, actually written by ghostwriter Milton MacKaye. They subsequently expanded the articles into a book, Our Jungle Road to Tokyo. The book sold reasonably well, and Harry Truman and Omar Bradley requested autographed copies. In 1951 he traveled to Hollywood, where he served as technical consultant on Francis Goes to West Point (1952) and The Day the Band Played (1952), but he was <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> happy with the results. He turned his hand to writing articles about the Far East for Newsweek, but gave this away in 1954. He then worked on the lecture circuit, giving speeches about his experiences, but gave this up too in 1955. He campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960.|$|E

25|$|Seventh, {{even where}} slavery was <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> repudiated, slaves and free men had {{equal access to}} the sacraments, and many clerics were from slave backgrounds, {{including}} two popes (Pius I and Callistus). This implies a fundamental equality incompatible with slavery.|$|E

Fortunately, since the y occurs only in loanwords, the letter ÿ is extremely rare (if <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> non-existent) in Dutch.|$|E

25|$|A {{ship was}} named Sir Allan MacNab and was sturdily built in Canada but was <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> {{designed}} for speed. The master in 1855 was Captain Cherry, and the tonnage {{of the ship}} was 840, then quite large. The ship was named after the Canadian hero and statesman.|$|E
25|$|Thus, - {{according}} to Zaehner - while {{the direction that}} the Sassanids took was <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> {{at odds with the}} spirit of the Gathas, the extreme dualism that accompanied a divinity that was remote and inaccessible made the faith less than attractive. Zurvanism was then truly heretical only {{in the sense that it}} weakened the appeal of Zoroastrianism.|$|E
25|$|After the Torah, {{other books}} were {{translated}} {{over the next}} two to three centuries. It is <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> clear which was translated when, or where; some may even have been translated twice, into different versions, and then revised. The quality and style of the different translators also varied considerably from book to book, from the literal to paraphrasing to interpretative.|$|E

25|$|The former was {{published}} in 1796, and gives a general explanation of the phenomena, but omits all details. It contains {{a summary of the}} history of astronomy. This summary procured for its author the honour of admission to the forty of the French Academy and is commonly esteemed one of the masterpieces of French literature, though it is <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> reliable for the later periods of which it treats.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} later dismissed {{such claims}} as borne out of jealousy, aggravated by Goncharov's natural suspiciousness, impressionability, and general hypochondria. Others {{argued that this}} would have been too simple an explanation, for while many of Goncharov's allegations were far-fetched, some were <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> groundless. At least one fact was undisputed: in 1855, having returned from his long sea voyage, Goncharov laid out before Turgenev, his then good friend, the whole plan of his future third novel, which he has conceived as far back as 1849.|$|E
25|$|Strmiska {{argues that}} these two poles could be termed reconstructionism and eclecticism, respectively. Reconstructionists do <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> reject {{innovation}} in their interpretation and adaptation of the source material, however they {{do believe that the}} source material conveys greater authenticity and thus should be emphasized. They often follow scholarly debates about the nature of such pre-Christian religions, and some reconstructionists are themselves scholars. Eclectic Pagans, conversely, seek general inspiration from the pre-Christian past, and do not attempt to recreate past rites or traditions with specific attention to detail.|$|E

25|$|The Civil War, presidency, {{and world}} tour had given Grant a purpose in life. His {{return to the}} United States and New York {{resettlement}} into private life, however, was <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> easy. Grant turned to speculation on Wall Street but lost $150,000 after a stock panic in 1884. Dying of throat cancer Grant penned his Personal Memoirs published by his friend Mark Twain, that earned his family $450,000. Grant {{would not be able}} to enjoy the financial relief of his family or the popularity of his only book. Grant died on July 23, 1885.|$|E
25|$|Free {{elections}} were a startling, and <b>not</b> <b>altogether</b> welcome, innovation for ordinary Paraguayans, {{who had always}} allied themselves with a patrón (benefactor) for security and protection. At the same time, Argentina and Brazil were not content to leave Paraguay with a truly free political system. Pro-Argentine militia chief Benigno Ferreira {{for a short time}} emerged as de facto dictator until his overthrow by Bernardino Caballero with Brazilian help in 1874. Ferreira later returned to lead the 1904 Liberal uprising, which ousted the Colorados. Ferreira then served as President between 1906 and 1908.|$|E
