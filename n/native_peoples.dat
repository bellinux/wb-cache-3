40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the rates and outcomes of diabetic {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD) among registered <b>native</b> <b>people</b> and non-native people in Saskatchewan. DESIGN: Retrospective population-based study {{using data from the}} Canadian Organ Replacement Registry. SETTING: Saskatchewan. PATIENTS: All patients with diabetic ESRD diagnosed between Jan. 1, 1981, and Dec. 31, 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rates of diabetic ESRD in the general population, rates of diabetic ESRD among patients with diabetes mellitus, nature of initial dialysis treatment, length of survival from start of dialysis, cause of death and renal transplant rates. RESULTS: The 10 -year incidence rates of diabetic ESRD were higher among all age groups among registered <b>native</b> <b>people</b> than among non-native people. The overall relative risk ratio for <b>native</b> <b>people</b> was 16. 2. When a higher prevalence of diabetes among <b>native</b> <b>people</b> was taken into account, <b>native</b> diabetic <b>people</b> were still seven times as likely as non-native diabetic people to manifest diabetic ESRD. The median survival from start of dialysis was under 2 years in both groups, but more <b>native</b> <b>people</b> died of stroke and more non-native people died of heart disease. Non-native diabetic people were more likely than <b>native</b> diabetic <b>people</b> to receive renal transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall incidence of diabetic ESRD in Saskatchewan is increasing, registered <b>native</b> <b>people</b> have a disproportionate risk for this serious complication...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflict}} between <b>native</b> <b>people</b> and resource {{development in the}} Canadian north is considered {{within the framework of}} a colonial model of development. It is hypothesized that the origins of contemporary land use conflicts in the north {{can be attributed to the}} colonization of <b>native</b> <b>people,</b> and that the growing discontent among <b>native</b> <b>people</b> can be viewed as a response to the perpetuation of their colonial statuso Two phases in the historical relationship between <b>native</b> <b>people</b> and the Canadian government, traditional colonialism and nee-colonialism, are defined and the impacts of these forms of colonialism upon <b>native</b> <b>people,</b> and their role in the future development of the north, are examinedo Alternative native responses to colonial status are identified and each option is discussed in terms of its likelihood as a choice and the effects of that choice upon the native community. Government control over <b>native</b> <b>people</b> is identified as a major constraint on response choice. ii Various means of government control and their effectiveness are considered. Two alternatives are presented for the future control of political space in northern Canada: continuation of colonial domination or increasing control by natives ~ It is concluded, on the basis of recent experiences in native communities, that increasing control by natives is the only means through which the political and socio-economic status of <b>native</b> <b>people</b> will be improved. ii...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the peacemaking potential of Native justice initiatives {{within the context}} of Canadian criminal justice. Like peacemaking which rose as a revitalization of peace and non-violence within criminology and its concerns, Native justice initiatives {{can be viewed as a}} revitalization movement which has risen in response to the injustice of the criminal process for <b>Native</b> <b>people.</b> By offering alternatives to criminal justice or healing approaches within the structure of the conventional criminal process, Native justice initiatives seek to provide healing and restoration and a meaningful delivery of justice to <b>Native</b> <b>people</b> in conflict with the law. The peacemaking potential of such alternatives lies in the observation that the current euro-based structure of criminal justice is foreign to the traditional spiritual and social understanding of <b>Native</b> <b>people.</b> The tragic consequence of this incompatibility is the overincarceration of <b>Native</b> <b>people</b> and the failure of conventional correctional programming to help them. The offering of a process which is sensitive to the needs of <b>Native</b> <b>people</b> in conflict with the law is a move toward peace and social justice within the Canadian criminal justice system which provides an illustration of how Peacemaking may be achieved. This thesis proposes that Native Justice Initiatives facilitate a healing process between <b>Native</b> <b>people</b> and the criminal justice process and do not represent a full restoration to health. Deep healing for <b>Native</b> <b>people</b> in conflict with the law will require an ongoing process of understanding and accommodation both within the realm of criminal justice and society in general.
