40|$|In {{the context}} of the Integrated Tokamak Modelling Task Force, a large number of {{software}} projects are made available to the task force members, including developers and end-users. This has been achieved through a combination of tools and technologies. The front-end is represented by a Java based portal system exposing a PHP project management system, GForge. These two applications are linked by a single sign-on mechanism, Shibboleth [1], and through secure HTTP [2] request rewriting, where appropriate. Furthermore, the underlying storage facility is an OpenAFS [3] distributed file system and the user base comes from both a <b>network</b> <b>information</b> <b>server</b> and an LDAP [4] directory. Security mechanisms are those of a distributed system, with multiple access points and protocols used for reading and writing data. The present paper presents the challenges of integrating these different technologies and programming languages into a single, working, application presented to its users as a web portal. Chaining of the tools is explored through the user perspective, with an in-depth overview of the background transitions between the various systems involved with regard to security requirements for the front-end nodes and the policies as seen by the users...|$|E

Persistent programming environments offer an elegant solution to the problem of managing large, complex persistent data upon which such servers are often built.

40|$|We {{contrast}} {{two approaches}} {{to the problem of}} information gathering that may be characterized as distributed processing and distributed problem solving. The former is characteristic of most existing information gathering systems, while the latter is central to research in multi-agent systems. We examine features of complex information carrying environments and the information gathering task that demonstrate both the utility of viewing information gathering as distributed problem solving and difficulties with viewing it as distributed processing. We propose a new approach to information gathering based on the distributed problem solving paradigm and its attendant body of research in multi-agent systems and distributed artificial intelligence. This approach, called Cooperative Information Gathering, involves concurrent, asynchronous discovery and composition of information spread across a <b>network</b> of <b>information</b> <b>servers.</b> Top level queries drive the creation of partially elaborat [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} tool, SKIPPER, which personalizes browsers of large {{information}} bases by (1) autonomously detecting and recording documents {{that are of}} apparent personal interest to the current user, and (2) by highlighting and presenting relevant browser options to the user in a hierarchically structured fashion. Thereby browser options are organized according the a relevance ranking of the respective documents, and our tool is designed {{to take into account}} that document relevance realistically changes over time. 1 Introduction Browsers in the style of Mosaic and Netscape [?] allow the access and exploration of information ("documents ") from the vast and growing <b>network</b> of <b>information</b> <b>servers,</b> known as the Internet (e. g., see [?]).

40|$|Complex {{software}} and <b>network</b> based <b>information</b> <b>server</b> systems may exhibit failures. Quite often, such failures {{may not be}} accidental. Instead some failures {{may be caused by}} deliberate security intrusions with the intent ranging from simple mischief, theft of confidential information to loss of crucial and possibly life saving services. Not only is it important to prevent and/or tolerate security intrusions, it is equally important to treat security as a QoS attribute at par with other QoS attributes such as availability and performance. This paper deals with various issues related to quantifying the security attributes of an intrusion tolerant system, such as the SITAR system. A security intrusion and the response of an intrusion tolerant system to an attack is modeled as a random process. This facilitates the use of stochastic modeling techniques to capture the attacker behavior as well as the system’s response to a security intrusion. This model is used to analyze and quantify the security attributes of the system. The security quantification analysis is first carried out for steady-state behavior leading to measures like steady-state availability. By transforming this model to a model with absorbing states, we compute a security measure called the “mean time (or effort) to security failure ” and also compute probabilities of security failur...|$|R

The study is part of the ‘Centre of Earth Observation’ (CEO) programme.

These agents had to include the following Management Information Bases (MIBs) : • A HTTP-MIB, with detailed information concerning the WWW document transfer protocol. • A Retrieval Service (RS) MIB, with high level information concerning the WWW document transfer service. • An Information Store (IS) MIB, with information concerning the WWW server and the documents provided by that server. The specifications of these MIBs were presented to the IETF and provided a good starting point for subsequent standardization activities.

40|$|Worm {{propagation}} analysis, including exploring mecha-nisms of worm propagation and formulating {{effects of}} net-work/worm parameters, has great importance for worm containment and host protection in P 2 P networks. Previ-ous work only focuses on topological worm propagation where worms search a hosts neighbor-list {{to find new}} vic-tims. In BitTorrent (BT) <b>networks,</b> the <b>information</b> from <b>servers</b> or trackers, however, could be fully exploited to design effective worms. In this paper, we propose a new approach for worm propagation in BT-like P 2 P networks. The worm, called Dynamic Hit-List (DHL) worm, locates new victims and propagates itself by requesting a tracker to build a dynamic hit list, which is a self-stopping BT worm to be stealthy. We construct an analytical model to study the propagation of such a worm: breadth-first propagation and depth-first propagation. The analytical results provide insights of the worm design into choosing parameters that enable the worm to stop itself after compromising a large fraction of vulnerable peers in a P 2 P network. We finally evaluate the performance of DHL worm through simula-tions. The simulation results verify the correctness of our model and show {{the effectiveness of the}} worm by compar-ing it with the topological worm. 1...|$|R
