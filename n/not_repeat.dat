The disc also continues the story from the first disc. The second CD contains the voice actors from the original and includes Kadowaki as a main cast member.|$|E
5|$|Even where metal {{objects such}} as bowls and dishes {{do not seem to}} have {{geometric}} decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object. Both closed designs (which do <b>not</b> <b>repeat)</b> and open or repetitive patterns are used. Patterns such as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12thcentury. Eva Baer notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.|$|E
5|$|Noreen's husband, Ashiq Masih, 51 {{years old}} at the time, {{announced}} that he planned to appeal the verdict, which has to be upheld by the Lahore High Court. A month later, Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab who investigated the affair for the President Asif Ali Zardari, stated that Noreen would most likely be pardoned if the High Court did not suspend the sentence. Zardari was poised to grant pardon but Lahore High Court issued a stay order against potential Presidential pardon, which remains in force till date. Court transcripts show numerous inconsistencies in the evidence presented and reporters say they dare <b>not</b> <b>repeat</b> Bibi's testimony lest they also be accused of blasphemy.|$|E

5|$|Several winning seasons followed, but Notre Dame did <b>not</b> <b>repeat</b> as {{national}} {{champion in the}} late 1960s. The team finished with an 8–2–1 record in 1969 and was invited {{to play in the}} postseason Cotton Bowl. The school had a long-standing policy in place forbidding the team from playing bowl games, but the university urgently needed funds for minority scholarships and decided to use the proceeds from the bowl to fund them. Parseghian's team lost the game 21–17 to the eventual national champion Texas Longhorns.|$|E
5|$|The Penguins {{qualified}} for {{the playoffs for the}} third consecutive season. They did <b>not</b> <b>repeat</b> as champions of the Atlantic Division, but earned the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference with 99 points. They began the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs on April 15 against the Philadelphia Flyers. They beat the Flyers, Washington Capitals, and Carolina Hurricanes to earn a second-straight berth in the Stanley Cup Final. In the Finals, the Penguins defeated the Detroit Red Wings in seven games in a rematch of the previous season's Stanley Cup Final to win the franchise's third league title.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{representations}} of 1 also occur in non-integer bases. For example, {{in the golden}} ratio base, the two standard representations are 1.000... and 0.101010..., and there are infinitely many more representations that include adjacent 1s. Generally, for almost all q between 1 and 2, there are uncountably many base-q expansions of 1. On the other hand, there are still uncountably many q (including all natural numbers greater than 1) {{for which there is}} only one base-q expansion of 1, other than the trivial 1.000.... This result was first obtained by Paul Erdős, Miklos Horváth, and István Joó around 1990. In 1998 Vilmos Komornik and Paola Loreti determined the smallest such base, the Komornik–Loreti constant q = 1.787231650.... In this base, 1 = 0.11010011001011010010110011010011...; the digits are given by the Thue–Morse sequence, which does <b>not</b> <b>repeat.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2001 {{they could}} <b>not</b> <b>repeat</b> a {{play-off}} performance, they did finish fifth and maintain an unbeaten record at Carisbrook {{for the second}} season in a row. In 2002 the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was introduced to be contested with the Blues, and the Highlanders won the trophy with a 2013 win at Eden Park. They did this {{on their way to}} finishing fourth, before again losing to the Crusaders in their semi-final. In 2003 they lost their first match at Carisbrook since the 1999 Super 12 final when the Crusaders defeated them 1716. Coach Laurie Mains resigned {{at the end of that}} season after a dispute with some of the senior players, including Anton Oliver. In 2004, their first season with coach Greg Cooper, they finished ninth despite scoring more tries then in 2003. This was mainly due to their defence as they conceded 12 more tries then in 2003. Despite winning six consecutive games in 2005, they eventually finished eighth due to losing their last three matches.|$|E
5|$|Surrey {{visited the}} County Ground, Taunton {{a few days}} later for the counties' second meeting of the season. In a repeat of their {{previous}} fixtures, Surrey won the toss and chose to bat. Bastard, who had not played in their earlier clash, opened the bowling for Somerset alongside John Challen. Bastard, presumably due to the weakness {{of the rest of the}} county's attack, bowled 50 overs, but he could <b>not</b> <b>repeat</b> the successes he had achieved against Hampshire, toiling to take two for 99. All of Somerset's six bowlers in that innings claimed a wicket as Surrey were bowled out for 292. In reply, Radcliffe occupied the crease as the batsmen at the other end came and went, scoring exactly half of Somerset's 164. Roe, Sainsbury and Hewett all reached double figures, but four Somerset batsmen were dismissed for ducks. Requested to follow on, Somerset fared less well in their second innings: Roe reached 43, but no other batsman passed 20, and Somerset were all out for 123, five runs short of forcing Surrey to bat again.|$|E
