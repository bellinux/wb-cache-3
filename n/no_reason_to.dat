5|$|In an {{interview}} Lidle gave {{about a month}} earlier, he stated {{he had been a}} pilot for seven months and had flown about 95 solo hours. The crash garnered extra attention because of superficial similarities to the September 11 attacks in New York City, which had occurred five years and one month earlier. U.S. officials said that NORAD scrambled fighter aircraft over numerous American and Canadian cities for Combat Air Patrol, and that U.S. President George W. Bush was informed about the situation, but that these were precautionary measures only. The FBI quickly announced there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suspect that the crash was an act of terrorism.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the crime was burglary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott {{organised}} the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott saw <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that his effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E

In the play, the audience is aligns with Leontes' view and gives <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> doubt Hermione's death, but the Thanhouser adaptation shows the mechanism and conspiracy formed by showing Hermione's revival and departure. Instead of using the Shakespeare character of Time to frame the passage of time, the role is performed by an inter-title. The final scene is missing from the surviving print.|$|E
5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> dispute those statements.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis of}} this article is simple: even if it is {{accepted}} that quantum mechanics is a fundamentally probabilistic theory, this provides us with <b>no</b> special <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe in “chances” in the sense of objectively existing factors that are responsible for the relative frequencies we encounter in experiments. More in general, quantum mechanics gives us <b>no</b> special <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe in the actual existence of modalities. We may intuitively be inclined to believe in chances as a kind of causes, just as in classical mechanics we are inclined to think of forces as causal powers that produce accelerations. It might even be the case that intuitions of this kind can be developed into a coherent metaphysical scheme (something which has yet to be done, I think). But as I shall argue, a sober Humean perspective on quantum mechanics is certainly possible as well, and has much to recommend it. In short, the thesis of the present paper is that for a Humean, quantum mechanics introduces <b>no</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> abandon his positio...|$|R

The common view among research scientists is that water would have existed for about 600million years on the surface before evaporating, though some such as David Grinspoon believe that up to 2billion years could also be plausible.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to {{also join the}} Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they saw <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so different from their own organization, which had grown {{over the last two}} hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.|$|E

In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E

5|$|Aston's {{return to}} England in late 1626, {{along with all}} the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, {{arriving}} on 23 July and staying only two months before returning to England. He had taken both Protestant and Catholic settlers with him, as well as two secular priests, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive; as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> alter his plans for the colony.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He saw <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> hand it over to someone {{who had not been}} involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
