Stivetts claimed {{that it was his}} weight loss (<b>now</b> <b>just</b> over 200lbs), that was the main reason why he had been more of an asset to the team than in past years.|$|E
5|$|Following the score, kickoff, and return, Tech began another {{offensive}} possession at its 24-yard line. The Hokies {{picked up}} two first downs and drove into NC State territory, but the clock continued to tick toward halftime. In the Wolfpack {{side of the}} field, Tech running back Eddie Hunter broke free for a 23-yard run, the longest play by Virginia Tech in the second quarter. There was <b>now</b> <b>just</b> over twominutes remaining in the quarter. Tech was unable to pick up another first down after Hunter's run, and attempted to convert the fourth down rather than trying a field goal. When the play was stopped for a loss, however, Virginia Tech was denied points and NC State's offense returned with 47seconds remaining in the half.|$|E

They {{were not}} allowed to build a large advantage, with the peloton keeping them just a few minutes ahead. The main action of the day came on the second-category final climb. In the breakaway, <b>now</b> <b>just</b> a minute ahead, Voeckler attacked and dropped the other breakaway riders. Nathan Haas (Dimension Data) attacked the peloton {{at the top of the}} climb, but made a mistake on a corner and ended up in a field.

5|$|Frank Arthur Worsley {{was born}} on 22 February 1872 in Akaroa, New Zealand, one of three {{children}} of a farmer, Henry Worsley, and his wife Georgiana. His grandfather, Henry Francis Worsley (1806–1876), had migrated from Rugby in England aboard the Cornwall to Lyttelton, where he arrived with his large family in December 1851. The family lived in Grehan Valley, high up above Akaroa. Worsley's mother died {{while he was a}} toddler. He was sent to school in Akaroa but when his father moved his family to take up work clearing bush from land at Peraki, he was homeschooled for a time. From age 10, he helped with clearing land for sheep pasture and growing cocksfoot. When Frank was 11, his older brother, Harry, left to join the New Zealand Shipping Company as an apprentice and at about the same time, his father moved his family, which was <b>now</b> <b>just</b> Frank and his 13-year-old sister, to Christchurch.

5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was <b>now</b> <b>just</b> a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
5|$|When it was {{decommissioned}} in 1957, M-56 {{started at}} an intersection with US24 (Telegraph Road) {{on the west}} side of Monroe. From there, the trunkline ran southeasterly along Elm Avenue to an intersection with US25 (Dixie Highway, now M-125) in downtown. M-56 also intersected US24A (now Interstate75) just outside town. The highway continued northeasterly past Sterling State Park and along Brest Bay in the communities of Detroit Beach and Woodland Beach. Turning inland near Stony Point, the trunkline followed Dixie Highway across the Swan Creek. North of the creek, Dixie Highway met US Turnpike, and M-56 followed Dixie Highway northward into South Rockwood. In that village, the trunkline turned northeasterly parallel to US24 to cross the Huron River. On the north side of the river, M-56 followed the southernmost end of Fort Street to Huron River Drive, turning northwesterly along the latter road. The highway ran through an intersection with US 24A and parallel to the river into Flat Rock, where it terminated at the intersection with US24/US25 (Telegraph Road, <b>now</b> <b>just</b> US24).|$|E
