5|$|Not long afterwards, Horch {{closed the}} Roerich Museum, which {{subsequently}} {{moved to a}} new location at 319 West 107th Street in 1949. In the Roerich Museum's former space, Horch established the Riverside Museum. He became president of the <b>new</b> <b>museum</b> and appointed Vernon C. Porter as its director. Open to the public free of charge, the <b>new</b> <b>museum</b> was devoted mainly to exhibitions of contemporary art by American artists. At its opening in on June 4, 1938, the museum showed modern American paintings and work by native Americans as well as Tibetan art objects that Roerich had given to Horch. The American artists included Stuart Davis, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Jack Levine, Marsden Hartley, George Luks, John Sloan, Philip Evergood, Reginald Marsh, Charles Burchfield, and Rockwell Kent.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Pei {{designed}} a <b>new</b> <b>museum</b> for Luxembourg, the Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, {{commonly known as}} the Mudam. Drawing from the original shape of the Fort Thüngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the Imperial War Museum {{sought to}} open a branch {{in the north of}} England. Seventy-one sites were offered for {{consideration}} by 36local councils. One such council was that of Hartlepool, in County Durham, for whom a <b>new</b> <b>museum</b> building was designed by architect Sir Norman Foster for a site on Hartlepool's dockside. In 1992 the Teesside Development Corporation offered the museum, on behalf of Hartlepool council, a total of £14.4 million towards construction and running costs. However, the National Audit Office later reported that the Corporation's offer breached government rules and negotiations were abandoned.|$|E

He was a keen supporter of the Standing Conference on London Archaeology, a body designed to monitor the impact that English Heritage was having on the city's archaeology, which he believed to be negative.|$|E

5|$|In January 1999 {{the then}} Culture Secretary Chris Smith {{launched}} {{a project to}} construct the <b>new</b> <b>museum</b> in Trafford, Greater Manchester. The Trafford Park area has strong associations with the Second World War on the British home front; factories in the area produced Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines used {{by a number of}} Royal Air Force combat aircraft. By 1945 the area employed 75,000 people. The area was consequently heavily bombed, particularly during the Manchester Blitz, when 684 people were killed in raids over two nights in December 1940. By the time of Chris Smith's announcement, the museum had already received outline planning permission (in October 1997), with full approval in April 1999.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) was {{a member}} of the French Academy of Sciences and a {{professor}} of botany at the Jardin des Plantes and then became the first professor of zoology at the <b>new</b> <b>Muséum</b> national d'Histoire naturelle. He became known for his work on the taxonomy of the invertebrates, especially of molluscs. However, he is mainly remembered for the theory that now bears his name, Lamarckism, and in particular his view that the environment (called by Lamarck the conditions of life) gave rise to permanent, inherited, evolutionary changes in animals. He described his theory in his 1802 Recherches sur l'organisation des corps vivants, and in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique, and later in his Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertèbres, (1815–1822).|$|E

5|$|Skagens Museum {{was founded}} {{in the dining room}} at Brøndums Hotel in October 1908. Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, Degn Brøndum, {{proprietor}} of Brøndums Hotel and Anna Ancher's brother, and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen were elected to form the first board of governors. After P.S. Krøyer's death in 1909, his house in Skagen Plantation was used as a museum. In 1919, Degn Brøndum donated the old hotel's garden to Skagens Museum as a site for a new building. Work started in 1926 and was completed in September 1928 when the <b>new</b> <b>museum</b> was officially opened.|$|E
5|$|After {{the home}} {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an {{application}} by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring the windows and wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a <b>new</b> <b>museum</b> and education center could provide a major boost to local tourism—one state senator hoped for as many as 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an effort was made to move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians fought to keep it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters hoping to see the house become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the Field of Dreams site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which does not account for additional after-hours visitors.|$|E
