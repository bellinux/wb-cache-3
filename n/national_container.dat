40|$|Harold James {{examines}} the vulnerability and fragility of processes of globalization, both historically {{and in the}} present. This book applies lessons from past breakdowns of globalization—above all in the Great Depression—to show how financial crises provoke backlashes against global integration: against the mobility of capital or goods, but also against flows of migration. By a parallel examination of the financial panics of 1929 and 1931 {{as well as that}} of 2008, he shows how banking and monetary collapses suddenly and radically alter the rules of engagement for every other type of economic activity. Increased calls for state action in countercyclical fiscal policy bring demands for trade protection. In the open economy of the twenty-first century, such calls are only viable in very large states—probably only in the United States and China. By contrast, in smaller countries demand trickles out of the <b>national</b> <b>container,</b> creating jobs in other countries.

It sets out to interpret the observed trajectories in light of social-historical contexts. The three cases presented share some similarities in their colonial pasts, Chinese-populated demography, and development trajectories as "Asian tigers". However, they demonstrate a sharp contrast in post-war geopolitics, political context, and identity. Three levels of analytical categories {{are involved in the}} analysis: geopolitical, state-institutional, and (collective) practitioner-level. On the one hand, this project attempts to look beyond the <b>national</b> <b>container</b> to introduce various trans-border factors (e. g. scholarly migration, foreign funding and knowledge flow) into the analytical scope under the conceptual framework of a "world system of knowledge network. " On the other hand, the explanation sought is to be grounded on a sympathetic understanding of the actors and their psychological perspective. The data analysed includes literature and archive material, bibliographic and demographic datasets, interviews with 56 sociologists stratified by bibliographical factors and a few informative talks, and some ethnographic observation in the field study. How sociology was introduced and institutionalized in three locations along the post-war geopolitical structure will be traced. The "domestic disciplinary identity" will be explored based on a systematic bibliographic review. A survey of the various modes of public engagement of sociologists is interpreted and the thesis relates some observed patterns to contextual factors.

40|$|Taking Shaun Tan’s The Arrival {{as a case}} study, {{this article}} {{examines}} how the idea of ‘crossing over’ goes beyond the mere mixing of characters and worlds that currently defines the ‘crossover’ phenomenon in the jargon of comics studies. More specifically, I probe how the term ‘crossover’ is connected to issues of fragmentation, dis/connection and dis/continuity, and thereby argue that it shares similarities with the concepts of dislocation and hybridity that have animated the debates of postcolonial literatures and diasporic scholarship for decades. Following that line of reasoning, then, I explore how in engaging with historical and translinear spatio-temporal relations, The Arrival moves between worlds and genres in order to destabilize fixed or preformatted aesthetic and cultural norms and traditions. Drawing on Françoise Král’s study of contemporary diasporic fiction, Marianne Hirsch’s concept of ‘postmemory’ and Graham Huggan’s exploration of ‘travelling theory’, I show how The Arrival visually and thematically articulates ‘migratory aesthetics’ and ‘diasporic tropes’ in order to reassess how the parameters of memory, time and place overlap and interact. In so doing, I maintain that Tan’s graphic narrative presents a chorus of migrants’ memories and experiences through which the personal, the collective and the historical intersperse. Finally, I conclude that in enacting the ramifications and consequences underlying the concept of ‘crossing over’, Tan’s narrative opens up a new space that not only questions the dogmatic <b>national</b> <b>container,</b> but retains utopian possibilities as well, including how {{reaching out to the}} other helps challenge binary models such as us/them, colonizer/colonized and nature/mankind.

5000|$|Deposit-refund {{systems or}} {{container}} deposit legislation, {{also known as}} [...] "bottle bills", can be viewed either as a tax on producing waste {{in the form of}} beverage containers or as a subsidy for properly recycling these containers. When a retailer buys products from a distributor, it must pay a deposit for each beverage container it purchases. The retailer then includes the cost of the deposit in the item's price, passing it to the consumer. However, the consumer is refunded this money by properly disposing of the used beverage container at a retail or redemption center. The retailer also recoups the deposit from the distributor. This system encourages consumers to properly dispose of the waste they generate by buying beverages in disposable containers. It also creates a privately funded system for the handling of this waste. A deposit-refund bill named <b>National</b> Beverage <b>Container</b> Reuse and Recycling Act was introduced by the House of Representatives in 1994 but never became federal law.Bottle bills are currently in place in ten states as well as in Guam.

40|$|Since 1949, {{the ocean}} {{shipping}} fleet, port facilities, roadways, railways and inland waterway transportation {{system of the}} People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of china have all been developed rapidly. Today, the transportation industry plays {{one of the most}} important roles in China 2 ̆ 7 s national economic development. Following the worldwide development of containerization, China has established a highly visible container transport system in terms of its containership fleet and container berths during the 1980 s. As a result, it has been recognized widely that China has entered into its second phase of development in containerization. However, China 2 ̆ 7 s future development in containerization faces a new challenge. it is noteworthy that there are some apparent weaknesses in this newly established system. First of all, China 2 ̆ 7 s transportation development, as well as its national economy as a whole, has long been directed by political decisions. Future success in containerization will be strongly influenced by decision-making on how to allocate the country 2 ̆ 7 s limited available financial resources, and the future trends of trade activities. Also, China 2 ̆ 7 s inland transportation systems are so weak that they do not match current shipping and port capacities. Therefore, the second phase of development in containerization can not be solely predicted by its first phase achievement. China 2 ̆ 7 s further development in containerization would depend highly on whether or not China can overcome its weaknesses in inland transportation systems. In this paper, China 2 ̆ 7 s <b>national</b> <b>container</b> transport management network will be first introduced.

40|$|In {{this article}} drawing {{on her new}} book, All the Way with the USA, Ann Capling argues that Australia needs a trade policy that puts trade, rather than foreign relations, at centre-stage.   A YEAR AGO this week, Australian trade negotiators in Washington were in the final frantic stages of trying to stitch {{together}} {{a free trade agreement}} with the United States.   Throughout the year-long negotiation, the Howard government had stressed the importance of getting a good deal for Australia, which included the removal of US restrictions on major Australia’s agricultural exports. In the dying hours of the negotiations, however, it was evident that the agreement was going to fall well short of Australia’s expectations - despite a personal plea from the prime minister to President Bush for the smallest of concessions. Australia’s trade negotiators always knew this would be a difficult negotiation, but even they were shocked at the lousy deal on offer from Washington. Yet their recommendation that the agreement not be signed was overridden by Prime Minister Howard, who was clearly of the view that a bad deal was better than no deal at all. For Howard, the issue was not so much about specific costs and benefits for industries or for social programs, or even the net economic benefits overall. Fundamentally, this trade agreement was about politics, not economics. At the domestic political level, Howard’s triumph in securing a free trade agreement with the US was promoted as evidence of his economic and foreign policy credentials, especially compared to the new leader of the Labor opposition, Mark Latham. The Coalition argued that any move by Labor to block the trade agreement was evidence of its anti-Americanism, and showed that a Latham Labor government could not be trusted to manage Australia’s relations with the United States, including the alliance. This proved to be a remarkably effective political tactic: although Labor was deeply divided on the merits of the agreement, in the end, Latham was not willing to torpedo it. Apart from domestic political considerations, there was one reason above all why Howard would not allow our negotiators to return home empty-handed. Australia’s pursuit of the trade agreement was driven by the prime minister’s very strong desire to strengthen Australia’s political and strategic links with the US - an objective that assumed even greater importance with the so-called ‘war on terror’. Howard saw the trade agreement as a means of binding Australia more closely to the United States. As Trade Minister Mark Vaile put it at the signing ceremony, ‘This is the commercial equivalent of the ANZUS Treaty’. But Washington sees it as much more than that, and the Bush administration has made clear that the trade agreement carries with it the expectation of continuing Australian support for the strategic framework of US interests - a commitment that will not end with Australia’s involvement in Iraq. This point was underlined by the US Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, who declared that any country seeking an FTA with the US must offer its cooperation ‘or better - on foreign policy and security issues’. Since uttering these words, Zoellick has become deputy secretary of state in the new Bush administration and can be expected to hold Australia to this understanding. It has been a cardinal rule of Australian foreign policy that commercial, political and security interests should not be mixed like this. Indeed, the greatest significance of the Australia-US FTA is that it subordinates Australia’s trade interests to other political and strategic interests that {{have little to do with}} our economic welfare. This subordination of trade policy to other political, strategic and electoral concerns could not have come at a worse time. Australia’s trade performance has deteriorated sharply over the past few years and export growth across key sectors - including agriculture, manufacturing and services - has declined dramatically since the late 1990 s. Nor is Australia keeping pace with its competitors, as our share of global markets has also declined markedly during this period. At the same time, imports have grown strongly, resulting in massive trade deficits and the slowing of economic growth. This is not sustainable over the long term, especially in the absence of a coherent trade and industry policy aimed squarely at addressing economic concerns rather than shoring up other foreign policy objectives. Australia urgently needs a new trade policy - one that focuses on investment in infrastructure and education, research and innovation, and industry and export development. For its part, the Coalition government believes that Australia’s salvation will be found in further free trade agreements. Few trade experts share this rosy view. Kim Beazley is eager to press Labor’s credentials in economic policy - getting trade policy right would be an excellent place to start. • Ann Capling is associate professor of political science at the University of Melbourne.

40|$|Playing an {{important}} role in local and <b>national</b> seaport activities, <b>container</b> wharves are susceptible to structural failure and damage during earthquake events. Therefore, factors that affect the seismic response of crane–wharf structures under different types of earthquake ground motions should be elucidated. In this paper, 3 D finite element models were established to investigate the differences of natural vibration characteristics between the wharf and crane–wharf structures. The dynamic response of a typical pile-supported wharf structure and the interaction behavior of a crane and wharf structural system under seismic actions of near-field and far-field ground motions were studied by performing numerical simulation and time-history response analysis. Axial force–moment relation curves were adopted to analyze the elastic–plastic limit state of the wharf structure under different ground motions. Results showed that the consideration of the container crane increased the natural vibration period of the pile-supported wharf structure and affected the dynamic characteristics of the structure. Compared with the far-field earthquake ground motion, the nearfield earthquake exerted a more significant impact on the structural dynamic response that controlled the elastic–plastic limit state. With the presence of a crane, the moment and shear force of the pile-top decreased and the location of the extreme value moved down obviously. The findings demonstrated that considering the crane changed the failure mechanism of the wharf structure, and the eccentric effect of the crane may amplify the dynamic response as the peak ground acceleration increases. The results provide reference for the seismic design and the evaluation of the seismic response of container wharves...|$|R
40|$|The {{articles}} in this special issue deal with the topic of cultural engineering in various contexts and from different perspectives, bringing together interculturalists, management scholars and engineering academics and professionals. Claude-Hélène Mayer emphasizes that intercultural competences are key competences in international engineering organisations. Her {{article is based on}} selected empirical findings from a multi-method research study. It focuses on cultural engineering in a specific Engineering organisation in South Africa and investigates how managers in an international and culturally diverse engineering environment define intercultural competence, how they cope with intercultural challenges in their daily work routine and how intercultural competence could be promoted within cultural engineering contexts. The contribution by Kirsten Nazarkiewicz focuses on the relevance of conversation as a learning tool to gain intercultural competence. Her paper reflects on communication as a crucial dimension of intercultural learning processes while focusing in particular on the target group of engineers. She presents three significant findings on the characteristics of communication in educational settings. The author argues that the unconscious reproduction of this pedagogical structure is not helpful for intercultural learning and shows how to use these orientations for a collective intercultural learning process that involves experts of different subcultures (technical and intercultural expert) interacting on equal terms. Finally, four approaches for trainers' conduct of talk are introduced to foster intercultural competences. Henning Hinderer highlights the cultural complexities of intercultural technical projects across organizations. He shows how the incorporation of external consultants into a technical project multiplies cultural complexity and suggests a model of how to conceptualize this condition. The author identifies processes of identity-making and othering as crucial constituting factors of intercultural engineering across organizations. He suggests strengthening the position of hybrid individuals who are between professional or organizational cultures to utilize their integrative potential as intercultural boundary-spanners. Project managers are encouraged to incorporate cultural complexity into their activities. Adding to the interpretative understanding of intercultural engineering, Jasmin Mahadevan and Christian Klinke propose analyzing failure and success stories in technical project management. Based on a long-term interpretative study, they show that project reality does not exist as such but is constantly created through stories of project success and failure. They identify three, interrelated types of stories and show when and how intercultural conflict and culturalized interpretations impact the development of intercultural competencies and neglect the complexities of project reality. To overcome these obstacles, they give recommendations to academics and practitioners from various fields. What these articles have in common, is an interpretative approach to specific intercultural settings between social reality and technology. One of their aims is to deconstruct reified <b>national</b> cultural <b>containers</b> and to facilitate a dialogue between such diverse fields as engineering, management and intercultural communication. For doing so, one article concerns the education of future intercultural engineers, another focuses upon intercultural training practice. One article highlights the construction of culture amongst technical management while two other articles conceptualize the complexities of intercultural engineering in technical projects across societal cultures and organizations. The articles presented in this Special Issue outline the field of Intercultural Engineering, this being an academic first. They bring about new thoughts and ideas to empirical research and theoretical approaches in this field and intend to stimulate further debates, research and discussion. You are now welcomed to read on and be stimulated to move the discussion forward, in a constructive, intercultural and controversial way. Die Artikel in dieser Sonderausgabe beschäftigen sich mit dem Thema Intercultural Engineering in verschiedenen Kontexten und aus verschiedenen Perspektiven und bringen so Interkulturalisten, Manager und IngenieurInnen auf praktischer und theoretischer Ebene zusammen. Claude-Hélène Mayer betont in ihrem Artikel, dass interkulturelle Kompetenzen Schlüsselkompetenzen für international technische Organisationen sind. Der Beitrag von Kirsten Nazarkiewicz konzentriert sich auf die Wichtigkeit von Gesprächen als ein Lerninstrument zum Erwerb von interkulturellen Kompetenzen. Henning Hinderer beleuchtet die kulturelle Komplexität von interkulturellen technischen Projekten jenseits organisationaler Grenzen. Jasmin Mahadevan und Christian Klinke analysieren Erfolgs- und Misserfolgsgeschichten in technischem Projektmanagement. Was diese Artikel eint, ist der interpretative Blick auf spezifische kulturelle Felder zwischen sozialer Wirklichkeit und Technologie. Ein Ziel dieser Artikel ist es, essentialisierte Vorstellungen von Nationalkultur als Container zu dekonstruieren und den Dialog zwischen so unterschiedlichen Feldern wie Ingenieurwesen, Management und Interkultureller Kommunikation zu ermöglichen. Zur Erreichung dieses Ziels beschäftigt sich ein Artikel mit der Ausbildung interkultureller IngenieurInnen, ein anderer fokussiert sich auf die interkulturelle Trainingspraxis. Ein Artikel beleuchtet die Konstruktion von Kultur im technischen Management, zwei weitere konzeptionieren die Komplexitäten von Intercultural Engineering in organisations- und gesellschaftskultur-übergreifenden Projekten. Zusammenfassend stecken die Artikel dieser Sonderausgabe das Feld Intercultural Engineering ab. Sie vermitteln neuartige Gedanken und Ideen für empirische Forschung und theoretische Herangehensweisen an dieses Feld und möchten zukünftige Debatten, Forschung und Diskussionen anregen. Daher möchten wir zum Lesen dieser Beiträge anregen, so dass die diese Diskussion auf konstruktive, interkulturelle und kontroverse Art und Weise weiterfortgeführt werden kann...|$|R
