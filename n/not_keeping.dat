5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is a non-fiction book by Canadian {{academic}} Thomas Homer-Dixon. It {{was written}} {{over the course}} of eight years from 1992 to 2000 when it was published by Knopf. The book argues that the nature of problems faced by our society are becoming more complex and that our ability to implement solutions is <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> pace. Homer-Dixon focuses upon complexities, unexpected non-linear results, and emergent properties. He takes an inter-disciplinary approach connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, and ecology.|$|E
5|$|The party {{also became}} {{very active in}} {{establishing}} contacts with post-communist parties in Eastern European countries, including the Croatian Party of Rights, Slovak National Party and IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement. While <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> official contacts, it was in addition very supportive of left-wing nationalist parties such as the Scottish National Party, Irish Sinn Féin and Basque Herri Batasuna. Some of the parties it established contacts with most recently was the Freedom Party of Austria and the Italian Lega Nord, which {{after a period of}} distrust, maintained contacts since 2002.|$|E
5|$|In October 1980, he {{interacted with}} a {{delegation}} of Solidarity members that included Lech Wałęsa, future President of the Third Republic of Poland. When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that {{he would try to}} give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it to cut back on its promise of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} Burn My Eyess release Machine Head started touring heavily {{in support of}} the album, opening for Slayer in Europe {{in the latter half of}} 1994, a tour which ended with their own {{headline}} show at the London Astoria. Following the success of the support tour the band returned to Europe for a headline tour in early 1995, performing in the same venues they opened for Slayer. The band would return to Europe for the summer festival season but Kontos refused to tour and the band drafted Walter Ryan for the festival dates. On the band's return to the US Kontos was fired because he was <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> to touring commitments. Kontos went on to play drums with Testament, and was replaced by Dave McClain.|$|E
5|$|Park's plan paid dividends. Bf 110s from ZG 26 {{were soon}} {{discovered}} by No. 56 Squadron and quickly found themselves under attack. In {{the short and}} sharp engagement, ZG 26 lost five Bf 110s and another damaged to No. 56 Squadron. Worse was to follow when No. 54 and 501 engaged the Messerschmitts. ZG 26 lost a further two shot down and two damaged to No. 54 Squadron. None of the RAF Squadrons reported any losses in these engagements. The Geschwader lost other machines to No. 151 and No. 46 Squadrons who arrived to join the battle. According to one source, the total losses of ZG 26 amounted to 12 destroyed and seven damaged throughout the entire day. Another source gives a list of 15 Bf 110s written off; 13 destroyed, two written off and six damaged on 18 August 1940. Whatever the actual losses, The Hardest Day marked {{the start of a}} decline in Bf 110 operations. Production was <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> pace with losses, and there simply were not enough aircraft to go around.|$|E
5|$|Wild tigers {{that have}} had no prior contact with humans {{actively}} avoid interactions with humans. However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal. Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between {{a mother and her}} young, or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle. Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey. For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines. She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, {{by the time she was}} shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett. According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> watch. Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.|$|E

25|$|Funding for Tertiary Institutions {{has been}} criticised {{recently}} {{due to high}} fees and funding <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> pace with costs or inflation.

25|$|Enver was the {{strategist}} of the operation. Hassan Izzet was the tactician who {{implemented the}} plan and remedied the shortcomings. The failure was blamed on Enver.

He {{did not have enough}} field services to alleviate the hardships faced by the soldiers; he analyzed operational necessities theoretically rather than contextually.|$|E
25|$|The {{footage of}} the BBC and ITV {{coverage}} became victim to the current broadcasting policy of either eventually erasing videotapes or simply <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> them. It is not definitely known {{what happened to the}} original tapes. This led to rumours that they were taped over almost immediately with horse racing, that the coverage was barely taped at all, or that the tapes fell to bits during digital remastering. All these rumours have since been discounted.|$|E

The Central Bank told the Oireachtas Enterprise Committee that shareholders who lost their money in the banking collapse are to blame for their fate and got what was coming to them for <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> bank chiefs in check, but did admit that the Central Bank had failed to give sufficient warning about reckless lending to property developers.|$|E

He tells her they are bound for District 13, headquarters of the rebellion, and that half the tributes (the ones from 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11) were recruited to help Katniss escape, as she is {{the symbol of the}} growing rebellion. They were unable to rescue Peeta and Johanna. Katniss is sedated after attacking Haymitch for <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> his promise. She later awakens to find Gale by her side. He assures her that her family is safe, but District 12 has been destroyed.|$|E
25|$|This pattern slowed {{due to the}} 1975 Land Reform program instituted by the government, which {{provided}} incentives for people to stay in rural areas. As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was <b>not</b> <b>keeping</b> up with population growth over the period of 1970–1983. This program proliferated the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The act did {{lead to an increase}} in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform act. Urban populations have continued to grow with an 8.1% increase from 1975 to 2000.|$|E
