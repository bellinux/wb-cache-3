50|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>vessels</b> in {{construction}} dates {{back at least}} to ancient Rome, where many structures used empty amphorae embedded in concrete. This was not done for aesthetic reasons, but to lighten the load of upper levels of structures, and also to reduce concrete usage. This technique was used for example in the Circus of Maxentius.|$|R

In those directions, Trade winds were setting. But full soon, cut out were all unladen and unprofitable gourds; and replaced by jolly-bellied calabashes, for a time sailing deep, yawing heavily to the push.|$|R

40|$|Owing to {{imbalances}} {{in international}} trade activities, shipping companies accumulate a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> unnecessary <b>empty</b> containers in the import-dominant ports, whilst request a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> containers in export-dominant ports. The logistics challenge to shipping companies is to better manage and control their containers, which consist of company-owned containers and leased containers. The multi-port empty container allocation problem {{is concerned with the}} allocation <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> containers from supply ports to demand ports. In this paper, optimal pairs of critical policies, (U, D) for one port, which are importing empty containers up to U when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> containers in the port is less than U, or exporting empty containers down to D when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> containers is larger than D, doing nothing otherwise, are adapted to multi-port case so that decision-makers can make decisions about allocating the right amounts <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> containers to the right ports at the right time. This allocation problem has been formulated and the heuristic methods are designed according to that the average cost using (u, d) policy at one port is convex in u and d. Furthermore, the examples show that, using the heuristic algorithm, the result in the inland line case is quite close to the lower bound, even the distance is not so close in the global line case...|$|R

Unfortunately, {{this type of}} calculation is extremely cumbersome even for present-day computers. The huge <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> states required both in the calculation of the polarizability and of the self-energy is a major bottleneck in GW calculations. We propose an almost costless scheme, which allows us to divide the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> states by about a factor of 5 to reach the same accuracy. The computational cost and the memory requirements are decreased by the same amount, accelerating all calculations from small primitive cells to large supercells...|$|R

To {{improve the}} efficiency <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> container repositioning for a shipping company, a stochastic optimization model <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> container repositioning <b>of</b> sea carriage {{was established by}} chance-constrained programming. The objective function was to minimize the cost <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> container repositioning including shipping, rening and shortage cost. In the model, shipping cost was decided by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ship used for empty container repositioning. The constraints of the model included meeting the need <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> containers, limit to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> containers provided and the capacity <b>of</b> shipping. The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> containers required are stochastic. The stochastis model was transferred to an integer programming one. Lingo 9. 0 was used to solve the model and simulation was done under varied parameters {{to get a good}} shipping strategy. The results show that the model can provide an effective program <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> container repositioning for a shipping company and it {{is a good way to}} raise shipping efficiency. I...|$|R

The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> cells is the sum <b>of</b> the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> cells in the two components prior to mixing.

40|$|A {{classical}} {{object of}} study in combinatorial geometry are sets S of points in the plane. A triangle with vertices from S is called empty if it contains no points of S in its interior. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> triangles depends on the positions of points from S and a burning question is: How many empty triangles are there at least, among all sets S of n points? In order to discard degenerate point configurations, we only consider sets S without three collinear points. In this project, a software has been developed which allows to count the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> triangles {{in a set of}} n points in the plane. The software permits generation of point sets and their graphical visualization, as well as searching and displaying of optimal point configurations encountered. A point set of a given cardinality is said to be optimal if it contains the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> triangles. The objective is to derive bounds on the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> triangles by means of experiments realized with our software. The created program also allows to count empty monochromatic triangles in two-colored point sets. A triangle is called monochromatic if its three vertices have the same color. While the first problem has been studied extensively during the last decades, the two-colored version remains to be explored in depth. In this work we also expose our results on the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> triangles in (small) two-colored point sets. Also, the treated problem is put in context with related results, such as the Erdös-Szekeres theorem, and a short outline of famous problems which contributed to the rise of combinatorial geometry is presented. Un objeto clásico de estudio en la Geometría combinatoria son conjuntos S de n puntos en el plano. Se dice que un triángulo con vértices en S esta vacío si no contiene puntos de S en su interior. El número de triángulos vacíos depende de cómo se dibujó el conjunto S y una pregunta ardiente es: ¿Cuántos triángulos vacíos hay como mínimo en cada conjunto S de n puntos?

30|$|Our {{suggested}} mechanism {{does not}} aim at filling every slot with a successful transmission.

In the results presented {{at the end of}} this section, we will see that this large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> slots does not severely penalize performance. The rationale for leaving a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slots <b>empty</b> is twofold. First, it guarantees quick converge to collision-free operation after any disrupting event, such as an interference burst. Second, the fraction <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> slots would prevent the starvation of legacy terminals if they were present.|$|R
