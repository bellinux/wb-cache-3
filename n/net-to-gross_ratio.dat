50|$|Bulk rock volume, or {{the gross}} rock volume of rock above any hydrocarbon-water contact, is {{determined}} by mapping and correlating sedimentary packages. The <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratio,</b> typically estimated from analogues and wireline logs, {{is used to calculate}} the proportion of the sedimentary packages that contains reservoir rocks. The bulk rock volume multiplied by the <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratio</b> gives the net rock volume of the reservoir. The net rock volume multiplied by porosity gives the total hydrocarbon pore volume i.e. the volume within the sedimentary package that fluids (importantly, hydrocarbons and water) can occupy. The summation of these volumes (see STOIIP and GIIP) for a given exploration prospect will allow explorers and commercial analysts to determine whether a prospect is financially viable.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{accessory}} mineralogy occurrence {{and distribution}} {{is critical to}} evaluating the reservoir quality and economic success of tight-gas reservoirs, since the occurrence of iron-rich chlorites can decrease resistivity measurements and the occurrence of potassium feldspar increases gamma-ray measurements, resulting in inaccurate water saturation and net-to-gross calculations, respectively. This study was undertaken to understand the occurrence and distribution of chlorite and potassium feldspar {{in the middle and}} upper Williams Fork Formations of the Piceance Basin at Grand Valley Field. Eight lithofacies are identified in core based on grain-size, internal geometry, and sedimentary structures. Four architectural elements (channel fill, crevasse splay, floodplain, and coal) were determined from lithofacies relationships, and then associated with well-log responses.

40|$|Household micro-datasets {{often do}} not contain {{information}} on gross incomes. We present an algorithm which exploits the tax- and contribution rules built into tax-benefit models to convert net income information into gross amounts. Using EUROMOD, a multi-country taxbenefit model covering all fifteen countries of the European Union, net-to-gross conversions can be performed for {{a large number of}} countries utilising existing models of relevant fiscal rules. The algorithm takes into account all relevant complexities of tax- and contribution rules and can, thus, produce much more accurate results than statistical models which estimate netto- gross ratios using only a few explanatory variables. Among the features of the algorithm is the ability to distinguish between different individuals in the same household. Even if individualsâ€™ incomes are taxed jointly, the algorithm is able to approximate separate net-togross factors for individuals in the same fiscal unit. This is possible since EUROMOD can accurately assign people to appropriate fiscal units. In addition, it is in certain cases possible to produce different <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratios</b> for different income components. We undertake a case study to illustrate the importance of deriving separate net-to-gross factors for different individuals within a household/fiscal unit and for different income sources of the same individual.

30|$|Deposition of fluvial sandbodies is {{controlled}} mainly by {{characteristics of the}} system, such as the rate of avulsion and aggradation of the fluvial channels and their geometry. The impact and the interaction of these parameters have not received adequate attention. In this paper, the impact of geological uncertainty resulting from {{the interpretation of the}} fluvial geometry, maximum depth of channels, and their avulsion rates on primary production is studied for fluvial reservoirs. Several meandering reservoirs were generated using a process-mimicking package by varying several controlling factors. Simulation results indicate that geometrical parameters of the fluvial channels impact cumulative production during primary production more significantly than their avulsion rate. The most significant factor appears to be the maximum depth of fluvial channels. The overall <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratio</b> is closely correlated with the cumulative oil production of the field, but cumulative production values for individual wells {{do not appear to be}} correlated with the local <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratio</b> calculated in the vicinity of each well.

40|$|The middle Mesaverde Group of the Douglas Creek Arch, northwestern Colorado, is {{represented}} by a complex succession of fluvial to marine strata that serve as outcrop analogs to laterally equivalent natural gas reservoirs in the Piceance and Uinta basins. The interval includes ~ 380 ft (~ 115. 9 m) of mudrock, coal, and sandstone within the lower (Kmvl) to main coal-bearing (Kmvc) intervals of the Mesaverde Group (equivalent to the upper Iles and lower Williams Fork formations). Based on 2, 488 ft (758. 5 m) of measured section, facies associations include: (1) coastal plain; (2) estuarine; (3) lagoon; and (4) shallow marine. Nine architectural elements are identified and include: (1) channel bodies; (2) crevasse splays; (3) discrete flood bodies; (4) a bayhead delta; (5) an estuarine assemblage; (6) foreshores; (7) tidal barforms; (8) middle shorefaces; and (9) washover fans. The study interval records an overall transgression from coastal-plain to shallow-marine facies associations to regression from shallow-marine to coastal-plain facies associations. Based on 38 sandstone-body measurements, channel bodies have an apparent width (W) of 287. 7 ft (87. 7 m), and thickness (T) of 4. 9 ft (1. 5 m) and are larger than crevasse splays (W= 90. 5 ft [28. 0 m]; T= 1. 8 ft [0. 5 m]) and discrete flood bodies (W= 61. 5 ft [18. 8 m]; T= 1. 6 ft [0. 5 m]). <b>Net-to-gross</b> <b>ratios</b> (N:G) create packages in the study interval and show direct ties to the sequence-stratigraphic framework.

40|$|A Plioceneâ€“Quaternary {{submarine}} channel system, {{influenced by}} localized mass wasting, is investigated using high-resolution 3 D seismic data from offshore EspÃ­rito Santo Basin, SE Brazil. Three abandoned channels, a channel belt, and a mass-transport deposit (MTD) are {{recognized in the}} channel system in a confluence region confined by salt diapirs. In this confluence region, the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the channel system can be up to 1. 2 km 2, i. e., 4 to 10 times larger than {{other parts of the}} study area. These significant changes in the architecture and morphology of the channel system resulted from the interaction between mass-wasting processes and turbidity flows. We postulate that a basal erosional scar created by mass-wasting processes was later filled with an MTD. This basal scar was then used as a preferential pathway for turbidity flows, which were captured by its headwall and lateral margins. The interpreted data show that the captured turbidity flows greatly widened the basal scar but caused only small modifications in scar height. This predominance of widening processes over channel incision occurred because part of the MTD in the basal scar was removed downslope by turbidity flows and replaced by channel-fill deposits. This paper shows that important flow-capture processes can predominate in channel-confluence regions of continental slopes. Basal scars can capture turbidity flows and facilitate flow channelization, which are key processes for submarine-channel initiation. Importantly, the replacement of MTDs by channel-fill deposits has profound implications for reservoir volumes and <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratios</b> in channel systems and partly depends on the properties of the turbidity flows, such as their erosive ability and frequency. The more erosive and frequent flows are captured by the basal scar, the larger is the accommodation space created for subsequent sand-prone turbidites...|$|R
30|$|The {{inaccurate}} delineation of {{the sand}} intervals in well logs can significantly affect the porosity, permeability, pore-size geometry and <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratio</b> of the reservoir units. This study utilized well log cross-plots to accurately delineate the lithologic units and also used petrophysical evaluation methods to determine the reservoir properties {{of the sand}}stone intervals in three wells (L, M, N wells) of the Daura field, Niger Delta. The cross-plots of the gamma ray with density, gamma ray with sonic and gamma ray with depth were generated using the Hampson Russel software. The result of the cross-plot clusters shows two major lithologies of sandstone and shale with occasional intercalation of sand and shale units. Fluid detection analysis shows that reservoirs L 3 (well L), M 4 â€“M 5 (well M), and N 2 â€“N 3 (well N) were found to contain oil, while reservoir M 2 (well M) contains gas. The rest of the reservoir intervals in the three wells contain water, and the average porosity ranges from 14.23 to 28.01 %. This study {{has shown that the}} cross-plots approach can be used to accurately delineate reservoirs for further formation evaluation. It therefore means that an outright estimation of petrophysical properties on wrongly delineated reservoirs can significantly affect the porosity, permeability, pore-size geometry and <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratio</b> of the reservoir units.|$|E
30|$|The Buchan Formation in the Ardmore Field is heterogeneous, and hence, the {{reservoir}} quality is highly variable. The <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratio</b> is commonly greater than 70 % in the better quality zones, the better developed braided channels and aeolian dune sand bodies achieve porosity between 12 % and 28 %, and the typical porosity values of North Sea oil-bearing sandstones at this depth is around 16 % (Selley 1978).

A better metric to approximate well-level oil production is the portion of the connected sands to each well instead of their proportion at the vicinity of each well. Cumulative oil production is not correlated with NGR.

40|$|Submarine {{channels}} are conduits that transfer sediment from continental shelves {{to the deep}} sea. They can form important hydrocarbon reservoirs when filled with sand-prone deposits and are, consequently, {{one of the most}} important hydrocarbon prospects on continental margins around the world. In this thesis, a 3 D seismic volume from offshore EspÃ­rito Santo (SE Brazil) was used to analyse submarine channel systems near the modern sea floor. The aim of the thesis was to investigate the key controlling factors on variations in the morphology and architecture of submarine channel systems, at the same time, providing an analogue for modern and ancient depositional systems on continental slopes around the world. This work shows significant variations in morphology and architectures along the investigated submarine channel systems. The spatial variations in both channel and valley morphology documented here suggest an important role of local factors (e. g. mass-wasting events, tributaries, substrate lithology and salt tectonics) in the development of channel systems. It also records in great detail the nature of the interaction between mass-transport deposits and turbidity currents at the early stages of channel evolution. Basal scars created by mass-wasting events can capture turbidity currents and facilitate flow channelisation, which is a key process for submarine-channel initiation. In addition, the replacement of MTDs by channel-fill deposits has profound implications for reservoir volumes and <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratios</b> in channel systems. Spatial variations in channel sinuosity observed in this work are interpreted as reflecting substrate erodibility beneath the channel system. Submarine channels will show higher sinuosity when encountering resistant substrates, and lower sinuosity when the substrate is more erodible. Temporal changes in channel sinuosity resulted from enhanced sediment discharge from tributaries. This work stresses the role of lateral channel migration as an important mechanism responding to factors such as sediment supply and ultimately, controlling the evolution of submarine channel systems...|$|R

40|$|The Ram Group in Jordan forms part of {{a massive}} and voluminous quartz-rich blanket that covered North Africa and Arabia, the former {{northern}} margin of Gondwana during the Early Paleozoic. The lack of vegetation on the vast peneplained and tectonically stable margin resulted {{in the development of}} extensive alluvial systems markedly different in scale from modern systems. In the Petra area, the Ram Group is conformed by the Salib, Abu Kusheiba and Umm Ishrin formations. Its onset and development are admirably displayed allowing a unique oportunity to perform detailed sedimentological studies. In the paleogeographic context of the Early Paleozoic, the detailed analysis of five lithofacies and interpretation of their three major associations in terms of architectural elements, the study of the mineralogical development throughout the sequence and the ichnofacies content from new ichnofossil discoveries are all gathered in order to reconstruct a depositional and architectural model for the Ram Group. The base of the sequence buries a remarkable 100 -metre high paleorelief of the Precambrian basement inherited from volcanic activity. Upward, the sedimentary package describes a 110 -metre-thick fining/thinning (salib Formation) and coarsening/thickening (Abu Kusheiba Formation) cycle until drastic development of a > 500 -metre-thick, massive, medium-grained cross-bedded quartzarenite (Umm Ishrin Formation). The environments of depositions evolved from shallow marine shelf to delta-front and delta braidplain until definite onset of a continent-wide alluvial plain dominated by shallow, perennial, sand-bed braided rivers on the distal margins of Gondwana. Short-lived transgressions and tidal currents reworked parts of abandoned braidplains. The Umm Ishrin Formation is an excellent analogue for subsurface braided hydrocarbon reservoirs. Reservoir characterization from outcrop studies results in a vertical stack of laterally extensive sheet-like units with remarkable high <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratios.</b> Radial flow is expected and drainage would be driven under gravity dominated flow due to good hydraulic connectivity in a rather thick and homogeneous sand-rich formation.

40|$|In South Central Cut Bank Sand Unit (SCCBSU) of Cut Bank field, primary {{production}} and waterflood projects {{have resulted in}} recovery of only 29 % of the original oil in place from heterogeneous, fluvial sandstone deposits. Using highresolution sequence stratigraphy and geostatistical analysis, I developed a geologic model that may improve the ultimate recovery of oil from this field. In this study, I assessed sequence stratigraphic concepts for continental settings and extended the techniques to analyze low-accommodation alluvial systems of the Cut Bank and Sunburst members of the lower Kootenai formation (Cretaceous) in Cut Bank field. Identification and delineation of five sequences and their bounding surfaces led {{to a better understanding}} of the reservoir distribution and variability. Recognition of stacking patterns allowed for the prediction of reservoir rock quality. Within each systems tract, the best quality reservoir rocks are strongly concentrated in the lowstand systems tract. Erosional events associated with falling baselevel resulted in stacked, communicated (multistory) reservoirs. The lowermost Cut Bank sandstone has the highest reservoir quality and is a braided stream parasequence. Average <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratio</b> value (0. 6) is greater than in other reservoir intervals. Little additional stratigraphically untapped oil is expected in the lowermost Cut Bank sandstone. Over most of the SCCBSU, the Sunburst and the upper Cut Bank strata are valley-fill complexes with interfluves that may laterally compartmentalize reservoir sands. Basal Sunburst sand (Sunburst 1, average <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratio</b> ~ 0. 3) has better reservoir quality than other Sunburst or upper Cut Bank sands, but its reservoir quality is significantly less than that of lower Cut Bank sand. Geostatistical analysis provided equiprobable representations of the heterogeneity of reservoirs. Simulated reservoir geometries resulted in an improved description of reservoir distribution and connectivity, as well as occurrences of flow barriers. The models resulting from this study can be used to improve reservoir management and well placement and to predict reservoir performance in Cut Bank field.

This relationship among adult copepods has previously received little attention. In this study, we questioned whether the swimming behaviour of three morphologically different adult states of Pseudodiaptomus annandalei (i. e. males, non-ovigerous and ovigerous females) could be differentiated. Two-dimensional video observations revealed that some swimming patterns were common to all adult states, whereas others were more specific {{to one of the}} adult states. Males swim in a straight way, ovigerous females exhibit jerky swimming behaviour, and non-ovigerous females exhibit slow and steady gliding, interrupted occasionally by jumps. Direct measures of the swimming behaviour (i. e. mean, maximal and probability density of speed) for a large number of trajectories were considered first. Deeper comparisons of each sexual state were conducted using scale-dependant (i. e. <b>net-to-gross</b> displacement <b>ratio),</b> scale-independent (power spectrum, multi-fractal) metrics and symbolic analysis. The combined analysis emphasized the differences (e. g. male swimming patterns were slower and less complex, both ovigerous and non-ovigerous female swimming patterns were faster and more complex) and similarities (e. g. all swimming patterns were different from the Brownian motion) between adult swimming patterns. The multi-fractal approach identified differences between the two sexes suggesting differential swimming behaviour.

The difficulty in visualizing nematocystâ€“prey interactions remains the chief obstacle to understanding how {{the wide variety of}} nematocyst types influences the mechanics of prey capture. One solution to this limitation has been to assign functional roles to nematocysts based on morphological characters of discharged cnidae. Here we report results of an alternative approach based upon dynamic traits of nematocyst discharge. We examined tubule lengths, tubule discharge velocities and <b>net-to-gross</b> displacement <b>ratios</b> of tubules of discharging nematocysts possessed by the cosmopolitan scyphomedusa, Cyanea capillata. This nematocyst assemblage consisted of euryteles, birhopaloids and three different isorhizas â€” a-isorhizas, A-isorhizas and O-isorhizas. Dynamic traits varied little within each nematocyst type but there were significant differences between the different types. Most importantly, dynamic traits varied significantly within a broad category of nematocyst â€“ the isorhizas â€“ indicating that conventional classification schemes that infer function based on broad nematocyst categories may not appropriately describe the functional roles of these nematocysts. The dynamic properties of discharging nematocysts were consistent with physical results described in studies using scanning electron microscopy images of nematocystâ€“prey interactions. These data suggest that nematocysts vary significantly in their roles during predation, but that inferences relating prey selection with broad nematocyst categories merit careful examination...|$|R

Both approaches are similar to their sensitivity to volume shale, and behave a little different when faults and vertical permeability is altered in the simulations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work investigates {{effective}} CO 2 {{storage capacity}} of a field case example, the Ketzin reservoir (CO 2 SINK) in Germany with highly heterogeneous permeability and porosity. The present concept of storage capacity coefficients is briefy explained and then extended to widen the usability in the long term. A basecase incorporating the latest geological model is defined, for which storage capacity coefficients are given {{in the course of}} time. The effective storage capacity C for a injection of 60000 tons of CO 2 is 5. 7 per mill in terms of pore volume. A sensitivity study on the <b>Net-to-Gross</b> <b>ratio</b> shows, that the applicability of the final effective storage capacity coefficient is limited here. All realisations show about the same effective storage capacity C. However, the location of the CO 2 mass and the mobility (mobile/immobile gas) varies with the N/G ratio. For increasing N/G ratio, more mobile CO 2 mass stays in the sand channels...|$|E

Information in chemical signals {{is influenced by}} the hydrodynamic conditions of the environment. Hydro-dynamically distinct environments will contain different types of information, which will influence how organisms orient. This study was designed to examine how the orientation behavior of the brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) is influenced by flow regime. The experiment was conducted in a flume under two different flow conditions. Treatments consisted of control (no odor) and plain gelatin (odor). Percent success, swimming speed, turning angle, heading angle, heading angle upstream, and <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratio</b> were analyzed. Brown bullheads were 100 % successful in finding the odor source under no flow and 57 % success-ful in flow. Bullheads swam differently in the no-flow condition when compared to the flow condition. Since, these fish did not orient the same under different flow conditions, it appears that hydrodynamics plays a role in shaping their behavior. Key Wordsâ€”Chemical orientation, catfish, swimming behavior, hydrodynam-ics, chemical signal...|$|E
40|$|CO 2 {{storage in}} {{depleted}} gas fields is attractive but gas fields are unequally distributed geographically {{and can be}} utilized only within a restricted window of opportunity. Therefore, CO 2 storage in saline aquifers {{can be expected to}} become an important element of CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) systems. CO 2 storage in saline aquifers is studied in the European DYNAMIS project, where special attention was paid to the relation between the geological structure, geological properties and achievable injection rates. This paper presents the results from simulations of CO 2 storage in two aquifer structures. One aquifer structure is located in the English sector of the Southern North Sea and one aquifer structure located in Northern Germany. The geological model of the Southern North Sea structure was built using existing knowledge of facies geometry and distribution from literature and well logs and the overall geometry from interpreted horizons. The distributions of properties like lithology, <b>net-to-gross</b> <b>ratios,</b> porosity and permeability were stochastically modelled to represent the braided and meandering river and fan systems within the Bunter Sandstone Formation. High-porosity and high-permeability zones model fluvial channels running through the reservoir. A different approach was chosen for the North German structure. Because there is no information on the facies or petrophysical parameter distribution of the aquifer, three different model scenarios were generated. One model was created with homogeneous properties throughout the aquifer. Two other model scenarios were generated allowing the porosity and permeability to vary within certain ranges. This was done using a sequential Gaussian simulation with the known mean, minimum and maximum values of porosity and permeability, respectively. Due {{to the size of the}} aquifer structures and computing limits, up-scaling of the geological model of the Southern North Sea was required. The up-scaling was aimed to retain as much as possible of the modelled geological features such as braided river and fan systems. Several reservoir simulations were carried out in collaboration between TNO and IFP to assess CO 2 injection. Given the injection rate constraints, the aim of the injection simulations was to: â€¢assess the achievable rate of injection;â€¢study the migration and behavior of the CO 2 in the reservoir;â€¢assess the most appropriate location(s) for the CO 2 injection wells using alternate injection strategies. The injection strategy is relevant especially for the Southern North Sea structure, where river and fan systems may results in high-permeability zones through the reservoir. Accessing such systems may significantly improve a reservoir's value for CO 2 storage. The effect of such systems on the injection rates is demonstrated. The reservoir simulations also demonstrate the injection rates that can be achieved in tight reservoirs as in the North Germany case, and the effect of spatial variability of geological parameters. This will show whether it is reasonable to assume spatial geological homogeneity, when data on the reservoir formation are scarce. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} a comprehensive and internally consistent {{assessment of the}} energy performance of {{the full range of}} electricity production technologies in the United Kingdom, integrating the viewpoints offered by net energy analysis (NEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA). Specifically, the energy return on investment (EROI), <b>net-to-gross</b> energy output <b>ratio</b> (NTG) and non-renewable cumulative energy demand (nr-CED) indicators were calculated for coal, oil, gas, biomass, nuclear, hydro, wind and PV electricity. Results point to wind, {{and to a lesser extent}} PV, as the most recommendable technologies overall in order to foster a transition towards an improved electricity grid mix in the UK, from both points of view of short-term effectiveness at providing a net energy gain to support the multiple societal energy consumption patterns, and long-term energy sustainability (the latter being inversely proportional to the reliance on non-renewable primary energy sources). The importance to maintain a sufficient installed capacity of readily-dispatchable gas-fired electricity is also recognized...|$|R
