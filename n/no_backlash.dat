A Facebook group which amassed approximately 38,000 members protested the decision by the publicly funded broadcaster ORF, to internally select the country's Eurovision act without a public vote. In an interview with Austrian newspaper Kurier, Wurst defended her internal selection by ORF, noting that the broadcaster had the sole responsibility of making decisions regarding the contest and that the 2007 internal {{selection of}} Eric Papilaya received <b>no</b> <b>backlash</b> from the Austrian public. Wurst also claimed that the criticism from the group surpassed protest against her as the selected artist and instead [...] "displayed homophobic statements and discrimination", and she vowed to [...] "continue fighting against discrimination" [...] in response to the Facebook group.|$|E

40|$|Most former Soviet republics {{have fallen}} into an {{economic}} and political under-reform trap. An intrusive state imposes high tax rates and drives entrepreneurs into the unofficial economy, which further aggravates the pressure on official businessmen.

Remarkably, Communist parties remain popular and opposed to establishing {{the rule of law}} precisely in those places where they were able to delay and derail reform. <b>No</b> electoral <b>backlash</b> prompts the reforms necessary to leave the under-reform trap.

40|$|Abstract. A Flexural {{mechanism}} uses {{flexibility of}} material for desired motion objectives. As compared rigid-body mechanisms where actuations are applied {{at the joints}} connecting rigid links, the manipulation of the Flexural mechanism relies on the deflection of internal flexible members. Flexural mechanisms have no relative moving parts (and thus involve <b>no</b> wear, <b>backlash,</b> noise and lubrication), are relatively compact in design as compared to rigid link mechanism. Double Flexural Manipulator (DFM) is basic building block for planar flexural mechanism. This paper explains working principle of DFM and its parametric modelling. DFM has three basic parameters which decides range of motion, actuator requirement (Peak force and continuous force). In this paper Parametric FEA analysis is carried on DFM and verified with Analytical Model. This parametric modelling can be further used for designing and developing a flexural mechanism for precision applications...|$|R

5000|$|Planetary {{reduction}} drives {{are typically}} attached between {{the shaft of}} the variable capacitor and the tuning knob of any radio, to allow fine adjustments of the tuning capacitor with smooth movements of the knob.

40|$|New {{technologies}} {{which are}} mainly based {{on high speed}} and precision (robots, manipulators, machine tools, etc.) impose special requirements for gears.

So, {{it is important that}} gears do not have excessive internal backlash. Harmonic drive gears are one of the newer gears which in there is <b>no</b> internal <b>backlash.</b> Harmonic drive gears have other advantages such as high capacity output bearing, high torque capacity, excellent positioning accuracy and repeatability, compact design, high single stage ratios, high torsional stiffness, high efficiency, simple installation and assembly, etc. In this paper it is described some cases of using Harmonic drive gear in machine tools...|$|R

Significantly, one motor can generate enough torque to lift a second motor of {{about the same size}} against the force of gravity, at a distance approximately equal {{to the size of the}} motor, without resorting to the use of a counterweight.

Gender, agentic and communal traits were manipulated in the applications. Whether or not the applications resulted in a job interview invitation constituted the dependent variable.

50|$|Strain wave gearing {{also known}} as Harmonic Drive is a special type of {{mechanical}} gear system that can improve certain characteristics compared to traditional gearing systems such as helical gears or planetary gears. It was invented in 1957 by C.W. Musser {{while he was a}} research advisor at United Shoe Machinery (USM). The advantages include: <b>no</b> <b>backlash,</b> compactness and light weight, high gear ratios, reconfigurable ratios within a standard housing, good resolution and excellent repeatability when repositioning inertial loads, high torque capability, and coaxial input and output shafts. High gear reduction ratios are possible in a small volume (a ratio from 30:1 up to 320:1 is possible in the same space in which planetary gears typically only produce a 10:1 ratio).Disadvantages include a tendency for 'wind-up' (a torsional spring rate) in the low torque region. Strain wave gears are typically used in industrial motion control, machine tool, printing machine, robotics and aerospace, for gear reduction but may also be used to increase rotational speed, or for differential gearing.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the inherent problem of friction {{in a variety of}} haptic devices, magnetic levitation-based systems were developed. Such systems work by providing force feedback to the user holding onto a handle, which levitates within a magnetic field, which is then controlled by controlling/shimming the magnetic field to impact the levitating metallic handle. These devices are favorable because they provide no static friction and <b>no</b> mechanical <b>backlash</b> and have high position accuracy and resolution. The first commercially available magnetic levitation-based haptic device was called the Maglev 200 developed by Butterfly Haptics (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) [96]. The inherent problem with such a device is the high computational cost for determining the magnetic control and instability of the body dynamics while in the magnetic field due to the presence of a human in the system. Last, the device only provided a 14 ° conical workspace which in regard to surgery is limiting. Similar technologies were developed by Energid Corporation, which built an untethered magnetic haptic feedback system [97]. However, the device was shown to have a 1.5 -Hz bandwidth, which was not enough to perform real-time haptic rendering.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDo extreme price {{changes of}} {{pharmaceutical}} stocks reflect unexpected scientific information produced during the drug R&D process, especially {{the approval of}} new drugs, but also pre- and clinical trial results, recalls and withdrawals? Do stock prices initially overreact to such information? We modelled market-adjusted daily changes in stock prices of the seventeen biggest pharmaceutical firms worldwide from 1989 to 2008 to detect large price changes (outliers), using an ARMA-GARCH dynamic econometric model. Then, we matched those outliers with news produced during the drug R&D process, and tested the hypothesis of no overreaction by examining cumulative abnormal returns. Our results show that there were 261 abnormal market adjusted daily returns. In 60 % of the cases, {{we were able to}} assign a plausible cause; i. e., FDA approvals in 6 % of these cases, news of a scientific nature in another 25 %. Only 10 of 1721 FDA approvals of new drugs during the study period were related to abnormally large returns. The impact of negative news items on stock prices is larger than of positive news items. The overreaction hypothesis is rejected; there is <b>no</b> price <b>backlash,</b> therefore the efficient market hypothesis is not violated...|$|R

Student experience was exceptionally good across all measures.
