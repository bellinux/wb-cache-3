25|$|Several unusual {{invertebrate}} {{species can}} be found in the Killarney valley. Some of these species, including the <b>northern</b> <b>emerald</b> dragonfly (Somatochlora arctica) and several caddisfly and stonefly species are usually found much further north in Europe. They are thought to be relict species that were left behind in Killarney after the last retreat of ice. The northern or moorland emerald dragonfly, the rarest Irish dragonfly, is confined to the park. It breeds in shallow pools in bogs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>emerald</b> (Somatochlora arctica) is a middle-sized {{species of}} dragonfly. The male can be {{recognised}} by its pincer-like appendages and its narrow-waisted body. The female has distinctive orange-yellow spots on (only) the third {{segment of the}} abdomen.This species lives in bogs and lays its eggs in very small water-filled depressions. It hunts between trees and avoids open spaces.|$|E
50|$|Glaciers {{have left}} a peat bog where one can find Drosera, mud sedge (Carex limosa), and the <b>northern</b> <b>emerald</b> (Somatochlora arctica), an insect {{in the order of}} Odonata. In a canyon hidden under the forest, one can find plants that are able to grow up to {{elevations}} of 2000 m (Rhododendron ferrugineum, Lycopode sélagine). On the other hand, on the lakeside cliffs in the hot and dry microclimate southern species (such as Acer monspessulanum) have acclimatized and established.|$|E

40|$|Whilst Corporate Social Responsibility is {{now part}} and parcel of many {{multinational}} mining operations, and a ‘sustainable mining’ narrative a fundamental part of their public persona, companies still struggle to provide secure, long-term livelihoods for either locals or the swathe of migrants mining attracts. Minimal opportunities in the formal sector leave migrants in particular engaging in informal and illegal activities that offer poor livelihood security. In this paper we examine these activities in <b>Northern</b> Zambia’s <b>emerald</b> mines to highlight some of the issues and barriers to sustainable development that exist across mining zones. We conclude that livelihood choices are not augmented by a so-called ‘sustainable mining’ approach that fails to engage all sectors of the population. We show the numerous challenges faced by migrants in this part of Zambia to accentuate the factors {{that need to be addressed}} before favourable environments for fostering sustainable mining might be achieved...|$|R

50|$|Local fan {{groups also}} developed, some {{disbanding}} when the series ended production, others {{which are still}} running; among those still in operation are The Whoosier Network (Indiana, celebrating its 29th Anniversary in 2013), the North East Wisconsin Friends of The Doctor (NEWFOD), the Prydonians of Prynceton (New Jersey), the Guardians of Gallifrey (Central Florida), Tardis Repairs Inc. (aka TRI, Southern Florida), Doctor Who New York and the Gallifreyan Embassy of Long Island (New York), the Atlanta Gallifreyans (Georgia) and the Time Meddlers of Los Angeles (California). Other prominent fan groups have included the Unearthly Children (Pennsylvania), Friends of the Time Lord and UNIT (Massachusetts), T.A.R.D.I.S. (Arizona), the Legion of Rassilon (<b>Northern</b> California), <b>Emerald</b> City Androgums (Washington state), Motor City TARDIS (Michigan), the St. Louis CIA (Missouri), Space City Time Lords and the International House of Daleks (Texas) and the Chronicles of Who (Illinois). Many others have existed over the years.|$|R
40|$|The <b>northern</b> {{terminus}} of <b>Emerald</b> Glacier (51 ﾟ 31 'N, 116 ﾟ 32 'W) in the Yoho Valley, British Columbia was {{bordered by}} a small, actively forming frontal moraine during summer 1979. Stratigraphic and morphological contrasts existed round the ice front, which primarily {{resulted from a}} contrast {{in the distribution of}} supraglacial debris. [...] Sedimentological and geotechnical techniques were utilised to determine the origin of stratigraphic units within the moraine ridge. [...] Moraine A, at the margin of heavily debris covered ice, exhibited a complex stratigraphy. At most sites a lens of subglacially derived till was evident, between units of supraglacially derived material. It is proposed that the moraine forming process involved the initial development of an ice-front talus apron, which was subsequently pushed and over-ridden. A plastic subglacial till was squeezed from beneath the supra-morainal ice margin, and overlain by a sorted supraglacial unit during glacier retreat. The moraine was actively advancing during the field season due to the maintenance of glacier-moraine contact resulting from the retardation of ice-melt afforded by the supraglacial debris cover. [...] Moraine B is located at the margin of debris-free ice. The stratigraphy is less complex, although an upper unit representing a younger depositional phase was observed. The process of formation involved the melt-out of subglacial deposits during the summer months (July to August), which were bull-dozed into a ridge during winter advance. Successive accretions of till onto the proximal moraine side, perhaps on a annual basis, are suggested. [...] Deterioration of climate, resulting in positive mass balances is the main cause of glacier advance. Positive balances have been recorded from nearby glaciers between 1973 and 1976. This suggests that small glaciers are sensitive indicators of periods of climatic deterioration. [...] The thesis concludes that more than one moraine forming process may be observed around a single ice margin, one of which may be 'annual' in nature; and that complex moraines may be formed by depositional processes operating at the margin of a temperate glacier. If complexities exist in presently forming moraines, then such a possibility must be considered when examining deposits of past glaciations...|$|R
