The computations predict {{the formation}} of the ETB at the heating power given by the multi-machine scaling if the fraction of convective heat losses from the plasma does not exceed 50 %. An increase of the amount of heat lost through convection above this critical value shifts the formation of ETB to a power several times above the level given by the scaling. For given plasma parameters, the ratio of the conductive to convective beat losses at the plasma edge is determined by the penetration of <b>neutrals.</b> By <b>switching</b> from a divertor to a limiter configuration when the distance between the LCMS and neutralizing plates decreases, this ratio increases due to the higher fraction of particles ionized inside the last closed magnetic surface (LCMS).
