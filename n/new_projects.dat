5|$|The General Assembly {{established}} the state's first sales tax at two percent in 1962. The {{revenues from the}} tax led {{to a host of}} <b>new</b> <b>projects</b> across the state. The General Assembly also passed the Indiana Civil Rights bill in 1963, granting equal protection to minorities in seeking employment. In 1970 a series of constitutional amendments were passed. Among them was one that authorized the General Assembly to meet annually instead of biennially.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's term as {{governor}} {{was marked by}} modestly progressive policies, which included tax reform, clean water regulations, and the repeal of laws against interracial marriage. Community health programs were expanded, as were higher educational and employment opportunities for those on low incomes. Steps were taken towards ending segregation in schools. Agnew's fair housing legislation was limited, applying only to <b>new</b> <b>projects</b> above a certain size. These were the first such laws passed south of the Mason–Dixon line.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a rationale for}} why an organization often generates a bias {{in favor of a}} <b>new</b> <b>project</b> even after learning that its profitability will be certainly below more conventional ones. We analyze a principal-agent model with two alternative projects, one of which is to be chosen by the principal. In our model, the profitability of a project is determined by the cost of implementation. All parties are familiar with one of the projects (the known project), and thus the implementation cost of this project is common knowledge. Information on the other <b>project</b> (the <b>new</b> <b>project),</b> however, must be acquired by the agent. We find that the <b>new</b> <b>project</b> may be chosen in the optimal contract even when {{it turns out to be}} more costly to implement than the known project, if acquiring information is costly enough and the realized implementation cost of the <b>new</b> <b>project</b> is below a particular level. We also discuss distortion in the <b>new</b> <b>project's</b> output schedule when it is selected. ...|$|R

5|$|Amman is {{introducing}} {{itself as a}} business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of <b>new</b> <b>projects.</b> A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 Iraq War. Jordan's main airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier Royal Jordanian, a major airline in the region. The airline is headquartered in Zahran district. Rubicon Group Holding and Maktoob, two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as Hikma Pharmaceuticals, one of the Middle East's largest pharmaceutical companies, and Aramex, the Middle East's largest logistics and transportation company.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 2009, {{the city}} had a declining and aging {{population}} compared to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as young people moved {{to the center of}} the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, as a result of <b>new</b> <b>projects</b> and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Communally, {{conditions}} for black Harlemites improved by 1943, with better employment in civil services, for instance. Economic problems became exacerbated under wartime conditions; new war and non-war industries and business continued {{to discriminate against}} blacks. Though <b>new</b> <b>projects</b> such as the Harlem River Houses were intended to expand black housing, by 1943, overall Harlem housing had deteriorated as new construction slowed due to diversion of efforts to the war, and buildings were destroyed in preparation for replacement. Although the state of African Americans improved relative to society, individuals could not accelerate their own progress.|$|E
5|$|Historically, many {{prospective}} Australian uranium mines {{have been}} constrained by active antinuclear opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But {{it is unlikely}} that any <b>new</b> <b>projects</b> will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. Toro wants to take the Wiluna proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market prices go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Cotswold Canals Partnership was established, drawing {{together}} people {{representing the}} Proprietors, the Cotswold Canals Trust, councils at district and county level, {{and a number}} of other interested parties. This provided a suitable structure to drive the restoration forwards. In 2002, the waterway was identified as being of high priority in the Association of Inland Navigation Authorities report entitled Vision for Strategic Enhancement of Britain's Inland Navigation Network, and was one of several <b>new</b> <b>projects</b> highlighted at British Waterways' Unlocked and Unlimited conference held in March. The estimated cost of the project to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal was £82 million.|$|E

The same year saw the arrest of two employees of Bohemia, who were charged with espionage by Greece and jailed for 129 days. This event had significantly lowered team morale and forced the team to rename the ARMA 3s setting to a fictional one.

5|$|In September 2002, Langan {{signed a}} new {{contract}} to develop <b>new</b> <b>projects</b> at Granada's combined drama, film and comedy department. Her first production was the romantic comedy television film Watermelon, starring Anna Friel. At the end of 2002, she began developing Peter Morgan's The Deal, a dramatisation of the political rise of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Although initially giving full backing, the ITV network backed out during pre-production. Channel 4 picked up the film from Granada, and it was broadcast in September 2003. The Deal was presented with the British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama in 2004. The same year, she produced the one-off drama Dirty Filthy Love, which was also nominated for the BAFTA for Best Single Drama.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the {{government}} borrowed heavily to finance <b>new</b> <b>projects</b> {{and to pay}} off war debts. These loans were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, {{the government}} received credit for £570,000 from the Baring Brothers {{in exchange for a}} debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which was linked to the price of gold. In 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of the {{management}} of innovation and equity carve-outs under heterogeneous beliefs among investors in the equity market. We consider a setting where an employee of a firm generates {{an idea for a}} <b>new</b> <b>project</b> (“innovation”) which can be financed either by issuing equity against the future cash flows of the entire firm, i. e., both assets in place and the <b>new</b> <b>project</b> (“inte-gration”), or by undertaking an equity carve-out of the <b>new</b> <b>project</b> (“non-integration”). The patent underlying the <b>new</b> <b>project</b> is owned by the firm. However, the employee generating the idea needs to be motivated to exert optimal effort for the project to be successful. The most important ingredient driving the firm’s choice between integration and non-integration is heterogeneity in beliefs among outside investors (each of whom has limited wealth to invest in the equity market) and between firm insiders and outsiders. If outsider beliefs are such that the marginal outsider financing the innovation is more optimistic about the prospects of the <b>new</b> <b>project</b> than firm insiders, and this incremental optimism of the marginal outsider over firm insiders is greater regarding the <b>new</b> <b>project</b> than about the firm’s assets in place, then the firm will implement the project under non-integration rather than integration.

5|$|Western Australia has a {{significant}} share of the Australia's uranium reserves, but between 2002 and 2008, a statewide ban on uranium mining was in force. The ban was lifted when the Liberal Party was voted into power in the state and, as of 2010, many companies are exploring for uranium in Western Australia. One of the industry's major players, the mining company BHP Billiton, planned to develop the Yeelirrie uranium project in a 17billion dollar project. Two other projects in Western Australia are further advanced then BHP's Yeelirrie, these being the Lake Way uranium project, which is pursued by Toro Energy, and the Lake Maitland uranium project, pursued by Mega Uranium. But {{it is unlikely that}} any <b>new</b> <b>projects</b> will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low.|$|E
5|$|With Poland's regained {{independence}} {{came the}} {{major change in}} the fortunes of Kraków—now {{the second most important}} city of a sovereign nation. The state began to make new plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings. The predominant style for <b>new</b> <b>projects</b> was modernism with various interpretations of the art-deco style. Important buildings constructed in the style of Polish modernism include the Feniks 'LOT' building on Basztowa Street, the Feniks department store on the Main Square and the Municipal Savings Bank on Szczepański Square. The Józef Piłsudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city.|$|E
5|$|As modern {{communities}} continued {{growing in}} and around Miami, developers looked to southern Dade County for <b>new</b> <b>projects.</b> The undeveloped keys south of Key Biscayne were viewed as prime development territory. Beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted {{the construction of a}} causeway to the mainland. One proposal included building a highway linking the Biscayne Bay keys to the Overseas Highway at Key Largo and to the developed barrier islands to the north. At the same time, pressure built to accommodate industrial development in South Florida. This led to competing priorities between those who wished to develop for residential and leisure use and those in favor of industrial and infrastructure development. On December 6, 1960, 12 of the 18 area landowners who favored development voted to create the City of Islandia on Elliott Key. The town was incorporated to encourage Dade County to improve access to Elliott Key in particular, which landowners viewed as a potential rival to Miami Beach. The new city lobbied for causeway access and formed a negotiating bloc to attract potential developers.|$|E
