40|$|Improving {{nitrogen}} (N) {{efficiency is}} a priority for increasing food production while reducing its environmental impacts. <b>N</b> efficiency <b>indicators</b> are needed to achieve this goal, but current indicators have some limitations. In particular, current <b>N</b> efficiency <b>indicators</b> are not appropriate tools to compare farming systems with different types of production because animal N efficiency is, by nature, lower than crop N efficiency. A novel <b>N</b> efficiency <b>indicator</b> called "relative <b>N</b> efficiency" was developed to address this issue. It was calculated as {{the ratio of the}} actual N efficiency of the farming system to the weighted mean of the potential efficiency of each type of product output provided in literature reviews. Relative N efficiency was calculated for 557 farms of various types from France and Italy. The relative <b>N</b> efficiency <b>indicator</b> was validated by comparison with a statistical approach based on multiple linear regression. Statistical analysis showed that relative N efficiency was independent of production type and could therefore be used for unbiased comparison of different farming systems. Relative N efficiency was particularly interesting when comparing mixed farming systems with different proportions of animal and crop production...|$|R
40|$|This paper first {{describes}} the concept of, governance interest in, and criticism on planetary boundaries, specifically {{with respect to}} the nitrogen (N) cycle. These criticisms are then systematically evaluated. We argue that planetary N boundaries should include both the benefits and adverse impacts of reactive N (Nr) and the spatial variability of Nr impacts. We revise the planetary N boundary by considering the need to: first, avoid adverse impacts of elevated Nr emissions to water, air and soils, and second, feed the world population in an adequate way. The derivation of a planetary N boundary, in terms of anthropogenic fixation of di-nitrogen (N 2) is illustrated by first, identification of multiple threat <b>N</b> <b>indicators</b> and setting limits for them; second, back calculating N losses from critical limits for <b>N</b> <b>indicators,</b> while accounting for the spatial variability of these indicators and their exceedance; and third, back calculating N fixation rates from critical N losses. The derivation of the needed planetary N fixation is assessed from the global population, the recommended dietary N consumption per capita and the N use efficiency in the complete chain from N fixation to N consumption. The example applications show that the previously suggested planetary N boundary of 35 Tg N yr- 1 is too low in view of needed N fixation and also unnecessary low in view of most environmental impacts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Geophysical {{techniques}} for seabed and sub-seabed site nvestigation {{can be divided}} into two categories: those providing information on gross structural (geological) and stratigraphical re ations, and those producing quantitative data which can be used to predict sediment behaviour under applied loading. The past few years have seen key developments in both fields which have come about hrough fundamental improvements in data acquisition (technological nd procedural), and through an improved understanding of geophysical-geotechnical property relations. For example, high-resolution seismic reflection signatures are now routinely recorded in digital format, and, given the appropriate data quality and processing software, it is now possible to extract geotechnically significant information from the reflection response. Seismic refraction techniques are also beginning to be more widely used to provide quantitative information on the engineering properties of seafloor materials; the seismic shear wave velocity is of particular interest, since it is now being recognized as <b>n</b> <b>indicator</b> of sediment strength and stiffness.

40|$|Question: Can {{a simple}} {{measurement}} of nitrogen (N) availability {{be related to}} an ecologically relevant response, i. e. mean Ellenberg <b>N</b> <b>indicator</b> value (EN) ? Location: UK (England,Wales and Scotland). Methods: Soil cores from a stratified sample of UK habitats were analysed for mineralizable N with a conventional incubation and a new flushing method, which uses a single mineral N extraction. Predictions of mean EN using mineralizable N and other soil measurements were assessed by fitting linear mixed-effect models, using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) {{as a measure of}} model parsimony. Results: Mineralizable N measurements using the flushing method described a component of the variation in mean EN that was more orthogonal to bulk soil properties such as moisture content, total N/C ratio and pH than that described by conventionally measured mineralizable N. Mineralizable N as measured using the flushing method improved the accuracy of predictions obtained using only bulk soil measurements, and appeared in the best two-term and threeterm models. Conclusions: Much of the variation in mean EN can be related to soil N/C ratio, pH or moisture content, but mineralizable N distinguishes variation in mean EN that is independent of these bulk soil properties. The new measure will be useful for studies of the exposure of plants to N, in particular when assessing N pollution effects on plant species composition. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop Chl based models for estimating N status and predicting grain yield of rice (Oryza sativa L.) with Leaf area index (LAI) and Chlorophyll concentration of the upper leaves. Six field experiments were conducted in Jiangsu Province of East China during 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013, and 2014. Different N rates were applied to generate contrasting conditions of N availability in six Japonica cultivars (9915, 27123, Wuxiangjing 14, Wuyunjing 19, Yongyou 8, and Wuyunjing 24) and two Indica cultivars (Liangyoupei 9, YLiangyou 1). The SPAD values of the four uppermost leaves and LAI were measured from tillering to flowering growth stages. Two <b>N</b> <b>indicators,</b> leaf <b>N</b> accumulation (LNA) and plant N accumulation (PNA) were measured. The LAI estimated by LAI- 2000 and LI- 3050 C were compared and calibrated with a conversion equation. A linear regression analysis showed significant relationships between Chl value and <b>N</b> <b>indicators,</b> the equations were as follows: PNA = (0. 092 × Chl) − 1. 179 (R 2 = 0. 94, P < 0. 001, relative root mean square error (RRMSE) = 0. 196), LNA = (0. 052 × Chl) − 0. 269 (R 2 = 0. 93, P < 0. 001, RRMSE = 0. 185).

Petiole-NO 3, particularly is widely used inthe USA as an in-season plant N test that guides N fertilizer recommendations in cotton. However, theseN status indicators do not take account of plant biomass, canopy width or percent cover. The objectives ofthis study were to assess the effect of N fertilizer rates on the commonly used indicators of plant N status;leaf N, petiole sap NO 3 and chlorophyll meter (SPAD) readings and the plant growth measurements; plantheight, canopy width, and percent ground cover, and determine to inter-correlations among the them. Irrigated field studies were conducted at Lubbock, TX USA in 2010 and 2011, New Deal, TX in 2010, and atHalfway, TX in 2011. Zero-N and a full N fertilizer rate of 134, 101, and 112 kg N ha− 1 were used at Lubbock,New Deal, and Halfway, respectively. The 2010 cotton growing season in West Texas was much wetterthan average, and the 2011 season was much drier than normal.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} two partial entanglement measures, {{namely the}} 'Linear Entanglement' (LE) (Section 6, Definition 11), and 'Stubborness of Entanglement' (SE) (Section 7, Definition 16), {{which is a}} sequence of parameters. The paper is aimed at both coding theorists and sequence designers, and at quantum physicists, and argues that the best codes and/or sequences {{can be interpreted as}} describing multiparticle states with high entanglement. A binary linear error-correcting code (ECC), C, is often partially described by its parameters [n, k, d], where n is wordlength, k is code dimension, and d is minimum Hamming Distance [18], and more generally by its weight hierarchy. We show, by interpreting the length 2 <b>n</b> <b>indicator</b> for C as an n-particle quantum state that, for those states representing binary linear ECCs, the ECCs with optimal weight hierarchy also have optimal LE and optimal SE (Theorems 10 and 15). By action of local unitary transform on the indicator of C, we can also view the quantum state as a bipolar sequence. In this context a sequence is often partially described by its nonlinear order, N, and correlation immunity order, CI (Definitions 21, 22). We show that N and CI give a lower bound on 2 Matthew G. Parker and V. Rijmen LE (Theorem 16).

This paper refers both to PAR l and to LE, where the two parameters are trivially related (Definition 11). The quantum-mechanical rule of 'local unitary equivalence' is a generalisation of code duality. We now state the most important results of this paper.

In prior studies audit-firm size {{has been used as}} a proxy for expected future audit-firm losses and hence - following theoretical arguments in DeAngelo (Journal of Accounting and Economics, 3 (3), pp. 183 - 199, 1981) and Dye (Journal of Political Economy, 101 (5), pp. 887 - 914, 1993) - for audit quality. In particular, the Big 8 / 6 / 5 / 4 indicator variable has been tested empirically against various measures of client financial reporting quality. In this paper, we focus on testing various characteristics of an audit firm's client portfolio as drivers of audit quality (and therefore subsequently also client financial reporting quality), including measures to proxy size, visibility and financial health characteristics of an audit-firm portfolio. We test both a disclosure and earnings quality model for that purpose, and find for a sample of Belgian companies in financial distress, that audit-firm portfolio characteristics better explain variations in client financial reporting quality than the traditionally used Big <b>N</b> <b>indicator</b> variable. In particular, we find that - ceteris paribus - the size of an audit-firm portfolio is irrelevant in explaining the variation in financial reporting quality amongst companies. Next, we find that client visibility characteristics of an audit-firm portfolio have a constraining impact on earnings management, but no impact on the disclosure quality in the notes. Third, we find that solvency characteristics of an audit-firm portfolio (but not liquidity and profitability characteristics), are positively associated with the financial reporting quality. Taken together, the evidence suggests that not so much the size of an audit-firm portfolio (and the audit firm) but other portfolio and client characteristics drive audit and financial reporting quality. ...|$|E

These wastes could be either important anaerobic fermentation materials of biogas energy or, if discharged into the environment without appropriate processing, serious pollution sources to soil and water systems. In developing countries, rural energy poverty is currently {{a major threat to}} sustainable development and livelihoods. Hence, the availability of clean, affordable and reliable energy is of significant concern in both policy and scholarly circles. Moreover, pollutants related with animal husbandry have been identified as one of the dominant contributors to contamination of water systems, such as surface water eutrophication and groundwater nitrate enrichment. Consequently, assessing waste from {{livestock and}} poultry breeding and the associated biogas systems is of critical essence in rural energy and environmental decision -making. The present study concentrates on a Chinese context and attempts to explicitly investigate Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) applying heterogeneous panel cointegration methods, combining with distribution and characteristics of waste from livestock and poultry breeding for China's 31 provincial economies from 1991 to 2013. And, potentiality of biogas energy and its CO 2 emission reduction based on the utilization of waste is assessed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The mineral {{nutrient}} uptake of {{plants in the}} field occurs in pulses, due to variations in the substance concentrations at the root surface. The fluctuations in nutrient supply probably induce changes in the plant, which are to date unknown for Eucalyptus. This study evaluated these changes in plant growth, nutritional status, photosynthesis, and gene expression, which can serve as biomarkers of the nitrogen status, of four eucalypt clones exposed to N omission and resupply. A greenhouse experiment with four Eucalyptus clones was installed, and after initial growth exposed to N omission for 21 d, followed by N resupply in nutrient solution for 14 d. Nitrogen omission decreased the total N and photosynthetic pigments, net photosynthesis and photochemical dissipation, and increased enzyme activity especially in leaves and the gene expression in leaves and roots. Nitrogen resupply decreased these variations, indicating recovery. The total N concentration was highly and significantly correlated with net photosynthesis, enzyme activity, expression of genes GS 2; 1 and Gln 1; 3 in the leaves and AMT 1; 2 in the roots, contents of chlorophyll a and b, and photochemical energy dissipation.

40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of species}} along environmental gradients {{has long been}} the subject of study regarding natural plant communities and, more recently, ecosystems disturbed by anthropogenic emissions of eutrophying and acidifying substances. We studied 527 sites in southern Swedish deciduous forests divided into two regions, with mean nitrogen depositions of 17 and 9 kg ha(- 1) y(- 1). The higher deposition in the more exposed region has resulted in higher nitrogen mineralisation and nitrification rates. The objective was to identify nitrogen indicators, which we defined as species with a skewed distribution in relation to the net potential nitrogen mineralisation in the soil. Soil pH was introduced as a co-variable as it may relate to other factors limiting plant growth and survival in these ecosystems. We tested the distribution of the net potential mineralised ammonium (minNH(4) (+)), nitrate (minNO(3) (-)), total inorganic nitrogen (minNH(4) (+) +NO 3 -) and the ratio of nitrification (percentage of minNH(4) (+) +NO 3 - as nitrate; %minNO(3) (-)) in 77 herbs. The number of species that showed a skewed distribution differed for the nitrogen variables studied in the following order: %minNO(3) (-) > minNO(3) (-) > minNH(4) (+) much greater than minNH(4) (+) +NO 3 -. As many as 21 species in region 1 and 17 species in region 2 were selected as indicators for one or several of the nitrogen variables. A fern, five graminoids and seven forbs were found to be indicators of low %minNO(3) (-) and two ferns, two grasses and 13 forbs were found to be indicators of high %minNO(3) (-). We correlated the Ellenberg <b>N</b> <b>indicator</b> values with species with and without skewed distributions, and found that the former group was best related to the N values.

30|$|Protein {{content of}} mustard seed and {{fractions}} {{were determined by}} the Kjeldahl method as modified by AOAC method 981.10 (AOAC 1990). Mustard seed and defatted meal samples (0.5 g) were digested by heating with concentrated H 2 SO 4 in a heating/digestion block using a package of Kjeldahl digestion mixture 200 (VWR Scientific, Mississauga, ON, Canada) as a catalyst. After digestion, samples were distilled using a steam distillation unit (Büchi Analytical Inc., New Castle, DE, USA) with 30 % (w/v) NaOH. Boric acid (4 %) was used to trap ammonia from the distillation. The distillate was titrated with 0.2 N HCl using an N-Point <b>indicator</b> (Titristar <b>N</b> point <b>indicator,</b> EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ, USA). Nitrogen concentration (N in %) was used to estimate protein concentration (%) {{by means of a}} nitrogen-to-protein conversion factor 5.7 (Sosulski et al. 1990) for TS and 5.5 (Lindeboom and Wanasundara 2007) for mustard seed, meal, and protein.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} co-occurrence of {{multiple}} sources of psychosocial disadvantage {{in association with}} risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD). It was hypothesized that increased co-occurring psychosocial disadvantage {{would be associated with}} increased risk of CHD in a monotonic fashion. While both social and psychological disadvantage are associated with increased risk of CHD, indicators of psychosocial disadvantage are traditionally examined individually in relationship to CHD. However, multiple sources of psychosocial disadvantage tend to co-occur. Methods: Hypotheses were examined using data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and its follow-up studies (<b>n</b> 6913). <b>Indicators</b> of psychosocial disadvantage (education, income, employment, single parenting, marital status, depressive and anxious symptoms) and covariates were derived from baseline interviews and incident CHD from hospital records/death certificates collected over 22 years of follow-up. Hypotheses were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Results indicated that greater co-occurrence of psychosocial disad-vantage conferred increased CHD risk. Relative to no disadvantage, one indicator of psychosocial disadvantage (relative ris...|$|R
40|$|Let I 1, I 2,..., In be a {{sequence}} of independent indicator functions de- fined on a probability space (Ω, A, P). We say that index k is a success time if Ik = 1. The sequence I 1, I 2,..., In is observed sequentially. The objective {{of this article is}} to predict the l-th last success, if any, with maximum probability at the time of its occurence. We find the optimal rule and discuss briefly an algorithm to compute it in an efficient way. This generalizes the result of Bruss (1998) for l = 1, and is equivalent to the problem of (multiple) stopping with l stops on the last l successes. We extend then the model to a larger class allowing for an unknown number <b>N</b> of <b>indicator</b> functions, and present, in particular, a convenient method for an approximate solution if the success probabilities are small. We also discuss some applications of the results. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} on the z 2. 3 mass-metallicity {{relation}} (MZR) using early observations from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. We use an initial sample of 87 star-forming galaxies with spectroscopic coverage of Hβ, [OIII]λ 5007, Hα, and [NII]λ 6584 rest-frame optical emission lines, and estimate the gas-phase oxygen abundance based on the N 2 and O 3 <b>N</b> 2 strong-line <b>indicators.</b> We find {{a positive correlation between}} stellar mass and metallicity among individual z 2. 3 galaxies using both the N 2 and O 3 <b>N</b> 2 <b>indicators.</b> We also measure the emission-line ratios and corresponding oxygen abundances for composite spectra in bins of stellar mass. Among composite spectra, we find a monotonic increase in metallicity with increasing stellar mass, offset 0. 15 - 0. 3 dex below the local MZR. When the sample is divided at the median star-formation rate (SFR), we do not observe significant SFR dependence of the z 2. 3 MZR among either individual galaxies or composite spectra. We furthermore find that z 2. 3 galaxies have metallicities 0. 1 dex lower at a given stellar mass and SFR than is observed locally. This offset suggests that high-redshift galaxies do not fall on the local "fundamental metallicity relation" among stellar mass, metallicity, and SFR, and may provide evidence of a phase of galaxy growth in which the gas reservoir is built up due to inflow rates that are higher than star-formation and outflow rates. However, robust conclusions regarding the gas-phase oxygen abundances of high-redshift galaxies await a systematic reappraisal of the application of locally calibrated metallicity indicators at high redshift.
