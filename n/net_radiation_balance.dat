40|$|ABSTRACT. Frost {{flowers are}} {{transient}} crystal structures that form on new and young sea ice surfaces. They have {{been implicated in}} a variety of biological, chemical, and physical processes and interactions with the atmosphere at the sea ice surface. We describe the atmospheric and radiative conditions and the physical and thermal properties of the sea ice and atmosphere that form, decay, and destroy frost flowers on young sea ice. Frost flower formation occurred during a high-pressure system that caused air temperatures to drop to − 30 ˚C, with relative humidity of 70 % (an undersaturated atmosphere), and very calm wind conditions. The sea ice surface temperature at the time of frost flower initiation was 10 ˚ – 13 ˚C warmer than the air temperature. Frost flowers grew on nodules raised above the mean surface height by 5 mm, which were 4 ˚ – 6 ˚C colder than the bare, brine-wetted, highly saline sea ice surface that provided the necessary moisture. The cold nodules created potential water vapour supersaturation zones above them with respect to air over the brine skim. Frost flowers formed and grew overnight in the absence of shortwave <b>radiation,</b> while the <b>net</b> longwave <b>radiation</b> was negative and dominated the <b>net</b> all-wave <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> at the surface. The observed crystal habits of the frost flowers were long needles, betraying their origin from the vapour phase at temperatures between − 20 ˚C and − 30 ˚C. After a night of growth, frost flowers decayed in association with increased solar <b>radiation,</b> a <b>net</b> surface <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> of 0 W m- 2, increased air and surface temperatures, increased wind speed, and decreased relative humidity. We hypothesize that these conditions increased vertical mixing, which eroded near-surface water vapour saturation and initiated sublimation.

5000|$|Feedbacks {{associated}} with sea {{ice and snow}} cover are widely cited as {{the main cause of}} recent terrestrial polar amplification. However, amplification is also observed in model worlds with no ice or snow.

40|$|Measurements of the <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> of two forested {{sites on}} the {{opposite}} slopes of a valley in south-western Germany, made over 3 years, are presented in this study. Radiation sensors were mounted horizontally on two measurement towers above two beech stands. The direct part of the measured short-wave incoming radiation was adjusted according to the slope’s angle to convert horizontally measured radiation data into surface-parallel radiation fluxes. During periods when contemporaneous measurements of slope-parallel and horizontal radiation fluxes were available, the calculation of surface-parallel radiation fluxes from the horizontally recorded net radiation components were compared with measured values. The net radiative fluxes parallel to the slopes were calculated {{for a period of}} 36 months and analysed. Results show that the different aspects of both sites cause significant differences of the <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>balance.</b> In June, when the elevation of the sun is highest, incoming solar radiation K¯ received on the NE-slope was 9 % lower than K¯ received on the SW-slope. During the winter months, the differences were much greater and incoming solar radiation to the NE-slope was 50 % of that to the SW-slope. Due to the differing solar irradiance, net radiation fluxes were significantly higher on the SW-slope than on the NE-slope. For long-wave radiation only small differences between both slopes could be found. Since radiative fluxes determine the energy balance and hence the microclimate and water balance of a forest stand, these differences in the <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> between the slopes are important for the vegetation...|$|E
40|$|Most {{evapotranspiration}} {{over land}} occurs through vegetation. The fraction of <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>balanced</b> by evapotranspiration depends on stomatal controls. Stomates transpire {{water for the}} leaf to assimilate carbon, depending on the canopy carbon demand, and on root uptake, if it is limiting. Canopy carbon demand in turn depends on the balancing between visible photon-driven and enzyme-driven steps in the leaf carbon physiology. The enzyme-driven component is here represented by a Rubisco-related nitrogen reservoir that interacts with plant–soil nitrogen cycling and other components of a climate model. Previous canopy carbon models included in GCMs have assumed either fixed leaf nitrogen, that is, prescribed photosynthetic capacities, or an optimization between leaf nitrogen and light levels so that in either case stomatal conductance varied only with light levels and temperature. A nitrogen model is coupled to a previously derived but here modified carbon model and includes, besides the enzyme reservoir, additional plant stores for leaf structure and roots. It also includes organic and mineral reservoirs in the soil; the latter are generated, exchanged, and lost by biological fixation, deposition and fertilization, mineralization, nitrification, root uptake, denitrification, and leaching. The root nutrient uptake model is a novel and simple, but rigorous, treatment of soil transport and root physiological uptake. The other soil components are largely derived from previously published parameterizations and global budget constraints. The feasibility of applying the derived biogeochemical cycling model to climate model calculations of evapotranspiration is demonstrated through its incorporation in the Biosphere–Atmosphere Transfer Scheme land model and a 17 -yr Atmospheric Model Inter comparison Project II integration with the NCAR CCM 3 GCM. The derived global budgets show land net primary production (NPP), fine root carbon, and {{various aspects of the}} nitrogen cycling are reasonably consistent with past studies.

40|$|The {{southern}} {{parts of}} West Africa are frequently covered by an extensive deck of shallow, low (200 - 400 m AGL) stratus or stratocumulus clouds {{during the summer}} monsoon. These clouds usually form at night in association with a nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ) and can persist into the early afternoon hours. Recent work suggests that the stratus deck is unsatisfactorily represented in standard satellite retrievals and stateof- the-art climate models. Here the authors use high-resolution regional simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and observations from the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) 2006 campaign to investigate (i) the spatiotemporal distribution, (ii) the influence on the shortwave <b>radiation</b> <b>balance,</b> and (iii) the detailed formation and maintenance mechanisms of the stratiform clouds. At least some configurations of WRF satisfactorily reproduce the diurnal cycle of the lowcloud evolution, yielding the following main conclusions: (i) The simulated stratus deck forms after sunset along the coast, spreads inland {{during the course of}} the night, and dissipates in the early afternoon. (ii) The average surface <b>net</b> shortwave <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> in stratus-dominated regions is about 35 Wm 22 lower than in those with fewer clouds. (iii) The cloud formation is related to a subtle balance between ''stratogenic'' upward (downward) fluxes of latent (sensible) heat caused by shear-driven turbulence below the NLLJ, cold advection, orographic lifting, and radiative cooling on one hand, and ''stratolytic'' dry advection and latent heating on the other hand...|$|R

The penetration of <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> within the canopy was also modelled. The model predicts the measured albedo of the stand very well. The estimation of solar radiation transmitted by the canopy was also satis-factory with the maximum difference between this and the mean output of mobile sensors at ground level being only 18 W m- 2.

Now let∆Rf be some specified, constant, radiative forcing (here, due to anthropogenic emissions of CO 2). ∆Rf is assumed small compared with F and S so that the changes it introduces in system dynamics are all small and linear in the forcing. In order to attain a new equilibrium state, the radiative balance must change by an amount∆R that is equal and opposite to the forcing. That is, ∆R = −∆Rf. In other words, in the new equilibrium state the longwave and shortwave radiation must adjust: ∆R = ∆F +∆S, and the temperature reaches a new equilibrium value, displaced from the old by an amoun...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} slope, aspect and {{vegetation}} cover on the radiation balance and active layer thermal regime of arctic tundra were investigated {{during the summer}} of 1999 and the spring of 2000. The study site is located at Daring Lake, N. W. T (64 ° 522 ̆ 7 N, 111 ° 352 ̆ 7 W) in the Slave Geological Province of the Coppermine River Basin. A sub-basin 14 ha in area and with approximately 30 meters of relief was intensely monitored for hydrological radiation and energy balance components. Initiation of active layer development and subsequent thawing was earlier and more pronounced on predominantly west facing slopes due to increased receipt of incoming solar radiation. Late summer active layer depths were the greatest on west-facing slopes as compared to north-and east-facing slopes (3 ̆e 170 cm. 84. 0 ± 21. 7 cm. 49. 2 ± 0. 8 cm respectively). Incoming shortwave radiation values were extrapolated from the met site to various basin sites taking slope and aspect into account. Spatial and diurnal variations in albedo were minimal within the Kakawi Lake Basin. As well, surface temperature measurements varied little from site to site causing the long wave radiation balance to remain relatively constant. Incoming shortwave radiation was determined to control diurnal fluctuations in the <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> on a daily and seasonal basis but represented less than one half (41...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to describe the <b>radiation</b> and energy <b>balance,</b> during the lettuce (Lactuca sativa, L. cv. Verônica) crop cycle inside a polyethylene greenhouse. The <b>radiation</b> and energy <b>balance</b> was made inside a tunnel greenhouse with polyethylene cover (100 mum) and in an external area, both areas with 35 m². Global, reflected and <b>net</b> <b>radiation,</b> soil heat flux and air temperature (dry and humid) were measured during the crop cycle. A Datalogger, which operated at 1 Hz frequency, storing 5 minutes averages was utilized. The global (K ¯) and reflected (K ­) radiations showed that the average transmission of global radiation (K ¯ in / K ¯ ex) was almost constant, near to 79. 59 %, while the average ratio of reflected radiation (K ­ in / K ­ ex) was 69. 21 % with 8. 47 % standard-deviation. The normalized curves of short-wave <b>net</b> <b>radiation,</b> in relation to the global radiation (K*/ K ¯), found for both environments, were almost constant at the beginning of cycle; this relation decreased in the final stage of culture. The normalized relation (Rn/ K ¯) was bigger in the external area, about 12 %, when the green culture covered the soil surface. The long-wave <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> average (L*) was bigger outside, about 50 %. The energy balance, estimated in terms of vertical fluxes, showed that, for the external area, in average, 83. 07 % of total <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> was converted in latent heat evaporation (LE), and 18 % in soil heat flux (G), and 9. 96 % in sensible heat (H), while inside of the greenhouse, 58. 71 % of total <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> was converted in LE, 42. 68 % in H, and 28. 79 % in G...|$|R
40|$|Four Surface Energy and <b>Radiation</b> <b>Balance</b> Systems (SERBS) were {{installed}} and operated {{for two weeks}} in Kansas during July of 1986. Surface energy and <b>radiation</b> <b>balances</b> were investigated on six sites on the Konza Prairie about 3 km south of Manhattan, Kansas. Measurements were made to allow the computation of these radiation components: total solar and diffuse radiation, reflected solar <b>radiation,</b> <b>net</b> <b>radiation,</b> and longwave radiation upward and downward. Measurements were made to allow the computation of the sensible and latent heat fluxes by the Bowen ratio method using differential psychrometers on automatic exchange mechanisms. The report includes {{a description of the}} experimental sites, data acquisition systems and sensors, data acquisitions system operating instructions, and software used for data acquisition and analysis.

40|$|The {{annual mean}} of the global-average <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> budget should be quite small. Because of errors in the {{measurement}} and data analysis, the annual mean global-average <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> as computed by the CERES program does not meet this requirement. A method is presented for computing the most likely errors in the measurement and data production which will bring the <b>radiation</b> into <b>balance</b> {{within the range of}} interannual variations.
