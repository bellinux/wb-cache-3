30|$|In the work, the {{principal}} component analysis is used to reduce the dimension of image [29], the impact of <b>non-critical</b> <b>dimensions,</b> {{and the amount of}} data, thus improving the efficiency. After the dimension reduction, the local feature points are extracted from the face image. To improve the alignment accuracy of feature points, the robust SIFT algorithm is applied for local feature extraction. Section 3.2. 2 introduces the extraction process in detail.|$|R

The formal analogy with 4 D (super) gravity Recently Polchinski and Strominger have made substantial progress in quantizing long effective strings such as Nielsen-Olesen vortex and long QCD flux tubes. The essential point is that the measure in path integral approach should be built out of the induced metric rather than the intrinsic metric as used in Polyakov quantization. Such an assumption i...|$|R

The Mandelstam method of constructing tree string amplitudes is {{extended to the}} bosonic massive string models of the discrete series. The general properties of the Liouville longitudinal excitations which are necessary and sufficient for the Lorentz covariance of the light-cone amplitudes are derived. The {{results suggest that the}} covariant and the light-cone approach are equivalent also in the <b>non-critical</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Some aspects of unitarity of interacting non-critical massive string theory are discussed.

40|$|The main {{principles}} of two-dimensional quantum field theories, in particular two-dimensional QCD and gravity are reviewed. We study non-perturbative aspects of these theories which make them particularly valuable for testing ideas of four-dimensional quantum field theory. The dynamics of confinement and theta vacuum are explained {{by using the}} non-perturbative methods developed in two dimensions. We describe in detail how the effective action of string theory in <b>non-critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> can be represented by Liouville gravity. By comparing the helicity amplitudes in four-dimensional QCD to those of integrable self-dual Yang-Mills theory, we extract a four dimensional version of two dimensional integrability.

40|$|In current feature {{modeling}} systems, all {{dimensions in}} a model have to be fully specified by the user. It is desirable that systems become more flexible in this respect, i. e. that <b>non-critical</b> <b>dimensions</b> {{in a model}} can be declared as variant, and that the model can be automatically adjusted when this is appropriate. A method and an implementation to realize this will be described. The underlying feature model definition and validation approach will be introduced. Validation is done by a collection of constraint solvers. An overview of invalid situations in which automatic model adjustment can be applied will be given. The constraint solving scheme and, in particular, the automatic model adjustment strategies for different types of constraints will be elaborated. Applications {{in the areas of}} design by features, creating a member from a family of products, and feature conversion will be given. These will illustrate that automatic feature model adjustment is a very useful concept. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{internal}} dynamics of a baryon, as a bound state of QCD-strings and quarks, may be captured by a theory of matrix coordinates. PACS: 12. 38. Aw, 11. 25. Tq, 11. 25. Uv, 02. 10. Yn 1 There is a relatively common belief that gauge theories have some kinds of string theory as their dual description. The supports for this belief come from some phenomenological facts, such as Regge trajectories, and also some theoretical considerations, like those coming from large-N and lattice gauge theories [1][2]. In the theoretical side, the gauge/gravity duality in the AdS limit of brane backgrounds [3] has realized the idea by a definite relation between the objects in two sides [4]. The loop-space formulation [5] {{is another example of}} efforts for string theoretic presentation of gauge theory dynamics, still exciting theoretical research [6]. In providing a dictionary between gauge and string theories, it is usually assumed that the dynamics of the electric fluxes in confined phase is presented by a string theory, probably in <b>non-critical</b> <b>dimensions.</b> These electric fluxes are usually referre...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the application of}} the mantle cloaking technique to near-infrared and visible frequencies, analyzing and designing thin covers consisting of 2 D arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles. First, we validate and generalize an analytical model recently appeared in the literature to describe a 2 D array of plasmonic nanoparticles as a metasurface characterized by its homogenized surface reactance. We prove that the proposed model allows to efficiently design 2 D mantle cloaks with an assigned surface reactance, enabling, thus, the extension of the mantle cloaking technique to optical frequencies. Then, we design realistic optical mantle cloaks made of 2 D arrays of spheroidal plasmonic nanoparticles with a high eccentricity. We show that the proposed cloaks allow significant, moderately broadband cloaking effects at visible frequencies. In our designs, we consider realistic losses and <b>non-critical</b> nanoparticle <b>dimensions</b> to envision a practical realization of the proposed cloaks...|$|R
40|$|We briefly {{review the}} {{approach}} to dipole-dipole scattering in holographic QCD developed in ARXIV: 1202. 0831. The Pomeron is modeled by exchanging closed strings between the dipoles and yields Regge behavior for the elastic amplitude. We calculate curvature corrections to this amplitude in both a conformal and confining background, identifying the holographic direction with the virtuality of the dipoles. The it wee-dipole density {{is related to the}} string tachyon diffusion in both virtuality and the transverse directions. We give an explicit derivation of the dipole saturation momentum both in the conformal and confining metric. Our holographic result for the dipole-dipole cross section and the it wee-dipole density in the conformal limit are shown to be identical in form to the BFKL pomeron result when the <b>non-critical</b> string transverse <b>dimension</b> is D_= 3. The total dipole-dipole cross section is compared to DIS data from HERA...|$|R
40|$|Liouville {{conformal}} {{field theory}} is considered with conformal boundary. There {{is a family}} of conformal boundary conditions parameterized by the boundary cosmological constant, so that observables depend on the dimensional ratios of boundary and bulk cosmological constants. The disk geometry is considered. We present an explicit expression for the expectation value of a bulk operator inside the disk and for the two-point function of boundary operators. We comment also on {{the properties of the}} degenrate boundary operators. Possible applications and further developments are discussed. In particular, we present exact expectation values of the boundary operators in the boundary sin-Gordon model. 1. Liouville field theory During last 20 years the Liouvlle field theory permanently attracts much attention mainly due to its relevance in the quantization of strings in <b>non-critical</b> space-time <b>dimensions</b> [1] (see also refs. [2, 3, 4]). It is also applied as a field theory of the 2 D quantum gravity. E. g., the results of the Liouville field theory (LFT) approach can be compared with the calculations in the matrix models of two-dimensional gravity [5, 6] and this comparison shows [7, 8] that when the LFT central charge cL â‰¥ 25 this field theory describes the same continuous gravity as was found in the critical region of the matrix models. Although there are still no known applications of LFT with cL < 25, the theory is interesting on its own footing as an example of non-rational 2 D conformal field theory. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue for}} the {{existence}} of phase transitions in $ 3 + 1 $ dimensions associated with the appearance of tensionless strings. The massless spectrum of this theory does not contain a graviton: it consists of one $N= 2 $ vector multiplet and one linear multiplet, in agreement with the light-cone analysis of the Green-Schwarz string in $ 3 + 1 $ dimensions. In M-theory the string decoupled from gravity arises when two 5 -branes intersect over a three-dimensional hyperplane. The two 5 -branes may be connected by a 2 -brane, whose boundary becomes a tensionless string with $N= 2 $ supersymmetry in $ 3 + 1 $ <b>dimensions.</b> <b>Non-critical</b> strings on the intersection may also come from dynamical 5 -branes intersecting the two 5 -branes over a string and wrapped over a four-torus. The near-extremal entropy of the intersecting 5 -branes is explained by the non-critical strings originating from the wrapped 5 -branes. Comment: latex, 16 pages; version to appear in Nucl.
