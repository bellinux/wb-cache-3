5|$|Following the tie to the Mark Greys, the Panhandles {{traveled}} to Lorain, Ohio, {{to play against}} the Elyria Athletics on Thanksgiving Day. The result of the game was another 0–0 tie, making it the seventh time in nine games the Panhandles were held scoreless. Chris Willis stated this tie was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> the previous weeks because the Athletics had old players from the Akron Indians, a winning team in the Ohio League.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone John {{extensively}} {{affected areas}} of Western Australia, but damage was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> expected. Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region {{were caused by}} John. Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast, as well as tree damage. 140windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast. Further inland, rainfall associated with the cyclone and its remnants brought flooding, which flooded 25houses and caused rivers to overflow. The system was responsible for no deaths and {{a limited amount of}} damage. After the season, the name John was retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list.|$|E
5|$|However, on 15 March 2016, American comedian Jim Breuer (a {{friend of}} Johnson) {{revealed}} on his podcast that Johnson {{had received a}} second opinion on his hearing and it was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> initially thought. Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson {{told him that he}} was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour. Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.|$|E

5|$|The {{contract}} was signed on June 15, 1866 and the expropriation {{of the first}} 1,100 houses was completed in a few months. The work began on February 13, 1867. There were several technical difficulties that delayed the covering, {{many of which were}} due to the geology of Brussels, though they were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> some engineers had forecast. The embezzlement scandal also caused a significant delay in construction, largely due to the change in control. The project was completed in 1871, with the municipal council ceremonially opening the reconstructed sluice gates on November 30.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{consequences for the}} county were more difficult to quantify. The financial impact on the county was estimated by the California Economic Forecast Director at $74 million if Line 901 remains dormant for three years because of the dependence of the region’s {{oil and gas industry}} to move product through this line. Workers income, property taxes, and federal royalties are reduced while the line is out of service. The impact on tourism was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> predicted and thousands of workers involved in the cleanup appear to have benefited some hotels.|$|E
5|$|The {{worst of}} Linda's impact was in Vietnam, where 3,111 people were killed, and damage totaled $385 million (USD). Heavy {{rainfall}} caused flooding, which {{damaged or destroyed}} about 200,000 houses and left about 383,000 people homeless. Widespread crop and transportation damage also occurred, the latter which impeded relief efforts. Several {{countries around the world}} sent relief aid, including medical teams, food, and clothing. However, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> originally feared. Linda later struck Thailand, causing flash flooding and at least 164 deaths. The storm also affected Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia to a lesser degree.|$|E

5|$|The Vietnamese {{government}} identified basic {{supplies that}} it needed {{in response to the}} storm; those included various foods, clothing, medicine, shelter supplies, and sanitation equipment. The country made a formal request for international assistance, noting that the storm was the worst in 100years, and officials had limited resources due to the unexpected destruction. Prior to the request, the government of Switzerland sent about 500,000 Swiss francs ($360,000 USD) for immediate relief assistance. Subsequently, ten other countries sent cash or relief supplies worth $2.6 million, including medical shelters from the United States, clothing from the United Kingdom, tents from Russia, and transport goods from Japan. Red Cross workers had to travel by riverboat to bring aid to the most affected communities, due to the poor state of the roads. After two months, the Red Cross distributed 65,401 roofing sheets, 390 metric tons of rice, 11,990 mosquito nets, 6,871 blankets, 3,664 medical kits, and abundant clothing supplies to about 150,000 affected people; the supplies were purchased in Ho Chi Minh City. Eventually, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> originally feared. After the assistance was distributed, the Red Cross shifted focus toward reconstruction. Reconstruction was slow, partly due to a slowdown in economic activity from the Vietnamese New Year. Additionally, the two primary factories responsible for making iron and construction frames were only intermittently open, due to machines failing.|$|E

25|$|Compared to many Welsh towns, Newport's {{economy had}} a broad base, with foundries, {{engineering}} works, a cattle market and shops that served much of Monmouthshire. However, the docks were in decline {{even before the}} Great Depression, and local unemployment peaked at 34.7% in 1930: high, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> the levels seen in the mining towns of the South Wales Valleys. Despite the economic conditions, the council re-housed over half {{the population in the}} 1920s and 30s. In 1930 the Town Dock was filled in.|$|E
25|$|A later study {{questioned}} {{the attitudes of}} adolescents. When asked about abstinence, many girls reported they felt conflicted. They were trying to balance maintaining a good reputation with trying to maintain a romantic relationship and wanting to behave in adult-like ways. Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys. Some boys said that for them, the risks that may come from having sex were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> the social risks that could come from remaining abstinent.|$|E
25|$|While still {{considered}} one of the most polluted places on the planet, the valley's air pollution problems are <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> they were several decades ago. One major problem that was brought under control was the lead contamination in the air with the introduction of unleaded gasoline. Two other contaminants that have been brought under control are carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The contamination problems that remain are primarily with ozone and fine particles (soot) (between 2.5micrometers and 10micrometers). Thirty to fifty percent of the time, Mexico City's levels of fine particles of ten micrometers, the most dangerous, exceed levels recommended by the World Health Organization.|$|E

Roller, suffering from a chronic disease, would drain one of the buckets himself and fill the other. In 1940, Roller left for Bessarabia after the former province of Romania had been occupied by the Soviets. Drawn into the PCdR group in Moscow, he worked under Ana Pauker. During World War II, he also attended the History faculty of Moscow State University.|$|E

Cole did indeed make a return at the end of the season, playing in the last twelve minutes of the 2007 FA Cup Final at the new Wembley Stadium against Manchester United. Chelsea emerged victorious 1–0 after extra-time with a goal scored by Didier Drogba, to win the 2007 FA Cup.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1980s {{pediatric}} surgery textbooks recommended female {{assignment and}} feminizing reconstructive surgery for XY infants with a severely inadequate phallus. Nevertheless, in the 1980s several factors began to induce {{a decline in}} the frequency of certain types of genital surgery. Pediatric endocrinologists had realized that some boys with micropenis had deficiency of growth hormone which could be improved with hormones rather than surgery, and over the next decade a couple of reports suggested adult outcome as males was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> expected for the boys with micropenis who had not had surgery. Although textbooks were slower to reflect the change, few reassignment surgeries for isolated micropenis were carried out by the 1990s.|$|E
