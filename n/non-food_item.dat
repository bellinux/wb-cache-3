50|$|The idea {{to create}} the Missing Maps project {{was born out of}} a {{realisation}} by the American Red Cross, British Red Cross, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, and Médecins Sans Frontières that maps are pivotal to delivering humanitarian aid. In civil wars, for example, maps can help individuals and organisations track the movement of internally displaced populations and determine where best to conduct food and <b>non-food</b> <b>item</b> distributions. Or in the case of disease outbreaks, emergency responders can use maps to identify the source of the outbreak and identify the most effective infection control methods. Baraka in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the end of 2014 became one of the pilot projects.|$|E

On {{one side of the}} boards is an edible substance while the other side contains something inedible. During the game, an Angel of Taste from each side of the board will provide sounds using the food item and <b>non-food</b> <b>item</b> respectively. After providing sounds from both items, the team must then decide within five seconds whether the left or right side contains the edible substance. Guessed right would earn the team $3000 HK along with the food item. However, guessed wrong would lead to punishments. Such punishment can either be asking the team to lick or take a bite out of the inedible item. The second team gets a chance to do the same as well.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the neural mechanisms involved in bias for food stimuli in our visual environment using event related lateralized (ERL) responses. The participants {{were presented with}} a cue (food or <b>non-food</b> <b>item)</b> to either identify or hold in working memory. Subsequently, they had {{to search for a}} target in a 2 -item display where target and distractor stimuli were each flanked by a picture of a food or a <b>non-food</b> <b>item.</b> The behavioural data showed that performance was strongly affected by food cues, especially when food was held in WM compared to when the cues were merely identified. The temporal dynamics of electrophysiological measures of attention (the N 1 pc and N 2 pc) showed that the orienting of attention towards food stimuli was associated with two different mechanisms; an early stage of attentional suppression followed by a later stage of attentional orienting towards food stimuli. In contrast, non-food cues were associated only with the guidance of attention to or away from cued stimuli on valid and invalid trials. The results demonstrate that food items, perhaps due to their motivational significance modulate the early orienting of attention, including an initial suppressive response to food items...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{from our}} {{laboratory}} have shown that, relative to neutral objects, food-related 30 objects kept in working memory (WM) are particularly effective in guiding attention to food stimuli (Higgs et al. 2012). Here, we used electrophysiological measurements {{to investigate the}} neural representation of food vs. non-food items in WM. Subjects were presented with a cue (food or <b>non-food</b> <b>item)</b> to either attend to or hold in WM. Subsequently, they had {{to search for a}} target, while the target and distractor were each flanked by a picture of a food or <b>non-food</b> <b>item.</b> Behavioural data showed that a food cue held in WM modulated the deployment of visual attention to a search target more than a non-food cue, even though the cue was irrelevant for target selection. Electrophysiological measures of attention, memory and retention of memory (the P 3, LPP and SPCN components) were larger when food was kept in WM, compared to non-food items. No such effect was observed in a priming task, when the initial cue was merely identified. Overall, our electrophysiological data are consistent with the suggestion that food stimuli are particularly strongly represented in the WM system...|$|E
40|$|Zoos {{all around}} the world have {{recently}} started to implement enrichment into their exhibits. Enrichment has been found to decrease stereotypic behaviors and alleviate stress in captive animals. The Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines, Iowa is one zoo that has implemented enrichment into several of their exhibits, including the Lar gibbon, also known as the white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar). As Hylobates lar is an endangered species, it is important to find enrichment activities that mentally and physically stimulate them to maintain their health. Previous research has found that primates prefer pliable items to non-pliable ones. We hypothesized that both the male and female gibbon would prefer the phone books, a pliable item, to a non-pliable item, a hanging barrel. Since animals have an instinct for food, we also hypothesized that both the male and female would prefer the food item, cereal, to a <b>non-food</b> <b>item,</b> a mop head. I conducted my study using a focal animal sampling approach, observing each sex for 15 -minute intervals. I recorded the duration of interaction with each enrichment activity. The results showed that both the male and female preferred the food item to the <b>non-food</b> <b>item</b> and the pliable item to the non-pliable item...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how nearby sourcing versus long-distance sourcing affects the ecological friendliness - operationalized in terms of energy efficiency - of a supply chain for a <b>non-food</b> <b>item</b> in a developing country. Using case research, we show that the average energy needed to supply a pair of imported shoes to a retailer in Morocco is less than the average energy needed to supply a pair of locally produced shoes. These findings highlight the need to assess the true total energy effects of nearby sourcing versus long-distance sourcing since the outcomes of such assessments may be more complicated than they appear upon first glance, particularly in developing countries...|$|E

30|$|International {{and local}} {{humanitarian}} organizations provided services, including WASH, education, protection, <b>non-food</b> <b>item</b> (NFI) distribution, health, and Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM). MHM activities were usually stand-alone and primarily {{focused on the}} provision of reusable pads. The lack of a clear framework for a multi-sectoral MHM response made the context relevant for a pilot and evaluation of the toolkit. For example, a WASH actor was providing menstrual hygiene kits, in addition to setting up a reusable menstrual pad income generating group with select women in Nyaragusu. Another organization focused on the menstrual material needs of adolescent girls, providing menstrual hygiene kits and basic education to school-going girls in Mtendeli. Other organizations constructed female-friendly toilets for a secondary school in Nduta and developed small-scale reusable pad income generating schemes in Nyaragusu. As many humanitarian contexts today will have limited MHM activities underway, the Tanzania context provided an appropriate context in which to pilot the toolkit’s holistic, coordinated, systematic approach.|$|E

30|$|Given {{the many}} risks {{associated}} with cash transfers, monitoring and accountability mechanisms are {{an essential component of}} program implementation. The CBR-TWG has demonstrated an in-depth understanding of monitoring and accountability needs associated with cross-border humanitarian assistance programming and capacity to establish and refine systems to address evolving stakeholder needs and concerns (CBR-TWG 2015 b). Key components of monitoring and accountability in multisector cash-based response are a functioning grievance and complaints system and a monitoring and evaluation framework that tests the assumptions of cost-efficiency and cost-effectiveness (Levine and Bailey 2015). Syria-specific guidance on monitoring <b>non-food</b> <b>item</b> assistance exists and includes a streamlined reporting system to be used by all organizations to uniformly report and share findings across the sector which will better inform program design and implementation (NFI Sector Working Group 2015). Given contextual constraints and the likely expansion of CBIs, a similar approach would help to ensure reliable monitoring and feedback from beneficiaries; the CBR-TWG is prioritizing standardized approaches to assessment and evaluations and context-specific standards in Syria which can help to guide the cash-based response going forward (CBR-TWG 2015 b).|$|E
40|$|Cultivation may be {{described}} as a process of co-evolution and niche construction, with two species developing a mutualistic relationship through association, leading to coordinated change [1]. Cultivation is rare but taxonomically widespread, benefiting the cultivator, usually through increased access to food, and the cultivar, by improved growth and protection, driving co-evolutionary changes (Supplemental information). Humans cultivate more than food, producing clothing, construction materials, fuel, drugs, and ornaments. A population of male spotted bowerbirds Ptilonorhynchus (Chlamydera) maculata uses fruits of Solanum ellipticum (Figure 1 A), not as food but as important components of their sexual display [2, 3]. Here, we show that males indirectly cultivate plants bearing these fruit - the first example of cultivation of a <b>non-food</b> <b>item</b> by a species other than humans. Plants appear at bowers following male occupation (Figure 1 B). Males benefit, exhibiting more fruit at their bowers. Plants benefit because fruit are deposited in better germination sites. Fruits from plants near bowers differ visually from those far from bowers, and look more similar to fruits that are preferred by males in choice tests...|$|E

30|$|The {{security}} situation throughout Syria poses immense challenges to {{both local and}} international actors providing in-kind assistance to beneficiaries. The possibility of more sustained, continuous assistance provided through cash transfer or voucher mechanisms negates many of the barriers faced in providing in-kind assistance. Consideration of the feasibility of cash {{as an alternative to}} other modalities relies on local-level assessment of capacity, available resources, political environment, beneficiary needs and preferences, and lessons learned from previous programs in those areas. With all assistance modalities, the continued devaluation of the Syrian pound, the increase in food and <b>non-food</b> <b>item</b> costs (especially fuel), the unpredictability of security conditions and associated operating costs, and the lack of functional banking systems within Syria create immense challenges in planning and budgeting for assistance programs. An assessment of market functioning in specific areas of intended operation is essential to claim feasibility of CBIs as a substitute for in-kind aid. In addition to market function, political considerations {{must be taken into account}} when evaluating the feasibility of cash as an alternative to other assistance modalities. For example, cash assistance is not permitted in government-controlled areas of Syria while vouchers and in-kind aid are generally allowed; thus, cash assistance is not a feasible alternative to other modalities (Beachwood International 2015 a; El-Qorchi et al. 2003).|$|E
30|$|A {{desk study}} has been completed, which {{gathered}} information regarding emergency response activities in both earthquakes from Situation Reports published by BNPB (National Disaster Management Agency), Indonesian Ministry of Health, and United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), {{as well as the}} 3 W Matrix (who is doing what and where) compiled by the humanitarian partners. In creating the dataset for SNA on both cases, information gathered from the desk study is reorganized into a “database of emergency response activities.” In the database, each activity contains the following fields: organization name and type, location of activity, type of activity, sector in which the project is classified (e.g., shelter), organization(s) responsible for the activity, description, progress of activity, classification of financier/executor, and beneficiaries. Given the information compiled in the database, a relational matrix (proxy of cooperation) of emergency response is developed. Activities included in the dataset are those implemented during the emergency response period, by two or more organizations. An activity that is said to be implemented by a single organization and/or did not clearly state its implementing partner will not be included in the dataset of input to the SNA. The sample of emergency response activities is classified into 12 groups, in relation to humanitarian cluster arrangement, as follows: food distribution (FD); <b>non-food</b> <b>item</b> distribution (NFI); health services (HS); disaster impact rapid assessment (RA); search and rescue (SAR); coordination and communication (CC); cash support and donation (CD); education in emergency time (Edu); water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) promotion; shelter (Shelter); logistics (LOG); and others.|$|E
