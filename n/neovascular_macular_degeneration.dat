40|$|Objectives To assess {{patients}} ’ {{knowledge of}} their drug therapy for <b>neovascular</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and to identify which aspects of the drug they consideredmost important if given the option of switching to an alternative drug. Design Prospective questionnaire survey. Setting Wolverhampton, England. Participants A total of 126 patients attending our hospital service for intravitreal ranibizumab therapy for <b>neovascular</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Main outcome measures Using a questionnaire, patients were asked questions pertaining to aspects of drug therapy in <b>neovascular</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Fields covered included drug names, knowledge of alter-native drugs, cost of drugs and their views on switching to another drug. Results Eighty (63. 5 %) had heard of Lucentis (ranibizumab) and 31 (24. 6 %) were aware of Avastin (bevacizumab). Of the latter 31 patients, 20 {{did not have a}} preference between Avastin and Lucentis. These patients felt that the factors they would consider important for them to consider switching were effectiveness (10, 50 %), specialist recommendation (8, 40 %), safety (2, 10 %) and cost (0). Conclusions Introducing a cheaper, off-label alternative in the therapy of macular degeneration {{in the presence of a}} licensed option has been extensively debated. Many patients have no knowledge of this contro-versial issue but it is likely that efficacy and recommendation by clinicians are more important than cost to patients who may consider switching to the off-label Avastin...|$|E

It has been shown that angiogenic growth factors are present in neovascular membranes in ARMD. However, it is not known if angiogenic growth factors {{play a role in the}} onset of neovascularisation. METHODS: In order to elucidate the involvement of angiogenic growth factors in the initiation of neovascularisation in early stages of ARM, the expression patterns of VEGF, TGF-beta, b-FGF, and PDGF-AA on 18 human maculae with ARM, and on 11 control specimens were investigated immunohistochemically.

40|$|<b>Neovascular</b> <b>Macular</b> <b>Degeneration</b> is a {{significant}} cause of blindness world–wide. Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor medication injected directly into the eye has halved the disease burden in recent years. Being able to adequately quantify the outcome of neovascular AMD treatment gives perspective not only on appropriate intervention for individual patients, but also {{the understanding of the}} science behind the disease, its therapeutics and design of future clinical trials. Assessment tools can be either subjective or objective, and often interrogate either efficacy or safety endpoints. Although patient reported Quality of Life utilities give the ultimate assessment of treatment success for an individual, surrogate biomarkers are more effective in judging short-term response. Visual acuity assessment is useful in analyzing cohorts of individuals, but its subjective nature means that it is not particularly useful in determining individual retreatment decisions. An objective morphological assessment of the macular architecture does provide a good way of assessing short-term response however. Retinal sensitivity also demonstrates usefulness as an endpoint for clinical trials, but as of yet is too cumbersome a technique for high volume clinical work. Functional imaging of the visual cortex remains a research tool at present, but provides promise as a new objective endpoint. Importantly this thesis has confirmed that that cortex is able to regain function after a short period of compromise due to <b>neovascular</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Measurement tools to assess the outcome of treatment are best selected, often in composite, with regards to the prime reason for assessment being undertaken. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Neovascular</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> is {{the leading}} cause of {{irreversible}} blindness in people 50 years of age or older in the developed world. As in other chronic diseases, several effective treatments are available, but in clinical daily practice there is an evidence performance gap. The Chronic Care Model represents an evidence-based framework for the care of chronically ill patients and aims at closing that gap. However, no data are available regarding patients with <b>neovascular</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Methods/Design CHARMED is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. The study challenges the hypothesis that the implementation of core elements of the Chronic Care Model (patient empowerment, delivering evidence based information, clinical information system, reminder system with structured follow up and frequent monitoring) via a specially trained Chronic Care Coach in Swiss centres for <b>neovascular</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> results in better visual acuity (primary outcome) and an increased disease specific quality of life (secondary outcome) in patients with <b>neovascular</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> According to the power calculation, a total sample size of 352 patients is needed (drop out rate of 25 %). 14 specialised medical doctors from leading ophtalmologic centres in Switzerland will include 25 patients. In each centre, a Chronic Care Coach will provide disease specific care according to the Chronic Care Model for intervention group. Patients from the control group will be treated as usual. Baseline measurements will be taken in month III - XII, starting in March 2011. Follow-up data will be collected after 6 months and 1 year. Discussion Multiple studies have shown that implementing Chronic Care Model elements improve clinical outcomes as well as process parameters in different chronic diseases as osteoarthritis, depression or e. g. the cardiovascular risk profile of diabetes patients. This study will be the first to assess this approach in <b>neovascular</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> If our hypothesis will be confirmed, the implementation of this approach in routine care for patients with with <b>neovascular</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> should be considered.

40|$|Abstract In Western countries, {{therapeutic}} management of patients affected by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to different typologies of macular degeneration represents a major health care problem. Age-related macular degeneration is the disease most frequently associated with CNV development. Schematically, CNVs {{can be distinguished}} into classic and occult subtypes, which are characterized by variable natural history and different responsiveness to some therapeutic procedures. At present, the dramatic vision loss due to CNV can be mainly treated by two interventional strategies, which are utilizable in either single or combined modalities: photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT-V), and intravitreal administration of drugs acting against vascular endothelial growth factor. The combined use of PDT-V and anti-angiogenic drugs {{represents one of the}} most promising strategies against <b>neovascular</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> but it unavoidably results in an expensive increase in health resource utilization. However, the positive data from several studies serve as a basis for reconsidering the role of PDT-V, which has undergone a renaissance prompted by the need for a more rational therapeutic approach toward CNV. New pharmacogenetic knowledge of PDT-V points to exploratory prospects to optimize the clinical application of this intriguing photothrombotic procedure. In fact, a Medline search provides data regarding the role of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as genetic predictors of CNV responsiveness to PDT-V. Specifically, correlations between SNPs and different levels of PDT-V efficacy have been detected by examining the gene variants influencing (i) thrombo-coagulative pathways, i. e. methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 C>T (rs 1801133), factor V (F 5) 1691 G>A (rs 6025), prothrombin (F 2) 20210 G>A (rs 1799963), and factor XIII-A (F 13 A 1) 185 G>T (rs 5985); (ii) complement activation and/or inflammatory processes, i. e. complement factor H (CFH) 1277 T>C (rs 1061170), high-temperature requirement factor A 1 (HTRA 1) promoter - 512 G>A (rs 11200638), and two variants of the C-reactive protein (CRP) gene (rs 2808635 and rs 876538); and (iii) production and bioavailability of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA - 2578 C>A [rs 699947] and rs 2146323). This article critically evaluates both the clinical plausibility and the opportunity to utilize the most important SNP-response interactions of PDT-V for an effective upgrade of the current anti-CNV therapeutic scenario. In addition, the pharmacogenetics of a very severe post-PDT-V adverse event, i. e. a decrease in acute vision, is briefly discussed. A comprehensive appraisal of the findings reviewed in this article should be carefully considered to design future trials aimed at verifying (after proper genotypic stratification of the enrolled patients) whether these innovative pharmacogenetic approaches will be able to improve the multifaceted interventional management of <b>neovascular</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration...</b>|$|E

C 57 BL/ 6 mice were exposed to 75 % hyperoxia for five days on postnatal day 7 (P 7). The mice were then exposed to room air from P 12 to P 17 to induce ischemic proliferative retinopathy.

Verteporfin, a drug that enhances phototherapy to treat <b>neovascular</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> is an inhibitor of YAP 1. We found that verteporfin inhibited tumor growth independently of its effects on YAP 1 or the related protein TAZ in genetically or chemically induced mouse models of CRC, in patient-derived xenografts, and in enteroid models of CRC. Instead, verteporfin exhibited in vivo selectivity for killing tumor cells in part by impairing the global clearance of high-molecular weight oligomerized proteins, particularly p 62 (a sequestrome involved in autophagy) and STAT 3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; a transcription factor). Verteporfin inhibited cytokine-induced STAT 3 activity and cell proliferation and reduced the viability of cultured CRC cells. Although verteporfin accumulated {{to a greater extent}} in normal cells than in tumor cells in vivo, experiments with cultured cells indicated that the normal cells efficiently cleared verteporfin-induced protein oligomers through autophagic and proteasomal pathways. Culturing CRC cells under hypoxic or nutrient-deprived conditions (modeling a typical CRC microenvironment) impaired the clearance of protein oligomers and resulted in cell death, whereas culturing cells under normoxic or glucose-replete conditions protected cell viability and proliferation in the presence of verteporfin.

PARTICIPANTS: First-degree relatives of 87 patients with late ARM, i. e., atrophic or <b>neovascular</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> were compared with first-degree relatives of 135 control subjects without ARM. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence and stage of ARM as diagnosed on fundus transparencies, odds ratio, lifetime risk, risk ratio, and population-attributable risk. RESULTS: Independent of other risk factors, the prevalence of early (odds ratio = 4. 8, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 8 - 12. 2) and late (odds ratio = 19. 8, 95 % CI = 3. 1 - 126. 0) ARM was significantly higher in relatives of patients with late ARM. The lifetime risk estimate of late ARM was 50 % (95 % CI = 26 %- 73 %) for relatives of patients vs 12 % (95 % CI = 2 %- 16 %) for relatives of controls (P <. 001), yielding a risk ratio of 4. 2 (95 % CI = 2. 6 - 6. 8). Relatives of patients expressed the various features of ARM at a younger age. The population-attributable risk related to genetic factors was 23 %. CONCLUSIONS: First-degree relatives of patients with late ARM developed ARM at an increased rate at a relatively young age. Our findings indicate that approximately one fourth of all late ARM is genetically determined and suggest that genetic susceptibility may {{play an important role}} in determining the onset of disease...|$|E

Verteporfin (VP), clinically used in photodynamic therapy for <b>neovascular</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> has been recently proven to be a suppressor of YAP–TEAD complex and has shown potential in anticancer treatment. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential effect of VP in the treatment of OC. Our results showed that VP led to inhibition of proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner and to the suppression of migratory and invasive capacities of OC cells. Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that VP induced YAP cytoplasmic retention and deregulated inducible YAP and CCNs in OC cells. In vivo, VP exerted a significant effect on tumor growth in OVCAR 8 xenograft mice, resulting in tumor nodules with lower average weight and reduced volume of gross ascites. In addition, VP treatment remarkably upregulated cytoplasmic YAP and phosphorylation YAP and downregulated CCN 1 and CCN 2, but exerted little effect on YAP-upstream components in Hippo pathway. In conclusion, our results suggested that VP may be a promising agent for OC, acting by suppressing YAP–TEAD complex. Keywords: YAP, CCN 2, ovarian cancer, verteporfin, Hippo pathwa...|$|E
40|$|In the 19 th century, age-related maculopathy (ARM) was {{described}} {{for the first}} time as an agerelated abnormality of the macula lutea. ARM consists of a variety of clinical signs, from the early stages with soft distinct drusen, indistinct drusen and pigment alterations up to the late stages of geographic atrophy and <b>neovascular</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> These late stages are also referred to as age-related macular degeneration. Nowadays, ARM is the leading cause of blindness among the elderly in the Western world. With the rapidly growing popUlation of the elderly, it can be estimated that in the Netherlands ahnost 115, 000 people will have signs of the end stages in the year 2030. This will have great implications for the quality of life of these patients, since age-related macular degeneration decreases central vision. Furthermore, treatment is only limited to a small group of patients. Although many investigators have tried to unravel the pathogenesis of ARM, the knowledge of its etiology is still limited. Many environmental factors have been implicated as risk factors in ARM, however limited factors were consistent. While already in 1875 the first description of a genetic component in ARM was given by Hutchington and Tay/ it was only since the last decade that research on the genetic factors in ARM has gained worldwide attention. Studies on the genetics of ARM have been hampered by the lack of suitable patient material and insight in complex diseases such as ARM. The aim of this thesis is to obtain more knowledge on the disease frequency and its risk factors. Special attention is addressed to the genetic factors involved in ARM. The first part of this thesis gives an overview of the current knowledge on the genetics of ARM. In the second part the disease frequency and its risk factors are described. The third part covers two genetic-epidemiological approaches to study the genetics of ARM. The fourth part addresses two candidate genes for ARM...|$|E
