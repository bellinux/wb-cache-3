5|$|Bart {{wakes up}} from the {{nightmare}} to find his family beside his bed. Marge assures him he has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> afraid of, but a green fog seeps {{in through the window}} and the Simpsons are turned inside out. They, along with Willie, perform a musical number over the end credits, but Bart is dragged away and eviscerated by Santa's Little Helper.|$|E
5|$|The good {{understanding}} between the patroons of the Amsterdam Chamber left <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> desired; Burgh, Godyn, Blommaert, and Van Rensselaer, before signifying to the directors {{their willingness to}} start colonies, made an agreement to work the projected colonies on joint account, each {{under the direction of}} one of them. Three of them would have a one-fifth share in each colony, while the fourth would receive the remaining two fifths, taking the responsibility for its management and exercising patroon rights.|$|E
5|$|As vice president, Brundage {{served on}} a {{commission}} appointed at the IOC's London session in 1948 to recommend whether the 1906 Intercalated Games, held in Athens, {{should be considered a}} full Olympic Games. All three members of what {{came to be known as}} the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when it met later that year in Rome.|$|E
60|$|The second {{expedition}} was as fruitless as the first. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen, and <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard, of Lady Lundie and Blanche.|$|R
60|$|They backed, and {{the boat}} answered, but <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen.|$|R
60|$|When {{he reached}} the river he paused and looked round {{for a moment to}} make sure that the strange feeling of some one {{watching}} him was fancy, and he was really alone. But the moon shone brightly on every tree, and <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen but his own shadow; <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard but the sound of the rippling stream.|$|R
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|As the WSPU gained {{recognition}} and notoriety for its actions, Pankhurst resisted efforts to democratise the organisation itself. In 1907 {{a small group}} of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to suggest that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{there is}} just one {{watermill}} working for trade. Those that remain have mostly been converted. Such conversions include a garage, dwellings, restaurants, museums and a wedding venue. Some watermills are mere derelict shells, lower walls or lesser remains. Of the majority, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>to</b> Gain <b>is</b> {{the third}} and final {{full-length}} album recorded by the San Francisco Bay Area thrash metal band Vio-lence. The album was recorded in August 1990, but wasn't released until 1993, after the departure of guitarist Robb Flynn. <b>Nothing</b> <b>to</b> Gain <b>was</b> re-released in 1997 with a different cover.|$|R
25|$|The {{court is}} {{informed}} that the plaintiff in error {{is no longer in}} the service of the state. We see <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case. On the contrary, we think that the peace and dignity of the state, which all criminal prosecutions are brought to redress, will be the better conserved by the entry of a nolle prosequi herein. Such a course is suggested to the Attorney General.|$|E
25|$|The issues {{involved}} in raw feeding may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi. It {{is interesting to note}} that the Hortaya Borzaya, undoubtedly a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight in itself is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Michael {{travels to}} New York City where he meets Ilana (now Lena Olin) and confesses his {{relationship}} with Hanna. He tells her about the suicide note and Hanna's illiteracy. Ilana tells Michael there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> learned from the camps and refuses the money. Michael suggests that she donate the money to an organization that combats adult illiteracy, preferably a Jewish one. She wants him {{to take care of}} this instead. Ilana keeps the tea tin since it is similar to one stolen from her in Auschwitz.|$|E
60|$|She had {{proceeded}} {{thus far}} with breathless curiosity and interest, when her attention suddenly failed her. Something--she was too deeply absorbed to know what--had got {{between her and}} the letter. Was it a sound in the Banqueting-Hall again? She looked over her shoulder at the door behind her, and listened. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen. She returned to the letter.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he raised}} his head, feeling {{that he had been}} through strange places, where he could never wander any more; and he held himself erect and strong, and looked about him. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen but the shining of the river, and the dark shadows of the trees; <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard but the hum of the insects, as they darted through the night.|$|R
60|$|There was {{the number}} in bright silver numerals, but <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen of any name.|$|R
25|$|According to Thomas Powers, {{the author}} of Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, the more Oughton learned about the hard life of rural Guatemala, the more she {{reflected}} on the affluence of the United States. In Chichicastenango, Americans seemed an alien presence; the fact of their wealth was almost {{an insult to the}} impoverished Indians. In her mind, confusion emerged that lasted the rest of her life: she had rejected affluence (at first almost unconsciously) to work among the poor, but poverty, clearly, was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> envied. She hated poverty, but she hated affluence, too. Oughton left Chichicastenango with a new view of the problems that undeveloped countries like Guatemala faced when in struggle with the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into account.|$|E
25|$|The Geo Storm was a rebadged {{version of}} the sporty, second {{generation}} Isuzu Impulse minus some of that car's more expensive features. The Storm was sold in Japan as the PA Nero and related Gemini Coupe, Impulse. The Storm lacked the Impulse's Lotus-tuned suspension {{as well as the}} Impulse's optional turbocharger and all-wheel drive drivetrain. Although they were essentially the same car, sales of the Storm were much stronger than those of the Impulse—indeed, the Storm sold better than most small GM cars of that era. Slow sales of the Isuzu version doomed the Storm when the Isuzu Impulse was canceled, the Geo Storm derivative had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built from, meaning both cars were discontinued in 1993. the Storm was replaced by the Geo Prizm for Standard hatchback in the same year as Storm discontinued and The wagonback Model was replaced by Pontiac Vibe in 2002 the Prizm and Vibe was built at the NUMMI plant. For The GSi hatchback Model was replaced by GM Delta platform based Chevrolet Cobalt SS in 2004 The Cobalt SS was built at the Lordstown Assembly in Lordstown, Ohio. As of 2010, there were only 40,300 Storms registered for road use.|$|E

25|$|Session IV {{took place}} on Monday 15 April. Angelo Correr (Corrario) and Pedro de Luna (Benedict) were again summoned to appear in person or by proxy, as were the four absent cardinals. The ambassadors of Rupert, King of the Romans, were then given audience. The Bishop of Verden, Ulrich von Albeck, made a strong {{statement}} against the pretensions of the Council itself, listing twenty-four objections of various kinds that the Germans wished to propound; most involved minutiae of Canon Law. Finally, the German delegation proposed a meeting between the Pisans and Pope Gregory at a mutually agreeable place, a proposition which was old and which had already failed several times. The speech was not well-received, but a response was promised for the next general Session, which was scheduled for April 24. In the meantime, a Sunday sermon by the Dominican Bishop of Digne attacked nearly all the German criticisms, and, seeing <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained, the German embassy departed Pisa, appealing their grievances to a future council, to be called by Gregory XII. The Council, wishing to proceed through generosity rather than rigor, and since some personages were understood to be en route, aannounced {{a continuation of the}} cases. Throughout the month of May testimonies were heard against the claimants, but the formal declaration of contumacy did not take place until the fourteenth session.|$|E
500|$|Except Peter, who, seeing <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{ashamed of}} in showing such undaunted courage, {{remained}} {{and kept the}} [...] "Three Pigeons," [...] and prospered remarkably {{to the end of}} his days.|$|E
500|$|After {{the match}} Henrik Larsson {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he was disappointed to have scored two goals in the final and still come away with a runners up medal. Larsson stated that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy about the outcome of the final. He told BBC Sport, [...] "I've said before, I'd much rather not score and be able to lift the UEFA Cup, than to score twice and finish up on the losing side. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy about, but now we have to find a way to lift ourselves for the league game on Sunday." ...|$|E
60|$|Hilary Vane groaned {{more than}} once in the train back to Ripton. It meant <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the father of the most popular man in college.|$|R
60|$|Finding that <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{made out}} of the prisoners, the {{magistrate}} ordered them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken back <b>to</b> jail.|$|R

500|$|In the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler shot himself. After Hitler's suicide, Goebbels was depressed. Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: [...] "It {{is a great}} pity {{that such}} a man is not with us any longer. But there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. For us, {{everything}} is lost now {{and the only way}} out left for us is the one which Hitler chose. I shall follow his example." ...|$|E
500|$|As most of Balzac's biographers point out, Hańska {{was not in}} {{the room}} when he died. Robb says she [...] "must have retired for a moment", while André Maurois notes that she had been by his side for weeks with no way of knowing how long it would continue, and [...] "there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done". Vincent Cronin {{attributes}} her absence to the nature of their relationship: [...] "From the first day by the lakeside at Neuchâtel theirs had been a Romantic love and Eve wanted to guard it to the end against that terrible taint of corruption." ...|$|E
500|$|During production, Lumet {{felt that}} the {{finished}} film would be [...] "an absolutely unique experience that nobody has ever witnessed before." [...] When asked about any possible influence from MGM's popular 1939 film adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, Lumet stated that [...] "there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained from [...] other than to make certain we didn't use anything from it. They made a brilliant movie, and even though our concept is different – they're Kansas, we're New York; they're white, we're black, and the score and the books are totally different – {{we wanted to make}} sure that we never overlapped in any area." ...|$|E
