Every one knows that Dwight Partridge was working on an {{explosive}} when he died, and here's his son comes along with a test-tube full of stuff which he says could blow this city to bits. What's the answer? The boy's been working on the old man's dope. From what I've seen of him, I guess there wasn't much more to be done on it, or he wouldn't have done it. He's pretty well dead from the neck up, as far as I can see. But that doesn't alter the fact that he's got the stuff and that you and I have got to get together and make a deal. If we don't, I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> mightn't gum my game, just as I might gum yours; but where's the sense in that? It only means taking extra chances. Whereas if we sit in together, there's enough in it for both of us. You know as well as I do that there's a dozen markets which'll bid against each other for stuff like that Partridgite. If you're worrying about Burke giving you a square deal, forget it. I'll fix Burke. He'll treat you nice, all right." ...|$|E

Ron McCoy, one of the festival's founders, said it is unknown where the three signed proclamations will be exhibited.

40|$|How do {{we protect}} systems? The answer is straightforward: each {{component}} must be evaluated independently and protected as necessary. Beware the easy answers, such as deploying stronger encryption while ignoring vulnerable end points; that's {{too much like}} looking under the streetlamp for lost keys, not because they're likely to be there but because it's an easy place to search. Remember, too, that people and processes are system components as well, and often the weakest onesâ€”think about phishing, but also about legitimate emails that are structurally indistinguishable from phishing attacks. I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> should ignore one weakness because you can't afford to address another serious oneâ€”but in general, your defenses should be balanced.
