5|$|The Lexus LS {{marked the}} first {{successful}} entrant of a Japanese manufacturer into the prestige luxury arena, a market that had long been dominated by established European and American brands. By 1991, with the LS 400 its top-selling model, Lexus had overtaken Mercedes-Benz and BMW in overall U.S. sales, and in 2000, the marque passed Cadillac as the luxury sales leader in the largest automotive market. Rival manufacturers responded with lower prices and added features. In particular, Mercedes-Benz reorganized its operations, shifting to a targeted-cost process similar to Lexus production methods, and dropped competing U.S. base prices by nearly 10 percent. To rival the LS 400, extra features were rushed for {{the launch of the}} 1991 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W140), causing budget overruns and costing the job of Daimler-Benz's chief engineer, Wolfgang Peter. Approximately 5 percent of 1989 LS 400 sales went to buyers employed by rival manufacturers, including GM, Ford, and Chrysler. When the LS 400 was disassembled for engineering analysis, Cadillac engineers concluded that the vehicle could not be built using existing GM methods. Industry publications noted the LS 400's precise panel gaps, and the subject became a common evaluation standard in road tests. The LS 430's interior <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> was later used by rival makes as a measure of cabin quiet.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{relationships}} between tyre/road <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> measured by the Coast-By (CB) and the Close-ProXimity (CPX) methods. For that purpose, tyre/road noise was measured for a passenger car fitted with four identical patterned tyres rolling {{on a set of}} 15 impervious road surfaces. The CPX and CB measurement methods have been used simultaneously on each road surface at vehicle speeds ranging between 50 km/h and 110 km/h. A very good correlation between overall CPX and CB <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> recomposed between 400 Hz and 4000 Hz was observed which is consistent with previous results of the literature. With the whole set of road surfaces and frequencies, a fairly good correlation between the CPX and CB spectral <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> was also observed. Taking each road surface individually, an excellent spectral correlation was observed, leading to a very accurate estimation of the overall CB <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> from the CPX <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> Considering each one-third octave band frequency, the correlations between CPX and CB spectral <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> were also good and enable to estimate the overall CB <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> with the same accuracy as when using the correlation between the overall CPX and CB <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> As a perspective, the results could help to compare different tyre/road noise prediction models which have been calibrated or validated with different testing method (pass-by or close-proximity) ...|$|R

40|$|Aims By developing, {{implementing}} {{and delivering}} a noise reduction intervention programme, we aimed {{to attempt to}} reduce the high <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> on inpatient wards. Background Sleep is essential for human survival and sleep deprivation is detrimental to health and well being. Exposure to noise {{has been found to}} disrupt sleep in hospitalised patients which is to be expected as <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> have been measured and reported as high. Design A primarily nursing focused, multi-method approach, involving development of clinical guidelines, ward environment review and a staff noise awareness and education programme, was used to target mainly nursing staff plus other healthcare staff on three wards within one hospital. Methods This practice development initiative was carried out in three key phases (1) Preaudit of ward <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> (2) The development, implementation and delivery of a noise reduction intervention programme, (3) Postaudit of ward <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> Results Preintervention average peak decibel levels over 24 hours were found to be 96 · 48 dB(A) and postintervention average peak decibel levels were measured at 77 · 52 dB(A), representing an overall significant reduction in <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> (p < 0 · 001).
