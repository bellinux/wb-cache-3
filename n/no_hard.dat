However, there were <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> feelings between the coaches. The two kept in cordial phone contact and Carroll made light of Harbaugh's comments several times during the season.|$|E
5|$|The few {{species of}} demosponge that have entirely soft fibrous skeletons with <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> {{elements}} {{have been used}} by humans over thousands of years for several purposes, including as padding and as cleaning tools. By the 1950s, though, these had been overfished so heavily that the industry almost collapsed, and most sponge-like materials are now synthetic. Sponges and their microscopic endosymbionts are now being researched as possible sources of medicines for treating a wide range of diseases. Dolphins have been observed using sponges as tools while foraging.|$|E

5|$|About {{forty years}} after Somairle's death, a Benedictine monastery was {{established}} on Iona. The monastery's foundation charter dates to December 1203, {{which suggests that}} Ragnall may {{have been responsible for}} its erection, as claimed by early modern tradition preserved in the eighteenth-century Book of Clanranald. Be that as it may, there is <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> evidence linking Ragnall to the house's foundation. Since the charter reveals that the monastery received substantial endowments from throughout the meic Somairle domain, the foundation appears to have been supported by other leading members the kindred, such as Dubgall himself (if he was still alive) or his son, Donnchad. The charter placed the monastery under the protection of Pope Innocent III (died 1216), which secured its episcopal independence from the Diocese of the Isles. However, the price for the privilege of Iona's papal protection appears to have been the adoption of the Benedictine Rule, and the supersession of the centuries-old institution of Colum Cille.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{prove that}} there is <b>no</b> sparse <b>hard</b> set for P under logspace computable bounded truth-table {{reductions}} unless P=L. In case of reductions computable in NC 1, the collapse goes down to P=NC 1. We parameterize this result and obtain a generic theorem allowing us to vary the sparseness condition, the space bound {{and the number of}} queries of the truth-table reduction. Another instantiation yields {{that there is}} <b>no</b> quasipolynomially dense <b>hard</b> set for P under polylog-space computable truth-table reductions using polylogarithmically many queries unless P is in polylog-space. We also apply the proof technique to NL and L. We establish that there is <b>no</b> sparse <b>hard</b> set for NL under logspace computable bounded truth-table reductions unless NL=L and that there is <b>no</b> sparse <b>hard</b> set for L under NC 1 -computable bounded truth-table reductions unless L=NC 1. We show that all these results carry over to the randomized setting: If we allow two-sided error randomized reductions with confidence at least inversely polynomial, we obtain collapses to the corresponding randomized classes in the multiple access model. In addition, we prove that there is <b>no</b> sparse <b>hard</b> set for NP under two-sided error randomized polynomial-time bounded truth-table reductions with confidence at least inversely polynomial unless NP=RP...|$|R
