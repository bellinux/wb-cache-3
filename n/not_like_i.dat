500|$|Rolling Stone fully {{retracted}} [...] "A Rape on Campus" [...] {{and removed the}} article from its website. However, Coco McPherson, {{who is in charge}} of Rolling Stone's fact-checking operation, said, [...] "I one-hundred percent do not think that the policies that we have in place failed." [...] Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana was also cited on the Columbia report: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things." [...] Jill Geisler in the Columbia Journalism Review reacted to Dana's statement by saying, [...] "At a time when humility should guide a leader's comments, that quote carries the aroma of arrogance." ...|$|E
500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} with Q, Lorde expressed frustration about [...] "certain things about music": [...] "There {{are a lot}} of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys." [...] Following the release of Pure Heroine, she also described herself as a [...] "sex-positive" [...] person, elaborating:People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and I have nothing against anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or help me tell a story any better. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> have a problem with dancing around in undies—I think you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me.|$|E
500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E
5000|$|From 1827-1831, Trollope's mother Frances Trollope {{lived the}} United States, {{attempting}} {{to repair the}} family's fortunes and observing {{all aspects of the}} nation. Upon her return to England, she published Domestic Manners of the Americans in 1832. Mrs. Trollope strongly criticised the country and its customs: [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>like</b> them. <b>I</b> do <b>not</b> <b>like</b> their principles, <b>I</b> do <b>not</b> <b>like</b> their manners, <b>I</b> do <b>not</b> <b>like</b> their opinions." [...] The American press responded with strongly negative reviews of Domestic Manners.|$|R

500|$|In the 2016 MLS Cup Final against Seattle, held at BMO Field on 10 December, Giovinco's {{performance}} was largely stifled by Seattle's heavy and aggressive defending, despite initially creating an early goalscoring chance for Altidore; throughout the match, he was fouled {{a total of}} six times and had several shots blocked. A scoring opportunity came in the 48th minute, but his shot was skewed wide of the near post. He was eventually substituted for Tosaint Ricketts in the 103rd minute, due to an apparent injury, and consequently, despite being the club's main penalty kick taker, was not used in the resulting shoot-out, which Toronto lost 5–4, following a 0–0 draw after extra-time. Regarding Giovinco's surprising substitution, Toronto's coach, Greg Vanney, stated in the post-match press conference: [...] "He couldn't move. He looked at me. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> take him off because I want to. I look at him and he gives me the sign that he can’t go any more and when he feels like he can’t go, he feels like he’s more of a liability to the group than anything. That’s the decision. It's not one that I generally want to make, but we had to." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Cooper hosted Saturday Night Live {{with musical}} guest TV on the Radio, portraying actor Christian Bale in one skit. Later that year, he {{appeared}} in a supporting role in the film He's Just Not That Into You. Cooper's breakthrough role came in Todd Phillips' comedy The Hangover (2009). He played Phil Wenneck, {{one of the three}} friends—alongside Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis—to wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas, with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor missing. The Hangover was a commercial success and finished as among the highest-grossing R-rated films in the United States. The New York Times A. O. Scott wrote: [...] "Mr. Cooper... offers the most interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss." [...] For his performance, Cooper received an award at the 13th Hollywood Film Festival and his first nomination for MTV Movie Awards—Best Comedic Performance. The newspaper The Daily Telegraph opined that the success of the film turned Cooper into [...] "a bona fide leading man". Nevertheless, Cooper stated in a 2011 interview with Shave: [...] "It's the same. I mean, look, more doors have been opened for sure, but it's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> sit back with a cigar on Monday morning and go through the scripts that have been offered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{an instant}} success, the novel {{steadily}} increased in sales, eventually attracting a following behind its core idea of [...] "Generation X". Over his own protestations, Coupland was dubbed the spokesperson for a generation, stating in 2006 [...] "I {{was just doing}} what I do and people sort of stuck that on to me. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> spend my days thinking that way." [...] Terms popularized by Coupland in the novel, including Generation X and McJob, ultimately entered the vernacular.|$|E

2500|$|A strange-looking whale {{can be seen}} {{flying around}} the large statue {{during most of the}} video, {{specifically}} {{at the end of the}} video. The whale in the video was Joe Hahn's idea. He has been quoted as saying, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> pulled it out of my ass; it made sense to me." [...] The reasoning behind its inclusion is still unknown. The whale could be identified as a [...] "space whale" [...] which takes the concept that life (or time) is too short for one to absorb all its mass surroundings. The whale also makes a brief appearance in the music video for [...] "Shadow of the Day".|$|E
2500|$|According to Harris, {{the head}} of the casting {{department}} refused to negotiate her salary, stating that she was a [...] "scale character who dies in the first twenty minutes." [...] This ultimately led to her dropping out of the project. [...] "People automatically assume I wanted some crazy amount of money, or something," [...] Harris commented in 2014, [...] " [...] it's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> [...] demanding of anything, really... When you've been asked to do something and then they insult you by saying, [...] "You're a piece of shit, you die in the first act—I don't give a fuck that you were in two other Halloween movies, who cares?"... I was in shock." [...] Actress J. C. Brandy was cast as Harris's replacement.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{she entered}} the Philippine music {{industry}} in 2002, Nina {{has been compared to}} Mariah Carey due to her similarity to Carey's vocal range and musical style. She can even imitate Carey's high whistle registers, and has performed Carey's popular hits in her different concerts and gigs. She expressed being a fan of Carey by saying that she never attempted to watch concerts before she became a recording artist, until [...] She also cited Carey as a major influence in her debut album Heaven (2002), although she still stressed the originality of her sound, saying [...] "But it's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> want my career to imitate or even be compared with hers [...] In the end, I want to be acknowledged as a singer of my own brand of music." [...] Some of her other musical influences include Whitney Houston, Alicia Keys, Gary Valenciano, Ella Mae Saison and Regine Velasquez. She has also collaborated with international acts such as Diane Warren, Joe Pizzulo, The Cascades, Fra Lippo Lippi, Keith Martin, Kenji Williams, Lea Salonga, Billy Crawford, Charice Pempengco and Arnel Pineda of Journey.|$|E

2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's not like we were having a problem out on the racetrack with her. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> just drew her name out of a hat and decided she was the one I was going to run into tonight." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mirah {{had been}} {{smiling at the}} swiftly-made image, and she smiled still, but {{with a touch of}} {{something}} else than amusement, as she said--"Thank you.

6000|$|There {{was a sort}} {{of curiosity}} in his eye that I did <b>not</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> don't know whether the steward had told them that I was [...] "queer" [...] only, or downright drunk, but I know the man meant to have a good look at me.

6000|$|Archie {{was able}} to endure no longer. He thrust his plate away and {{interrupted}} the deliberate and insignificant stream of talk.

60|$|There {{seemed to}} be {{a number of things that}} Mrs. Kennedy did <b>not</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> thought my chance of {{pleasing}} that critical lady extremely small, especially when I had to live up to Clark Oliver's personality.
