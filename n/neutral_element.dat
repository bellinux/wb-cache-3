40|$|In recent years, the {{computation}} of marginals {{out of a}} factorization of val-uations {{has been}} studied in detail. There are several algorithms solving this task such that the domains of the intermediate results remain small. These methods are essentially based on message passing schemes on join trees. Every node’s label equals the domain of a factor or {{the domain of the}} combination of several factors. However, we are usually forced to use covering join trees where the domains of the factors are only supposed to be contained in the labels of the nodes. A major drawback of the use of covering join trees {{is that we have to}} ensure that all marginals to be computed are well defined. Until yet, this problem was simplified by filling the nodes with <b>neutral</b> <b>elements</b> bearing the desired, bigger domain. Although mathematical correct, this is not feasible for practical purposes, since <b>neutral</b> <b>elements</b> tend to contain infinite elements.

2500|$|Given a {{vector space}} V {{we can take}} G to be the general linear group GL(V), and X to be the set of all (ordered) bases of V.

What is more, a linear transformation fixing each vector of a basis will fix all v in V, hence being the <b>neutral</b> <b>element</b> of the general linear group GL(V) : so that X is indeed a principal homogeneous space. One way to follow basis-dependence in a linear algebra argument is to track variables x in X.
