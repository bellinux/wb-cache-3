50|$|Winster is {{a village}} in the English Derbyshire Dales about 5 mi from Matlock and 6 mi from Bakewell at an {{altitude}} of approximately 820 ft. It was formerly a centre for the lead mining industry. The village, which lies within the Peak District National Park, has a large number of listed buildings, including the Market House open daily as a <b>National</b> Trust <b>information</b> <b>point.</b> Its current population is about 630; reducing to 600 at the 2011 Census, the village has a primary school, two churches, two pubs and a village shop (owned by the community) which includes a post office. Winster was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 when it was owned by Henry de Ferrers.|$|R
30|$|INTAS {{became one}} of the fist ‘victims’ of this reorientation. Although the {{programme}} proved to be successful (Idenburg et al. [2004]), it could not be adapted to a changing policy environment and ceased its operations {{at the end of the}} first decade of the new millennium. This was especially disadvantageous for the economically less advanced EECA countries since they hardly had capacities to withstand the higher competition exercised within the sixth and seventh FPs, which generally opened up for participation of international partner countries. Although the interest of Central Asian institutions in participating in FP 7 is broad, in fact, only 34 institutes succeeded in different S&T projects within FP 7 (data until May 2011). These participations were supported by the EC with a mere budget of € 1.7 million. With 17 participations, Kazakhstan was the strongest partner from this region. Discussions with policy makers from Central Asia revealed that the European Framework Programme for RTD is rather a distant concept to them, while INTAS is still more present in their heads. A reason for this lack of awareness is also the underdeveloped FP 7 National Contact Point (NCP) system in Central Asia. With 14 thematic NCPs and 1 national coordination office, Kazakhstan has the most developed NCP system in the region. A similarly advanced structure can only be found in Uzbekistan (13 NCPs). Overall, however, the existing FP 7 <b>national</b> <b>information</b> <b>points</b> in the region are not directly supported financially by their national governments (Sonnenburg et al. [2012]).|$|R
50|$|Next to {{the church}} stands the Church House, built in 1537. It {{is thought to have}} {{originally}} been built as a brewery for the production of church ales, became adapted as an almshouse, and later became the village school. Today, it is used as a meeting place for local people. Sexton's Cottage forms the western end of the building and is now a National Trust shop and Dartmoor <b>National</b> Park <b>information</b> <b>point.</b> It is now managed by the National Trust. Standing {{in front of the building}} is a 15-inch naval shell, which was donated to the village after the First World War to thank the villagers for supplying troops with sphagnum moss. This grows in abundance in the damp Dartmoor conditions, and is said to have healing properties. It was used as an emergency field dressing for injured troops.|$|R
5000|$|In The Pentagon Papers case, a {{classified}} study was published revealing that four administrations had misled the American public about their intentions in the Vietnam War, increasing the credibility gap. Russo and Ellsberg were prosecuted under Espionage Law. The case prompted Harold Edgar & Benno C. Schmidt, Jr. {{to write a}} review of Espionage law in the 1973 Columbia Law Review. Their article was entitled [...] "The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information". In it, {{they point out that}} Espionage law does not criminalize classified <b>information,</b> only <b>national</b> defense <b>information.</b> They <b>point</b> out that Congress has repeatedly resisted or failed to make the disclosing of classified information illegal, in and of itself. Instead, Congress has strictly limited which sort of classified information is illegal, and under which specific circumstances it is illegal. i.e. in [...] Congress specifically criminalized leaking cryptographic information that is classified, but when it passed the law it specifically stated the law didn't criminalize disclosing other types of classified information. Another article that discusses the issue is by Jennifer Elsea of the Congressional Research Service.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} an <b>information</b> <b>point</b> {{factor and}} attempts to identify how it affects saturation flow and their relationship at signalized intersections. An <b>information</b> <b>point</b> is defined as any object, structure, or activity located outside of a traveling vehicle that can potentially attract the visual attention of the driver. Saturation flow rates are studied at three pairs of signalized intersections in Toledo, Ohio, USA. Each pair of intersections consists of one intersection with {{a high number of}} <b>information</b> <b>points</b> and one intersection with a low number of <b>information</b> <b>points.</b> Study results reveal that, for each pair of intersections, the one with high <b>information</b> <b>points</b> has a lower saturation flow rate than the one with low <b>information</b> <b>points.</b> A statistical analysis shows that the differences are significant. Based on the saturation flow data of the paired intersections, <b>information</b> <b>point</b> effect models are developed and presented in this paper...|$|R

As such {{it is a matter of}} social justice. A brief overview of the scope and nature of <b>national</b> <b>information</b> policies is provided.
