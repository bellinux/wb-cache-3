At this time, officers who had not served overseas were sent to Europe to tour the battlefields, and Loper visited battlefields in France, Belgium and Italy, as well as the Army of Occupation in Germany.|$|E

At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{grew up to}} be {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} good looking {{by the standards of the}} period.

40|$|The {{comparison}} of standard climatological <b>normals</b> <b>for</b> the periods 1931 - 1960 and 1961 - 90 indicates a certain increase in winter temperatures and {{a decrease in}} summer temperatures in Croatia. ln the monthly precipitation totals there is an opposite trend. Weakening of the continental climate characteristics has recently been accompanied by a decrease of interannual variability of mean monthly temperatures. Temperature <b>normals</b> <b>for</b> the 1961 - 90 period approach more closely the mean values for the entire period of observation in Zagreb than any other standard normals. lt is shown that the often advocated advantage of short period (5 or 10 years) normals as a more reliable basis for future value estimations, has no justification...|$|R
5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is <b>normal</b> <b>for</b> guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|In early July, shower {{activity}} {{increased in}} association with an area of disturbed weather. With surface pressures lower than <b>normal</b> <b>for</b> a tropical disturbance, deep convection increased further and Tropical Depression Six-E formed late on July 5 and reaching tropical storm status the following day and was named Dolores. Despite moderate wind shear, very cold cloud tops formed as the winds increased to , a moderate tropical storm. Moving westward, Dolores strengthened into the first hurricane of the season on July 7 as a ragged eye formed.|$|E

Potential applications of the normal form include clutter reduction and automated theorem proving in systems based on Euler diagrams...|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{photograph}} on record in Denmark is credited to Peter Faber (1810–1877), a songwriter and {{a pioneer in}} telegraphy. His daguerreotype of Ulfeldts Plads is in the Copenhagen City Museum. The image of the square is in fact reversed left to right, as was <b>normal</b> <b>for</b> daguerreotypes unless a mirror was used together with the camera. Careful analysis of the photograph suggests that it dates back to July 1840. The exposure time of about 15 minutes in sunlight explains why the only figure to be seen is a man sleeping {{at the foot of}} the Pillar of Shame towards the left of the picture.|$|E
5|$|The {{visual effects}} supervisor, John Sullivan, hired Arc Productions to create just under 500 shots with {{computer}} generated imagery, between a quarter {{and a third}} of what a blockbuster film would feature. The Covenant that appear are all completely computer generated, as is the academy's space elevator, weapons' muzzle flashes and a few shots of Master Chief. Hendler felt that the visual effects were the area that needed particular focus and spent a much larger percentage of the budget on the Master Chief costume and computer generated imagery than is <b>normal</b> <b>for</b> a production.|$|E
