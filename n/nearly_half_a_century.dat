5|$|His wife of <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> Elizabeth, {{to whom he}} had {{not been}} faithful, died in 1971. Brundage had once jested that his {{ambition}} was to wed a German princess. In June 1973, this came to pass when he married Princess Mariann Charlotte Katharina Stefanie von Reuss (1936–2003), daughter of HeinrichXXXVII, Prince of Reuss-Köstritz. Von Reuss had worked as an interpreter during the Munich Games; she stated that she had met Brundage in 1955, when she was 19. When Brundage was asked by reporters about the 48-year difference in their ages, Brundage responded that he was young for his age and she mature for hers, and instead of 85 years to 37, it should be thought of as more like 55 to 46. Ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after Brundage's death that the couple had dissipated much of Brundage's fortune through free spending, though Guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate, which could be deemed investments.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the course}} of the {{research}} represented in the book, Heilmann considers and eventually rejects the possibility of all living and several extinct groups of reptiles as potential ancestors for modern birds, including crocodilians, pterosaurs and several groups of dinosaurs. Despite his acknowledgment that some of the smaller Jurassic theropods had many similarities to Archaeopteryx and modern birds, he determined that they were unlikely to be direct bird ancestors and that they were instead closely–related offshoots, and concluded that the similarities were a result of convergent evolution rather than direct ancestry. Based essentially on a process of elimination, Heilmann arrives at the conclusion that birds must be descended from thecodonts, a group of archosaurs that lived during the Permian and Triassic periods. Although this conclusion was later shown to be inaccurate, The Origin of Birds was regarded as a masterful piece of scholarship at the time and set the international agenda for research in bird evolution for <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> and much of its research remains of interest.|$|E

50|$|Fite {{constructed}} a huge A-frame out of 30 ft timbers and raised {{it over the}} monolith, then used a chain hoist to lift the stone and suspend it over the hole. Still working stone by stone, he filled in the hole and built up a pedestal, topped by a three-quarter ton capstone.The monolith had previously been made ready by trimming its base, so that its center of gravity was exactly perpendicular to the capstone. This entailed a calculation of extreme precision, one that was worked out by Fite and his neighbor Berthel Wrolsen, a local man who was a self-taught engineering genius and an unofficial consultant to Fite on many structural issues over the years. The calculations were especially difficult in that {{the top of the}} monolith is not only wider than the base, but also asymmetrical. Lowered into place, the monolith was to be held there entirely by its own weight and balance. Fite and Wrolsen’s calculations, and Fite’s execution, proved to be correct. The monolith remains standing after <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century’s</b> exposure to all kinds of weather.|$|R
40|$|This thesis uses a {{specific}} event, B. B. King’s performance in 1970 and subsequent album from Chicago’s Cook County Jail, {{to study the}} intersections of race, music, and American culture. First, I trace the {{events leading up to}} the performance and album and contextualize both within King's career and the history of race relations in the South and in Chicago.   Second, I detail the history of Cook County Jail and King’s subsequent prison activism. All in all, this thesis argues that the sense of racial bondage shared between the blues, King, and the inmates at Cook County Jail, is the primary reason Live in Cook County Jail became the most successful prison blues ever recorded. This thesis also concludes that, while King’s performance occurred <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> ago, what it had to say about racial inequality in correctional facilities remains relevant...|$|R
25|$|Clergymen {{all over}} the world became shocked when dresses to be worn with modest round or V-shaped necklines became fashionable around 1913. In the German Empire, for example, all Roman Catholic bishops joined in issuing a {{pastoral}} letter attacking the new fashions. Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more accepted in Western societies, during World War I and remained so for <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

The first Byzantine attempts for counter-attack were repulsed after the annihilation of a 60,000 force {{in the battle of}} the Gates of Trajan in 986 in which Basil II himself barely escaped. In the following decade the Bulgarians took Thessaly, destroyed the Principality of Duklja, advanced deep to the south as far as Corinth on the Peloponnese peninsula and campaigned in Dalmatia and Bosnia.|$|E
25|$|For <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> the Giro {{started and}} {{finished}} by Milan, {{the city where}} {{the headquarters of the}} Gazzetta dello Sport were located. The first time the race didn't start or finish in Milan was in 1911, where the start and finish were moved to Rome to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Italy's unification. With the occasional exception, the start and finish in Milan was the standard for the Giro d'Italia. However, since 1960 the place of departure has changed each year. Some years (1965, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973, 1975, 1981–1989) the finish was also changed, but in 1990 the traditional finish in Milan was restored.|$|E

40|$|The {{profession}} of audiology took root in Brazil <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> {{ago and has}} since blossomed into a flourishing, well-developed field. Currently, audiologists in Brazil work at private institutions, including private medical practices and dedicated speech and hearing clinics. They are also employed in {{a wide array of}} public institutions, including community clinics, elementary schools, colleges, and universities. In both the private sector and health clinics, audiologists perform diagnostic evaluations of auditory and vestibular disorders, select and fit hearing aids, and provide aural rehabilitation. At the public level, they assist with workers` health programs, dispense hearing aids, and aural rehabilitation. There is always room to grow, however, and the future of audiology in Brazil holds both challenges and opportunity. The following article will sketch the development of audiology training and practice in Brazil, provide a picture of how the field stands today, and summarize the unique challenges which the profession faces in this large and diverse nation...|$|R
25|$|When ʿIsa died in 1284, he was {{succeeded by}} his son Muhanna. He and his brother Fadl ruled the emirate for <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> with two interruptions. The first was when Qalawun's successor, Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil, had them and their sons imprisoned in Cairo. Their cousin, Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr (grandson of Ali ibn Haditha) presided over the emirate until Muhanna was reinstalled in 1295, after al-Ashraf Khalil's death. Muhanna's {{allegiance}} vacillated between the Mamluks and the Ilkhanids between 1311 and 1330, after which he became firmly loyal to the Mamluk sultan, an-Nasir Muhammad.

25|$|In 29 BC, the Roman Senate {{ordered the}} closure of the doors to the Temple of Janus in the Roman Forum {{for the first time in}} over 200 years. Signifying that the Roman state was no longer at war, this act {{reportedly}} pleased Augustus, then in his 5th Consulship, more than all the other honours showered on him. But the closure could not have been less appropriate. As Dio himself points out, there were ongoing major operations against the Treveri in Gaul, and the Cantabri and Astures in Spain. Furthermore, the closure inaugurated <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> of virtually incessant warfare, as a result of which the Roman Empire assumed the borders it would hold, with a few modifications, for its entire history.|$|E
25|$|Under Chandragupta Maurya and his successors, {{internal}} and external trade, agriculture, and economic activities all thrived and expanded across India thanks {{to the creation of}} a single and efficient system of finance, administration, and security. After the Kalinga War, the Empire experienced <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of the sciences and of knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across all of India.

60|$|It {{has already}} been said that Dr. Harford had been rector of Baslehurst for many years at the period to which this story refers. He had <b>nearly</b> {{completed}} <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> of work in that capacity, and had certainly been neither an idle nor an inefficient clergyman. But, now in his old age, he was discontented and disgusted by the changes which had come upon him; and though some bodily strength for further service still remained to him, he had no longer any aptitude for useful work. A man cannot change as men change. Individual men are like the separate links of a rotatory chain. The chain goes on with continuous easy motion as though every part of it were capable of adapting itself to a curve, but not the less is each link as stiff and sturdy as any other piece of wrought iron. Dr. Harford had in his time been an active, popular man,--a man possessing even some liberal tendencies in politics, though a country rector of <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century's</b> standing. In his parish he {{had been more than}} a clergyman. He had been a magistrate, and a moving man in municipal affairs. He had been a politician, and though now for many years he had supported the Conservative candidate, he had been loudly in favour of the Reform Bill when Baslehurst was a close borough in the possession of a great duke, who held property hard by. But liberal politics had gone on and had left Dr. Harford high and dry on the standing-ground which he had chosen for himself {{in the early days of}} his manhood. And then had come that pestilent act of the legislature under which his parish had been divided. Not that the Act of Parliament itself had been violently condemned by the doctor on its becoming law. I doubt whether he had then thought much of it.|$|R

25|$|Los Angeles {{employers}} {{had been}} successfully resisting unionization for <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> Harrison Gray Otis, {{publisher of the}} Los Angeles Times, was vehemently anti-union. Otis first joined and then seized control of the local Merchants Association in 1896, renaming it the Merchants and Manufacturers' Association (colloquially known as the M), and using it and his newspaper's large circulation to spearhead a 20-year campaign to end the city's few remaining unions. Without unions to keep wages high, open shop employers in Los Angeles were able to undermine the wage standards set in heavily unionized San Francisco. Unions in San Francisco feared that employers in their city would also soon begin pressing for wage cuts and start an open shop drive of their own. The only solution they saw was to re-unionize Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Baltimore sister station WJZ-TV {{lost its}} {{affiliation}} with ABC after that network announced {{a deal with}} the E. W. Scripps Company to switch all but two of Scripps' television stations to ABC. One of the Scripps-owned stations joining ABC was Baltimore's NBC affiliate, WMAR-TV. This did not sit well with Westinghouse, who felt betrayed by ABC after <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> of loyalty. As a safeguard, Group W intensified a search (which had begun prior to WJZ's affiliation loss) for affiliation deals of its own. Group W eventually struck an agreement to switch KYW-TV, WBZ-TV and WJZ-TV to CBS (Westinghouse already had two CBS affiliates in its portfolio at the time, KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh and KPIX-TV in San Francisco). CBS was initially skeptical about including KYW-TV in the deal. While KYW-TV was a poor third, CBS-owned WCAU-TV (channel 10) was a solid runner-up to long-dominant ABC-owned WPVI-TV. However, after Westinghouse offered to sell CBS a minority stake in KYW-TV, CBS agreed to move its affiliation to channel 3 and put channel 10 up for sale.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> after Elagabalus, Aurelian came to power. He was a reformer, {{strengthening}} {{the position of}} the sun-god as the main divinity of the Roman pantheon; he even built a brand new temple, in Rome, dedicated to the deity. It's also thought likely that he may have been responsible for establishing the festival of the day of the birth of the unconquered sun (Dies Natalis Solis Invicti), which was celebrated on December 25, the day when the sun appears to start rising again - four days after having previously reached its lowest point, though the earliest surviving reference to the festival is in the Chronography of 354. He followed the principle of one god, one empire; his intention was to give to all the peoples of the Empire, civilian or soldiers, easterners or westerners, a single god they could believe in without betraying their own gods. Lactantius argued that Aurelian would have outlawed all the other gods if he had had enough time, but Aurelian only managed {{to hold on to the}} position of Emperor for five years.|$|E

25|$|The lipid {{nature of}} the cell {{membrane}} was first correctly intuited by Quincke, who noted that a cell generally forms a spherical shape in water and, when broken in half, forms two smaller spheres. The only other known material to exhibit this behavior was oil. He also noted that a thin film of oil behaves as a semipermeable membrane, precisely as predicted. Based on these observations, Quincke asserted that the cell membrane comprised a fluid layer of fat less than 100nm thick. This theory was further extended by evidence {{from the study of}} anesthetics. Hans Meyer and Ernest Overton independently noticed that the chemicals which act as general anesthetics are also those soluble in both water and oil. They interpreted this as meaning that to pass the cell membrane a molecule must be at least sparingly soluble in oil, their “lipoid theory of narcosis.” Based on this evidence and further experiments, they concluded that the cell membrane might be made of lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) and cholesterol. Interestingly, one of the early criticisms of this theory was that it included no mechanism for energy-dependent selective transport. This “flaw” would remain unanswered for <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> until the discovery that specialized molecules called integral membrane proteins can act as ion transportation pumps.|$|E
