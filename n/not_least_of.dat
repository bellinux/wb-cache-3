5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction {{had to choose between}} the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which is that many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{case for}} {{excluding}} Oswiu from {{any role in}} Wighard's election {{is based on the}} theory that Bede misinterpreted a letter from Vitalian to Oswiu as stating that Oswiu was involved in the selection. The historian Nicholas Brooks points out that although Bede may have indeed misread Vitalian's letter, Oswiu had other reasons for involving himself in Deusdedit's replacement, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which was a concern that the exiled Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid, who was in Kent and Mercia at the time, not be selected as the new archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby sees Oswiu's involvement in Wighard's selection as an attempt to help restore the Anglo-Saxon church, and perhaps as the beginning of steps to secure York as an archbishopric. Brooks points out that one reason Wighard might have journeyed to Rome was to receive his pallium. As it had been the normal practice up until then to have it sent out to England by the papacy, Wighard's travel to Rome would indicate the papacy's approval of his election and ensure the validity of his consecration.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} held {{a number}} of lessons for the Australians, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> all was the need for tanks. Although the APCs {{had been used to}} support the infantry during the operation, they lacked the firepower and armour to be an effective substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive. Meanwhile, the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated. Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine, and under pressure from Townsend to press on with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong. Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare, when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine-guns in the certainty of suffering casualties. As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon {{became one of the most}} highly decorated Australian platoons of the war. Yet aggression alone could not overcome concentrated firepower, and many survivors were later bitter about the order and losses suffered in these attempts. Another lesson identified included the need to thoroughly prepare an unsecure landing zone by fire prior to insertion. Likewise, during the initial contact A Company had been unable to call in artillery, and the need for a dedicated command and control helicopter to co-ordinate indirect fire during an airmobile assault was also evident.|$|E

25|$|Stage I {{commenced}} on 2 March 1959 {{with the}} construction firm Civil & Civic, monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners. The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind, mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which {{was the fact that}} the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.|$|E
25|$|The {{change of}} format that Doctor Who had {{undergone}} in Season 22 (45-minute episodes, {{moving back to}} one episode per week on Saturday evenings) had been reasonably successful, with ratings around the 6–8 million mark. As such, the production team began preparations for Season 23 in the same format, {{with a total of}} 13 episodes spread over six stories, with five 2-episode serials and one of 3 episodes. A number of storylines were submitted, with six eventually being commissioned between September 1984 and February 1985. However, in February 1985, the BBC announced that, as a cost-cutting measure owing to the costs of several large projects (<b>not</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which was the launch of EastEnders), Season 23 was being put back from its planned transmission in January 1986 to the following September, which would be a different financial year.|$|E
25|$|As governor, Douglas faced {{a number}} of {{significant}} challenges, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which was the expansionist pressure of the neighbouring United States of America. Using his meagre resources, Douglas created the Victoria Voltigeurs, Vancouver Island's first militia, using money from the Company and composed of Metis and French-Canadians in the company's service. He also used the sparse presence of the Royal Navy for protection. During the Crimean War, in 1854 the British and French carried out an attack on Petropavlovsk and casualties were sent to Victoria. After facilities of this key port proved inadequate, the British government charged Douglas to build a hospital at Esquimalt harbour, as well as improve Royal Navy supply capacity. This base proved to be important and successful when in 1865 the headquarters of the North Pacific Squadron were moved to Vancouver Island.|$|E

25|$|The SVR {{have been}} offered first refusal by BRB (Residuary) Ltd. on the all-important tunnel under Bridgnorth as the first {{essential}} part of the plan. If the Telford Steam Railway were to expand and cross the river Severn via the Albert Edward Bridge and operate to the original site of Buildwas Junction station, it would operate over a very short part of the former Severn Valley Line. The planned closure of Ironbridge Power Station In 2015 further adds to the debate because this covers the site of Buildwas Junction station. However, there are several obstacles to overcome, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which is that all of the land north of Bridgnorth tunnel is in private ownership. The Holybush Road was widened and raised after closure, impeding access to the southern portal of Bridgnorth tunnel. The group currently promoting such an extension has identified a viable technical solution to this and other difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Dezong {{witnessed}} {{the rise of}} eunuchs {{during the reign of}} his father Emperor Daizong who himself succeeded to the throne as a result of support from eunuchs. Dezong realized the danger of depending too heavily on eunuchs and as a result he kept them at arm's length when he became emperor. Dezong's opinion of these eunuchs changed drastically when in 782 Dezong was driven out of his capital city by revolting military governors and was not able to command the situation. Even his own generals would not heed to his authority. Dezong felt forsaken and during his escape, only a handful of eunuchs namely Dou Wenchang and Huo Xianming were by his side. During this difficult times, Dezong's view of the eunuchs began to take on a different approach. After his return to Chang'an, Dezong greatly rewarded Dou and Huo for their loyalty <b>not</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which were military and government post. In due course, these eunuchs's power became an inalienable part of the Tang government. Some eunuchs {{in the latter part of}} the dynasty were so powerful that they alone held the abilities to support or depose any emperors at whim. Dezong's son Tang Shunzong and grandson Tang Xianzong as well as later emperors such as Tang Jingzong and Tang Wenzong were all murdered or deposed by eunuchs.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1918 {{his term}} {{of service in}} the police force was {{completed}} and he had reached pensionable age. However, the Halifax Borough Council Watch Committee asked him to stay on in office, and he did so, until 1944. Around this time Richardson instigated the installation of a Police Out-Station at Kings Cross, Halifax, which was a mini replica of Harrison Road. This, he said, would benefit the police and, just as important, the local population, and set the scene for {{what was to become}} Neighbourhood Policing in the UK many years later. The first Police van for the Halifax Borough Police was purchased in 1920. Richardson supervised the purchase and modifications were made so that it could be used for various other purposes, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which was for use by The Coroner's court in Halifax. By 1922 Halifax had many theatres and cinemas. Richardson made and published a booklet regarding the safety of people in 'Queues at Licensed Places of Entertainment' involving their health, weather protection and creating crush room amongst other headings. This followed a tragedy in London when some people died in a cinema fire because the emergency doors opened inwards. Richardson ensured all such doors opened outwards from now on. From 16 January 1924 the Borough was granted the status of a 'Quarter Session town'. This affected procedure and routines for Richardson and his police/court work. From this time he was very active in a Prosecutors role in Court cases. In 1925 he wrote a book called 'The Evolution of the Police Force.' and also wrote a booklet 'Superannuation in the Police Force'.|$|E
