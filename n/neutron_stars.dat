5|$|Multiple X-ray {{sources have}} since been {{detected}} in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton orbiting observatory. Robin Barnard et al. hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or <b>neutron</b> <b>stars,</b> which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays. The spectrum of the <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> {{is the same as}} the hypothesized black holes but can be distinguished by their masses.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting <b>neutron</b> <b>stars,</b> one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E

The Be stellar wind forms a disk confined to a plane often different from the orbital plane of the <b>neutron</b> <b>star.</b> When the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> passes through the Be disk, it accretes a large mass of gas in a short time.

40|$|We {{have found}} {{a new way to}} make Thorne-Zytkow objects, which are massive <b>stars</b> with {{degenerate}} <b>neutron</b> cores. The asymmetric kick given to the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> formed when the primary of a massive tight binary system explodes as a supernova sometimes has the appropriate direction and amplitude to place the newly formed <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> into a bound orbit with a pericenter distance smaller than the radius of the secondary. Consequently, the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> becomes embedded in the secondary. Thorne-Zytkow objects are expected to look like extreme M-type supergiants, assuming that they can avoid a runaway neutrino instability. Accretion onto the embedded <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> will produce either an isolated, spun-up <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> (possibly a short-period pulsar) or a black hole.

The temperature of the proto <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> PSR J 0348 + 0432 is chosen as T= 5 MeV. The calculations show that the central baryon number density of the proto <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> PSR J 0348 + 0432 is in the range 0. 623 ∼ 0. 813 fm^- 3, decreased by 2 ∼ 7 % compared to that of the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> PSR J 0348 + 0432.

5000|$|When two {{massive stars}} are born close {{together}} {{from the same}} cloud of gas, they can form a binary system and orbit each other from birth. If those two stars are {{at least a few}} times as massive as our sun, their lives will both end in supernova explosions. The more massive star explodes first, leaving behind a <b>neutron</b> <b>star.</b> If the explosion does not kick the second star away, the binary system survives. The <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> can now be visible as a radio pulsar, and it slowly loses energy and spins down. Later, the second star can swell up, allowing the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> to suck up its matter. The matter falling onto the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> spins it up and reduces its magnetic field. This is called [...] "recycling" [...] because it returns the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> to a quickly-spinning state. Finally, the second star also explodes in a supernova, producing another <b>neutron</b> <b>star.</b> If this second explosion also fails to disrupt the binary, a double <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> binary is formed. Otherwise, the spun-up <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> is left with no companion and becomes a [...] "disrupted recycled pulsar", spinning between a few and 50 times per second.|$|R
5|$|Gamma ray telescopes {{collect and}} measure individual, high energy gamma rays from astrophysical sources. These are {{absorbed by the}} atmosphere, {{requiring}} that observations are done by high-altitude balloons or space missions.

5|$|The first, indirect, {{detection}} of gravitational waves {{came in the}} 1970s through observation {{of a pair of}} closely orbiting <b>neutron</b> <b>stars,</b> PSR B1913+16. The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves. Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, on Earth, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.|$|E
5|$|The massive-star model {{probably}} {{does not explain}} all types of gamma-ray burst. There is strong evidence that some short-duration gamma-ray bursts occur in systems with no star formation and no massive stars, such as elliptical galaxies and galaxy halos. The favored theory for the origin of most short gamma-ray bursts is the merger of a binary system consisting of two <b>neutron</b> <b>stars.</b> According to this model, the two stars in a binary slowly spiral towards each other because gravitational radiation releases energy until tidal forces suddenly rip the <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> apart and they collapse into a single black hole. The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases a burst of energy, analogous to the collapsar model. Numerous other models have also been proposed to explain short gamma-ray bursts, including the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the accretion-induced collapse of a neutron star, or the evaporation of primordial black holes.|$|E

50|$|Once the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> {{enters the}} red giant, drag between the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> and the outer, diffuse {{layers of the}} red giant causes the binary star system's orbit to decay, and the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> and core of the red giant spiral inward toward one another. Depending on their initial separation, this process may take {{hundreds}} of years. When the two finally collide, the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> and red giant core will merge. If their combined mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit then the two will collapse into a black hole, resulting in a supernova that disperses the outer layers of the star. Otherwise, the two will coalesce into a single <b>neutron</b> <b>star.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{the axis}} of {{rotation}} of the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> is different to the magnetic axis, external viewers will only see these beams of radiation whenever the magnetic axis point towards them during the <b>neutron</b> <b>star</b> rotation.

5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly {{comparable to those}} found in <b>neutron</b> <b>stars</b> – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks.
