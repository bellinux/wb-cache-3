5|$|The main Hessian {{force of}} 1,500 men {{was divided into}} three regiments: Knyphausen, Lossberg and Rall. That <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> did not send out any patrols because of the severe weather.|$|E
5|$|They move {{deeper into}} the woods {{the next day and}} locate what appears to be an old {{cemetery}} with seven small cairns and set up camp nearby. Later that <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> hear the sound of twigs snapping from all directions but assume the noises are from animals or locals. The following day, they attempt to hike back to the car, but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. That <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> again hear twigs snapping but fail to find the source of the noises.|$|E

5|$|According {{to another}} legend, two Parmars from Malwa, named Govinddas and Madhavdas, took up their haunt among the rush grass {{that covered the}} {{neighbourhood}} of the Rudra Mahalaya, and lived by plunder. There they found the foundations of a temple and Shiva linga, and {{said that in the}} <b>night</b> <b>they</b> had seen heavenly beings. This was told to Siddharaj and led to the erection or completion of the temple.|$|E
5|$|Allowing Madigan and Stillwell's parties a head-start, Mawson, Ninnis, Mertz and the {{seventeen}} dogs left Cape Denison {{early in}} the afternoon, reaching Aladdin's Cave four hours later. Stopping for the <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> took on extra supplies and rearranged the sledges. The first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges, which collectively carried half {{the weight of the}} party's supplies. The remaining supplies were put on the third sledge, towed by the second dog team.|$|E
5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the smaller}} insectivorous birds {{including}} the warblers, hummingbirds and flycatchers migrate large distances, usually at <b>night.</b> <b>They</b> land {{in the morning and}} may feed for a few days before resuming their migration.

2500|$|According to the captives {{they were}} [...] "blindfolded, their hands bound, {{and they were}} forced up against the wall." [...] they said they faced [...] "constant {{psychological}} pressure." [...] Later, the British {{said they had been}} stripped and dressed in pyjamas. Over the next few <b>nights</b> <b>they</b> said they slept in [...] "stone cells approximately [...] by , sleeping on piles of blankets" [...] and kept in [...] "isolation" [...] and [...] "interrogated" [...] most <b>nights.</b> <b>They</b> said they were given two options: to admit they were in Iranian waters and be returned to the UK or face up to [...] "seven years in prison".

5000|$|The {{official}} commentary {{included in}} the CD set Celebrate: The Three Dog Night Story, 1964-1975 states that vocalist Danny Hutton's girlfriend, actress June Fairchild (best known as the [...] "Ajax Lady" [...] from the Cheech and Chong movie Up In Smoke) suggested the name after reading a magazine article about indigenous Australians, {{in which it was}} explained that on cold <b>nights</b> <b>they</b> would customarily sleep in {{a hole in the ground}} while embracing a dingo (wild dog). On colder <b>nights</b> <b>they</b> would sleep with two dogs and, if the night was freezing, it was a [...] "three dog night".|$|R

5|$|Some traditions {{also hold}} that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; {{after the first}} {{invitation}} they can {{come and go as}} they please. Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> were not generally considered vulnerable to sunlight.|$|E
5|$|South of the river, the Poles {{prepared}} for another crossing. That <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> awaited {{the arrival of}} assault boats from XXX Corps, but these did not arrive until after midnight, and many were without oars. The crossings started at 03:00, with fire support from the 43rd Wessex Division. Through the remaining hours of darkness, only 153 men were able to cross– less than ¼ of the hoped for reinforcement.|$|E
50|$|Between the {{freezing}} <b>nights,</b> <b>they</b> {{are exposed to}} the sun, and they are trampled by foot. This eliminates what little water is still retained by the potatoes, and removes the skins, enabling subsequent freezing.|$|R
50|$|Interact Club {{participants}} perform {{volunteer work}} {{in the schools and}} in the community. They often work at various school-sponsored events, including dances and activity <b>nights.</b> <b>They</b> are advised by a History teacher and a town councilwoman.|$|R
50|$|Footworks, {{a nationally}} known dance troupe from New York, {{contacted}} the Dotsons after learning about their mastery of old-time flatfooting style, requesting to come watch him {{in hopes of}} learning some of his moves. The troupe {{of about a dozen}} dancers stayed in the cabin’s bunk loft for three <b>nights.</b> <b>They</b> danced every day and every <b>night</b> while <b>they</b> were visiting the Dotsons, and Robert remained good friends with one of the group's original members.|$|R
5|$|The final rankings {{were based}} on points {{accumulated}} in matches against the other teams in the medal round. Despite the common misconception that the Americans won gold the <b>night</b> <b>they</b> beat the Soviets, this did not occur until February 24 when they defeated Finland 4–2 and finished the tournament undefeated. The Soviets finished with silver; Sweden won the bronze. In 2008, the IIHF picked the Miracle on Ice as the top international hockey story of the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|The flotilla's second {{success was}} the night of 19/20 December 1941, again in the North Sea off the Dutch coast, when two boats engaged two R boats and one E boat. They passed twice at high speed before losing contact, but twice during the <b>night</b> <b>they</b> located them and {{eventually}} carried out depth charge attacks. Both Hichens and {{the commander of the}} other boat received a MID for this action.|$|E
5|$|Their {{collaboration}} proved successful when, on the 3tht {{day at sea}} on the 1976 voyage, Mau stated {{soon they}} would see land, and the next day, Tahiti. A few hours later, they spotted land-based white terns (Gygis alba) followed by a diminution of the trade-wind swell. That <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> spotted Mataiva. After a brief stopover, {{with little more than}} another day's sailing they made landfall at Tahiti where they were welcomed by 17,000 people, half the population of Tahiti.|$|E

5000|$|Three Dog Night {{was based}} around the vocal skills of Danny Hutton, Chuck Negron and Cory Wells. In 1967, Hutton {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a three-vocalist group, and he and Wells enlisted mutual friend Negron. The official commentary included in the CD set Celebrate: The Three Dog Night Story, 1965-1975 states that vocalist Hutton's then-girlfriend June Fairchild suggested the name after reading a magazine article about indigenous Australians, in which it was explained that on cold <b>nights</b> <b>they</b> would customarily sleep in {{a hole in the ground}} whilst embracing a dingo, a native species of wild dog. On colder <b>nights</b> <b>they</b> would sleep with two dogs and if the night was freezing, it was a [...] "three dog night".|$|R

5|$|Wild equines {{may spend}} seven {{hours a day}} sleeping. During the day, they sleep {{standing}} up while at <b>night</b> <b>they</b> lie down. They regularly rub against trees, rocks and other objects and roll in around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. Except the mountain zebra, wild equines can roll over completely.|$|E
5|$|Around midnight 7/8 June, {{during the}} slow voyage across the Channel, a German {{airplane}} hit West Honaker with two skip bombs. Because the ship, already {{prepared for a}} fast sinking for the blockship duties, began taking on water, {{a large portion of}} the crew, including Chief Engineer Poropat, abandoned ship. After drifting in the Channel for most of the rest of the moonless <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> were picked up in the morning by a British trawler and returned to the UK. In the meantime, the master of the ship was able to keep West Honaker in the convoy headed to Utah beach.|$|E
