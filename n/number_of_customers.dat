5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was actually in the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of a reduction in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its offices in Illinois, the company had branch offices in Baltimore, Buffalo, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York City, Omaha, St. Louis, San Francisco and Seattle, all of which closed when Oliver shifted to mail order sales in March 1917. A minor recession in 1921–22 caused a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to default on their payments, resulting in the repossession of their typewriters. The company opted not to borrow money and, in 1926, {{the board of directors}} voted to liquidate the company. Only one employee, Chester Nelson, was retained to oversee the company's liquidation.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Florida {{received}} a federal Major Disaster Declaration on September 12. Franklin, Levy, Manatee, and Pinellas counties—where the storm left 5,000 individuals without work—became eligible for federal aid after President Ronald Reagan visited {{the state and}} determined that residents in those areas would benefit from assistance such as temporary housing, low-interest loans for rebuilding efforts, and monetary grants. Disaster centers were opened in those four counties as centralized locations for federal, state, and volunteer agencies to operate relief programs. President Reagan later included Hillsborough, Wakulla, and Dixie counties, bringing {{the total number of}} Florida counties eligible for federal aid to seven. The deadline for residents of all seven counties to apply for either state or federal assistance was set for November 12. Several major corporations—including Texaco, Exxon, and J.C. Penney—contacted customers in the affected areas and offered to make special arrangements for their monthly payments if they had been financially affected by the storm. While only a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> took advantage of the assistance, the companies' actions were met with highly positive feedback.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} heat {{provided}} to customers is often recorded with a heat meter to encourage conservation and maximize the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> which can be served, but such meters are expensive.

25|$|In 1929–33 {{the economy}} was destabilized by bank failures. The initial reasons were {{substantial}} losses in investment banking, followed by bank runs. Bank runs occurred when a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> lost confidence in their deposits (which were not insured) and rushed to withdraw their deposits. Runs destabilized many banks {{to the point where}} they faced bankruptcy. Between 1929 and 1933 40% of all banks (9,490 out of 23,697 banks) went bankrupt. Much of the Great Depression's economic damage was caused directly by bank runs.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze a tandem {{queueing}} model with two stages. The arrivals to the first stage are Poisson stream and the service time at this stage is exponential. There is no waiting room at first stage. The service time is hyperexponential and no waiting is allowed at second stage. The transition probabilities and loss probabilities of this model are obtained. In addition, the loss probability at second stage is optimized. Performance measures and the variance <b>of</b> the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> <b>of</b> this tandem queueing model are found. It is seen that the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> in first stage and second stage are dependent. Finally we have simulated this queueing model. For different values of parameters, exact values, simulated values, and optimal values of obtained performance measures of this model are numerically shown in tables and graphs...|$|R
40|$|Suppose {{that the}} {{stockout}} cost for a supplier {{is a function}} <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> requests backordered, each request possibly being for several units of stock of a product. The problem arises of computing the expected <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> requests backordered. when techniques are available for computing the expected <b>number</b> <b>of</b> units backordered. A simple conversion factor is desirable. Based on a formal analysis, the conversion factor 1 /E(X) is recommended where E(X) is average size <b>of</b> a <b>customer</b> request. This conclusion is contrary to that reached in previously published research. Analysis is extended to the case where backorder cost is time weighted; i. e., backordered sales are not lost, {{and the cost of}} a backorder depends on the time elapsing before the customer request is finally satisfied. ...|$|R
