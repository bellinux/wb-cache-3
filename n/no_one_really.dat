500|$|The {{government}} decided {{to close a}} number of government libraries without consultation on the closings or the process involved.

[...] This is because no significant effort was made to inventory the material, to determine what should be preserved, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> knows what was discarded.

[...] Spotnitz later said, [...] "I can't say I regret killing them off, as you know, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> dies in The X-Files [...] But I do feel tonally {{it was a mistake to}} end the episode on such a somber note.

According to Mercury vice president Marty Maidenberg, an international tour for the album had been planned by October 1996, with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, but it never materialized.

500|$|Before the {{development}} of Crash Bandicoot, Naughty Dog wanted to do what Sega and Warner Bros. did while designing their respective characters, Sonic the Hedgehog and the Tasmanian Devil, and incorporate an animal that was [...] "cute, real, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> knew about". The team purchased a field guide on Tasmanian mammals and selected the wombat, potoroo, and bandicoot as options. Gavin and Rubin went with [...] "Willie the Wombat" [...] as a temporary name for the starring character of the game. The name {{was never meant to}} be final due both to the name sounding [...] "too dorky" [...] and to the existence of a non-video game property of the same name. The character was effectively a bandicoot by October 1994, but was still referred to as [...] "Willie the Wombat" [...] as a final name had not been formulated yet. It was decided that the main character would be mute because past voices for video game characters were considered to be [...] "lame, negative, and distracted from identification with them." [...] The villain of the game was created while Gavin, Rubin, Baggett, and Cerny were eating [...] "mediocre Italian" [...] near the Universal Interactive Studios lot. Gavin idealized an [...] "evil genius villain with a big head" [...] who was [...] "all about his attitude and his minions". Rubin, having become fond of the animated television series Pinky and the Brain, imagined a [...] "more malevolent Brain" [...] with minions resembling the weasel characters in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. After Gavin performed a [...] "silly villain voice" [...] depicting the attitude in mind for the character, the villain's name, Doctor Neo Cortex, was instantly formulated.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} reasons Naughty Dog chose to develop Crash Bandicoot (at the time jokingly codenamed [...] "Sonic's Ass Game") for the Sony PlayStation was Sony's lack of an {{existing}} mascot character that could compete with Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Mario. By this time video game mascots were seen as increasingly unimportant, since they were overshadowed by cross-licensing and the aging games market meant most gamers were too old to find mascots appealing, but Sony were nonetheless interested in covering all bases. Naughty Dog desired to do what Sega and Warner Bros. did with the hedgehog (Sonic) and the Tasmanian devil (Taz) respectively and incorporate an animal that was [...] "cute, real, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> knew about".

Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin went with [...] "Willie the Wombat" [...] as a temporary name for the starring character of the game. The name was never meant to be final, due both to the name sounding [...] "too dorky" [...] and to the existence of a non-video game property of the same name. The character was effectively a bandicoot by October 1994, but was still referred to as [...] "Willie the Wombat" [...] because a final name had not been formulated yet. Wanting their mascot game to be multi-dimensional in character depth as well as gameplay, Gavin and Rubin chose not to base Willie around one attribute such as [...] "fast" [...] or [...] "cute". The team felt that Willie should be [...] "goofy and fun-loving, and never talk"; the character's muteness was based on the theory that voices for video game characters were always [...] "lame, negative, and distracted from identification with them." ...|$|E
