5|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{recorded}} primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria.

Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has <b>no</b> <b>central</b> theme and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E

5|$|Although Somalia has had <b>no</b> <b>central</b> {{monetary}} authority for upwards of 15 {{years between the}} outbreak of the civil war in 1991 and the subsequent re-establishment of the Central Bank of Somalia in 2009, the nation's payment system is actually fairly advanced due primarily to the widespread existence of private money transfer operators (MTO) that have acted as informal banking networks.|$|E
5|$|Rome had <b>no</b> <b>central</b> bank, and {{regulation}} of the banking system was minimal. Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers' deposits. A typical bank had fairly limited capital, and often only one principal, though a bank might {{have as many as}} six to fifteen principals. Seneca assumes that anyone involved in commerce needs access to credit.|$|E

They are {{distributed}} evenly around Ida, {{except for a}} protrusion north of crater Choukoutien which is smoother and less cratered. The ejecta excavated by impacts is deposited differently on Ida than on planets because of its rapid rotation, low gravity and irregular shape. Ejecta blankets settle asymmetrically around their craters, but fast-moving ejecta that escapes from the asteroid is permanently lost.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace (1975) applied {{rational}} expectations to models with Phillips curve trade-offs between inflation and output {{and found that}} monetary policy {{could not be used}} to systematically stabilize the economy. Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that economic agents would anticipate inflation and adjust to higher price levels before the influx of monetary stimulus could boost employment and output. Only unanticipated monetary policy could increase employment, and <b>no</b> <b>central</b> bank could systematically use monetary policy for expansion without economic agents catching on and anticipating price changes before they could have a stimulative impact.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{came to the}} Kingdom of Hungary {{upon the}} {{invitation}} of an influential Croatian lord, Paul Šubić, in August 1300. AndrewIII died on 14January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305. Because it had <b>no</b> <b>central</b> government, the Kingdom of Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful nobleman, or oligarch. One of those oligarchs, Ladislaus Kán, captured and imprisoned Otto of Bavaria in 1307. Charles was elected king in Pest on 27November 1308, but his rule remained nominal {{in most parts of}} his kingdom even after he was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27August 1310.|$|E
5|$|Each town in {{the colony}} was {{considered}} a single church congregation; in later years, {{some of the larger}} towns split into two or three congregations. Church attendance was mandatory for all residents of the colony, while church membership was restricted to those who had converted to the faith. In Plymouth Colony, it seems that a simple profession of faith was all that was required for acceptance. This was a more liberal doctrine than some other New England congregations, such as those of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where it was common to subject those seeking formal membership to strict and detailed cross-examinations. There was <b>no</b> <b>central</b> governing body for the churches. Each individual congregation was left to determine its own standards of membership, hire its own ministers, and conduct its own business.|$|E

5|$|Explicit {{goals of}} {{financial}} regulation include countries' pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors. A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, deposit insurance, emergency financing through discount windows, standard accounting practices, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, <b>no</b> <b>central</b> political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated {{to establish a}} host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecture. Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as national governments and intergovernmental organizations {{have the capacity to}} influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.|$|E
5|$|For Alderson {{the battle}} {{had been a}} failure: {{although}} his troops had held, he had found himself {{out of touch with}} the front line and unable to get accurate information about the situation. At one stage he had been commanding 33 battalions across several miles of front line with <b>no</b> <b>central</b> co-ordination and great confusion between his distant headquarters and the trenches. In addition to his personal failings however, the Ross rifles had proven almost useless in battle and some of Alderson's officer corps had performed poorly. In particular Brigadier-General Richard Turner, commander of the 3rd Brigade, and Turner's brigade-major, Colonel Garnet Hughes, the son of Sam Hughes, caused much havoc when on the second day of the battle, they unilaterally withdrew the 3rd Brigade from the front line, opening up a 4,000-yard gap through which the Germans threatened the entire Ypres Salient. Colonel John Carson however, who reported personally to Hughes, downplayed the difficulties and blamed the heavy casualties on Alderson's leadership, indicating that the division had only been saved from annihilation by the actions of Turner and Hughes.|$|E
5|$|Framlingham Castle is {{a castle}} {{in the market}} town of Framlingham in Suffolk in England. An early motte and bailey or ringwork Norman castle {{was built on the}} Framlingham site by 1148, but this was {{destroyed}} by Henry II of England {{in the aftermath of the}} revolt of 1173–4. Its replacement, constructed by Roger Bigod, the Earl of Norfolk, was unusual for the time in having <b>no</b> <b>central</b> keep, but instead using a curtain wall with thirteen mural towers to defend the centre of the castle. Despite this, the castle was successfully taken by King John in 1216 after a short siege. By the end of the 13th century, Framlingham had become a luxurious home, surrounded by extensive parkland used for hunting.|$|E
50|$|The {{constituency}} {{was created}} for the 1918 general election, as one of two divisions of the Parliamentary County of Stirling and Clackmannan. It was then defined as the Central and Western County Districts of the County of Stirling including all burghs within their boundaries, save for the Burgh of Stirling. From 1950 onwards, due to local government changes, it {{was defined as the}} Burghs of Bridge of Allan, Denny and Dunipace and the <b>Central</b> <b>No.</b> 1, <b>Central</b> <b>No.</b> 2, Western No. 1, Western No. 2 and Western No. 3 Districts of the County of Stirling.|$|R

5|$|Most Doctor Who episodes {{were made}} on two-inch {{videotape}} for initial broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation. Enterprises used 16mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not. The BBC had <b>no</b> <b>central</b> archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes {{that had been made}} on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little dedicated storage space, and tended to place piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.|$|E
5|$|Somalia, from 1991 to 2006, {{is cited}} as a {{real-world}} example of a stateless society and legal system. Since the fall of Siad Barre's government in January 1991, there had been <b>no</b> <b>central</b> government in Somalia until {{the establishment of the}} Transitional National Government and its successor the Transitional Federal Government. Large areas of the country such as Puntland, Somaliland and Galmudug were internationally unrecognized and administered as autonomous regions of Somalia. The remaining areas, including the capital Mogadishu, were divided into smaller territories ruled by competing faction leaders. In many areas, there were no formal regulations or licensing requirements for businesses and individuals.|$|E
5|$|The De Beatis description, only rediscovered by Steppe in the 1960s, cast {{new light}} on the {{commissioning}} of a work that was previously thoughtsince it has <b>no</b> <b>central</b> religious imageto be an atypical altarpiece. Many Netherlandish diptychs intended for private use are known, and even a few triptychs, but the Bosch panels are unusually large compared with these and contain no donor portraits. Possibly they were commissioned to celebrate a wedding, as large Italian paintings for private houses frequently were. Nevertheless, The Gardens bold depictions do not rule out a church commission, such was the contemporaneous fervor to warn against immorality. In 1566, the triptych served as the model for a tapestry that hangs at El Escorial monastery near Madrid.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} kingdoms fluctuated between Western and Eastern Han, {{but there were}} never fewer than eight nor greater than twenty-five. In the early Western Han, the kingdoms {{accounted}} for approximately two-thirds of the empire. The imperial court ruled over the commanderies located in the western third of the empire, while kings ruled their fiefs with little or <b>no</b> <b>central</b> government intervention. The administrative staffs of each kingdom paralleled the model of central government, as each kingdom had a Grand Tutor (ranked 2000–dan), Chancellor (2,000-dan), and Imperial Secretary (2,000-dan). No kingdom was allowed to have a Grand Commandant, since they {{were not allowed to}} initiate war campaigns on their own behalf. Although the kingdoms' Chancellors were appointed by the imperial court, the king had the right to appoint all other officials in his fief.|$|E
5|$|Various {{different}} {{mechanisms for}} commissioning {{the construction of}} war memorials emerged during the inter-war period. In most of the nations involved in the conflict, the memorials erected in towns and cities were usually commissioned by local community leaders and other civic groups, with relatively little or <b>no</b> <b>central</b> state involvement. Some national organisations emerged, including the British War Memorials Committee and the Canadian War Memorials Fund, but these focused on narrow, limited projects, {{rather than trying to}} coordinate a national response. The local processes and committees could result in multiple memorials being created for the same community or event: the site of Verdun was commemorated by three different memorials, for example, while some British towns saw rival memorials created by competing groups in the community.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, when the Spanish {{discovered}} the Yucatán Peninsula, {{the region was}} still dominated by the Maya civilization. It was divided {{into a number of}} independent provinces referred to as kuchkabal (plural kuchkabaloob) in the Yucatec Maya language. The various provinces shared a common culture but the internal sociopolitical organisation varied from one province to the next, as did access to important resources. These differences in political and economic makeup often led to hostilities between the provinces. The politically fragmented state of the Yucatán Peninsula at the time of conquest hindered the Spanish invasion, since there was <b>no</b> <b>central</b> political authority to be overthrown. However, the Spanish were also able to exploit this fragmentation by taking advantage of pre-existing rivalries between polities. Estimates of the number of kuchkabal in the northern Yucatán vary from sixteen to twenty-four. The boundaries between polities were not stable, being subject to the effects of alliances and wars; those kuchkabaloob with more centralised forms of government were likely to have had more stable boundaries than those of loose confederations of provinces. When the Spanish discovered Yucatán, the provinces of Mani and Sotuta were two of the most important polities in the region. They were mutually hostile; the Xiu Maya of Mani allied themselves with the Spanish, while the Cocom Maya of Sotuta became the implacable enemies of the European colonisers.|$|E
