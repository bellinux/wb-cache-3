5|$|<b>Night</b> <b>falls,</b> and Captain Magenta detects {{an unusual}} signal in the Cloudbase Radar Room. Rhapsody Angel is {{launched}} {{to investigate and}} finds that the readings are emanating from a spinning Mysteron spacecraft, which obliterates her interceptor in mid-air. To prevent civilian casualties on the ground, Cloudbase is moved into Himalayan airspace on its horizontal thrusters, while its personnel prepare for the inevitable final confrontation. When more spacecraft appear on the radar, Captain Scarlet volunteers to challenge the Mysterons in Destiny's place, but crash-lands on the Cloudbase flight deck after his interceptor is damaged.|$|E

5|$|During {{the hunting}} trip, Jimbo proclaims Kenny his honorary nephew, {{upsetting}} Stan. When <b>night</b> <b>falls,</b> Cartman {{tells the story}} of Scuzzlebutt, a creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of its hands and Patrick Duffy for a leg. The boys are skeptical, so Cartman decides to dress up as the creature the next morning in order to convince and scare them. When he disappears the next morning, the others set out to find him. They then see Cartman disguised as Scuzzlebutt and start shooting at him. When they catch up with Cartman {{at the base of the}} mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes. However, he is unable to do so and the delay gives Cartman time to remove the costume.

5|$|Schmitt {{arrived at}} dusk, {{and the action}} {{continued}} well after dark; in mid-November <b>night</b> <b>falls</b> at close to 17:00 in the upper Danube climes. Despite the darkness, Schmitt descended out of the defiles and deployed his troops to assail Dupont's flank. As his Russians entered the fray, they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians. With the additional force, the French were overwhelmed, {{but most of the}} shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from foe in the dark. Under the cover of darkness, aided by a waning moon, Mortier used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank. The French and Russians continued to skirmish fitfully into the night as sentries encountered one another in the dark. Portions of Gazan's force provided any necessary rear guard action, and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the Danube, while they maintained possession of only Spitz and Weissenkirchen on the north bank.|$|E
5|$|They {{climb up}} and {{eventually}} reach a small abandoned house. While there, {{the man is}} attacked by a big cat, which the woman strikes away {{with a piece of}} wood. The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. Deciding that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain, where they see a structure, would be a better medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As <b>night</b> <b>falls,</b> they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people.|$|E

5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before <b>Night</b> <b>Falls).</b>|$|E
