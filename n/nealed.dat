60|$|Others {{of these}} Drops I heat red {{hot in the}} fire, and then {{suffered}} them to cool by degrees. And these I found to have quite lost all their fulminating or flying quality, as also their hard, brittle and springy texture; and to emerge of a much softer temper, and much easier to be broken or snapt with ones finger; but its strong and brittle quality was quite destroyed, and it seemed {{much of the same}} consistence with other green Glass well <b>nealed</b> in the Oven.|$|E
60|$|And {{this will}} make {{probable}} my next Position, That {{the parts of the}} Glass are under a kind of tension or flexure, out of which they indeavour to extricate and free themselves, and thereby all the parts draw towards the Center or middle, and would, if the outward parts would give way, as they do when the outward parts cool leisurely (as in baking of Glasses) contract the bulk of the drop into a much less compass. For since, as I proved before, the Internal parts of the drop, when fluid, were of a very rarified Texture, and, as it were, tos'd open like a Lock of Wool, and if they were suffered leisurely to cool, would be again prest, as it were, close together: And since that the heat, which kept them bended and open, is removed, and yet the parts not suffered to get as neer together as they naturally would; It follows, that the Particles remain under a kind of tension and flexure, and consequently have an indeavour to free themselves from that bending and distension, which they do, as soon as either the tip be broken, or as soon as by a leisurely heating and cooling, the parts are <b>nealed</b> into another posture.|$|E
60|$|The {{texture of}} Muscovy Glass; its Figures: what other Bodies are like it: that it {{exhibits}} several colours, and how: several Observations and Experiments about those colours: {{the reason why}} on this occasion the nature of colours is inquir'd into. A conjecture at the reason of these colours explicated by several Experiments and Reasons: First, by continual cleaving the Body till it become colour'd. Secondly, by producing all kinds of colours with two flat Plates of Glass. Thirdly, by blowing Glass so thin in the Lamp, till it produce the same effect. Fourthly, by doing the same with Bubbles of divers other transparent Bodies: the reasons of the colours on <b>nealed</b> Steel, where {{by the way the}} causes of the hardning and tempering of Steel, endeavour'd to be shewn and explicated by several Reasons and Experiments: the reason of the colours on Lead, Brass, Copper, Silver, &c. other Instances of such colour'd bodies in animal substances: several other distinguishing Observations. Des Cartes Hypothesis of Colours examin'd. An Hypothesis for the explication of light by motion, indeavoured to be explicated and determined by several Reasons and Experiments: three distinguishing Properties of the motion of light. The distinguishing Properties of a trasparent Medium [that {{there seems to be no}} Experiment that proves the Instantaneous motion of light] the manner of the propagation of light through them. Of the homogeniety and heterogeniety of transparent Mediums, and what effects they cause on the Rayes of light, explicated by a Figure: an Examination of the refraction of the Rays by a plain Surface, which causes Colours. An Examination of the like effects produced by a spherical Surface: the use that may be made of these Experiments, for the examination of several Hypotheses of Colours. Des Cartes Hypothesis examin'd. Some Difficulties taken notice of in it. What seems most likely to be the cause of colour: that propriety is indeavoured to be shewn in a Glass ball: that the reflection is not necessary to produce Colours nor a double refraction: the Hypothesis further examined, both in the pellucid Medium and in the Eye. The definitions of Colours; and a further explication and examination of the Proprieties of laminated Bodies; by what means they conduce to the production of Colours.|$|E

Three different base materials are compared conventional boron-doped Cz-Si, gallium-doped Cz-Si and boron-doped magnetically cast Cz-Si (mCz-Si). Stencil printing is applied for front contact formation resulting in increased aspect ratio and finger homogeneity and thus low series resistance losses. Regarding material consumption, the presented cells allow for a reduction of silver usage by 30 %.

40|$|High quality superconducting {{films of}} YBa 2 Cu 307 _x were {{deposited}} insitu using single target 90 ° off-axis puttering. We have investigated their superconducting DC and RF properties, their normal state properties, and their microstructures. These films are distinctly different from bulk crystals and post-deposition a <b>nealed</b> films. Sharp superconducting transition temperatures can be reproducibly obtained by control of deposition parameters. The Tc can be varied from 75 to 89 K. The optimization ofprop-erties other than Tc {{and the control}} of film texture occur under conditions different from those for which the highest Tc is obtained. Normal state conductivities are as high as or {{higher than those of}} single crystals. Critical current densities reach 6 × 107 A/cm 2 at 4. 2 K. All the above properties are relatively insensitive tocompositional variations. The Tc's have a much weaker dependence on the c-axis lattice parameters than do those of bulk samples. The measured low-temperature penetration depth is 1400, ~ and surface resistance at 4. 2 K and 10 GHz is as low as 16 ~tfl.
