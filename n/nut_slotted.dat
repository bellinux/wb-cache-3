5000|$|A {{castellated}} nut, {{also called}} a castle <b>nut</b> or <b>slotted</b> <b>nut,</b> is a <b>nut</b> with <b>slots</b> (notches) cut into one end. [...] The {{name comes from}} the nut’s resemblance to the crenellated parapet of a medieval castle.|$|R
5000|$|Some guitars have {{a rolling}} nut. In this design, made popular by the Fender company, the strings sit on roller {{bearings}} instead of <b>nut</b> <b>slots.</b> The rollers let the string freely slide or roll through the nut. The roller nut {{helps keep the}} guitar in tune by preventing the strings from getting stuck in the nut.|$|R
50|$|The System II tremolo {{system was}} {{designed}} by John Page, Chip Todd and Charlie Gressett.The System III tremolo system {{was designed by}} John Page, Dan Smith, Charlie Gressett and John Carruthers. The System I, II and III tremolo systems were manufactured in Germany by Schaller.Sometimes parts of the tremolo system are lost and one common modification {{is to make the}} bridge function as a hardtail by locking the bridge into a non movable position and installing a string tree for the first and second strings so that the strings don't slip out of the <b>nut</b> <b>slots.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} nut made {{of relatively}} soft plastic or bone will easily clamp the string and make fine tuning difficult. The clamping effect does not only result from too narrow <b>nut</b> <b>slots,</b> but notably {{more from the}} impression of the string windings into the nut material {{at the bottom of}} the slot. That effect is more prevalent with wire wound nylon strings than with steel strings. Using a zero fret relieves the pressure from the nut material and the nut serves only to center the strings sideways. Tuning is smooth and without sudden movement and intonation jumps. There are only a few manufacturers making metal (bronze)conventional nuts which avoid the string clamping effect.|$|R
5000|$|GA {{split beam}} nut, {{also known as}} a split hex <b>nut</b> or <b>slotted</b> beam <b>nut,</b> is a locknut with slots cut in the top that {{separate}} the outside end into two or more sections that are bent slightly inward, making the thread diameter undersized in the slotted portion. As the nut is threaded on, these sections are forced back out to their original position and increase the friction between the nut and the fastener, creating the locking action.|$|R
50|$|It {{was already}} {{announced}} by GMA {{that a new}} comedy talk show, Cool Center, would be occupying <b>Nuts</b> Entertainments time <b>slot</b> starting in February, with Anjo Yllana hosting. The network {{was looking for a}} female host to co-star with Yllana {{who turned out to be}} Eugene Domingo.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{chainring}} bolt. These {{are used}} in various lengths both to join rings and to fasten the assembly to the spider of the crank. While some have recessed hex fittings in both screw and nut, some like this have a <b>slotted</b> <b>nut</b> that {{requires the use of}} a special tool.|$|R
5000|$|KeyMod is an {{open-source}} design released for use {{and distribution}} {{in the public domain}} in an effort to standardize universal attachment systems in the firearm accessories market. The KeyMod system is intended {{to be used as a}} direct attachment method for firearm accessories such as flash light mounts, laser modules, sights, scope mounts, vertical grips, rail panels, hand stops, barricade supports, and many others. The goal is to eliminate the need for the rail to be fully outfitted with 1913 rails covering the entire handguard. The KeyMod system allows you to place MIL-STD-1913 rails wherever needed (even in the 45° positions at times). The KeyMod system consists of two parts: the KeyMod slot and the KeyMod <b>nut.</b> The <b>slot</b> is distinctive with a larger diameter through-hole combined with a narrow slot. The slot is chambered on the backside while the through hole is sized for clearance of a quick-detach sling swivel (approximately 3/8" [...] diameter).|$|R
50|$|The nut is stepped and {{the larger}} {{diameter}} end is chamfered around 270 degrees of its diameter. The angled face created is meant to interface with the chamfer on the backside of the KeyMod slot. The full diameter is left intact to create two flats on the nut which align the <b>nut</b> to the <b>slot,</b> {{and allow it to}} be indexed to the accessory {{as well as to the}} KeyMod slot. This eliminates the need to align the nuts to the holes prior to accessory installation as well as the need for tools to tighten the screw/nut. In most accessories, the screw is swaged after assembly to ensure that it cannot be backed out of the nut. This prevents loss of small parts (screws, nuts or other small parts used in the assembly of the accessory). The spacing of the holes is critical and is based on MIL-STD-1913 spacing to allow the greatest modularity with existing accessories.|$|R
50|$|An {{ordinary}} guitar, either electric or acoustic, can be {{used for}} playing slide. Often, the strings are raised a little higher off the fingerboard than they would be for conventional guitar playing—especially if the player isn't going to use the free fingers for fretting. An extension nut may be used to achieve the higher string height at the peghead end of the fingerboard. This is just a normal <b>nut,</b> with the <b>slots</b> filed less deeply, and often in a straight line rather than following the radius of the fretboard.The lap steel and the pedal steel are guitars that have evolved especially for playing slide in the horizontal position. Resophonic or resonator guitars have often been employed for slide playing, typically held horizontally. They are sometimes known as Dobros after the Dopyera brothers, whose company first made them. National is another brand. In resonator guitars, rather than the sound being produced by the body's hollow, a special bridge transfers the vibrations from the strings to a metal cone placed inside the body.|$|R
