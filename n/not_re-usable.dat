50|$|Ballistic gels {{made from}} natural gelatin are {{typically}} clear yellow-brown in color, and are generally <b>not</b> <b>re-usable.</b> The more expensive synthetic substitutes are engineered {{to simulate the}} ballistic properties of natural gelatin, whilst initially being colorless and clear. Some synthetic gels are also re-usable, since they can be melted and reformed without affecting the ballistic properties of the gels.|$|E
5000|$|Stargate SG-1 {{has several}} regular directors. Andy Mikita {{is known to}} shoot much {{coverage}} because he likes having the choices during cut-and-edit. Peter DeLuise, however, lets the cameras roll, which makes things {{more difficult for the}} script supervisor and the editors later. The video tapes are <b>not</b> <b>re-usable</b> and are archived in a library. [...] "Lockdown" [...] was the first SG-1 episode to be shot in high definition (HD) instead of on 35 mm film. Since no one was used to filming in HD, they had to get a new HD crew and lost about an hour per day. The HD video tapes cost around 50 dollars, and previously 7000 feet of film were shot each day, costing possibly {{a million dollars a year}} in film.|$|E
50|$|A {{master link}} or {{quick-release}} link is {{a roller chain}} accessory that allows convenient connection and disconnection of a chain {{without the need for}} a chain tool. It acts as a set of the chain's outer plates, so joining two sets of the chain's inner plate ends. Such master links may or may <b>not</b> be <b>re-usable.</b> A chain tool is nonetheless needed to adjust a chain's length, for example to shorten a new chain before connecting its ends. They are used on bicycles and motorcycles.|$|R

30|$|The Biella {{district}} has {{been suffering from}} a deep crisis {{since at least the}} Seventies. The situation worsened in 2008, when production, number of workers and enterprises halved. However, the textile {{district has}} recently recovered a positive trend. What has been lost and has remained on the territory is an enormous quantity of abandoned or disused industrial space. In Vallemosso the desolation is boundless: kilometers of desolate factories and a huge quantity of covered, almost always high-quality empty spaces which have lost their use value. Most of these spaces are <b>not</b> currently <b>re-usable.</b> Society has reacted with weak initiatives by welfare associations, bottom-up actions and minor projects, hoping for an unlikely massive return of productivity. The production of the industrial district, which has been the backbone of Biella’s development, has now become completely detached from the territory generating it (Cerruti But 2014, 2015; Ccia 2016).|$|R
50|$|Film has {{a number}} of {{disadvantages}} as a scientific detector: it is difficult to calibrate for photometry, it is <b>not</b> <b>re-usable,</b> it requires careful handling (including temperature and humidity control) for best calibration, and the film must physically be returned to the laboratory and processed. Against this, photographic film can be made with a higher spatial resolution than any other type of imaging detector, and, because of its logarithmic response to light, has a wider dynamic range than most digital detectors. For example, Agfa 10E56 holographic film has a resolution of over 4,000 lines/mm—equivalent to a pixel size of 0.125 micrometers—and an active dynamic range of over five orders of magnitude in brightness, compared to typical scientific CCDs that might have pixels of about 10 micrometers and a dynamic range of 3-4 orders of magnitude.|$|E
50|$|Unregulated e-waste {{processing}} junkyards do {{not contain}} proper equipment or employ safety precautions. The primary dismantling process generally includes manual separation of the plastic sections {{from the rest of}} the device; the plastic sections are then shredded into small portions if <b>not</b> <b>re-usable</b> themselves. If these plastic fragments are not directly resold to larger companies, they are further broken down into a fine powder. When this process is poorly regulated, the powder is easily inhaled and absorbed into the soil, air, and surrounding vegetation. The electronic devices are also stripped of their heavy metal components; this process in turn exposes workers to the raw elements of the metals. In addition to manually dismantling the devices, unregulated junkyards are ultimate disposal sites. Device disposal is mainly done by burning or smashing and burying the fragments; the aftermath of which has been documented to cause significant health problems in the surrounding area.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{robotics}} has seen tremendous increase in complexity {{and variety of}} applications. The key area in the robots seeing rapid evolution is the software. However, usually the software developed for robots has been limited to a specific application and/or a specific hardware. Unfortunately most of the software developed for robotic applications are <b>not</b> easily <b>re-usable</b> in another project. Very little effort {{has been done to}} tackle this issue and the software is developed on an ad-hoc basis. In this work, a framework for developing sensor fusion software is proposed that is based on practices of model-driven engineering. A small domain-specific language is developed that effectively hides the lower level implementation details and makes the software development more structured and easier to re-use. It is also discussed how graphical models can be used as computational framework for performing the statistical inference in filtering problems. It is shown how a simple estimation problem can be solved using graphical models...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Agent {{technologies}} {{are now being}} applied {{to the development of}} large-scale commercial and industrial software systems. Such systems are complex, involving hundreds, perhaps thousands of agents, and there is a pressing need for system modelling techniques that permit their complexity to be e ectively managed, and principled methodologies to guide the process of system design. Without adequate techniques to support the design process, such systems will not be su ciently reliable, maintainable or extensible, will be di cult to comprehend, and their elements will <b>not</b> be <b>re-usable.</b> In this paper, we present techniques for modelling agents and multi-agent systems which adapt and extend existing Object-Oriented representation techniques, and a methodology which provides a clear conceptual framework to guide system design and speci cation. We have developed these techniques for systems of agents based upon a particular Belief-Desire-Intention architecture, but have soughttoprovide a framework for the description of agent systems that is su ciently general to be applicable to other agent architectures, and which may be extended in various ways. ...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{trials are}} used as medical {{evidence}} for clinicians or medical decision makers to support the treatment decisions and improve patient care. To have reliable evidence to inform their decisions, they should perform a systematic review of the medical literature in order to summarize and analyze the available clinical trials in a systematic way. However, the clinical trials are scattered to different information systems such as abstract databases and clinical trials registries which are not interoperated to each other. Due to poor data structure in those systems, the clinical trials are <b>not</b> accessible or <b>re-usable</b> in an automatic way. As a result, the process for systematic review is time consuming and error prone due to much manual work in literature searches and screening activities. To solve these problems, we propose {{the design of a}} new system by using the pattern-based software architecture approach in order to support the process of systematic review in an efficient way. As a result, the new system enables the accessibility and re-usability of clinical trials from different sources in a single point of view. Therefore, the pattern-based design increases the efficiency of systematic review by removing manual work in literature searching and screening activities. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Several methodologies and {{techniques}} are currently available {{so as to}} dissipate energy in engineering systems; {{most of them are}} either <b>not</b> <b>re-usable,</b> or complex in mechanism. This paper introduces an innovative re-usable energy absorption device, based upon the working principles of Equal Channel Angular Extrusion, and known as UREAD (Universal Re-usable Energy Absorption Device). This study compares the behaviour of different “low-density ” deformable materials (a range of silicon rubber grades) inserted in a UREAD unit and loaded under impact condition. The energy absorbed was experimentally measured and compared against the impact energy. It was possible to dissipate levels as high as 74. 91 % of the impact energy when using a simple set-up, and the device re-usability was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Much {{scientific}} research {{is based on}} the gathering and analysis of measurement data. Scientific data-sets are, at least, intermediate results in many {{scientific research}} projects. For some time data-sets weren’t even published and even if they were published it was mostly as a (<b>not</b> <b>re-usable)</b> by-product of the publication. But an interesting phenomenon might be observed here: data-sets (often in combination with models and parameters) are becoming more important themselves and can sometimes be seen as the primary intellectual output of the research. Publishing and preserving data-sets should therefore seriously be considered. This will especially be the case if the data cannot be reproduced (as they result from unique events) and will be necessary in the future for longitudinal research or to test or check future insights.

40|$|Most {{engineering}} products {{are designed to}} either deliver or withstand a specific maximum force or level of energy. It is important however that {{the design of a}} struct ure or a machine incorporates an external or internal mechanism to overcome excessive loading, so as to reduce human discomfort and unsafe operations. Most high-energy absorption devices are <b>not</b> <b>re-usable</b> and have rebound forces comparable to those that being absorbed. This paper examines the validity of a new concept which has been implemented into a Universal Re-usable Energy Absorption Device ? ?UREAD?. The process uses a passageway of a constant cross sec tion. Experiment s were applied to devices of a single 90 -degrees passageway that is constructed from intersecting cha nnels. The experiments were carried out using different materials and di fferent channel dimensions. Th e results showed a typical patt ern of deformation that is associated with a continuous in tense shearing with a regular force displacement diagram. Patterns of deformation zones were investigated by the Finite Element Analysis(FEA), and th e predictions showed a yielding process that is dominated by shearing zones...|$|E
40|$|The study {{seeks to}} know the factors {{affecting}} {{the use of the}} re-usable plastic crates by farmers and merchants in three (3) Local Government areas namely Kumbosto, Kura and Nassarawa of Kano State, Nigeria. Data was collected through the use of structured questionnaire. One hundred and fifty (150) respondents were randomly selected and sampled for the study. Investigative Survey Research Approach (ISRA) and descriptive statistics were used in analysing data. The study found out these reasons why the respondents are <b>not</b> using the <b>re-usable</b> plastic crate among others; the crate were expensive even when they were available (100 %), the crates are not readily available but palm baskets, jute and polythene bags are (91 %), the crate is not a unit of measure commensurate with the measure of traditional packaging’s (65 %), it is difficult changing old habits (18 %), there is very low knowledge about the existence of the crate (11 %), and finally, lack of contacts with extension agents to push {{for the use of the}} plastic crate is seen as a culprit for non- use of the crate (9 %). It was recommended that the plastic crate be made available at a highly subsidized cost, plastic manufacturing companies should be given incentives to start production, or better still the government be involved in its production. Plastic manufacturing companies and the government should produce crates that would be commensurate in measurement with the traditional packagings. Finally, extension bodies should be involved in a massive enlightenment campaign in all ramification to make the crate and its’ advantages be known over traditional packagings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Synchronous {{programs}} {{were introduced to}} sim-plify the development of reactive systems hiding the complexity and indeterminism of the interleaving while taking full ad-vantage of possible concurrency. The introduction of commu-nication networks enabled the creation of distributed systems presenting the programmer with a new burden of interleaving and non determinism due to the asynchronous communication medium. Again this complexity should be hidden from the user while taking {{full advantage of the}} possible concurrency to improve performance. Many algorithms for the automatic distributions of synchronous programs have been proposed so far, but they are not suitable for large scale system because they do not preserve the compositionality of the original code: the modularity of the synchronous program is lost. As a result the subsystems are <b>not</b> <b>re-usable</b> and a small local change results in the recompilation and re-distribution of the overall system. This solution is cumbersome and unpractical in many real-world applications. In this paper we introduce an algorithm for the distribution of synchronous programs that preserves the modularity and allows separate compilation and subsystem re-use. I...|$|E
40|$|Post-stroke {{patients}} and {{people suffering from}} hand diseases often need rehabilitation therapy. The recovery of original skills, when possible, {{is closely related to}} the frequency, quality, and duration of rehabilitative therapy. Rehabilitation gloves are tools used both to facilitate rehabilitation and to control improvements by an evaluation system. Mechanical gloves have high cost, are often cumbersome, are <b>not</b> <b>re-usable</b> and, hence, not usable with the healthy hand to collect patient-specific hand mobility information to which rehabilitation should tend. The approach we propose is the virtual glove, a system that, unlike tools based on mechanical haptic interfaces, uses a set of video cameras surrounding the patient hand to collect a set of synchronized videos used to track hand movements. The hand tracking is associated with a numerical hand model that is used to calculate physical, geometrical and mechanical parameters, and to implement some boundary constraints such as joint dimensions, shape, joint angles, and so on. Besides being accurate, the proposed system is aimed to be low cost, not bulky (touch-less), easy to use, and re-usable. Previous works described the virtual glove general concepts, the hand model, and its characterization including system calibration strategy. The present paper provides the virtual glove overall design, both in real-time and in off-line modalities. In particular, the real-time modality is described and implemented and a marker-based hand tracking algorithm, including a marker positioning, coloring, labeling, detection and classification strategy, is presented for the off-line modality. Moreover, model based hand tracking experimental measurements are reported, discussed and compared with the corresponding poses of the real hand. An error estimation strategy is also presented and used for the collected measurements. System limitations and future work for system improvement are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Statistical {{data about}} cities, regions and at country level is {{collected}} for various purposes and from various institutions. Yet, while access to high quality and recent such data is crucial both for decision makers {{as well as}} for the public, all to often such collections of data remain isolated and <b>not</b> <b>re-usable,</b> let alone properly integrated. In this paper we present the Open City Data Pipeline, a focused attempt to collect, integrate, and enrich statistical data collected at city level worldwide, and republish this data in a reusable manner as Linked Data. The main feature of the Open City Data Pipeline are: (i) we integrate and cleanse data from several sources in a modular and extensible, always up-to-date fashion; (ii) we use both Machine Learning techniques as well as ontological reasoning over equational background knowledge to enrich the data by imputing missing values, (iii) we assess the estimated accuracy of such imputations per indicator. Additionally, (iv) we make the integrated and enriched data available both in a we browser interface and as machine-readable Linked Data, using standard vocabularies such as QB and PROV, and linking to e. g. DBpedia. Lastly, in an exhaustive evaluation of our approach, we compare our enrichment and cleansing techniques to a preliminary version of the Open City Data Pipeline presented at ISWC 2015 : firstly, we demonstrate that the combination of equational knowledge and standard machine learning techniques significantly helps to improve the quality of our missing value imputations; secondly, we arguable show that the more data we integrate, the more reliable our predictions become. Hence, over time, the Open City Data Pipeline shall provide a sustainable effort to serve Linked Data about cities in increasing quality.
