25|$|Catherine's {{family history}} is delved into {{in this first}} season, as her mother's unsolved murder has preyed on her mind for nine years. Catherine {{witnessed}} her mother {{shot and killed by}} two hitmen who were then killed by Vincent. Catherine refused to believe the official police report that her mother's death was that of carjacking gone wrong since the men who killed her mother suddenly appeared and began shooting without saying a word, as well as that the two dead killers identities were never found in any police record, leading Catherine to believe that her mother's killing was that of a government conspiracy. It was later revealed that Catherine's mother worked for Muirfield, conducting the experiments, and ultimately helped turn Vincent into a beast. Catherine must deal with conflicted feelings of her mother's memory across this season, having been determined to solve her case for all this time. When Catherine watches her father get run over in the season finale, she then learns that, biologically, he was <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> father after all.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor and Rose reminisce {{about their}} travels {{in front of}} Mickey, who feels left out. Suddenly the TARDIS is jolted and comes to a sudden stop. The Doctor tells them they have fallen out of the time vortex and that the TARDIS's power cell is dead. The Doctor fears they are trapped in the Void, but Mickey opens the TARDIS doors {{to see that they}} are in London. Heading outside to look, they quickly realise that they are in London on a {{parallel}} Earth. The Doctor finds a small power cell in the TARDIS that still works, and he energises it with some of his own lifeforce. The cell needs time to recharge, so they decide to explore the alternate world. Rose is shocked to see a billboard with her father's picture on it, and the Doctor warns her not to seek him out because he is <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> father. Mickey decides to head off on his own and try to find his grandmother, who died in his universe. The Doctor and Rose discover that most of the population of London wear EarPod devices that feed information directly into the wearer's brain.|$|E
25|$|Queen-regent Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont and Queen Wilhelmina {{were able}} to recover much of the popular support lost under William III. They {{successfully}} changed {{the role of the}} royal family to symbolise the nation's unity, determinacy and virtuousness. In 1890, when Wilhelmina took office, rumours were spread by Socialist satirical magazine De Roode Duivel ("The Red Devil") that William III was <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> father, but Emma's confidant S.M.S. de Ranitz. This would undermine the legitimacy of Wilhelmina's reign. Although no hard evidence exists for the allegations, and the consensus amongst historians is that they are false, the rumours were stubborn, and still feature in conspiracy theories circulating in republican circles. The author of the rumour, the later parliamentarian and senator Louis Maximiliaan Hermans, was sentenced to six months imprisonment for lèse-majesté in 1895 for a different article and cartoon in De Roode Duivel, mocking the two queens. There were considerably more concerns over the royal dynasty's future, when Wilhelmina's marriage with Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (since 1901) repeatedly resulted in miscarriage. Had the House of Orange died out, the throne would likely have passed to Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss of Köstritz, leading the Netherlands into an undesirable strong influence of the German Empire that would threaten Dutch independence. Not just Socialists, but now also Anti-Revolutionary politicians including Prime Minister Abraham Kuyper and Liberals such as Samuel van Houten advocated the restoration of the Republic in Parliament in case the marriage remained childless. The birth of Princess Juliana in 1909 put the question to rest.|$|E
50|$|A bizarre {{student who}} always wears an Indian headdress and {{also happens to}} be the Student Council President somehow. Most people do <b>not</b> {{remember}} <b>her</b> <b>real</b> name.|$|R
60|$|These essays {{were good}} and thoughtful, they {{represented}} study and toil, {{but they did}} <b>not</b> represent <b>her</b> <b>real</b> self, <b>her</b> <b>real</b> emotions, any more than her reading represented <b>her</b> <b>real</b> liking. <b>Her</b> emotions, big, vital, contemporaneous, had no part in this formal and colorless pedantry. Of this she was still ignorant, however.|$|R

2500|$|Xia is Juris's wife by {{the time}} of the second series, and mother to Jubal. An Asian woman, Xia is <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> name, but one that Juris picked for her, which means [...] "glow of the sunrise". After Jude becomes Magistrate, Xia {{attempts}} to become close to him, and even tries to seduce him. When these efforts fail, she concentrates on manipulating Jude, with the eventual goal of leading him to his own destruction, which Xia believes will lead to Jubal becoming the next Magistrate.|$|E

2500|$|Fertility Hollis : A {{friend of}} Tender's. [...] She meets him at her dead brother Trevor's crypt. At first, Fertility {{says she is}} repulsed by him, but as the novel {{progresses}} the two grow close. [...] "Fertility" [...] is <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> name but a pseudonym she uses for her job, which is acting as a surrogate mother for couples who cannot conceive. Her job is fraudulent in that she is actually sterile and has never managed to carry a child for a client. Fertility has the psychic ability to predict the future; she knows when, where, how, and to whom {{everything is going to}} happen, which takes all the fun out of life for her. She strikes up a friendship with Tender and helps him throughout the novel because she believes he is the only person who can surprise her. It is Fertility who leads Tender to hijack the plane. She also tells him that there is a way for him to [...] "survive", but her meaning is ambiguous.|$|E

50|$|When Johanna van Haarlem {{contacted}} him, in 1977, believing {{him to be}} <b>her</b> <b>real</b> son, he {{was ordered}} to play along, in order not to blow his cover, and did so, even {{going so far as to}} visit her family in Holland.

60|$|This (as the reader, {{if at all}} {{acquainted with}} our {{literary}} biography, need scarcely be told) was <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> name. She had assumed it, in the first instance, as her magazine signature; and, as it accorded well with something imperial which her friends attributed to this lady's figure and deportment, they half-laughingly adopted it in their familiar intercourse with her. She took the appellation in good part, and even encouraged its constant use; which, in fact, was thus far appropriate, that our Zenobia, however humble looked her new philosophy, had as much native pride as any queen would have known what to do with.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile he {{definitely}} forsook his old gods. The amazement with which {{at first he}} had looked upon {{the works of the}} impressionists, changed to admiration; and presently he found himself talking as emphatically as the rest on the merits of Manet, Monet, and Degas. He bought a photograph of a drawing by Ingres of the Odalisque and a photograph of the Olympia. They were pinned side by side over his washing-stand so that he could contemplate their beauty while he shaved. He knew now quite positively that there had been no painting of landscape before Monet; and he felt a real thrill when he stood in front of Rembrandt's Disciples at Emmaus or Velasquez' Lady with the Flea-bitten Nose. That was <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> name, but by that she was distinguished at Gravier's to emphasise the picture's beauty notwithstanding the somewhat revolting peculiarity of the sitter's appearance. With Ruskin, Burne-Jones, and Watts, he had put aside his bowler hat and the neat blue tie with white spots which he had worn on coming to Paris; and now disported himself in a soft, broad-brimmed hat, a flowing black cravat, and a cape of romantic cut. He walked along the Boulevard du Montparnasse as though he had known it all his life, and by virtuous perseverance he had learnt to drink absinthe without distaste. He was letting his hair grow, and it was only because Nature is unkind and has no regard for the immortal longings of youth that he did not attempt a beard.|$|E

However, unlike most other characters' fictional biography, Sombra's does <b>not</b> reveal <b>her</b> <b>real</b> name, instead listing a censored [...] "░░░░░░" [...] in the field where her name should be. She later briefly appears in the 10th issue of the Overwatch digital comics.|$|R
25|$|Freud {{gave her}} the name 'Dora', and he {{describes}} in detail in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life what his unconscious motivations for choosing such a name might have been. His sister's nursemaid {{had to give up}} <b>her</b> <b>real</b> name, Rosa, when she accepted the job because Freud's sister was also named Rosa—she took the name 'Dora' instead. Thus, when Freud needed a name for someone who could <b>not</b> keep <b>her</b> <b>real</b> name (this time, in order to preserve his patient's anonymity), Dora was the name that occurred to him.|$|R

6000|$|Misunderstood!--I {{can tell}} you why. Surely the mass of American [...] girls are nice, fine, sweet, wholesome. They are young. The news of [...] war liberates {{something}} in them {{that we can find}} no name for. But it [...] must be noble. A soldier! The very name, from childhood, is one to [...] make a girl thrill. What then the actual thing, the uniform, [...] invested somehow with chivalry and courage, the clean-cut athletic [...] young man, somber and fascinating with his intent eyes, his serious [...] brow, or his devil-may-care gallantry, the compelling presence of [...] him that breathes of his sacrifice, of his near departure to [...] privation, to squalid, comfortless trenches, to the fire and hell of [...] war, to blood and agony and death--in a word to fight, fight, fight [...] for women!... So through this beautiful emotion women lose their [...] balance and many are misunderstood. Those who would not and could [...] not be bold are susceptible to advances that in an ordinary time [...] would not affect them. War invests a soldier with a glamour. Love at [...] first sight, flirtations, rash intimacies, quick engagements, [...] immediate marriages. The soldier who is soon going away to fight and [...] perhaps to die strikes hard {{at the very heart of}} a girl. Either she [...] is <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> self then, or else she is suddenly transported to a [...] womanhood that is instinctive, elemental, universal for the future. [...] She feels what she does not know. She surrenders because there is an [...] imperative call to the depths of her nature. She sacrifices because [...] she is the inspiritor of the soldier, the reward for his loss, the [...] savior of the race. If women are the spoils of barbarous conquerors, [...] they are also the sinews, the strength, the soul of defenders.|$|E
6000|$|... "Saduko, my husband," [...] she said, [...] "I, a Princess of the Zulu House, married {{you who are}} not {{of royal}} blood because I loved you, and {{although}} Panda the King and Umbelazi the Prince wished it, {{for no other reason}} whatsoever. Well, I have been faithful to you through some trials, even when you set the widow of a wizard--if, indeed, as I have reason to suspect, she was not herself the wizard--before me, and although that wizard had killed our son, lived in her hut rather than in mine. Now this woman of whom you thought so much has deserted you for your friend and my brother, the Prince Umbelazi--Umbelazi who is called the Handsome, and who, if the fortune of war goes with him, as it may or may not, will succeed to Panda, my father. This she has done because she alleges that I, your Inkosikazi and the King's daughter, treated her as a servant, which is a lie. I kept her in her place, no more, who, if she could have had her will, would have ousted me from mine, perhaps by death, for the wives of wizards learn their arts. On this pretext she has left you; but that is <b>not</b> <b>her</b> <b>real</b> reason. She has left you because the Prince, my brother, whom she has befooled with her tricks and beauty, as she has befooled others, or tried to"--and she glanced at me--"is a bigger man than you are. You, Saduko, may become great, as my heart prays that you will, but my brother may become a king. She does not love him any more than she loved you, but she does love the place that may be his, and therefore hers--she who would be the first doe of the herd. My husband, I think that you are well rid of Mameena, for I think also that if she had stayed with us there would have been more deaths in our House; perhaps mine, which would not matter, and perhaps yours, which would matter much. All this I say to you, not from jealousy of one who is fairer than I, but because it is the truth. Therefore my counsel to you is to let this business pass over and keep silent. Above all, seek not to avenge yourself upon Umbelazi, since I am sure that he has taken vengeance to dwell with him in his own hut. I have spoken." ...|$|E
