If A c-commands B but B does not c-command A, then A {{asymmetric}}ally c-commands B. The notion of asymmetric c-command plays a major role in Richard Kayne's theory of Antisymmetry.|$|E
25|$|The {{validity}} {{and importance of}} c-command for the theory of syntax is a debated issue. In most cases, c-command correlates positively with precedence (linear order), that is, when node A c-commands <b>node</b> <b>B,</b> {{it is usually the}} case that node A also precedes <b>node</b> <b>B.</b> Furthermore, basic S(V)O (subject-verb-object) word order in English correlates positively with a hierarchy of syntactic functions, subjects outranking objects. Subjects typically precede objects in declarative sentences in English and related languages. These two insights suggest that theories of syntax that build on c-command have misconstrued the importance of precedence and/or the hierarchy of syntactic functions. What c-command is intended to address is arguably more accurately analyzed in terms of precedence and the syntactic functions. Further, the c-command concept was developed primarily with its ability to address syntactic phenomena of English, a language with relatively strict word order. When confronted with the much freer word order of many other languages, the insights provided by c-command are less compelling, since linear order becomes less important.|$|E

(If the insertion is to insert a right child, then B is the right child of A, and similarly with a left child insertion.) A assigns its child to the new node and the new node assigns its parent to A. Then the new node assigns its child to B and B assigns its parent as the new node.|$|E

By adopting the MRC signal processing technique, the SNR at node F {{is equal to the}} sum of the SNR contributed from <b>nodes</b> <b>B</b> and C. Hence, the SNR at node F could meet the minimum SNR requirement to successfully decode the received data by using the 16 -QAM modulation scheme. In addition, node D is still within <b>node</b> <b>B’s</b> SNR-aware transmission radius. Then all the SNR requirements are all satisfied for the destination nodes. This example shows that cooperative routing scheme is more power efficient than the non-cooperative routing scheme. To facilitate the cooperative routing scheme, a new many-to-one communication (e.g., from <b>nodes</b> <b>B</b> and C to F), denote as convergecasting, should carefully be designed.|$|R

[...] The small letters identify the areas, eight inside the figure, and area i designates the space outside of it.

The global optimisation can be obtained in terms of great probability as GA is applied to global search and TS is applied to the local search. The particular memory ability of TS can be integrated to GA and the prematurity of GA can be avoided by virtue of the hill-climbing ability of TS. The problem to be addressed is the determination of optimal locations of <b>node</b> <b>Bs</b> in the network based on the user distribution, while improving the QoS. The proposed approach considers the site selection as an integer problem and the site placement as a continuous problem. The two problems are focused on concurrently - finding the optimal number of <b>node</b> <b>Bs</b> that satisfies the capacity requirements in the network and hence QoS improvement. The proposed algorithm combines the strength of Genetic and Tabu Search algorithms in successive elimination of <b>node</b> <b>Bs</b> after their random distribution in the area of study. The results showed that the proposed approach produced fewer number of <b>node</b> <b>Bs</b> sites in the network that provided the required QoS. In addition, it exhibited high fitness function in the simulations meaning that it has the higher ability of achieving the objective function when it was compared to TS and GA...|$|R

Finally, a case study comprising realistic site positions and propagation data is performed for verification of the general results. ...|$|R
