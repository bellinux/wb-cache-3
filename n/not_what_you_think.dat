In this article, Faulkner examines a “trend-following philosophy” which he constructed after having observed the language patterns {{and behaviors of}} several top traders.|$|E
500|$|The player must enter four {{different}} worlds through the Bequest Globe, {{each of which}} is an amalgamation of historical and fantastical elements and is named after one of the sephirot on the kabbalistic Tree of Life. The player seeks to recover four lost artifacts: the Rod of Osiris, the Holy Grail, the Philosopher's Stone, and the Ark of the Covenant. According to Horse, [...] "The relics you're searching for are <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> they are". The first world, Binah, includes aspects of Arthurian legend, including Morgan Le Fey and the Knights Templar, as well as Stonehenge. The second, Chesed, features Aztec ruins and a submarine interior. The third, Din, centers around an underground transit system, a steampunk carnival, and a mechanical maze. The final world, Chokmah, takes place outside Area 51.|$|E

2500|$|John Leland, {{author of}} Why Kerouac Matters: The Lessons of On the Road (They're <b>Not</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think),</b> says [...] "We're no longer {{shocked by the}} sex and drugs. The slang is passé and at times corny. Some of the racial sentimentality is appalling" [...] but adds [...] "the tale of passionate {{friendship}} {{and the search for}} revelation are timeless. These are as elusive and precious in our time as in Sal's, and will be when our grandchildren celebrate the book's hundredth anniversary." ...|$|E

He theorized that Bigfoot creatures share a [...] "space-time origin and connection with UFOs and come from an alternative universe by a wormhole." ...|$|E

And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal with the madmen. All men are mad {{in some way or}} the other, and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen too, the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it.

But, as there is this true relation between money and [...] "goods," [...] or good things, {{so there is a}} false relation between money and [...] "bads," [...] or bad things. Many bad things will fetch a price in exchange; but they do not increase the wealth of the country. Good wine is wealth, drugged wine is not; good meat is wealth, putrid meat is not; good pictures are wealth, bad pictures are not. A thing is worth precisely what it can do for you; not what you choose to pay for it. You may pay a thousand pounds for a cracked pipkin, if you please; but you do not by that transaction make the cracked pipkin worth one that will hold water, nor that, nor any pipkin whatsoever, worth more than it was before you paid such sum for it. You may, perhaps, induce many potters to manufacture fissured pots, and many amateurs of clay to buy them; but the nation is, through the whole business so encouraged, rich by the addition to its wealth of so many potsherds,--and there an end. The thing is worth what it CAN do for you, <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it can; and most national luxuries, nowadays, are a form of potsherd, provided for the solace of a self-complacent Job, voluntary sedent on his ash-heap.|$|E
