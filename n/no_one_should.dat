5|$|According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi {{considered}} untouchability to {{be wrong}} and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless {{of his or her}} background, stated Gandhi, has a right to choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{to suicide}} include Christian {{philosophers}} such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant and, arguably, John Stuart Mill – Mill's {{focus on the}} importance of liberty and autonomy meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions. Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice. Supporters of this position maintain that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age, with no possibility of improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. A stronger stance would argue that people should be allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume and American bioethicist Jacob Appel.|$|E

5|$|The Nez Perce band {{associated}} with Chief Joseph, numbering about 750 people, passed through Yellowstone National Park in thirteen days during late August 1877. They were {{being pursued by}} the U.S.Army and entered the national park about {{two weeks after the}} Battle of the Big Hole. Some of the Nez Perce were friendly to the tourists and other people they encountered in the park; some were not. Nine park visitors were briefly taken captive. Despite Joseph and other chiefs ordering that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be harmed, at least two people were killed and several wounded. One of the areas where encounters occurred was in Lower Geyser Basin and east along a branch of the Firehole River to Mary Mountain and beyond. That stream is still known as Nez Perce Creek. A group of Bannocks entered the park in 1878, alarming park Superintendent Philetus Norris. In the aftermath of the Sheepeater Indian War of 1879, Norris built a fort to prevent Native Americans from entering the national park.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the twin}} {{elements}} of natural justice is the rule against bias or nemo iudex in causa sua, which means that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be a judge {{in his or her}} own cause.

25|$|Comanche raids before 1840 had {{generally}} penetrated only a {{short distance}} south of the Rio Grande and had usually resulted {{in only a few}} deaths and the theft of a few thousand livestock. The threat, however, from the Comanche was serious enough in 1826 in northern Nuevo León, that the Governor issued orders that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> venture out of villages into the countryside except in groups of at least thirty armed men.|$|E

25|$|Health issues {{regarding}} Kingman Lake again became {{prominent in the}} mid-1950s. An American University biologist found that the bed of Kingman Lake was composed almost entirely of fecal matter, and warned that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> swim in the lake due the extensive pollution. The immense amount of raw sewage in the lake was attributed to low water flows, {{and the lack of}} southern locks to allow water to more freely pass out of the lake. Nonetheless, a year later city officials were advocating that a playground be built on the shores of Kingman Island.|$|E
25|$|According to Exodus, Shabbat (Sabbath) was reinstituted {{the first}} week manna appeared. It states that twice as much manna as usual was {{available}} on the sixth morning of the week, and none at all could {{be found on the}} seventh day; although manna usually rotted and became maggot-infested after a single night, that which had been collected on the sixth day remained fresh until the second night. Moses stated that the double portion of Preparation Day was to be consumed on Shabbat; and that God instructed him that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> leave his place on Shabbat, so that the people could rest during it.|$|E

25|$|Ebroin endeavoured to {{maintain}} {{at any rate}} the union of Neustria and Burgundy, but the great Burgundian nobles too wished to remain independent. They rose under bishop Leodegar (or Léger) of Autun, and defeated Ebroin and Theuderic. They decided to tonsure Ebroin, interning him in the monastery of Luxeuil. A proclamation was then issued {{to the effect that}} each kingdom should keep its own laws and customs, {{that there should be no}} further interchange of functionaries between the kingdoms, and that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> again set up a tyranny like that of Ebroin. Soon, however, Leodegar too was defeated by Wulfoald and the Austrasians, and was himself confined at Luxeuil in 673.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} end of Robespierre, a new royalist social movement, called the Muscadins had appeared. These were largely upper middle class young men, {{numbering}} between and two and three thousand, who dressed in an extravagant fashion, spoke with an exaggerated accent, carried canes as weapons, and, particularly in 1794 and 1795, they patrolled the streets in groups and attacked sans culottes and symbols of the revolution. They tried to be and act like the nobility of the Ancien Regime, and mostly tried to live in the abandoned Marais area. One of the most extreme of the revolutionaries, Marat, the editor of the radical newspaper L'Ami du people ("Friend of the people") had been assassinated on 13 July 1793, and on 22 September 1794, his ashes had been placed with great ceremony in the Pantheon, alongside those of Voltaire and Rousseau. After the downfall of Robespierre, the Convention issued a decree that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> be entered in the Pantheon who had not been dead for ten years. The Muscadins went even further, invading the Pantheon, destroying Marat's monument and removing his ashes.|$|E
