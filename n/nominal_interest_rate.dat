While increased liquidity may lower the <b>nominal</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower <b>nominal</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

Although a stable price level tends to enhance economic welfare, some economists (e. g., SUMMERS, 1991) have questioned the wisdom of reducing inflation to very low levels.
