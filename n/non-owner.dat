500|$|There were reipersecutory actions {{available}} {{in addition to}} penal actions, those actions which followed from a finding of theft but were additional to it. An action for furtum allowed the dominus or his heirs a claim under vindicatio (and action in rem), which {{would result in the}} thing being returned if its value could not be paid instead. It also allowed a claim by the owner for the thing’s value under the condictio furtiva against the thief in personam, although only one could be successful. Allowing a condictio was anomalous: it was an action more usually brought by a <b>non-owner,</b> possibly kept over from before condictio was restricted in this way. It is also possible it was allowed because it granted to the claimant an advantage insofar as he did not need ascertain who had the property itself. Gaius suggests that it was kept [...] "out of hatred for thieves". A possessory interdict was another option in either case.|$|E

40|$|Property law has a {{particular}} problem with <b>non-owners.</b> Although property law has a very {{clear understanding of the}} rights of “owners,” it has only a vague understanding of the rights of “non-owners. ” The problem is significant, because modern property law is so often called upon to balance the rights and needs of owners and <b>non-owners.</b> With so vague an understanding of one set of rights, property law cannot adequately perform this function. The New Jersey case of State v. Shack exemplifies this problem, because it purports to be a case about protecting <b>non-owners.</b> By examining both the case and the texts upon which the Court relied in deciding the case, this Article argues that the New Jersey Supreme Court could not understand, and therefore could not adequately protect, the <b>non-owners</b> in the case. Instead, in its effort to evince a set of rights powerful enough to overcome the property owner’s rights, the Court eliminated the voices of the migrant workers it claimed to protect. This Article draws upon postcolonialist theory both in examining the problem and in prescribing a solution. In its prescription, the Article proposes a pragmatic form of postcolonialist inquiry as a theoretical foundation for protecting <b>non-owners</b> in property law. Relying on the less iconic case of Hilder v. St. Peter, the Article proposes three devices within the common law tradition that are well suited to the task of representing and protecting <b>non-owners.</b> As Hilder demonstrates, by the pragmatic use of storytelling, the personalization of claims, and the precise matching of remedies to harm and need, legal decision-makers can more fully consider and protect the rights and needs of <b>non-owners...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In general dog-owners {{are more}} {{physically}} active than <b>non-owners,</b> however; {{it is not}} known whether dog-ownership can influence seasonal fluctuations in physical activity. This study examines whether dog-ownership influences summer and winter patterns of neighbourhood-based walking among adults living in Calgary, Canada. Methods A cohort of adults, randomly sampled from the Calgary metropolitan area, completed postal surveys in winter and summer 2008. Both winter and summer versions of the survey included questions on dog-ownership, walking for recreation, and walking for transportation in residential neighbourhoods. Participation in neighbourhood-based walking was compared, among dog-owners and <b>non-owners,</b> and in summer and winter, using general linear modeling. Stability of participation in neighbourhood-based walking across summer and winter among dog-owners and <b>non-owners</b> was also assessed, using logistic regression. Results A total of 428 participants participated in the study, of whom 115 indicated owning dogs at the time of both surveys. Dog-owners reported more walking for recreation in their neighbourhoods than did <b>non-owners,</b> both in summer and in winter. Dog-owners were also more likely than <b>non-owners</b> to report participation in walking for recreation in their neighbourhoods, in summer as well as in winter. Dog-owners and <b>non-owners</b> did not differ in the amount of walking that they reported for transportation, either in summer or in winter. Conclusions By acting as cues for physical activity, dogs may help their owners remain active across seasons. Policies and programs related to dog-ownership and dog-walking, such as dog-supportive housing and dog-supportive parks, may assist in enhancing population health by promoting physical activity. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{impact of}} {{immigration}} shocks on childbearing potentially differs by homeownership status. While {{an increase in}} the price of housing accompanying immigration will make childbearing more costly for <b>non-owners</b> (since housing and raising children are complementary), and so decrease their current-period demand for children, it could, by increasing accessible home equity, instead increase homeowners’ demand for children (Lovenheim and Mumford 2013; Dettling and Kearney 2014). Further, rent increases due to immigration will leave <b>non-owners</b> with less financial resources for childrearing while providing homeowners with more. Hence, one would expect <b>non-owners</b> and owners to respond differently to the shock. In order to test for heterogeneous impacts, I repeat the above analysis, separating individuals by homeownership status.|$|R
2500|$|A {{minority}} view among historians is {{that the}} Confederacy lost because, as E. Merton Coulter put it, [...] "people did not will hard enough and long enough to win." [...] Marxist historian Armstead Robinson agrees, pointing to a class conflict in the Confederates army between the slave owners and the larger number of non-owners. He argues that the <b>non-owner</b> soldiers grew embittered about fighting to preserve slavery, and fought less enthusiastically. He attributes the major Confederate defeats in 1863 at Vicksburg and Missionary Ridge to this class conflict. However, most historians reject the argument. James M. McPherson, after reading thousands of letters written by Confederate soldiers, found strong patriotism that continued to the end; they truly believed they were fighting for freedom and liberty. Even as the Confederacy was visibly collapsing in 1864–65, he says most Confederate soldiers were fighting hard. Historian Gary Gallagher cites General Sherman who in early 1864 commented, [...] "The devils {{seem to have a}} determination that cannot but be admired." [...] Despite their loss of slaves and wealth, with starvation looming, Sherman continued, [...] "yet I see no sign of let up—some few deserters—plenty tired of war, but the masses determined to fight it out." ...|$|E

40|$|International {{differences}} in {{practices and attitudes}} regarding pet cats' interactions with wildlife were assessed by surveying citizens from at least two cities in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the USA, China and Japan. Predictions tested were: (i) cat owners would agree less than non-cat owners that cats might threaten wildlife, (ii) cat owners value wildlife less than non-cat owners, (iii) cat owners are less accepting of cat legislation/restrictions than <b>non-owners,</b> and (iv) respondents from regions with high endemic biodiversity (Australia, New Zealand, China and the USA state of Hawaii) would be most concerned about pet cats threatening wildlife. Everywhere <b>non-owners</b> {{were more likely than}} owners to agree that pet cats killing wildlife were a problem in cities, towns and rural areas. Agreement amongst <b>non-owners</b> was highest in Australia (95 %) and New Zealand (78 %) and lowest in the UK (38 %). Irrespective of ownership, over 85 % of respondents from all countries except China (65 %) valued wildlife in cities, towns and rural areas. <b>Non-owners</b> advocated cat legislation more strongly than owners except in Japan. Australian <b>non-owners</b> were the most supportive (88 %), followed by Chinese <b>non-owners</b> (80 %) and Japanese owners (79. 5 %). The UK was least supportive (<b>non-owners</b> 43 %, owners 25 %). Many Australian (62 %), New Zealand (51 %) and Chinese owners (42 %) agreed that pet cats killing wildlife in cities, towns and rural areas was a problem, while Hawaiian owners were similar to the mainland USA (20 %). Thus high endemic biodiversity might contribute to attitudes in some, but not all, countries. Husbandry practices varied internationally, with predation highest where fewer cats were confined. Although the risk of wildlife population declines caused by pet cats justifies precautionary action, campaigns based on wildlife protection are unlikely to succeed outside Australia or New Zealand. Restrictions on roaming protect wildlife and benefit cat welfare, so welfare is a better rationale...|$|R

Two surveys of gun owners and <b>non-owners,</b> conducted immediately {{before and after the}} Orlando shooting, allowed us to assess its impact on threat perceptions and on gun-purchasing intentions. Although there was a minor impact on threat perceptions of <b>non-owners,</b> neither group reported any increased gun-purchasing intentions or an increased need of a gun for protection and self-defense. We suggest that these responses are representative for the majority of Americans and, therefore, people who are influenced by mass shootings to buy guns are probably an atypical minority...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{examines}} changes in socio-demographic, environmental and intrapersonal {{factors associated with}} dog acquisition in non-dog owners at baseline to 12 -months follow-up {{and the effect of}} dog acquisition on minutes per week of recreational walking. Methods RESIDE study participants completed self-administered questionnaires (baseline and 12 -months follow-up) measuring physical activity, dog ownership, dog walking behavior as well as environmental, intrapersonal and socio-demographic factors. Analysis was restricted to 'Continuing non-owners' (i. e., <b>non-owners</b> at both baseline and follow-up; n = 681) and 'New dog owners' (i. e., <b>non-owners</b> who acquired a dog by follow-up; n = 92). Results Overall, 12 % of baseline <b>non-owners</b> had acquired a dog at follow-up. Dog acquisition was associated with working and having children at home. Those who changed from single to couple marital status {{were also more likely to}} acquire a dog. The increase in minutes of walking for recreation within the neighborhood from baseline to follow-up was 48 minutes/week for new dog owners compared with 12 minutes/week for continuing <b>non-owners</b> (p p p > 0. 05) after further adjustment for change in baseline to follow-up variables. Increase in intention to walk was the main factor contributing to attenuation of the effect of dog acquisition on recreational walking. Conclusion This study used a large representative sample of <b>non-owners</b> to examine the relationship between dog acquisition and recreational walking and provides evidence to suggest that dog acquisition leads to an increase in walking. The most likely mechanism through which dog acquisition facilitates increased physical activity is through behavioral intention via the dog's positive effect on owner's cognitive beliefs about walking, and through the provision of motivation and social support for walking. The results suggest that behavioral intention mediates the relationship between dog acquisition and walking and that dogs may have a significant role in the maintenance of owner walking behavior. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Dog-owners {{tend to be}} more {{physically}} active than non-owners; however, dogs have also been shown to inhibit physical activity for <b>non-owners,</b> under some circumstances. Methods We conducted a scoping review to identify studies pertaining to the influence of dogs on physical activity for both dog-owners and <b>non-owners,</b> and adopted a critical realist orientation to draw inferences about the positive and negative impact of dogs via their affect on physical and social environments. Results We identified 35 studies from disparate literatures for review. These studies confirm that dog and owner behaviors affect shared physical and social environments in ways that may influence physical activity patterns, not only among dog-owners but also among <b>non-owners.</b> The direction of influence appears to be most positive in neighborhoods exhibiting high levels of social cohesion, socioeconomic status, perceived safety, dominant culture, or all of these. In disadvantaged neighborhoods, the health of women as well as older adults may be disproportionately affected by dog and owner behavior. Conclusions While dogs have the potential to increase physical activity for both dog-owners and <b>non-owners,</b> {{the presence or absence of}} dogs will not have a standard effect across the physical and social environments of all neighborhoods. Dogs' contributions to shared environments in ways that support physical activity for all must be leveraged. Thus, specific contextual factors must be considered in relation to dogs when planning neighborhood-level interventions designed to support physical activity. We suggest this population health topic merits further investigation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the knowledge, {{attitudes and practices}} of cat-owners and <b>non-owners</b> in suburban Perth, Western Australia, on issues relating to proposed local government regulation of cat-ownership. Design: The 1261 respondents to a mailed survey were ranked on issues regarding restrictions on cat-ownership and cat roaming (control scale), attitudes to wildlife in suburbia and putative impacts of cats on wildlife (wildlife scale), knowledge of cat behaviour and husbandry (knowledge scale) and attitudes and practices regarding cat sterilisation (sterilisation scale). Age, gender and cat-ownership status of the survey respondents were explored {{to see if any}} of these factors influenced the position of respondents on the scales. Results: Cat-owners, particularly female owners, scored significantly higher on the knowledge scale than <b>non-owners,</b> whilst <b>non-owners</b> scored significantly higher than cat-owners on the control and wildlife scales. Women were more likely to favour compulsory sterilisation of pet cats than men, but men were more willing to implement controls on cat-ownership. Age was also a significant factor, with older people more willing to implement controls. Analysis of specific questions showed that both cat-owners and <b>non-owners</b> agreed that there was a need for cat control legislation and supported measures such as compulsory sterilisation, registering of cats, restricting cats' ability to roam and stipulating a maximum number of cats per property. Nevertheless, both groups rejected the idea that local governments should enforce cat-free zones. Conclusion: Cat legislation that avoids or educates about the contentious issue of cat-free zones should receive solid community support...|$|R

Furthermore, when segmenting potential FTBs {{on the basis of their}} subjective knowledge, the segment of potential FTBs with higher subjective knowledge display similar attribute preferences to owners, while the preference differences are observed when segmenting potential buyers into owners and <b>non-owners.</b> From a managerial perspective, the findings of the research demonstrate the value of using subjective knowledge for consumer segmentation when targeting car buyers...|$|R

But <b>non-owners</b> argue that the owners' formula precludes the public access through and over private property to beaches, mandated by California state law, and that the Hollister Ranch Association beaches remain open to heavy vehicular traffic from registered beach going vehicles. In addition, <b>non-owners</b> argue that the working cattle operation that has shipped as much as 1,000,000 pounds of beef in a good, rainy year is subsidized by the owners and exists primarily for tax-front purposes. Regardless of the fact that cattle have continuously grazed at Hollister Ranch since the 1860s, some environmentalists note the potential impact such an operation could have on native flora and fauna.

The gaze allocation within local facial features was also modulated by the ownership. The averaged proportion of the fixations and viewing time directed at the dog mouth region were significantly less for the dog owners, and more experienced dog owners tended to look more at the dog eyes, suggesting the adoption of a prior experience-based viewing behaviour for assessing dog approachability.
