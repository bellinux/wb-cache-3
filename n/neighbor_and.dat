Her German crew at Pola—since it was still the intent for UB-7 {{to be transferred to}} the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms. As time dragged on, the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austrian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from <b>neighbor</b> <b>and</b> former ally Italy.|$|E

5|$|Although for a {{few decades}} (since the times of the Silent Sejm) Russia had seen a weak Poland as its own protectorate, Poland had also been devastated by a civil war in which {{the forces of the}} Bar Confederation {{attempted}} to disrupt Russian control over Poland. The recent Koliyivschyna peasant and Cossack uprising in Ukraine also weakened Poland's position. Further, the Russian-supported Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, was seen as both weak and too independent-minded; eventually the Russian court decided that the usefulness of Poland as a protectorate had diminished. The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome <b>neighbor</b> <b>and</b> restoring order in Poland through military intervention (the Bar Confederation provided a convenient excuse); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.|$|E

The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome <b>neighbor</b> <b>and</b> restoring order through military intervention in the civil war (the War of Bar Confederation); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.|$|E
