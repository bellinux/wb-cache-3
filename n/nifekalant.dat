5000|$|<b>Nifekalant</b> (INN) is a class III {{antiarrhythmic}} agent approved in Japan {{for the treatment}} of arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia. [...] It has the brand name Shinbit.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to review the {{literature}} and discuss nifekalant&#x 2019;s potential use as a first aid drug in an emergency care setting. The PubMed database was used to identify papers, using keywords <b>nifekalant,</b> MS- 551, amiodarone and lidocaine. <b>Nifekalant</b> hydrochloride, formally known as MS- 551, is a class III antiarrhythmic agent which acts only by increasing the time course of myocardial repolarization. It was developed and is currently being used only in Japan for the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It is a non-selective K+ channel blocker without any &#x 3 B 2;-blocking actions. Administration of <b>nifekalant</b> suppressed sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in acute coronary syndrome patients, and in cardiac arrest victims as well as during or after cardiac surgery. The major adverse effect of <b>nifekalant</b> is QT interval prolongation and occurrence of torsades de pointes which requires frequent monitoring of the QT interval during <b>nifekalant</b> infusion with adequate dose adjustment. <b>Nifekalant</b> is a possible effective antiarrhythmic agent for refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Further clinical studies are required before <b>nifekalant</b> is routinely used in the emergency care setting...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{a simple}} and {{selective}} high-performance liquid chro-matography method was developed and validated for the determin-ation of <b>nifekalant</b> hydrochloride in canine plasma. Liquid–liquid extraction was used to separate <b>nifekalant</b> hydrochloride from canine plasma and the mean extraction recoveries of <b>nifekalant</b> hydrochloride and the internal standard were 82. 31 and 94. 81 %, respectively. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Dikma Diamonsil column with a mobile phase consisting of aceto-nitrile– 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6. 2; 30 : 70, v/v) with flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min. The standard curve was linear over the concentra-tion range of 20 – 10, 000 ng/mL (r 2 > 0. 99). The intra-batch and inter-batch accuracy for <b>nifekalant</b> hydrochloride at four concentra-tions were 93. 14 – 100. 47 % and 96. 12 – 103. 77 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: <b>Nifekalant</b> is {{a unique}} class III {{anti-arrhythmic}} agent with a strong effect on prolonging the myocardial refractoriness, but its clinical effect is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated the effect of <b>nifekalant</b> on life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and compared the clinical background between the effective and non-effective patients in order to clarify the clinical factors which may have an influence on the efficacy of <b>nifekalant.</b> Methods: The study population consisted of 47 consecutive patients who underwent <b>nifekalant</b> administration for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF). Their clinical characteristics and ECG parameters were retrospectively compared between patients with and without an effective result with the <b>nifekalant</b> administration. Results: <b>Nifekalant</b> was effective for refractory VT/VF in 26 / 47 patients. There {{was no significant difference}} in the age, gender or left ventricular ejection fraction, but the incidence of ischemic heart disease was higher in the effective group (17 / 26) than non-effective group (9 / 21, p = 0. 004). The incidence of in-hospital events was higher in the effective group than non-effective group (20 / 26 vs 10 / 21, p = 0. 037). A significant prolongation in the QTc interval was observed in all patients and the degree of QTc prolongation was greater in the effective group than in the non-effective group (0. 46 ± 0. 04 vs 0. 43 ± 0. 02 sec 1 / 2, p = 0. 026). Conclusion: <b>Nifekalant</b> was effective in 55 % of the patients for refractory VT/VF. It was considered that <b>nifekalant</b> was more effective for patients with ischemic heart disease, during the perioperative period or in those experiencing in-hospital events.

40|$|Background: Ablation {{of complex}} {{fractionated}} atrial electrograms (CFAE) is now performed {{in patients with}} persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). However, extensive ablation is often necessary to eliminate all CFAE or to terminate AF. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) on CFAE. Methods and Results: Sixty patients, including 38 with longstanding persistent AF and 22 with persistent AF, underwent box isolation. After box isolation, CFAE maps were created before and after infusion of a pure Na+ blocker, pilsicainide (1 mg/kg), in 30 patients or a pure IKr blocker, <b>nifekalant</b> (0. 3 mg/kg), in 30 patients. <b>Nifekalant</b> had a greater effect on AF termination than pilsicainide (33. 3 % versus 6. 7 %, P = 0. 01). Both AADs similarly reduced CFAE. Ablation of CFAE localized by <b>nifekalant</b> and pilsicainide terminated AF in 26. 7 % and 20 % of the patients, respectively. After a single ablation procedure, patients in whom AF was terminated by CFAE ablation had a lower recurrence rate than those in whom AF was not terminated despite CFAE ablation (19. 2 % vers us 35. 3 %, P = 0. 04). Conclusions: Both pilsicainide and <b>nifekalant</b> reduce CFAE, and <b>nifekalant</b> has a greater effect on AF termination than pilsicainide.

40|$|Introduction: We {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} pilsicainide, a pure Na+ channel blocker, and <b>nifekalant,</b> a pure rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) blocker, on the electrophysiological characteristics within the pulmonary vein (PV) and at the PV-left atrial (LA) junction. Methods and Results: We used a basket catheter for PV mapping in 38 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Programmed stimulation was performed in the distal PV and PV-LA junction {{before and after the}} infusion of pilsicainide (1 mg/kg; n = 24) or <b>nifekalant</b> (0. 3 mg/kg; n = 14). Both drugs significantly prolonged the effective refractory period (ERP) of the distal PV and PV-LA junction. Pilsicainide significantly decreased the ERP heterogeneity of the PV and PV-LA junction (36 ± 43 vs. 9 ± 60 ms, P < 0 : 05). In contrast, <b>nifekalant</b> significantly increased the ERP heterogeneity of the PV and PV-LA junction (from 38 ± 34 to 60 ± 46 ms, P < 0 : 01). Pilsicainide significantly prolonged the conduction time (S 1 -A 1) from the distal PV to the PV-LA junction (from 42 ± 12 to 63 ± 26 ms, P < 0 : 001), whereas this did not change with <b>nifekalant.</b> Conclusions: In AF patients, pilsicainide has antiarrhythmic effects mainly on the distal PV by modifying the ERP and conduction properties.

40|$|Background: Intravenous {{amiodarone}} {{is considered}} to be the first-line drug for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. However, in Japan, <b>nifekalant</b> had been used before the introduction of amiodarone; therefore, most clinical studies on amiodarone use have been small-scale studies. The aim {{of the present study was}} to review the literature concerning the actual use of amiodarone and <b>nifekalant</b> in order to evaluate the effects of both drugs and the most appropriate mode of administration. Methods: The Japan Medical Abstracts Society, PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to identify the reports. The resulting data were used for a systematic review focusing on the effectiveness of amiodarone in comparison with that of <b>nifekalant</b> and the dose differential effect of amiodarone. Results: The search returned 9 studies, including 310 patients, that compared the effectiveness of amiodarone and <b>nifekalant,</b> as well as 3 studies, including 108 patients, that analyzed the effectiveness of treatment according to amiodarone dose. Of 418 patients, 187 in whom amiodarone was used for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were included in a review that compared the doses recommended by Japanese guidelines 2009 (125  mg intravenous [i. v. ] over 10  min) and the American Heart Association guidelines (300  mg bolus i. v.). Amiodarone and <b>nifekalant</b> were equally effective in preventing electrical storm (67 % vs. 67 %). The defibrillation effect for CPR was also equal in the 2 groups (60 % vs. 54 %). Hypotension and bradycardia were recorded as adverse effects in the amiodarone group (9. 5 % and 5. 3 %), whereas torsades de pointes was observed in the <b>nifekalant</b> group (1. 4 %). In the analysis of the dose-differential effect of amiodarone, the rates of successful return of spontaneous circulation and discharge survival were higher in the 125 -mg slow i. v. group than in the 300 -mg bolus i. v. group (76 % vs. 53 % and 54 % vs. 26 %, respectively). Conclusions: Amiodarone and <b>nifekalant</b> were equivalent in their prophylactic and defibrillation efficacy. Concerning the initial amiodarone dose, the 125  mg intravenous [i. v. ] over 10  min seemed to be more appropriate for the Japanese population...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAdditional {{ablation}} {{of complex}} fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) {{has been shown}} to improve the success of ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). However, extensive ablation is often necessary to eliminate all CFAE or to terminate AF. We assessed the usefulness of the administration of an antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) before CFAE ablation. Methods and resultsOne-hundred and ten patients with persistent AF first underwent PVI, roof and floor linear ablation (box isolation). One hundred patients who remained in AF after box isolation were then randomized to either receive (AAD group, n= 50) or not receive (no-AAD group, n= 50) intravenous <b>nifekalant</b> (0. 3 mg/kg) followed by a CFAE ablation. In the AAD group, <b>nifekalant</b> terminated AF in 19 (38 %) patients and ablation of localized CFAE was performed in 31 patients who remained in AF after <b>nifekalant,</b> and terminated AF in 11 (35 %) patients. In the no-AAD group, ablation of CFAE terminated AF in 13 (26 %) patients. The AAD group had a significantly lesser number of radio frequency applications at CFAE sites (18 ± 12 versus 36 ± 10, p< 0. 0001) and shorter procedure time (162 ± 34 versus 197 ± 29 min, p< 0. 0001) compared with the no-AAD group. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in success rate at 12 months after a single ablation procedure between the two groups (AAD group, 74 % versus no-AAD group, 76 %). ConclusionsAn approach to ablation using <b>nifekalant</b> may be useful in localizing areas of CFAE, reducing the number of applications at CFAE sites and procedure time. Ablation of only CFAE localized with <b>nifekalant</b> may be sufficient for clinical outcome...|$|E
40|$|A 66 -year-old man {{underwent}} a second ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). Intravenous isoproterenol administration caused the atrial premature beat (APB), triggering AF.

40|$|Background: Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) are {{life-threatening}} {{events that}} result in hemodynamic compromise. Recurrence is common and may worsen a patient׳s clinical course despite appropriate treatment. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs for suppression of VTs. Methods: In this cohort study, eligible patients were those who were admitted {{to one of the}} nine cardiovascular care centers and treated with continuous infusion of an antiarrhythmic drug for at least 1  h to prevent recurrence of VTs after return of spontaneous circulation. To adjust for differences in baseline characteristics among treatment groups, propensity scores for administered agents were generated and used as covariates in regression analyses. Results: Seventy-two patients were enrolled and 67 patients were included in the final analysis. Amiodarone (n= 21, 31. 3 %), <b>nifekalant</b> (n= 24, 35. 8 %), and lidocaine (n= 22, 32. 8 %) were administered as first-line therapy for suppression of VTs. In the adjusted analyses, the odds ratio (OR) of switching to a different drug was significantly higher in the lidocaine group (OR 37. 6, 95 % CI 5. 1 – 279, p< 0. 001) than in the amiodarone group, but not in the <b>nifekalant</b> group (OR 4. 1, 95 % CI 0. 72 – 23. 2, p= 0. 11). There {{was no significant difference in}} mortality rate in the lidocaine group (OR 1. 67, 95 % CI 0. 40 – 6. 95, p= 0. 48) or the <b>nifekalant</b> group (OR 1. 11, 95 % CI 0. 15 – 4. 85, p= 0. 89) compared with the amiodarone group. Conclusion: Amiodarone and <b>nifekalant</b> are similarly effective in preventing VT recurrence, but their impact on survival rate is minimal.

40|$|We here {{report a}} case of 71 -year-old man with acute {{extensive}} anterior myocardial infarction, who was complicated with ventricular tachycardia (VT) even after successful percutaneous coronary intervention. As intravenous administration of <b>nifekalant</b> terminated VT, we started oral administration of amiodarone (day 1). We gave 400 mg of amiodarone {{a day for the}} first week and 200 mg a day from the second week. The patient was stable with normoxia by day 20, in spite of pulmonary congestion-like infiltrates on chest X-ray. On day 21, he was complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Immediate discontinuance of amiodarone and high-dose pulse glucocorticoid therapy with intubation slightly improved the infiltrations on chest X-ray. However, glucocorticoid therapy induced hyperglycemia with an increase in plasma osmolality, complicated with hypoalbuminemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite treatment with a large amount of saline, high-doses of catecholamines, and blood transfusion, the patient died on day 28.

40|$|Introduction: Some {{studies have}} {{reported}} that transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) {{is involved in the}} onset of ventricular arrhythmia. We investigated the effects of nicorandil (NIC) and <b>nifekalant</b> (NIF) injected into the pericardial space, on TDR and T waves in the pig. Methods and Results: We injected NIC 4 or 8 mg and NIF 50 or 100 mg at intervals into the pericardial space for eleven pigs. The effects of these drugs were investigated on the effective refractory period (ERP) between the endocardial and epicardial myocardial cells, as well as on QT time, QT peak-end (QTcpe) as an index of TDR, and T waveforms, respectively. QTcpe increased from 91 ± 21 to 116 ± 19 msec, 2. 8 min after injection of NIC (p < 0. 01), although corrected QT (QTc) interval did not changed. But 5. 5 min after injection, QTc decreased while QTcpe recovered. T wave amplitude significantly increased, and epicardium ERP decreased. When NIF was injected, TDR decreased from 55 ± 10 msec to 44 ± 8 msec (p < 0. 01) although QTc did not change. In a later phase, QTc increased (p < 0. 01) and QTcpe recovered. T wave amplitude rapidly decreased and became negative. Conclusion: Injected into the pericardial space, NIC and NIF brought about certain changes in ERP, QT and T waveform.

Methods and Results: In 35 patients with oral amiodarone and β-blocker therapy, and an ICD, we recorded the 87 -lead electrocardiogram during sinus rhythm (CONTROL- 1 group) under general anesthesia, and just after the termination of induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) by ICD shock, with or without NIF administration. In all recordings, the corrected QT interval (QTc) was measured in each lead. The dispersion of QTc (QTc-D; maximum QTc minus minimum QTc) was also measured. Compared with that in the CONTROL- 1 group, the QTc-D exhibited significant deterioration after ICD shock (61 ± 14 and 90 ± 19  ms 1 / 2, respectively; p< 0. 05).

Methods and Results: Between August 2007 and April 2009, 403 consecutive out-of-hospital patients with cardiopulmonary arrest were transferred to the Emergency Medical Service of Tokai University. Of these, 30 patients with first defibrillation failure or VF recurrence were enrolled for this NIF/AMD study. The final defibrillation success (and hospital survival rate) was 67 % (10 / 15) in the AMD and 47 % (7 / 15) in the NIF group. The discharge survival rate was 53 % (8 / 15) in the AMD and 21 % (4 / 15) in the NIF group (P = 0. 06). Notably, all 4 survivors in the NIF group could take up normal daily life again, whereas this was restricted to only 2 patients from the 11 survivors in the AMD group. The difference is probably partly attributable to longer time from AMD administration to defibrillation success compared with NIF. In the cases of defibrillation failure, VF continued in 4 / 8 by NIF, however, asystole or pulseless electrical activity occurred in 4 / 5 patients by AMD. Conclusions: AMD may be borderline superior over NIF to facilitate defibrillation in out-of-hospital patients with cardiopulmonary arrest. However, from the view point of preservation of brain function, NIF is not inferior to AMD for CP...|$|E
40|$|Background: Both <b>nifekalant</b> {{hydrochloride}} (NIF), {{a selective}} IKr blocker, and intravenous amiodarone (AMD), a multi-channel (including IKr blocking) blocker, {{have been reported}} to be efficacious for refractory arrhythmias. However, the optimal use of those antiarrhythmic drugs for refractory arrhythmia with severe heart failure has not been established. Intravenous AMD might be effective for arrhythmias refractory to NIF in patients with severe heart failure. Here, we report that intravenous amiodarone was effective in the treatment of nifekalant-resistant in a group of arrhythmia patients with severe heart failure. Methods: Eleven severe heart failure patients who had received intravenous AMD for treatment of NIF-resistant arrhythmias were included in this study, and retrospective analysis was performed. Clinical efficacy (terminative and preventive effects on arrhythmia) of intravenous AMD was evaluated. Results: All cases were emergent cases and had depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (30 ± 13 %). Clinical arrhythmias were ventricular fibrillation (VF) in four patients, ventricular tachycardia (VT) in six patients, and atrial fibrillation (AF) in one patient. NIF was administered to all patients by intravenous injection. After administration of NIF, VT/VF/AF was terminated in seven of the 10 patients, but a preventive effect was not obtained in any of the patients (NIF-resistance). Intravenous AMD (maintenance dose: 484 ± 166 mg/day) was effective both in termination (80 %) and in prevention (80 %) of VT/VF events in those patients. It was also effective in termination (80 %) and prevention (60 %) of AF events refractory to NIF. During continuous AMD administration, no significant adverse effects or proarrhythmic effects were observed in any of the patients. Five patients died within one month, but there was no arrhythmic deaths. Conclusions: Intravenous AMD was effective in NIF-resistant lethal arrhythmias and was relatively safe in emergent cases with severe heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Background: Complex {{fractionated}} atrial electrogram (CFAE) -targeted catheter ablation (CFAE ablation) {{requires a}} high rate of atrial fibrillation (AF) termination to provide good outcomes. We determined the optimal settings of CFAE software. Methods: In our 430 consecutive patients, AF was terminated in 97 (234 / 242) and 79 % (149 / 188) of patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively, by CFAE ablation combined with (31 %) or without (69 %) pulmonary vein isolation, occasionally with <b>nifekalant</b> infusion. We analyzed 109 consecutive patients who underwent CFAE ablation to determine the optimal settings for comparing subjective versus objective decisions by the CFAE software on CARTO 3. We compared three settings: the default setting (0. 05 – 0. 15  mV, 50 – 120  ms) and two modified settings (# 1 : 0. 05 – 0. 30  mV, 40 – 70  ms, # 2 : 0. 05 – 0. 13  mV, 10 – 20  ms). We retrospectively analyzed 11, 425 points during left atrial mapping before ablation and 10, 306 points that were subjectively detected and ablated as CFAE points. An interval confidence level ≥ 6 denoted a site with CFAE. Results: With the default setting, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive productive value, and negative productive values were 67, 42, 77, 48, and 73 %, respectively. With modified setting # 1, the values were 78, 55, 87, 74, and 77 %, respectively, versus 64, 82, 60, 53, and 91 %, respectively, for modified setting # 2. Conclusion: These data suggest that setting # 1 was generally superior to the default setting, whereas setting # 2 was optimal for excluding areas not requiring ablation. The optimal CFAE software setting was a voltage of 0. 05 – 0. 30  mV and an interval parameter of 40 – 70  ms...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundControversy {{exists as}} to whether atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) ablation guided solely by complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) has a good outcome despite not requiring pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). ObjectivesThe {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of AF ablation guided solely by targeting CFAE areas, and to determine whether its clinical efficacy has any relationship with unintentionally isolating the PV. MethodsWe studied 100 consecutive patients (ages 59 ± 11 years; 54 with paroxysmal, 35 persistent, and 11 long-standing persistent AF), who underwent CFAE-ablation. PV potential (PVP) was recorded before and after ablation. After excluding 39 patients in whom sinus rhythm could not be maintained before ablation by internal cardioversion and/or who had a history of PVI(s), PVPs were analyzed. ResultsAF was terminated during ablation in 98 % of paroxysmal, 80 % of persistent, and 55 % of long-standing persistent AF patients. <b>Nifekalant</b> (0. 3 – 0. 6 mg/kg) was administered in 30 %, 57 %, and 83 %, respectively. The common areas of CFAE around the PVs were anterior to the right PVs, posterior to the left PVs, and at the ridge of the left atrial appendage. Among 215 PVs in 61 patients (42 paroxysmal, 19 persistent), only 17 PVs (8 %) were unintentionally isolated. The atrial potential to PVP was prolonged (> 30 ms) in 13 % of PVs. After at least 12 months of follow-up (23 ± 5 months), 65 % of paroxysmal (11 % with drug), 54 % of persistent (37 % with drug), and 45 % of long-standing (60 % with drug) AF patients were free from atrial arrhythmia after one session. ConclusionsCFAE-ablation terminates AF without isolating PVs in a high percentage of patients, and yields excellent clinical outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Long QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS) is {{a disorder}} of the heart's electrical activity that infrequently causes severe ventricular arrhythmias {{such as a}} type of ventricular tachycardia called torsade de pointes (TdP) and ventricular fibrillation, which can be fatal. There have been no previous reports on the time-to-onset for LQTS based on data from spontaneous reporting systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the time-to-onset of LQTS according to drug treatment. We analyzed the association between 113 drugs in 37 therapeutic categories and LQTS including TdP using data obtained from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. For signal detection, we used the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Furthermore, we analyzed the time-to-onset data and assessed the hazard type using the Weibull shape parameter. The RORs (95 % confidence interval) for bepridil, amiodarone, pilsicainide, nilotinib, disopyramide, arsenic trioxide, clarithromycin, cibenzoline, donepezil, famotidine, sulpiride, and <b>nifekalant</b> were 174. 4 (148. 6 - 204. 6), 17. 3 (14. 7 - 20. 4), 52. 0 (43. 4 - 62. 4), 13. 9 (11. 5 - 16. 7), 69. 3 (55. 3 - 86. 8), 54. 2 (43. 2 - 68. 0), 4. 7 (3. 8 - 5. 8), 19. 9 (15. 9 - 25. 0), 8. 1 (6. 5 - 10. 1), 3. 2 (2. 5 - 4. 1), 7. 1 (5. 5 - 9. 2), and 254. 8 (168. 5 - 385. 4), respectively. The medians and quartiles of time-to-onset for aprindine (oral) and bepridil were 20. 0 (11. 0 - 35. 8) and 18. 0 (6. 0 - 43. 0) days, respectively. The lower 95 % confidence interval of the shape parameter β of bepridil was over 1 and the hazard was considered to increase over time. Our study indicated that the pattern of LQTS onset might differ among drugs. Based on these results, careful long-term observation is recommended, especially for specific drugs such as bepridil and aprindine. This information may be useful for the prevention of sudden death following LQTS and for efficient therapeutic planning...|$|E
