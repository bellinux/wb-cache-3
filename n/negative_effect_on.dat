30|$|The {{main results}} showed that a vast {{majority}} of the examined measures support both policy objectives and thereby contribute effectively to sustainable transportation. However, there were also measures with conflicting effects, although the number of those measures was limited. Specifically, no examined environmental measure had documented <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> road safety, but an increase in bicycling and walking is likely to have <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> road safety. The road-safety measures with documented <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the environment included winter maintenance of roads, studded tires, and daytime running lights. Road lighting and grade-separated junctions are likely to have <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the environment. In addition, {{there were a number of}} measures with no interaction.|$|R

The shark itself {{is too small to}} be of value, and is only infrequently taken, as bycatch, on pelagic longlines and in midwater trawls and plankton nets. The lack of significant population threats, coupled with a worldwide distribution, has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the Big Four is generally seen {{to have had a}} positive impact on tennis, making the sport more exciting and in turn attracting more attention. However, with all four members being from European countries, this may have had a potentially <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> interest in North America. It has also been argued that the dominance of the Big Four has made the game predictable or even boring.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E

5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The American Medical Association conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E
5|$|Corley instituted {{sweeping}} changes in {{leadership in the}} regiment, hoping to improve its combat performance. He was able {{to cut down on}} straggling to a degree with more strict threats of court martial, but this had a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the regiment's morale. He began a unit newspaper, eventually called Eagle Forward, and moved to allow more discourse for the soldiers and leaders of the unit, and this was shown to improve the morale to a degree. Wanting to build a sense of pride in the unit, he sought to emphasize the toughness of the battles the regiment had seen, and played up its victory at the Battle of Yechon while downplaying other poor performances.|$|E
5|$|Jean {{was one of}} {{the writers}} and {{producers}} who worked on The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film that was released in 2007. The show's voice cast was signed on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The producers of The Simpsons were initially worried that creating a film would have a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the show, as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects. As the show progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and Brooks were therefore able to invite Jean (who continued to work as show runner on the television show) to produce the film with them.|$|E

5|$|Manuel Máximiliano Alberti (28 May 1763 – 31 January 1811) was {{a priest}} from Buenos Aires, {{when the city}} {{was part of the}} Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. He had a curacy at Maldonado, Uruguay during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, and {{returned}} to Buenos Aires in time {{to take part in the}} May Revolution of 1810. He was chosen as one of the seven members of the Primera Junta, which is considered the first national government of Argentina. He supported most of the proposals of Mariano Moreno and worked at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspaper. The internal disputes of the Junta had a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> his health, and he died of a heart attack in 1811.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1893 had a {{severely}} <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the Hoosier economy when many factories closed and several railroads declared bankruptcy. The Pullman Strike of 1894 hurt the Chicago area and coal miners in southern Indiana {{participated in a}} national strike. Hard times were not limited to industry; farmers also felt a financial pinch from falling prices. The economy began to recover when World War I broke out in Europe, creating a higher demand for American goods. Despite economic setbacks, advances in industrial technology continued throughout {{the last years of}} the 19th and into the 20th century. On July 4, 1894, Elwood Haynes successfully road tested his first automobile, and opened the Haynes-Apperson auto company in 1896. In 1895, William Johnson invented a process for casting aluminum.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{widespread}} in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator. This includes much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 2015, there were 296 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 731,000 deaths. Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa. Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%, but increased from 2014 during which there were 198 million cases. Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> economic development. In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and negative effects on tourism.|$|E

5|$|The herd {{has been}} studied {{periodically}} since the late 1980s, with researchers recommending various management strategies depending on the focus of their study. Current herd levels {{have been shown to}} have a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> their environment, and researchers focused on environmental issues recommend a severe reduction in herd numbers. Other researchers, looking at genetic variability, state that a herd size nearly as large as current is necessary to prevent inbreeding, but also state the herd is not genetically unique enough to warrant special preservation. The National Park Service has no current management plan for the horses, and their one effort to create one was blocked by Jack Kingston, a Georgia member of the US House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to {{various factors such as}} lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E
5|$|Feethams was {{originally}} used by Darlington Cricket Club, but {{began to be}} used for football in the 1860s. Darlington F.C. began playing there when they formed in 1883. With growing crowd figures, the ground was expanded with the construction of the West stand {{at the turn of the}} century and the Polam Lane end in 1905. In 1913, a pair of towers were built at the entrance to the ground, and in 1920, offices and changing rooms were built underneath the East stand. Floodlights were installed in September 1960, but after their first use an electrical fault gutted the West stand in a fire, prompting its rebuilding. In 1997, the East stand was demolished and rebuilt as an all-seater stand, but its cost had a major <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the club's finances. George Reynolds came in to the club, paid its debts and initiated construction of a new stadium. The last match played at Feethams was a 2–2 draw with Leyton Orient on 3 May 2003. Following the closure of the ground, the floodlights were sold to Workington A.F.C. and the stadium demolished. A housing estate was planned for the cleared site.|$|E
