40|$|Ion {{cyclotron}} {{heating and}} current drive at ω ≈ 2 ωcH in JET deuterium plasmas with a hydrogen concentrationnH/(nD+nH) {{in the range}} of 5 – 15 % are analysed, comparing results of <b>numerical</b> <b>computer</b> <b>modelling</b> with experiments. Second harmonic hydrogen damping is found to be maximized by placing the resonance on the low-field side (LFS) of the torus, which minimizes competing direct electron damping and parasitic high-harmonic D damping in the presence of D beams. The shape of the calculated current perturbation and the radial localization of the heating power density for the LFS resonance are consistent with the experimentally observed evolution of the sawtooth period when the resonance layer moves near the q = 1 surface. Since the calculated driven current is dominated by a current of diamagnetic type caused by finite orbit widths of trapped resonating ions, it is not too sensitive to the ICRF phasing. Control of sawteeth with ion cyclotron current drive using the LFS ω ≈ 2 ωcH resonance in the present experimental conditions can thus be best obtained b...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} captures {{our current}} understanding of groundwater quality, quantity and interaction with rivers. The Namoi catchments {{are some of}} the most extensively studied catchments in Australia and the World. But there are still many gaps in our understanding of groundwater which limit our capacity to manage how we allocate between all stakeholders including rural industries, mining, urban users and the environment. To allow for a better informed discussion on groundwater usage improvements are needed in the science underlying catchment management. Estimating catchment scale water fluxes is not an exact science. There are errors in estimating rainfall recharge, river recharge, irrigation returns to the aquifer, inflows through basement rocks, discharge via the rivers, evapotranspiration losses, surface water storage losses, and quantifying flood events. This is why catchment water balances have to be modelled and best estimates given (ideally with confidence intervals). Through improved measurement techniques, higher resolution data and advancement in <b>numerical</b> <b>computer</b> <b>modelling</b> techniques the errors associated with quantifying water fluxes through the catchment can be reduced and water management decisions improved.

40|$|The {{trend towards}} {{miniaturization}} of electronic products {{leads to the}} need for very small sized solder joints. Therefore, there is a higher reliability risk that too large a fraction of solder joints will transform into Intermetallic Compounds (IMCs) at the solder interface. In this paper, fracture mechanics study of the IMC layer for SnPb and Pb-free solder joints was carried out using finite element <b>numerical</b> <b>computer</b> <b>modelling</b> method. It is assumed that only one crack is present in the IMC layer. Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) approach is used for parametric study of the Stress Intensity Factors (SIF, KI and KII), at the predefined crack in the IMC layer of solder butt joint tensile sample. Contrary to intuition, it is revealed that a thicker IMC layer in fact increases the reliability of solder joint for a cracked IMC. Value of KI and KII are found to decrease with the location of the crack further away from the solder interfaces while other parameters are constant. Solder thickness and strain rate were also found to have a significant influence on the SIF values. It has been found that soft solder matrix generates non-uniform plastic deformation across the solder-IMC interface near the crack tip that is responsible to obtain higher KI and KII...|$|E

The investigation has focused on a medium sized products tanker acting as a midpoint of the spectrum of ship sizes within the range of 20, 000 – 60, 000 DWT of this type. In order to solve such an extensive problem, in the first place, it was important to analyse the energy efficient technology market in a structured manner and then, to identify the most favourable fuel consumption reduction methods that can be associated with the examined ship type. Next, an integrated computer simulation model, involving linked engine, propeller and hull analysis programs, has been developed and calibrated with the model tests and sea trial data. The ship system has been analysed under diverse conditions including various propulsion systems, innovative machinery arrangements, efficiency enhancing hydrodynamic appendages as well as changing weather and load conditions. The evaluation of potential benefits associated with the deployment of innovative technology(s), operation profile(s) or their combination has been made by comparing the designated Energy Efficiency Indicators (EDI), namely, the propulsive efficiency, fuel oil consumption, exhaust emissions footprint and EEDI, respectively associated with the technical, fuel savings, environmental and legal perspectives.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this report is to present two <b>numerical</b> <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> that compute the static and the transient displacements and stresses in pavement systems consisting {{of one or more}} distinct layers of material. Both models are based on the boundary element method, which is described in detail in the attachment. The static model is capable of predicting the static solution, which is sometimes also the steady-state distribution of stresses and displacements anywhere within a layered pavement system. The dynamic model is capable of representing the propagation of displacement and stress waves across the interfaces separating the layers and includes the wave scattering effects of reflection and refraction from these interfaces. The transient displacements and stresses tend towards the static or steady-state solution as time tends to infinity, thus complimenting the solution obtained with the static boundary element method. Both of these methods are validated through a comparison with existing analytical and numerical solutions in the literature. Finally, both the static and dynamic <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> are applied to typical three layered rigid pavement configurations and loads to provide examples of the potential usefulness of these methods in developing appropriate guidelines for transient loading conditions.
