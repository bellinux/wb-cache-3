5|$|While {{the rivalry}} was {{somewhat}} subdued by the lopsidedness {{of the two}} teams records, the rivalry did provide some moments. On April 15, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilled Chase Utley in the back, after a few Mets pitchers {{had been hit by}} the Phillies. On August 25, during a game at Citizens Bank Park Phillies coach Larry Bowa started yelling out of the dugout after a quick pitch by Mets reliever Hansel Robles while Darin Ruf was in the box <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> and not ready for the pitch. Bowa also yelled at Mets 1st baseman Daniel Murphy over a perceived slight by Murphy's bat flip earlier in the game during a home run. Benches cleared as Bowa threatened Murphy with retaliation and was ultimately ejected from the game.|$|E
60|$|He edged away at once, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> even; and Razumov saw his gaunt, shabby, famine-stricken figure {{cross the}} street obliquely with lowered head and that {{peculiar}} exact motion of the feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see why {{you should}} pity her," [...] said Joyce, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> from her embroidery. There was just the merest tremor in her voice. Miss Sally looked at her sharply.|$|E
60|$|The face of Professor de Worms darkened, {{and he did}} <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|The man did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> {{but held}} out the paper with a drowsy grunt.|$|R
60|$|Daddy {{began to}} snivel. Agnes could <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> for shame. Will felt sick. Ed laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rose {{will do as}} she pleases," [...] said Martin, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> {{from the}} book which, {{according}} to his custom then and in after-life, he was studying over his bread and milk.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun, {{absorbed in}} a stupor of {{apprehension}} of surging water-plants, sat crouched on the shoal, drawing, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> {{for a long}} time, and then staring unconsciously, absorbedly at the rigid, naked, succulent stems. Her feet were bare, her hat lay on the bank opposite.|$|E
6000|$|But, angrily {{resolved}} not {{to betray}} herself, she seized her work, {{and went on}} making false stitches and pricking her fingers with much perseverance, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> or taking notice {{of what was going}} forward, until all the three voices united in [...] "Let us take the road." ...|$|E
60|$|Dick {{glanced at}} Ida, and {{imagined}} {{that she was}} interested, though she did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|MacIan {{lifted his}} head and looked at the Master steadily, but Turnbull did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|Philippa {{had taken}} up her work. Her fingers ceased their labours, but she did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{last three}} or four rehearsals we {{performed}} in company with the principals. Divided counsels rendered them decidedly harassing. Our chief comedian had his views, and they were decided; the leading lady had hers, and was generous with them. The author of the English version possessed his also, but of these nobody took much notice. Once every twenty minutes the stage manager washed his hands of the whole affair and left the theatre in despair, and anybody's hat that happened to be handy, to return a few minutes later full of renewed hope. The sentimental baritone was sarcastic, the tenor distinctly rude to everybody. Mr. Hodgson's method was to agree with all and listen to none. The smaller fry of the company, together with the more pushing of the chorus, supported each in turn, when the others were <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> <b>Up</b> to the dress rehearsal it was anybody's opera.|$|E
60|$|The {{floor of}} one of the rooms was {{burdened}} with immense packages, containing parts of the Washington monument, ready to be forwarded to its destination. When finished, and set up, it will probably make a very splendid appearance, by its height, its mass, its skilful execution; and will produce a moral effect through its images of illustrious men, and the associations that connect it with our Revolutionary history; but I do not think it will owe much to artistic force of thought or depth of feeling. It is certainly, in one sense, a very foolish and illogical piece of work,--Washington, mounted on an uneasy steed, on a very narrow space, aloft in the air, whence a single step of the horse backward, forward, or on either side, must precipitate him; and several of his contemporaries standing beneath him, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> to wonder at his predicament, but each intent on manifesting his own personality to the world around. They {{have nothing to do with}} one another, nor with Washington, nor with any great purpose which all are to work out together.|$|E
60|$|When {{the old man}} was <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> {{some point}} of his saint's history in his books, he was taking with the hopefulness of youth and the {{patience}} of age a lesson in colloquial Italian from his landlady's daughter, which he pronounced with a scholarly scrupulosity and a sincere atonic Massachusetts accent. He practised the language wherever he could, especially at the trattoria where he dined, and where he made occasions to detain the waiter in conversation. They humoured him, out of their national good-heartedness and sympathy, and they did what they could to realise a strange American dish for him on Sundays--a combination of stockfish and potatoes boiled, and then fried together in small cakes. They revered him as a foreign gentleman of saintly amiability and incomprehensible preferences; and he was held in equal regard at the next green-grocer's where he spent every morning five centessimi for a bunch of radishes and ten for a little pat of butter to eat with his bread and coffee; he could not yet accustom himself to mere bread and coffee for breakfast, though he conformed as completely as he could to the Italian way of living. He respected the abstemiousness of the race; he held that it came from a spirituality of nature to which the North was still strange, with all its conscience and sense of individual accountability. He contended that he never suffered in his small dealings with these people from the dishonesty which most of his countrymen complained of; and he praised their unfailing gentleness of manner; this could arise only from goodness of heart, which was perhaps the best kind of goodness after all.|$|E
60|$|Sheila {{took a deep}} breath, but did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> 'I am {{entirely in}} your hands,' she replied.|$|R
60|$|Tess again {{shook her}} head, her throat {{swelling}} with complicated emotion. She could <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at d'Urberville.|$|R
60|$|He {{read the}} {{sentence}} through three times, and then recollected {{that he had}} <b>not</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> the Draconian reforms.|$|R
50|$|After {{she arrived}} at the Chu palace, the king looked down on the women's {{quarters}} and noticed her <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> no matter what he offered her. He then made her his principal wife. Both she and his chief minister cautioned against the appointment of his son Shangchen as crown prince. After the king ignored the advice, Shangchen caused the downfall of the minister. After this, the King wanted to appoint a younger son as heir apparent instead, but now Zheng Mao advised against this, predicting civil war.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{because there}} {{continues}} to be a high number of homelessness in Oregon - crime relating to such issue is <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up.</b> Businesses have begun to make it known that they are not accepting the presence of homeless people around their businesses regardless the circumstances these people are in. Some of the complaints given are that homeless people 'scare customers away'; 'they are too noisy'; and 'they block the way' {{just to name a few}} complaints. This obviously does not sit well with any local or state government given that businesses generate revenue and no customers mean less revenue. Such differences led to the local and state government to come up with laws which criminalize homelessness and begging on the streets. Such law which was called the 'sidewalk obstruction ordinance' gave authorities the power to arrest homeless people congregating or living on the sidewalks. This was however, quashed by a judge's decision in 2009. This decision took away the main tool which the police and business owners had to gain power over the homeless people. Such ordinance is similar to the 'vagrancy laws' which criminalizes various things including homelessness even though there is no criminal activity involved.|$|E
60|$|He {{went away}} without another word, and Babbie watched {{him from the}} window. Nanny had <b>not</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> from the ring.|$|R
60|$|Blood did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> {{from his}} task. There {{was not the}} need. He knew the voice, as I have said.|$|R
60|$|Concho shuddered. Could it be {{that the}} devil was really going to fly away with his mule? He dared <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|She stirred {{her coffee}} absently. At first {{he thought that}} she might be offended, for she did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> for several moments.|$|R
60|$|The door of {{the blue}} room opened. Jims did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> It was Aunt Augusta, of course--and she had heard the whole story.|$|R
60|$|She {{heard him}} moving towards her, {{but she did}} <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> The next moment his arms were round her, and he was babbling.|$|R
60|$|The {{voice that}} put the {{question}} was so very kind, that Polly dared <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> because she knew what the eyes were silently saying.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mustn't disturb {{your friends}} on my account," [...] she said quietly. She did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> but Trent felt keenly the {{alteration}} in her manner.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused at}} the door, but Mrs. Bowman did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> A second later the front door closed and she heard him walk rapidly away.|$|R
6000|$|Allie did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> As {{she carried}} the tray to the large table she heard a man whisper low: [...] "By jove!... Hough, that's the girl!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An angel," [...] Miss Jillgall answered, solemnly. [...] "A {{destitute}} earthly creature like me must <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> {{as high as}} your father. I {{might be}} dazzled." ...|$|R
60|$|Jethro did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> Mr. Balch went to {{the table}} and seized a pen and filled out a check for an amount that shall be nameless.|$|R
60|$|Though she did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at him, she started. There was a {{difference}} between the proposition and the covenant, which she had felt only too quickly.|$|R
60|$|Helen did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> {{again until}} she was near the porch. She had dreaded this meeting, yet she was so glad {{that she could have}} cried aloud.|$|R
60|$|When Conger {{reached the}} house he found the Appletons sitting around the {{television}} set. They did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> as he came in. He lingered at the door.|$|R
