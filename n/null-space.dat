He is captured in his hotel room. A high-ranking officer named Cherkassky tries to render Tallon harmless by erasing his memory of the jump data, using a device called a [...] "brain brush". He thinks that he has succeeded, but Tallon {{is equipped with a}} gadget that can sequester certain memories. Cherkassky enjoys tormenting people, and he is known for destroying most of the memories of prisoners who annoy him. He begins by erasing Tallon's memory of a loved one; the sense of loss enrages Tallon, and he attacks Cherkassky in a bid for escape. He is blinded when Cherkassky shoots him in the face with a dart gun, destroying his eyes. He is taken to a secret prison complex in the southernmost tip of the most distant continent to convalesce. While he is there, he enlists the aid of the scientific elite among the other political prisoners there, and together they design a pair of electronic [...] "sonar" [...] eyes. The headgear delivers different tones to distinguish various objects. Later, they make another breakthrough: they make a device that can sense and interpret the nerve signals of the eyes of nearby living things. Tallon can now see, but only through others' eyes. After they develop and test this device, Tallon and his partner Winfield try to break out, but Winfield is shot during the attempt. Tallon must flee alone, depending on encountering local animal life in order to see. Tallon escapes and travels across the continent, reaching his secret contact after much difficulty.

40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{approach}} for inversion of large random matrices in massive Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. It {{is based on the}} concept of inverse vectors in which an inverse vector is defined for each column of the principal matrix. Such an inverse vector has to satisfy two constraints. Firstly, it has to be in the <b>null-space</b> of all the remaining columns. We call it the <b>null-space</b> problem. Secondly, it has to form a projection of value equal to one in the direction of selected column. We term it as the normalization problem. The process essentially decomposes the inversion problem and distributes it over columns. Each column {{can be thought of as}} a node in the network or a particle in a swarm seeking its own solution, the inverse vector, which lightens the computational load on it. Another benefit of this approach is its applicability to all three cases pertaining to a linear system: the fully-determined, the over-determined, and the under-determined case. It eliminates the need of forming the generalized inverse for the last two cases by providing a new way to solve the least squares problem and the Moore and Penrose’s pseudoinverse problem. The approach makes no assumption regarding the size, structure or sparsity of the matrix. This makes it fully applicable to much in vogue large random matrices arising in massive MIMO systems. Also, the <b>null-space</b> problem opens the door for a plethora of methods available in literature for <b>null-space</b> computation to enter the realm of matrix inversion. There is even a flexibility of finding an exact or approximate inverse depending on the <b>null-space</b> method employed. We employ the Householder’s <b>null-space</b> method fo...|$|E

40|$|Rank-revealing ULV and URV factorizations {{are useful}} tools to {{determine}} the rank and to compute bases for <b>null-spaces</b> of a matrix. However, in the practical ULV (resp.

As a result, algorithms based on these factorizations may be expensive, especially on parallel computers where triangular solves are expensive. In this paper we propose an alternative approach. Our new rankrevealing ULV factorization, which we call "top-down" ULV factorization (TDULV -factorization) is based on right null vectors of lower triangular matrices and therefore no triangular solves are required. Right null vectors are easy to estimate accurately using condition estimators such as incremental condition estimator (ICE).

40|$|In essence, {{designing}} a perfect-reconstruction (PR) biorthogonal cosine-modulated filter bank (BCM) is a non-convex constrained optimization problem {{that can be}} solved in principle using general optimization solvers. However, {{when the number of}} channels is large and the order of the prototype filter (PF) is high, numerical difficulties in using those optimization solvers often occur, and the computational efficiency also becomes a concern.

In the first stage, a convex Lagrangian relaxation technique is used to obtain a near PR (NPR) filter bank and, in the second stage, the coefficient vector of the PF obtained is alternately projected onto the <b>null-spaces</b> that are associated with the PR constraints, which turns the NPR filter bank into a PR filter bank.
