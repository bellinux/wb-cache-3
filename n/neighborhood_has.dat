5|$|The modern city of Ashdod {{city was}} built outside the {{historic}} settlement site, on virgin sands. The development followed a main development plan.

5|$|The {{defining}} {{dynamic characteristic}} of a planet {{is that it has}} cleared its neighborhood. A planet that has cleared its <b>neighborhood</b> <b>has</b> accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the IAU's official definition of a planet in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets. Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.|$|E
