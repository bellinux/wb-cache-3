She said in 2011 that she chose {{emancipation}} as she was influenced by other young actors doing it. In 1997, unhappy with the roles they were being offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled Blink. It was sold, but <b>nothing</b> <b>happened</b> with it.|$|E
5|$|Amira goes to Yusef for help, {{saying she}} needs him on her side, {{threatening}} to tell Zainab that Yusef {{bought her a}} plane ticket {{if he does not}} help her get Syed back. She convinces Zainab to talk to Yusef, and when Yusef sees 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), who has recently come out as homosexual, running out of Christian's flat, he asks if Christian acted inappropriately. At first Ben says <b>nothing</b> <b>happened</b> but later Ben tells Yusef that Christian touched him, and they tell Ben's father, Phil. This turns out to be untrue, but leads to Christian leaving Syed and Walford.|$|E

5|$|One famous {{demonstration}} of Dunstan's charismatic style and media savvy came in January 1976. A psychic predicted that, due to Dunstan and the state's social liberalisation—which {{he saw as}} sinful—God would destroy Adelaide with a tsunami caused by an earthquake. This was publicised by the media, prompting a not insignificant number of residents to sell their property and leave; some businesses had clearance sales while many who decided to stay indulged in doomsday parties. Dunstan promised {{to stand on the}} seashore at Glenelg and wait for the imminent destruction. He did so on 20 January, the day of the predicted storm, and <b>nothing</b> <b>happened,</b> although he made newspaper headlines in the United Kingdom for his defiance.|$|E
5|$|Hela and {{the rest}} of the fleet {{anchored}} off Helgoland on 811 September. During the day the ships conducted training with steam tactics. On 11 September the ships returned to Wilhelmshaven where on the following two days the ships replenished their coal supplies. On 14 September the final operation of the annual maneuvers began. The situation specified that the naval war had gone badly for Germany; only four battleships were still in service, along with Hela, Freya, and a division of torpedo boats. The ships were to be stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river to protect the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and access to Hamburg. On 15 September, the hostile force blockaded the Elbe, along with other rivers and harbors on the North Sea. The torpedo boats, which had been scattered in the previous engagement, were tracked and destroyed by the hostile force. The hostile battleship squadron steamed to the mouth of the Elbe, where Hela, Freya, and the remaining torpedo boats were stationed as lookouts. <b>Nothing</b> <b>happened</b> during the day of 16 September, but that night several German torpedo boats managed to destroy one of the blockading cruisers and badly damage another. The following day, Prinz Heinrich engaged Hela and Freya briefly before forcing the two ships to retreat. The weather began to storm so the operation was postponed until the following day. That morning, the hostile fleet forced its way into the Elbe, past the fortifications at the mouth of the river. The German flotilla made a desperate attack which resulted in the sinking of two of the hostile battleships. The hostile force, however, ultimately overwhelmed the outnumbered German ships and the exercise ended with their victory.|$|E

The opposition to these shut-door beliefs was led by Joshua Himes and make up the second post-1844 group. This faction soon gained the upper hand, even converting Miller to their point of view. Their influence was enhanced by the staging of the Albany Conference. The Advent Christian Church has its roots in this post-Great Disappointment group.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the Finnish Seamen's Union {{proposed}} the Finnish government that SuomenJoutsen should {{be turned into}} a stationary seamen's school. As <b>nothing</b> <b>happened,</b> the Union renewed its proposal with a different tone in the late 1950s when it learned that the government was planning to sell the old full rigged ship for German scrap dealers and, in fact, the first payment had already been made. The Union gave its ultimatum on 29 April 1959 and when the government did not react, the crews of the inspection ships under the Finnish Maritime Administration went on a strike on 2 May. Before the action could spread, the government acceded and it was agreed that SuomenJoutsen would be stationed in Turku. However, due to intentional delays <b>nothing</b> <b>happened</b> until Niilo Wälläri, the leader of the Finnish Seamen's Union, presented his final ultimatum on 13 January 1960: if the preparations to turn SuomenJoutsen into a seamen's school did not begin immediately, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers would go into strike on 15 January, effectively stopping all foreign trade. Two days later, icebreaker Sampo began towing the former school ship through the icefields towards Turku, where the convoy arrived on 17 January 1960. This {{was also one of the}} last missions of the old steam-powered icebreaker before she was decommissioned and sold for scrap.|$|E
25|$|Serpico was a plainclothes {{police officer}} working in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan to expose vice racketeering. In 1967 he {{reported}} credible evidence of widespread systematic police corruption. <b>Nothing</b> <b>happened,</b> until he met another police officer, David Durk, who helped him. Serpico believed his partners knew about his secret meetings with police investigators. Finally, he contributed to an April 25, 1970, New York Times front-page story on widespread corruption in the NYPD which drew national attention to the problem. Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed a five-member panel to investigate accusations of police corruption. The panel became the Knapp Commission, named after its chairman, Whitman Knapp.|$|E

The battle lasted 6 days during which Abu Ubaida {{transferred}} the command of the entire army to Khalid. The five times larger Byzantine army was defeated in October 636 CE. Abu Ubaida held a meeting with his high command officers, including Khalid to decide on future conquests. They decided to conquer Jerusalem. The siege of Jerusalem lasted four months after which the city agreed to surrender, but only to Caliph Umar Ibn Al Khattab in person. Amr ibn Al As suggested that Khalid should be sent as Caliph, because of his very strong resemblance of Caliph Umar.|$|E
25|$|On the Batavian {{right wing}} of General Daendels, {{absolutely}} <b>nothing</b> <b>happened</b> that day, as the inundations made his lines impenetrable. There was a strange incident when the British General Don, under cover of a flag of truce, tried to get permission to cross the Batavian lines {{on a mission to}} the Batavian government. As on the Batavian left wing the battle had clearly started, Daendels considered this an abuse of the flag of truce. Besides, Don turned out to have papers on his person that could be considered to be of a seditious nature. Daendels therefore arrested Don as a spy and sent him to Brune's headquarters. Don was incarcerated in the fortress of Lille and only years later exchanged for the Irish rebel James Napper Tandy.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} said Waiting for Godot, with {{destructive}} intent, {{that it is a}} drama in which absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>happens.</b> 2 ̆ 2 And does that seem a small accomplishment? 2 ̆ 2 we should ask. This is precisely what is so fascinating about Waiting for Godot: that <b>nothing</b> <b>happens.</b> It is a lucid testimony of nothingness. But while we are left cold by many dramas of intrigue in which a great deal happens, this 2 ̆ 2 <b>nothing</b> <b>happens</b> 2 ̆ 2 of Waiting for Godot keeps us in suspense. These men who are bored cast us out of our own boredom; their boredom produces our catharsis, and we follow their adventure breathlessly, for they have suddenly placed us before the 2 ̆ 2 <b>nothing</b> <b>happens</b> 2 ̆ 2 of our lives. The gray and meaningless mass of our everyday existence is suddenly illuminated, disclosing its true structure, naked and desolate. That is the great revelation. Besides, we are not before a plotless drama. We are before a mono-situational plot. Considered in this light, Waiting for Godot is a drama which conforms to the artistic requirements of traditional drama. It is rooted in sure ground, the only ground in which theater can be seriously rooted: situation. Thus, 2 ̆ 2 <b>nothing</b> <b>happens</b> 2 ̆ 2 can be the form in which the most extraordinary and profound events are presented, just as 2 ̆ 2 many things happen 2 ̆ 2 can be a form of emptiness. Waiting for Godot captures this 2 ̆ 2 <b>nothing</b> <b>happens</b> 2 ̆ 2 which constitutes our daily existence. For this reason, it is a familiar picture, a radiographic plate in which we recognize ourselves with horror. The story of Waiting for Godot is precisely a story of our lives. [URL]...|$|R
