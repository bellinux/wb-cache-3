25|$|The {{first part}} of {{qualifying}} saw Button top the time sheets, with a lap of 1:38.531. With all the optimism of {{the pace of the}} Force India, Fisichella came 16th and was knocked out. Another big name that failed to make it was Kazuki Nakajima who came 2nd in practice just a few hours beforehand. Trulli, Alguersuari and Badoer were the others that joined them in <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> through to Q2.|$|E
25|$|He is {{probably}} the second fastest bowler in Sri Lanka, behind Lasith Malinga. Despite <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> to the Caribbean he was selected in the Sri Lankan squad for a post World Cup tournament against Pakistan at Abu Dhabi. He made his One Day International debut {{in the first game}} of the series but failed to take a wicket. However, he made significant strides in the 2008 CB series, where he picked up 8 wickets at 35.75 each.|$|E

25|$|On March 17, 2015, {{ratification}} by {{a majority}} of presbyteries was reached on a constitutional amendment passed by that same 2014 General Assembly, which broadened the definition of marriage in the Directory for Worship from only being between “a man and a woman,” to “two people, traditionally a man and a woman,” thus giving official sanction to, while <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> mandatory for, any congregation's pastor to preside over and bless marriage ceremonies for same-gender couples.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> on the {{international}} stage with Sri-Lanka, Boteju has been picked to play for Nottinghamshire Rifles. His recent scores include a duck, with bowling figures of 45 of 3 overs, for no wickets. He scored 3 first class fifties and one century. He has been consistently working on his big hitting which has resulted in him being promoted up the order in one day matches and twenty20 matches. Arjuna Ranatunga recently stated that Boteju has the potential for an international comeback after being selected for the ICC Charity XI.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, he {{returned}} to Olympiacos, where he won the double again. Also, his team got {{very close to the}} second round of the Champions League by collecting ten points, however the defeat against Liverpool F.C. with 3–1 in the last game stopped them <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> to the next round. Olympiacos went as far as the fourth round of the UEFA Cup. Despite these good results, he quit, mainly due to the pressure from Gate 7 fans who were not satisfied with the team's way of playing, although the majority of the fans were on his side.|$|E

25|$|Coventry {{began playing}} proper cricket {{in the third}} grade in Whitestone School, for whom he played two years in the colts team and two in the senior. His best {{performance}} was taking a hat-trick with his leg breaks. In his final two years he represented Matabeleland Primary Schools team, in the national Primary Schools Cricket Weeks, scoring a couple of fifties but <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> into the national age group side. He went to High School at Christian Brothers College, Bulawayo, and was selected for the national U14s side, progressing through the U16s and U19s as well. His best performance was 94 against the South African side Northerns. He played for CBC Senior team for two years, having scored a hundred against the strong St. Johns U16 side.|$|E
25|$|At Martinsville, Kenseth {{came into}} a turn going very fast, causing {{his car to}} wheel-hop. He hit Kevin Harvick hard, who's still in the Chase, causing Harvick to spin. Harvick hit the wall hard and fell 42 laps back. After hitting Harvick, a {{sideways}} Kenseth was bumped by Tony Stewart and straightened Kenseth out of his spin with no more damage. Laps later, after Harvick {{had returned to the}} track, he saw Kenseth coming behind him. Harvick, purposely checked-up trying to smash up Kenseth's radiator. Kenseth saw what Harvick was doing and checked-up enough to avoid serious damage. Kenseth still finished in 6th place and is in 4th place of the Chase. Harvick finished in 33rd putting Kenseth 28 points down and swore that if this race is the cause of him <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> further into the Chase, {{that he was going to}} cause Kenseth not to make it either.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{defended the}} Honinbo title once more, which {{would lead to}} him {{defending}} {{it again and again}} until 1999. He did terribly (in Cho terms) due to <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> through to the Meijin. In the same year, more international tournaments come to be. These include the Tong Yang Cup and the Fujitsu Cup. Cho wasn't very successful in these, winning only one in 1991, the Fujitsu Cup. He lucked out in the 1991 Fujitsu Cup because his opponent Qian Yuping had health issues to pay attention to and couldn't compete in the final. He lost the Judan once more and lost the play-off of the Kisei. His record looked better when he ended with 30 wins and 17 losses. 1992 was nothing special. The only events to note are his defending of the Honinbo and losing the semi-final of the Ing Cup. Remnants of the old Cho were coming back with his 31–16 record.|$|E

500|$|Racist local laws, discriminatory social codes, {{segregated}} commercial facilities, {{racial profiling}} by police, and sundown towns made road journeys a minefield of constant uncertainty and risk. Road trip narratives by blacks reflected their unease {{and the dangers}} they faced, presenting a more complex outlook from those written by whites extolling the joys of the road. Milloy recalls the menacing environment that he encountered during his childhood, in which he learned of [...] "so many black travelers ... just <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> to their destinations." ...|$|E
500|$|The fact-checker {{concluded}} that Ryan– [...] "Randall" [...] under pseudonym– {{had not been}} interviewed and that in [...] "one of the story's many unfathomable deceits", as The Washington Post put it, the article pretended {{that he had been}} interviewed. The Columbia report cited the fact-checker: [...] "I pushed. ... They {{came to the conclusion that}} they were comfortable" [...] with <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> clear to readers that they had never contacted Ryan. Ultimately, the report determined that Rolling Stone had exhibited confirmation bias and failed to perform basic fact checking by relying excessively on the accuser's account without verifying it through other means.|$|E
500|$|The Heart is a {{human heart}} {{modified}} with technology and the supernatural, that helps the player to find collectible items in the levels, and [...] "plays a part related to informing [...] decisions about when to apply violence or <b>not,</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> a really interesting, more subtle part of the power fantasy." [...] The Heart provides contextual verbal feedback to the player, offering insight into a particular location, the secrets or history of a character, and its own origins. The Heart was originally designed {{as a method of}} identifying assassination targets using vibration and sound mechanics. The design then developed into the concept of the Heart speaking and feeling alive and having its own agenda. As a result of player-conducted testing of the game, the designers decided that a more direct navigation system was required. The Heart's gameplay role continued to change, and it continued to provide narration on its perceptions of different characters, which helped to reinforce the narrative themes and to differentiate the city's social classes in a more subtle alternative to having the characters provide expository dialogue. Colantonio and Smith were concerned that optional use of the Heart would result in some players missing the information it provides, but they considered that it was a part of giving the player the freedom to choose how to play.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "clever, ground-breaking", [...] "fitting" [...] and [...] "hugely satisfying" [...] episode {{reminded}} hdtvuk.tv's Ian Calcutt of s finale [...] "", while TV Squad's Richard Keller noted strong {{similarities to}} a two-part episode of [...] named [...] "Year of Hell". He was [...] "extremely {{sad to see}} [...] go", but could not overlook the mediocrity, predictability and lack of originality of the series finale. TV Zones Anthony Brown, who considered the episode [...] "curious low-key", regretted the planned direct-to-DVD films, as [...] "the whole thing inevitably loses its punch as the reset button's pressed , rather than providing the genuine emotion of an actual ending". Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune thought that the episode went out on [...] "a strange note" [...] with a disappointing last [...] "string of banal clichés" [...] dialogue exchange, although the cast and the established goodwill of their characters could partly make up for it. Mary McNamara of Multichannel News lauded Cooper's direction, lighting, costuming, the [...] "haunting" [...] music and sound, the production values and special effects. She acknowledged the SG-1 finale as a [...] "true ensemble/team piece" [...] with [...] "a poignant and satisfying conclusion", and despite <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> into the top ten of series finales, the episode was [...] "very good" [...] and [...] "respects and rewards the ten year commitment viewers have made to the series". David Bianculli from the New York Daily Times gave the episode {{two and a half}} out of five and saying the franchise stopped [...] "Without warning" [...] thanks to this episode.|$|E
500|$|With most of {{the plot}} in place, Shusett and O'Bannon {{presented}} their script to several studios, pitching it as [...] "Jaws in space." [...] They {{were on the verge}} of signing a deal with Roger Corman's studio when a friend offered to find them a better deal and passed the script on to Gordon Carroll, David Giler, and Walter Hill, who had formed a production company called Brandywine with ties to 20th Century Fox. O'Bannon and Shusett signed a deal with Brandywine, but Hill and Giler were not satisfied with the script and made numerous rewrites and revisions. This caused tension with O'Bannon and Shusett, since Hill and Giler had very little experience with science fiction; according to Shusett, [...] "They weren't good at making it better, or, in fact, at <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> even worse." [...] O'Bannon believed that Hill and Giler were attempting to justify taking his name off of the script and claiming his and Shusett's work as their own. Hill and Giler did add some substantial elements to the story, however, including the android character Ash—which O'Bannon felt was an unnecessary subplot but which Shusett later described as [...] "one of the best things in the movie...That whole idea and scenario was theirs." [...] Hill and Giler went through eight drafts of the script in total, concentrating largely on the Ash subplot but also making the dialogue more natural and trimming some sequences set on the alien planetoid. Despite the fact that the final shooting script was written by Hill and Giler, the Writers Guild of America awarded O'Bannon sole credit for the screenplay.|$|E
2500|$|Tiffany also {{submitted}} a {{design for the}} reverse of the seal, but even though Congress had ordered one a die was not created. The members of the consulting group were somewhat disparaging of the design of even the obverse, but especially critical of the reverse, and suggested <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> at all. Dwight eventually agreed and did not order the die, though {{he said it was}} [...] "not improper" [...] that one eventually be made. To this day, there has never been an official die made of the reverse.|$|E

50|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to Miner 2049er in that the player must inspect every section of 25 mines while {{avoiding}} mutants within a set time.

Despite spending {{the final days of the}} campaign in a hospital recovering from a heart attack, she won the election handily. After amalgamation, Davidson was still mindful of local sentiment towards the neighbourhood name of Leaside, and, while <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> official, insisted that the name 'Leaside' be retained for any public building or space.|$|E
2500|$|Leaked {{extracts}} from an internal 10 February 2010 memo by Amnesty's Asia-Pacific director Sam Zarifi, were published by The Sunday Times. [...] In the memo Zarifi said Amnesty {{had made a}} mistake in <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>it</b> clearer they did not support Begg's views. Zarifi said Amnesty [...] "did not always sufficiently distinguish between the rights of detainees to be free from torture, and the validity of their views", adding that the organisation [...] "did not always clarify that while we champion the rights of all—including terrorism suspects, and more important, victims of terrorism—we do not champion their views”. In a subsequent letter to The Sunday Times, Zarifi said he agreed with Amnesty's actions with regard to Sahgal.|$|E
