5|$|It {{is thought}} that these plants that have evolved protocarnivorous habits {{typically}} reside in habitats {{where there is a}} significant nutrient deficiency, but not the severe deficiency in nitrogen and phosphorus seen where true carnivorous plants grow. The function of the protocarnivorous habit, however, need not be directly related to lack of nutrient access. Some classic protocarnivorous plants represent convergent evolution in form but <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> function. Plumbago, for example, possesses glandular trichomes on its calyces that structurally resemble the tentacles of Drosera and Drosophyllum. The function of the Plumbago tentacles is, however, disputed. Some contend that their function is to aid in pollination, adhering seeds to visiting pollinators. Others note that on some species (Plumbago auriculata), small, crawling insects have been trapped in the Plumbagos mucilage, which supports the conclusion that these tentacles could have evolved to exclude crawling insects and favor flying pollinators for greater seed dispersal or perhaps for protection against crawling insect predators.|$|E

25|$|As {{defined by}} Hogan and Sternad, “posture” is a nonzero time {{period during which}} bodily {{movement}} is minimal. When a movement is called “discrete,” it means that a new posture is assumed without any other postures interrupting the process. “Rhythmic” movements are those that occur in cycles of similar movements. “Repetitive,” “recurrent,” and “reciprocal” movements feature a certain bodily or joint position that occur {{more than once in}} a period, but <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> a cyclic manner.|$|E

It is common in dogs, especially seen in breeds such as Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, and Shih Tzus. The most common symptom is itching. Affected areas include the underside, the face, the feet, and the ears.|$|E

25|$|Historian William McNeill {{asserts that}} the Antonine Plague and the later Plague of Cyprian (251–ca. 270) were {{outbreaks}} of two different diseases, one of smallpox and one of measles, <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> that order. The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors. Other historians believe that both outbreaks involved smallpox. The latter view seems {{more likely to be}} correct given that molecular estimates place the evolution of measles sometime after 500 AD.|$|E

Completing a pair (two of a kind) scores two points; {{three or four}} of a kind are counted as {{multiple}} pairs: completing three of a kind is the same as three different pairs, or 6 points, and four of a kind is 6 different kinds of pairs, or 12 points. A run of three or more cards (consecutively played, but <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> order) scores the number of cards in the run.|$|E
25|$|Debussy {{began work}} on Pelléas in September 1893. He decided to remove four scenes from the play (Act I Scene 1, Act II Scene 4, Act III Scene 1, Act V Scene 1), {{significantly}} reducing {{the role of the}} serving-women to one silent appearance in the last act. He also cut back on the elaborate descriptions that Maeterlinck was fond of. Debussy's method of composition was fairly systematic; he worked on only one act at a time but <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> chronological order. The first scene that he wrote was Act 4 Scene 4, the climactic love scene between Pelléas and Mélisande.|$|E
25|$|At {{least ten}} monuments, {{including}} the Verrazzano, Coast Guard and Wireless memorials, were {{stored in the}} park behind a temporary fence from 2004 or 2005 until 2016 {{as the result of}} a long-term renovation of Battery Park. Controversy over the statues' integrity arose in 2015 after renovations took longer than expected. Representatives of NYC Park Advocates and the Italian-American organization UNICO expressed concern about the statues' condition, although experts said there should be no long-term physical harm. The monuments have since been installed in or around the perimeter of the park, although <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> their previous locations.|$|E

25|$|Camps were <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> remote areas. They {{were often}} {{situated}} near hamlets, or even within them - with troops taking shelter in individual houses if {{the village was}} fully dominated by the guerilla forces. After digging in, telephone wire was run, units positioned and contact made with other surrounding military formations - especially militia and guerrilla fighters. These local units were crucial in warning, diversion and delay of GVN or US forces if the Main Force element came under attack. Communist forces generally avoided villages with high canal banks, graveyards or trees because such obstacles hindered observation and gave advancing US and ARVN troops cover. Mines and booby traps were also planted along likely avenues of approach.|$|E
25|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology perspective states {{that many of}} the perceived limitations in rational choice can be explained as being rational in the context of maximizing biological fitness in the ancestral environment, but <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> the current one. Thus, when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may result in death, it may have been rational to place a greater value on preventing losses than on obtaining gains. It may also explain behavioral differences between groups, such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable reproductive success than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success from successful risk-seeking much more than females can.|$|E
25|$|The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland {{is divided}} into nine dioceses. Each diocese is headed by a Bishop and a cathedral chapter. The Archdiocese of Turku is headed by the Archbishop, who is {{personally}} responsible for leading two deaneries within that diocese. He is assisted by a Bishop of Turku who takes day-to-day responsibility for running {{the rest of the}} diocese, leaving the Archbishop free for his duties of national leadership and international representation. The bishops meet together regularly in the Bishops' Conference, which has eleven members; these are the Archbishop, his assistant Bishop of Turku, the other eight diocesan bishops, and the Chaplain General of the Defence Forces, whose title is kenttäpiispa ("field bishop"), although he is <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> bishop's Orders.|$|E
