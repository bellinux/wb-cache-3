30|$|In {{preventing}} underground explosion, China initially {{adopted the}} Polish measures {{to use the}} rock dust barriers. However, the “caking” problems of the rock dust limited its effectiveness in explosion control. Since 1980 s, <b>water</b> <b>barriers</b> have been extensively used as an explosion mitigation measure in Chinese underground mines. The principles of <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> are similar as rock dust barrier. In an explosion event, the precursor shock wave would overturn the <b>water</b> <b>barriers</b> or break the water bags to release the stored water into the air. The released water, if fully mixed with the flame front, can greatly reduce the explosion intensity by acting as heat sinker and flame retardant. The effects of water on preventing mine gas/dust explosion under specific experimental conditions are evident. However, when the water is poured from its containers in underground conditions, it is often poorly dispersed in space and can only suspend in air for a short duration. Therefore, the potential effectiveness of the <b>water</b> <b>barriers</b> in suppressing the explosion is greatly reduced. The water barriers’ poor performances in preventing underground explosions have been evidenced {{by a number of}} serious mine explosion accidents in Chinese coal mines. Hence, the necessity and reliability of <b>water</b> <b>barriers</b> are now questioned by a number of Chinese mine safety experts and engineers.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOxygen and <b>water</b> vapor <b>barrier</b> {{coatings}} {{were made}} by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition on a polymer multilayer substrate. Plasma deposition was realized on the external PET layer of the substrate by using a RF plasma source and two different precursors (trimethylsilane (TMS) and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO)). Two types of monolayer deposits (SiOx and SiOxCzHw) were investigated for each precursor. The structure and composition of the deposited coatings were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and XPS analysis. Their surface topography was imaged by AFM and the surface energy was determined thanks to contact angle measurements. Oxygen and <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> properties of the coated substrate were interpreted in terms of coating structure and composition and TMS was identified as the most interesting precursor for enhanced barrier properties. The sensitivity of the coatings to thermal exposure was also investigated. A multilayer deposit approach consisting in alternating organic and inorganic deposited layers was developed.

40|$|The {{outcome of}} this {{research}} project suggests that the transport of radon in water is significantly greater than that predicted solely by molecular diffusion. The original study {{was related to the}} long term storage of {sup 226 }Ra-bearing sand at the DOE Fernald site and determining whether a <b>barrier</b> of <b>water</b> covering the sand would be effective in reducing the emanation of {sup 222 }Rn from the sand. Initial observations before this study found the transport of radon in water to be greater than that predicted solely by molecular diffusion. Fick's law on diffusion was used to model the transport of radon in water including the impact associated with radioactive decay. Initial measurements suggested that the deposition of energy in water associated with the radioactive decay process influences diffusion and enhances transport of radon. A multi-region, one-dimensional, steady-state transport model was used to analyze the movement of radon through a sequential column of air, water and air. An effective diffusion coefficient was determined by varying the thickness of the water column and measuring the time for transport of {sup 222 }Rn through of the <b>water</b> <b>barrier.</b> A one-region, one-dimensional transient diffusion equation was developed to investigate the build up of radon {{at the end of the}} water column to the time when a steady-state, equilibrium condition was achieved. This build up with time is characteristic of the transport rate of radon in water and established the basis for estimating the effective diffusion coefficient for {sup 222 }Rn in water. Several experiments were conducted using different types and physical arrangements of <b>water</b> <b>barriers</b> to examine how radon transport is influenced by the <b>water</b> <b>barrier.</b> Results of our measurements confirm our theoretical analyses which suggest that convective forces other than pure molecular diffusion impact the transport of {sup 222 }Rn through the <b>water</b> <b>barrier.</b> An effective diffusion coefficient is defined that includes effects of molecular diffusion and convection to describe the transport of radon in water. The effective diffusion coefficients measured in these experiments are 6. 8 x 10 {sup - 4 } {+-} 28 % and 3. 5 x 10 {sup - 4 } {+-} 34 % cm{sup 2 } sec{sup - 1 } for the steady-state and transient diffusion conditions, respectively. <b>Water</b> <b>barriers</b> ranging in thickness from 30 - 50 cm reduce the amount of radon released from the radium-bearing source material by a factor of 0. 3 - 0. 1, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{epidermal}} <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> {{resides in}} the stratum corneum (SC) and is dependent on a highly organized network of multi-lamellar membranes comprised of a critical lipid composition. The SC membranes are formed from precursor membranes packaged in cytoplasmic lamellar bodies in the stratum granulosum and delivered to the SC by exocytosis. An abnormal lipid composition of the SC membranes often results in a disrupted <b>water</b> <b>barrier</b> and the clinical appearance of ichthyosis. This cutaneous feature is characteristic of Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS), an inborn error of lipid metabolism caused by deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). The contribution of FALDH to normal epidermal function has become increasingly evident with the recognition that this enzyme has {{an essential role in}} metabolism of several lipids, including fatty aldehydes and alcohols, ether glycerolipids, isoprenoid alcohols and certain lipids that undergo ω-oxidation, such as leukotriene B 4 and very long-chain fatty acids. In the absence of FALDH, the skin produces lamellar bodies that are empty, lack their surrounding vesicle membranes or contain granular contents rather then the usual cargo membranes. These defective organelles also have impaired exocytosis, which results in structurally abnormal, deficient multi-lamellar membranes in the SC and a leaky <b>water</b> <b>barrier.</b> Although the exact biochemical mechanism for the cutaneous pathology is still unclear, studies in SLS demonstrate the critical importance of FALDH for normal epidermal structure and function...|$|R
