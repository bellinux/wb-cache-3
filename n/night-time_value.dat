Field {{observations}} of temperature {{and the intensity}} of light were used in concert with data from a continuously monitoring pulse amplitude modulating (PAM) fluorometer to create an expert system decision table of in hospit zooxanthellae response to high sea temperature and intense light. A diffuse attenuation based spectral slope coefficient (SKd) is developed to provide real-time enhancement of optical data from discrete detector bands to estimate the full spectra and intensity of light at a coral's surface. During studies with a PAM fluorometer, seawater temperature was increased by less than 1 o C (starting temperature 29. 4 o C) over four days, and resulted in subtle decreases in fluorescent yield in two Montastrea faveolata just before the onset of coral bleaching. Following this increase, cloudy conditions reduced insolation levels which lead to fluroescent yield recovery from a low <b>night-time</b> <b>value</b> of 0. 56 back to an initial value of 0. 61...|$|E
3000|$|Although data {{uncertainty}} estimates {{would be}} useful for consideration in the modelling, {{it is not possible}} to give stringent values for that purpose for any of our data sets. Error estimates for observatory values for H and Z components vary from 1  nT at HER to 1.5  nT for a remote location such as TSU or KMH, depending on the accuracy of the baselines. Similar for D, the errors can vary from 10 " [...] at HER to 20 " [...] at places like TSU and KMH. For the repeat stations, an estimate of measurement uncertainties can be obtained from the scatter of the individual results at a particular location and from any observed systematic difference between evening and morning observations. This provides error estimates of 1 – 2  nT in H and Z and 0.3 – 0.5  min in D. However, {{it is not possible to}} assess how much external field influence remains in any observatory data average or particular <b>night-time</b> <b>value.</b> These contributions, which will often dominate over the measurement uncertainties, should also not be considered by a main field model. We therefore expect any model misfits to be clearly larger than the numbers stated above.|$|E

Our calculations show that the G condition {{is more likely to}} occur {{during the first half of}} a day than during the second half of a day, at all latitudes during all seasons for the same value of the solar zenith angle. The F 1 -layer occurrence probability is larger in the first half of a day in comparison with that in the second half of a day for the same value of the solar zenith angle in latitude range 1 for all seasons, while the F 1 -layer occurrence probability is approximately the same for the same solar zenith angle before and after noon in latitude ranges 4 and 5. The F 1 -layer and G condition are more commonly formed near midday than close to post sunrise or pre-sunset. The chance that the day-time F 1 -layer and G condition will be formed is greater in summer than in winter at the given solar zenith angle in latitude ranges 2 ? 5, while the F 1 -layer occurrence probability is greater in winter than in summer for any solar zenith angle in latitude range 1. The calculated occurrence probability of the Nm F 2 weak negative disturbances reaches its maximum and minimum values during daytime and night-time conditions, respectively, and the average <b>night-time</b> <b>value</b> of this probability is less than that by day for all seasons in all studied latitude regions. It is shown that the Nm F 2 normal, strong, and very strong negative disturbances are more frequent on average at night than by day in latitude ranges 1 and 2 for all seasons, reaching their maximum and minimum occurrence probability values at night and by day, respectively. This conclusion is also correct for all other studied latitude regions during winter months, except for the Nm F 2 normal and strong negative disturbances in latitude range 5. A difference in the dependence of the strong and very strong Nm F 2 negative disturbance percentage occurrences on the solar zenith angle is found between latitude ranges 1 and 2. Our results provide evidence that the daytime dependence of the G condition occurrence probability on the solar zenith angle is determined mainly by the dependence of the F 1 -layer occurrence probability on the solar zenith angle in the studied latitude regions for winter months, in latitude range 2 for all seasons, and in latitude ranges 4 and 5 for spring, summer, and autumn months. The solar zenith angle trend in the probability of the G condition occurrence in latitude range 3 arises in the main from the solar zenith angle trend in the F 1 -layer occurrence probability. The solar zenith angle trend in the probabilities of strong and very strong Nm F 2 negative disturbances counteracts the identified solar zenith angle trend in the probability of the G condition occurrence...|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the scale height in the topside ionosphere region remains rather poor due to the insufficient observations carried so far. To advance this knowledge, presented here is a new method of retrieving the topside ionospheric scale height based on radio occultation observations onboard low-earth-orbiting satellites. The scale height, well known for its dependence on the temperatures and masses of the ionospheric constituents, understandably experiences large spatial and temporal variability. With {{the help of the}} CHAMP satellite's occultation experiment, analysed is the scale height behaviour with respect to solar and geomagnetic activity, local time, season, longitude and latitude. The expected strong dependence on temperature has been confirmed; however, it has been found that this dependence is not straightforward but more complex and clearly affected by other factors. For example, while the daytime scale height values increase at higher solar activity, the <b>night-time</b> <b>values</b> do not show such a trend. The seasonal dependence proved to be strong with summer-time values significantly higher than winter-time numbers. Also, there is no common pattern for the diurnal variations: sometimes daytime values are higher, sometimes the <b>night-time</b> <b>values</b> dominate; large differences are detected from season to season and from latitude to latitude. Generally, the scale increases at higher latitudes, although a few differences do exist. No major longitudinal and hemispheric differences have been detected so far. Based on the accumulated data, a first attempt has been made to empirically simulate the scale height value at 425 km altitude; as input parameters, the model respects the local time, latitude, and season. The scale height model can be implemented into the electron density profile retrieval procedure by delivering an improved initial guess...|$|R

The semi-annual anomaly around noon is generally present in all the years. The only exception is in 2007 (where the spring values are missing).

The latitude variation of the magnitude of the annual (and semi-annual) variation for this case is determined and compared with results obtained at a number of stations in order to find the maximum amplitude of the coil movement.

The diurnal and seasonal changes agree closely with satellite drag and backscatter measurements, except that the maximum temperature occurs after sunset in winter.

On winter nights the transition height descends to the level set by chemical equilibrium. On summer nights the transition height is always above this level, giving a continual production of H(+) which serves as an additional source for maintaining the night-time ionosphere in the winter hemisphere...|$|R

In addition, {{it serves as a}} powerful tool to identify and separate different wave modes in the atmospheric data. In our work we present space-time spectral analyses of chemical heating rates derived from Scanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) hydroxyl nightglow emission measurements onboard Envisat for the years 2002 – 2006 at mesopause heights. Since SCIAMACHY nightglow hydroxyl emission measurements are restricted to the ascending (nighttime) part of the satellite orbit, our analysis also includes temperature spectra derived from 15 μm CO 2 emissions measured by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument. SABER offers better temporal and spatial coverage (daytime and <b>night-time</b> <b>values</b> of temperature) and a more regular sampling grid. Therefore SABER spectra also contain information about higher frequency waves. Comparison of SCIAMACHY and SABER results shows that SCIAMACHY, in spite of its observational restrictions, provides valuable information on most of the wave modes present in the mesopause region.

40|$|The pineal gland and retina of {{the turkey}} rhythmically produce melatonin. In birds kept under a daily light-dark (LD) {{illumination}} cycle melatonin {{concentrations in the}} pineal gland and retina were low during the light phase and high during the dark phase. A similar melatonin rhythm with high <b>night-time</b> <b>values</b> was also observed in the plasma. The pineal and retinal melatonin rhythms mirror oscillations in the activity of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AANAT; the penultimate enzyme in the melatonin biosynthetic pathway). In contrast, in both the pineal gland and retina {{the activity of the}} enzyme hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) did not exhibit significant changes throughout the 24 -h period. Acute exposure of turkeys to light at night dramatically decreased melatonin levels in the pineal gland, retina and plasma. The rhythms in AANAT activity and melatonin concentrations in the turkey pineal gland and retina were circadian in nature as they persisted under conditions of constant darkness (DD). Under DD, however, the amplitudes of AANAT and melatonin rhythms were significantly lower (by 50 - 80 %) than those found under the LD cycle. The findings indicate that melatonin rhythmicity in the turkey pineal gland and retina is regulated both by light and the endogenous circadian clock. The rapid dampening of the rhythms under DD suggests that of these two regulatory factors, environmental light may be the primary stimulus in the maintenance of the high amplitude melatonin rhythms in the turkey...|$|R
40|$|Although many biochemical, {{morphological}} {{and physiological}} {{processes in the}} vertebrate retina are controlled by a circadian (24 h) clock, {{the location of the}} clock and how the clock alters retinal function are unclear. For instance, several observations have suggested that dopamine, a retinal neuromodulator, may {{play an important role in}} retinal rhythmicity but the link between dopamine and a clock located within or outside the retina remains to be established. We found that endogenous dopamine release from isolated goldfish retinae cultured in continuous darkness for 56 h clearly exhibited a circadian rhythm with high values during the subjective day. The continuous presence of melatonin (1 nm) in the culture medium abolished the circadian rhythm of dopamine release and kept values constantly low and equal to the <b>night-time</b> <b>values.</b> The selective melatonin antagonist luzindole (1 μm) also abolished the dopamine rhythm but the values were high and equal to the daytime values. Melatonin application during the late subjective day introduced rod input and reduced cone input to fish cone horizontal cells, a state usually observed during the subjective night. In contrast, luzindole application during the subjective night decreased rod input and increased cone input. Prior application of dopamine or spiperone, a selective dopamine D 2 -like antagonist, blocked the above effects of melatonin and luzindole, respectively. These findings indicate that a circadian clock in the vertebrate retina regulates dopamine release by the activation of melatonin receptors and that endogenous melatonin modulates rod and cone pathways through dopamine-mediated D 2 -like receptor activation...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that vines of the Semillon {{wine grape variety}} show anisohydric behaviour was tested, i. e. that tissue hydration is unstable under fluctuating environmental conditions. Stomatal conductance and transpiration rates from leaves were measured {{during the day and}} at night. Leaf water potential (Ψl) in Semillon was negatively correlated to vapour pressure deficit (VPD) both predawn and during the day. Furthermore, Ψl fell to significantly lower values than in any of the nine other varieties examined. <b>Night-time</b> <b>values</b> of stomatal conductance (gn) and transpiration (En) in Semillon were up to four times higher than in other varieties; plants enclosed in plastic bags overnight to reduce En resulted in better plant–soil equilibration so that predawn Ψl in Semillon was the same as in Grenache. These data indicate that the hypothesis is supported, and that night-time transpiration contributes significantly to the low Ψl values in Semillon during warm, dry nights. The other contributing factor is daytime stomatal conductance (gday), which in Semillon leaves was higher than in other varieties, although the decline in gday with increasing VPD was greater in Semillon than in Shiraz or Grenache. The high values of gday were associated with high rates of transpiration (Eday) by Semillon through a day when VPD reached 4. 5 kPa. When compared to other varieties, Semillon was not unusual in terms of root length density, stomatal density, xylem sap abscisic acid, or leaf electrolyte leakage. Night-time and daytime water loss and insufficient stomatal regulation therefore account for the tendency to anisohydric behaviour shown by Semillon...|$|R

Individuals with night-time BP falls more than 10 % of the daytime values were defined as dippers. A bivariate analysis of the daytime and the night-time BP levels, as well as a liability-threshold model of dippers vs. nondippers were used. Results Bivariate model fitting showed no ethnic or sex differences for any of the measures, with heritabilities of 0. 70 and 0. 68 for SBP and 0. 70 and 0. 64 for DBP at daytime and at night-time. The genetic influences on daytime and night-time were not significantly different for SBP or DBP. The bivariate analysis also indicated that about 56 and 33 % of the heritabilities of night-time SBP and DBP could be attributed to genes that also influenced daytime levels. The specific heritabilities due to genetic effects only influencing <b>night-time</b> <b>values</b> were 0. 30 for SBP and 0. 43 for DBP. The heritabilities of systolic and diastolic dipping were 0. 59 and 0. 81, respectively.

Half-hourly values of evaporation, E, were calculated from diurnal changes in total soil profile water content, using the soil water balance equation. For the bare soil field, Profile Probes and ML 2 x ThetaProbes indicated a diurnal course of theta that did not concur with typical soil physical observations: surface layer soil moisture content increased from early morning until about midday, after which theta declined, generally until the early evening. The unexpected course of theta was positively correlated to soil temperature, T-s, also at deeper depths. Aquaflex and ML 1 ThetaProbe (older models) outputs, however, reflected common observations: 0 increased slightly during the night (capillary rise) and decreased from the morning until late afternoon (as a result of evaporation). For the vegetated plot, the spurious diurnal theta fluctuations were less obvious, because canopy shading resulted in lower amplitudes of T-s. The unrealistic theta profiles measured for the bare and vegetated field sites caused diurnal estimates of E to attain downward daytime and upward <b>night-time</b> <b>values.</b> In the mini-lysimeters, at medium to high moisture contents, theta values measured by (ML 2 x) ThetaProbes followed a relatively realistic course, and predictions of E from diurnal changes in vertically integrated theta generally compared well with lysimeter estimates of E. However, time courses of theta and E became comparable to those observed for the field plots when the soil in the lysimeters reached relatively low values of theta. Attempts to correct measured theta for fluctuations in T, revealed that no generally applicable formula could be derived. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The analysis shows the following: (a) all three models show the best agreement with the tomography data at the height 300 km (near hmF 2) in comparison with the heights below and above hmF 2 (200 and 400 km); (b) all three models systematically underestimate the electron density values in comparison with the tomography data at the height 200 km and overestimate them at the height 400 km; (c) for all investigated events the Ne (UAM) values are closest to Ne (tomo) in 399 of 1125 examined data points (36 %), Ne(RIM- 88) values are closest to Ne(tomo) in 510 cases (45 %) and Ne (IRI- 95) values are closest to Ne (tomo) in 216 cases (19 %).

It means that for all events RIM- 88 has the best agreement with the tomography measured electron densities, whereas UAM has the best agreement with the daytime tomography measured electron densities, and IRI- 95 has the worst agreement for both daytime and all events; (d) simulated UAM daytime values of electron density near the F 2 -layer maximum agree with corresponding tomography images for all seasons for the first half of 1999, covering almost the total range of the solar activity, so that no correction of the solar EUV flux (used as an input parameter in the UAM) is required; (e) a necessary correction of simulated precipitating soft electron flux intensities has to be made, in order to improve the consistency between measured <b>night-time</b> <b>values</b> of the electron density and those estimated by the theoretical model; (f) the simulated electron density behaviour caused by spatial, diurnal, seasonal variations, as well as due to a solar activity is consistent with the experimental tomographic images.

The tomographic images were interpreted by using simulation results obtained by the models which were also compared to one another. The analysis shows the following: (a) all three models show the best agreement with the tomography data at the height 300 km (near hm F 2) in comparison with the heights below and above hm F 2 (200 and 400 km); (b) all three models systematically underestimate the electron density values in comparison with the tomography data at the height 200 km and overestimate them at the height 400 km; (c) for all investigated events the N e (UAM) values are closest to N e (tomo) in 399 of 1125 examined data points (36 %), N e (RIM- 88) values are closest to N e (tomo) in 510 cases (45 %) and N e (IRI- 95) values are closest to N e (tomo) in 216 cases (19 %). For the only day-time events, the N e (UAM) values are closest to N e (tomo) in 274 of 624 data points (44 %), whereas N e (RIM- 88) day-time values are closest to N e (tomo) in 221 cases (36 %) and closest to N e (IRI- 95) values in 129 cases (20 %). It means that for all events RIM- 88 has the best agreement with the tomography measured electron densities, whereas UAM has the best agreement with the daytime tomography measured electron densities, and IRI- 95 has the worst agreement for both daytime and all events; (d) simulated UAM daytime values of electron density near the F 2 -layer maximum agree with corresponding tomography images for all seasons for the first half of 1999, covering almost the total range of the solar activity, so that no correction of the solar EUV flux (used as an input parameter in the UAM) is required; (e) a necessary correction of simulated precipitating soft electron flux intensities has to be made, in order to improve the consistency between measured <b>night-time</b> <b>values</b> of the electron density and those estimated by the theoretical model; (f) the simulated electron density behaviour caused by spatial, diurnal, seasonal variations, as well as due to a solar activity is consistent with the experimental tomographic images.

40|$|This article {{studied the}} {{potential}} seasonal heat-stress of dairy ewes {{housed in a}} typical naturally ventilated sheep barn located close to {{the east coast of}} central Greece. Heat stress was assessed using the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) and the Seasonal THI-hrs index. Dairy ewes were exposed to potential heat-stress (THI >= 22. 2) in 79 %, 17 %, and 11 % of summer, autumn, and spring hours, respectively, whereas no heat-stress was present during winter. The monthly means of the daily maximum hourly THI values remained above the extreme severe heat-stress threshold (i. e. 25. 6) during the summer months and above the severe heat-stress threshold (i. e., 23. 3) during May and September. During all summer days the minimum daily maximum hourly THI value was 24. 6 indicating that sheep experienced severe heat-stress (THI >= 23. 3). THI levels remained very high (usually above the extreme severe heat-stress threshold) during daytime and dropped below the heat-stress threshold (i. e., 22. 2) only for a few hours during <b>night-time.</b> The <b>values</b> of the Seasonal THI-hrs index under heat-stress conditions (THI >= 22. 2) were 6596, 975, 0, and 516 during summer, autumn, winter, and spring, respectively. These findings suggest that under summer conditions in the east coast of central Greece, dairy ewes were exposed to severe or extremely severe heat-stress conditions, while they were also partially exposed to severe or extremely severe heat-stress conditions during autumn and spring...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the water}} vapor product from MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument, {{on-board}} Aqua and Terra satellites, is compared against GPS water vapor data from 21 {{stations in the}} Iberian Peninsula as reference. GPS water vapor data is obtained from ground-based receiver stations which measure the delay caused by water vapor in the GPS microwave signals. The study period extends from 2007 until 2012. Regression analysis in every GPS station show that MODIS overestimates low integrated water vapor (IWV) data and tends to underestimate high IWV data. R 2 shows a fair agreement, between 0. 38 and 0. 71. Interquartile range (IQR) in every station is around 30 – 45 %. The dependence on several parameters was also analyzed. IWV dependence showed that low IWV are highly overestimated by MODIS, with high IQR (low precision), sharply decreasing as IWV increases. Regarding dependence on solar zenith angle (SZA), performance of MODIS IWV data decreases between 50 ° and 90 °, while night-time MODIS data (infrared) are quite stable. The seasonal cycles of IWV and SZA cause a seasonal dependence on MODIS performance. In summer and winter, MODIS IWV tends to overestimate the reference IWV value, while in spring and autumn the tendency is to underestimate. Low IWV from coastal stations is highly overestimated (∼ 60 %) and quite imprecise (IQR around 60 %). On the contrary, high IWV data show very little dependence along seasons. Cloud-fraction (CF) dependence was also studied, showing that clouds display a negligible impact on IWV over/underestimation. However, IQR increases with CF, except in <b>night-time</b> satellite <b>values,</b> which are quite stable...|$|R
30|$|It {{can be seen}} that, in general, the {{two models}} estimations (CCIR and URSI) follow the diurnal trend of the {{experimental}} foF 2 curves in winter (July) and fall (April): lower values are observed during night-time than during daytime in the three curves at both levels of solar activity. In generally the IRI predictions overestimate the observations during April at HSA and a good agreement is observed during LSA. In spring (October) the IRI predictions do not reproduced the post sunset peak observed in the experimental values. The model overestimation is also present in this month particularly at HSA. In summer (January) the diurnal variation observed in foF 2 is notpredicted by the model at HSA: The night time maximum is not reproduced by the IRI predictions. It is {{important to point out}} that in this season during <b>night-time</b> the URSI <b>values</b> are closer to the observations than the CCIR IRI option values. Moreover it is noted that the night/day differences are more pronounced in the measurements than in the IRI predictions. This is more evident at HSA.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of the meridional wind velocity on the latitudinal location of the enhanced electron density regions (EEDR’s) has been investigated using the global numerical model of the Upper Atmosphere Model (UAM). We have calculated the global distributions of the ionospheric F 2 -layer critical frequency {{under the condition that}} the equatorward wind velocity is constant at the <b>night-time</b> sector. The <b>values</b> of the velocity were changed from 0 to 100 m/s. It has been shown that the latitudinal location of the EEDR’s does not coincide with the location of the maximum of the vertical ion velocity induced by the wind. The EEDR’s are moved to the higher latitudes when the equatorward wind velocity increases. It has been proposed that the horizontal transfer of the plasma by neutral wind is the main cause of this displacement. The ions get a horizontal component vector of the velocity under the collisions with the neutral particles and the low latitudinal part of the EEDR’s removes from middle to the lower magnetic latitude. It results in the EEDR’s forming at the higher latitudes...|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} {{of renewable energy}} is widely recognised as a challenge for integrating high levels of renewable generation into electricity systems. However, to explore its implications effectively, variability itself should first be clearly understood. This is particularly true for national electricity systems with high planned penetration of renewables and limited interconnection such as the UK. Variability cannot {{be considered as a}} distinct resource property with a single measurable parameter, but is a multi-faceted concept best described by a range of distinct characteristics. This paper identifies relevant characteristics of variability, and considers their implications for energy research. This is done through analysis of wind, solar and tidal current resources, with a primary focus on the Bristol Channel region in the UK. The relationship with electricity demand is considered, alongside the potential benefits of resource diversity. Analysis is presented in terms of persistence, distribution, frequency and correlation between supply and demand. Marked differences are seen between the behaviours of the individual resources, and these give rise to a range of different implications for system integration. Wind shows strong persistence and a useful seasonal pattern, but also a high spread in energy levels at timescales beyond one or two days. The solar resource is most closely correlated with electricity demand, but is undermined by <b>night-time</b> zero <b>values</b> and an even greater spread of monthly energy delivered than wind. In contrast, the tidal resource exhibits very low persistence, but also much greater consistency in energy values assessed across monthly time scales. Whilst this paper focuses primarily on the behaviour of resources, it is noted that discrete variability characteristics can be related to different system impacts. Persistence and predictability are relevant for system balancing, whereas statistical distribution is more relevant when exploring issues of asset utilisation and energy curtailment. Areas of further research are also identified, including the need to assess the value of predictability in relation to other characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of investigations that have measured sediment properties related to intertidal sediment stability have been undertaken during daylight subaerial exposure periods. As a consequence, models based upon such data represent only partially the intertidal flat surface conditions within any 24 h period. In this contribution, a comparison is made between surface sediment properties related to sediment stability measured during six consecutive (day/night), semi-diurnal subaerial exposure periods, at three stations on an intertidal sand flat in late March 1999. The study site was selected {{on the basis}} of its suitability for sampling and data collection at night, with special regard to safety and logistics. Seawater temperatures ranged from 4. 1 to 9. 6 [deg]C, and salinities from 33. 9 to 34. 8. Eleven parameters related to intertidal flat sediment stability were measured, or derived. These variables included the critical erosion shear stress ([tau]c), chlorophyll a, phaeopigment, and colloidal carbohydrate content, mean grain size and settling velocity of the surface (0 - 1 mm) sediment fraction. Bed elevation was described using an acretion/erosion parameter (AEP) (West and West 1991), whilst additional physical terms included ambient seawater salinity and temperature, as well as tidal range and wind speed, during the preceding immersion periods. One-way ANOVA was used to detect significant differences between day- and night-time emersion periods; similarly, principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to detect continuous variation between properties. The results show a high degree of temporal and spatial variability between day- and night-time intertidal flat variables, the PCA differentiating clearly between day and night conditions. Surface sediments across the intertidal flat exhibited varying degrees of biostabilisation. The maximum biostabilisation coefficient (18) was recorded at night in high microalgal biomass areas; the minimum (5) occurred during both day and night, in areas with lower microalgal biomass. All surface sediment parameters varied rhythmically between day- and night-time. Significant differences were found between day- and night-time biostabilisation coefficients, however, differences between day- and <b>night-time</b> [tau]c <b>values</b> were not detected. It is suggested that sediment stability at night is enhanced in high microalgal biomass areas as a result of degradation products from bound extra-cellular polysaccharides (EPS) not easily detected using standard extraction procedure...|$|R
40|$|Intestinal enterococci are the {{principal}} ‘health-evidence-based’ parameter recommended by WHO {{for the assessment of}} marine recreational water compliance. Understanding the survival characteristics of these organisms in nearshore waters is central to public health protection using robust modelling to effect real-time prediction of water quality at recreation sites as recently suggested by WHO and the Commission of the European Communities Previous models have more often focused on the coliform parameters and assumed two static day-time and <b>night-time</b> T 90 <b>values</b> to characterise the decay process. The principal driver for enterococci survival is the received dose of irradiance from sunlight. In the water column, transmission of irradiance is determined by turbidity produced by suspended material. This paper reports the results of irradiated microcosm experiments using simulated sunlight to investigate the decay of intestinal enterococci in relatively turbid estuarine and coastal waters collected from the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel, UK. High-turbidity estuarine waters produced a T 90 value of 39. 5 h. Low-turbidity coastal waters produced a much shorter T 90 value of 6. 6 h. In experiments receiving no irradiation, high-turbidity estuarine waters also produced a longer T 90 of 65. 1 h compared with corresponding low-turbidity coastal waters, T 90 24. 8 h. Irradiated T 90 values were correlated with salinity, turbidity and suspended solids (r> 0. 8, p 200 NTU is similar to decay observed under dark conditions. Most significantly, these results suggest that modelling turbidity and or suspended solids offers a potential means of predicting T 90 values in ‘real-time’ for discrete cells of a hydrodynamic model...|$|R

In a double-blind randomised study, the effects of a 2 -week treatment with MPA (30 mg b. i. d.) or ACET (250 mg b. i. d.), followed by a 2 -week treatment with a combination of both drugs (MPA/ACET), on daytime and nocturnal ventilatory and blood gas parameters in 17 stable hypercapnic COPD patients were investigated. ACET, MPA and MPA/ACET treatment decreased mean daytime carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood by 0. 4, 0. 7 and 1. 2 kPa, respectively. Minute ventilation was improved only with combined therapy, from 9. 3 to 11. 2 L x min(- 1). With MPA/ACET therapy, the hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses significantly increased, from 3. 7 to 5. 8 L x min(- 1) x kPa(- 1) and from - 0. 13 to - 0. 40 L x min(- 1) x %(- 1), respectively. The mouth exclusion pressure response to hypoxia increased during combination therapy, from - 0. 01 to - 0. 03 kPa %(- 1). Nocturnal end-tidal carbon dioxide tension decreased with MPA and MPA/ACET treatment, by 0. 9 and 1. 4 kPa, respectively. MPA/ACET significantly increased mean nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation values, from 85. 5 to 90. 2 %.

40|$|Purpose: A {{small number}} of recent studies have linked daily cycles in stream {{turbidity}} to nocturnal bioturbation by aquatic fauna, principally crayfish, and demonstrated this process can significantly impact upon water quality under baseflow conditions. Adding to this limited body of research, we use high-resolution water quality monitoring data to investigate evidence of diel turbidity cycles in a lowland, headwater stream with a known signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) population and explore a range of potential causal mechanisms. Materials and methods: Automatic bankside monitoring stations measured turbidity and other water quality parameters at 30 -min resolution at three locations on the River Blackwater, Norfolk, UK during 2013. Specifically, we focused on two 20 -day periods of baseflow conditions during January and April 2013 which displayed turbidity trends typical of winter and spring seasons, respectively. The turbidity time-series, which were smoothed with 6. 5 hour Savitzky-Golay filters to highlight diel trends, were correlated against temperature, stage, dissolved oxygen and pH to assess the importance of abiotic influences on turbidity. Turbidity was also calibrated against suspended particulate matter (SPM) {{over a wide range}} of values via linear regression. Results and discussion: Pronounced diel turbidity cycles were found at two of the three sites under baseflow conditions during April. Spring <b>night-time</b> turbidity <b>values</b> consistently peaked between 21 : 00 and 04 : 00 with values increasing by ~ 10 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) compared with the lowest recorded daytime values which occurred between 10 : 00 and 14 : 00. This translated into statistically significant increases in median midnight SPM concentration of up to 76 % compared with midday, with night-time (18 : 00 – 05 : 30) SPM loads also up to 30 % higher than that recorded during the daytime (06 : 00 – 17 : 30). Relating turbidity to other water quality parameters exhibiting diel cycles revealed there to be neither any correlation that might indicate a causal link, nor any obvious mechanistic connections to explain the temporal turbidity trends. Diel turbidity cycles were less prominent at all sites during the winter. Conclusions: Considering the seasonality and timing of elevated turbidity, visual observations of crayfish activity, and an absence of mechanistic connections with other water quality parameters, the results presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that nocturnal bioturbation is responsible for generating diel turbidity cycles under baseflow conditions in headwater streams. However, further research in a variety of fluvial environments is required to better assess the spatial extent, importance and causal mechanisms of this phenomenon...|$|R

To this end {{we have used}} a combination of sun and star photometer measurements at the city of Granada (37. 16 &deg; N, 3. 60 &deg; W, 680 m a. s. l.; South-East of Spain) from 2007 to 2010. For the whole study period, mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 440 nm (± standard deviation) is 0. 18 ± 0. 10 and 0. 19 ± 0. 11 for day- and night-time, respectively, while the mean Angström exponent (&alpha;) is 1. 0 ± 0. 4 and 0. 9 ± 0. 4 for day- and night-time. The ANOVA statistical tests reveal that there are {{no significant differences between the}} AOD and &alpha; obtained at day-time and those obtained at night-time. Additionally, the mean day-time values of AOD and &alpha; obtained during this period are within the values obtained in the surrounding AERONET stations. On the other hand, AOD presents an evident seasonal pattern characterized by large values in summer (mean values of 0. 20 ± 0. 10 both at day- and <b>night-time)</b> and low <b>values</b> in winter (mean values of 0. 15 ± 0. 09 at day-time and 0. 17 ± 0. 10 at night-time). The Angström exponent presents clear seasonal pattern with low values in summer (mean values of 0. 8 ± 0. 4 and 0. 9 ± 0. 4 at day- and night-time) and relatively large values in winter (mean values of 1. 2 ± 0. 4 and 1. 0 ± 0. 3 at day- and night-time). These seasonal patterns are explained by the differences in the meteorological conditions and by the differences in the strength of aerosol sources during day and night. To take more insight about the changes in aerosol particles between day and night, the spectral difference of the Angström exponent (&delta;&alpha;) as function of &alpha; is also studied. This analysis reveals an increase in the fine mode radius and in the fine mode contribution to AOD during night-time, being more remarkable in summer seasons. These changes are explained by the changes in the local aerosol source emissions and meteorological conditions between day- and night-time, as well as aerosol aging processes...|$|R
