5|$|During {{their brief}} existence, Wicked Lester {{performed}} in public twice. The first show {{took place at}} the Rivoli Theatre in South Fallsburg, New York on April 23, 1971. The second, in late summer 1971, was at an Atlantic City, New Jersey hotel hosting a B'nai B'rith Youth Organization event. <b>Not</b> <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> show, the band suffered a major setback when they had all of their musical gear stolen. After a chance meeting with Electric Lady Studios engineer Ron Johnsen, Wicked Lester was given the opportunity to record some demos in late 1971. Johnsen, who produced the demo tape, shopped it to a few labels, with no success. Eventually the tape was screened by Epic Records, who purchased the masters and agreed to fund the recording of a full album. One of the conditions, however, was that Stephen Coronel be fired and replaced with a better guitarist.|$|E

The route crosses some local and county roads before entering Central Square, where it intersects with U.S. Route11 (US11) {{in the village}} center. It is <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> Route49 meets I-81 at exit32. Route49 leaves Central Square and heads southeast toward both Constantia and the Oneida Lake shoreline.|$|E

This alternative-history Cal took over the Grand Hall of Justice, killing hundreds of judges in the process, and crucified all his prisoners in the street. He was finally stopped by Dredd and killed (again {{with the help of a}} civilian, Darien Kenzie), but only after considerable loss of life.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} Pigpen did not slow the band down, and they {{continued}} {{with their new}} members. They soon formed their own record group, Grateful Dead Records. Later that year, they released their next studio album, the jazz-influenced Wake of the Flood. It became their biggest commercial success thus far. Meanwhile, capitalizing on Flood’s success, the band soon {{went back to the}} studio, and the next year, 1974, released another album, From the Mars Hotel. <b>Not</b> <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> album’s release however, the Dead decided to take a hiatus from live touring.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrialization}} {{drive was}} meant to be primarily a Peruvian process not totally excluding foreign investors but definitely not welcoming them warmly. In that spirit, the Velasco regime immediately nationalized IPC in October 1968 and, <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> the largest copper mining company, while taking over other foreign firms more peacefully through buy-outs. The government put into place new restrictions on foreign investment in Peru and led the way to a regional agreement, the Andean Pact, that featured some of the most extensive controls on foreign investment yet attempted in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|She {{suffered}} a minor stroke in 1956, and later underwent surgery on her jawbone for osteomyelitis. Twelve {{days after the}} operation, Davies fell in her hospital room and broke her leg. Davies made her last public appearance on January 10, 1960, on an NBC television special called Hedda Hopper's Hollywood. Joseph P. Kennedy rented Davies' mansion and worked from {{behind the scenes to}} secure his son John F. Kennedy's nomination during the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. It was <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> she was diagnosed with stomach cancer.|$|E

25|$|At 5:40p.m. the 160 men of 41 {{commando}} {{rushed the}} bombarded positions {{and soon after}} swept over the outer defences. <b>Not</b> <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> they entered the casemates, tunnels and bunkers, opening fire and they found many shocked and dazed Germans. Having taken nearly all the strongpoints, for the Germans {{it was clear that}} the station could no longer be defended. With their protective concrete breached the Germans surrendered. The assault was similarly successful on the small station on the Northern site that was found to contain thirty eight Germans but almost immediately they gave up; like the others they had been dazed, shocked and exhausted by the bombardment.|$|E
25|$|When told by Nick Chance of Cafiero's {{decision}} not to go, booking agent Gerrard suggested drummer Cathy Green, who was based in Canberra. Gerrard knew Green was {{a huge fan of}} X, and thus knew the songs, and was a great drummer in her own right who could fill in to save the Melbourne tour. Luckily Cathy agreed to do it, on a few days' notice. There were two hastily organised rehearsals prior to the Melbourne shows, {{which turned out to be}} a huge success. Cathy brought a new fresh yet solid feel to the band. Tragically, <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> Cafiero died when injected with a dye prior to an X-ray for a back complaint and Cathy became a permanent final member of X.|$|E
25|$|During the shad bake {{lunch at}} Rosser's camp, two of Munford's pickets rode up {{to report that}} Union forces were {{advancing}} on all roads. Fitzhugh Lee and Pickett decided that since they could not hear an attack, due {{as it turned out}} to the thick pine forest and heavy atmosphere between the camp and Five Forks and an acoustic shadow, there was little to worry about. Soon after 4:00p.m., Pickett asked Rosser for a courier to take a message to Five Forks. <b>Not</b> <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> two couriers were dispatched, the officers heard gunfire and saw the lead courier captured by Union horsemen on Ford's Road just across Hatcher's Run. Then they saw a Union Army battle line coming toward the road.|$|E

25|$|Early steel ploughs, {{like those}} for {{thousands}} of years prior, were walking ploughs, directed by the ploughman holding onto handles {{on either side of the}} plough. The steel ploughs were so much easier to draw through the soil that the constant adjustments of the blade to react to roots or clods was no longer necessary, as the plough could easily cut through them. Consequently, it was <b>not</b> <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> the first riding ploughs appeared. On these, wheels kept the plough at an adjustable level above the ground, while the ploughman sat on a seat; whereas, with earlier ploughs the ploughman would have had to walk. Direction was now controlled mostly through the draught team, with levers allowing fine adjustments. This led very quickly to riding ploughs with multiple mouldboards, dramatically increasing ploughing performance.|$|E
25|$|J.T. and Colleen become {{embroiled in}} Lily Winters' (Christel Khalil) drama with {{internet}} predator Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). They discourage Lily from being with him. After Lily engages in illegal intercourse with him, Colleen tells Lily's parents, Neil (Kristoff St. John) and Drucilla (Victoria Rowell). They have him arrested. In retaliation, Kevin attempts to murder Colleen by locking {{her in a}} freezer inside a burning building. J.T. rescues her and carries {{her out of the}} building. The couple moves on from the Kevin ordeal as J.T. begins to focus on his music career. This serves as a roadblock in their romance as Colleen becomes jealous of J.T.'s closeness with other girls in his music video. During a press conference, he also lies to a reporter about not having a girlfriend. Though he attempts to explain why he did that, Colleen decides to move back to New York to live with her mother so she will not be {{standing in the way of}} J.T.'s career. During her time away, he develops romantic feelings for his long-time friend Brittany, who plans to marry Bobby Marsino (John Enos III). Colleen returns to Genoa City briefly and J.T. deals with his feelings for both her and Brittany. She ultimately leaves town again and returns in 2006 intent on reuniting with J.T. However, he is dating Mackenzie Browning (then played by Rachel Kimsey) at the time. Colleen attempts to break them up. Ultimately, Mac's dependence on Kevin during her pregnancy and miscarriage, as well as J.T.'s cheating with Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), break the couple up. <b>Not</b> <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> he and Colleen reunite.|$|E
