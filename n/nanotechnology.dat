5|$|The Drexler–Smalley {{debate on}} {{molecular}} <b>nanotechnology</b> {{was a public}} dispute between K. Eric Drexler, the originator of the conceptual basis of molecular <b>nanotechnology,</b> and Richard Smalley, a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for {{the discovery of the}} nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular <b>nanotechnology,</b> but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of <b>nanotechnology</b> was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for <b>nanotechnology</b> research.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic DNA <b>nanotechnology</b> {{focuses on}} forming nucleic acid systems with {{designed}} dynamic functionalities {{related to their}} overall structures, such as computation and mechanical motion. There is some overlap between structural and dynamic DNA <b>nanotechnology,</b> as structures can be formed through annealing and then reconfigured dynamically, or {{can be made to}} form dynamically in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Smalley {{had also}} taken a {{prominent}} public policy role {{in relation to}} <b>nanotechnology,</b> and was an outspoken advocate for using <b>nanotechnology</b> to develop solutions to the world's energy and health problems, for example raising {{the possibility of using}} nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and transmission, and of developing nanomaterial-based drugs for targeted drug delivery. Smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes, having founded Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., and serving on the scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and <b>nanotechnology</b> startups. Smalley died of leukemia in October 2005, after the conclusion of his debate with Drexler.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{discussions about}} the evolvement of <b>nanotechnologies</b> criticize that the notion ‘risk’ is too {{abstract}} and an all-inclusive category. Moreover, the concept of risk is not precise enough to describe the potential {{issues related to the}} development of <b>nanotechnologies.</b> Instead, experts of technological development speak more about risk communication. Within the field of <b>nanotechnologies,</b> they even redefined this expression in February 2005 and related it {{to the question of the}} societal acceptance of <b>nanotechnologies.</b> Risk communication is about to gain stakeholder acceptance of policy decisions, whereas public and stakeholders are encouraged to participate actively in the communication process through public consultations, hearings, etc. Thus on the one hand, the category of risk has been pragmatically nuanced in order to better highlight the vulnerability of the communication on <b>nanotechnologies.</b> On the other hand, this vulnerable communication is not the result of a deficit of information. It is based on the idea of participation, where the vulnerability relies on the social groups specialized in the design, the application, and the diffusion of <b>nanotechnologies</b> within society. How is this participation possible, and what does it mean? We develop this question in the framework of a comparative survey on experts that are involved in the deployment of <b>nanotechnologies</b> in Grenoble (France) and Hamburg (Germany). <b>nanotechnologies,</b> society, risks, experts, collaboration. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nanotechnologies</b> are {{expected}} to be the dominant general purpose technology of the next decades. Their market potential is immense and especially demand side arguments will have far reaching consequences for innovations. They may occur as increased miniaturization or via building completely new products, processes or services. Innovations in the field of <b>nanotechnologies</b> do not only affect productivity in downstream sectors but these feed back to <b>nanotechnologies</b> thereby inducing circles of continuing innovation. Demand for nanocomponents mainly arises by firms while private demand is assigned to final products, processes or services that are augmented by <b>nanotechnologies.</b> Due to the technology’s controversial character, the consumer’s attitude towards risk and technology affects private demand and this may either spur or hamper innovation. The paper aims to unravel how these complex interdependencies and feedback mechanisms affect overall innovation that is induced by <b>nanotechnologies</b> and how this on its part affects further improvements of <b>nanotechnologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceNanoscience {{emerged in}} the late 1980 s and is {{developed}} and applied in China {{since the middle of}} the 1990 s. Although <b>nanotechnologies</b> have been less developed in agronomy than other disciplines, due to less investment, <b>nanotechnologies</b> have the potential to improve agricultural production. Here, we review more than 200 reports involving nanoscience in agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture. The major points are as follows: (1) <b>nanotechnologies</b> used for seeds and water improved plant germination, growth, yield, and quality. (2) <b>Nanotechnologies</b> could increase the storage period for vegetables and fruits. (3) For livestock and poultry breeding, <b>nanotechnologies</b> improved animals immunity, oxidation resistance, and production and decreased antibiotic use and manure odor. For instance, the average daily gain of pig increased by 9. 9 – 15. 3  %, the ratio of feedstuff to weight decreased by 7. 5 – 10. 3  %, and the diarrhea rate decreased by 55. 6 – 66. 7  %. (4) <b>Nanotechnologies</b> for water disinfection in fishpond increased water quality and increased yields and survivals of fish and prawn. (5) <b>Nanotechnologies</b> for pesticides increased pesticide performance threefold and reduced cost by 50  %. (6) Nano urea increased the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen fertilization by 44. 5  % and the grain yield by 10. 2  %, versus normal urea. (7) <b>Nanotechnologies</b> are widely used for rapid detection and diagnosis, notably for clinical examination, food safety testing, and animal epidemic surveillance.

40|$|Purposes. The {{aim of this}} {{preliminary}} survey was to picture the current knowledge and opinions of law students and medical students about <b>nanotechnologies.</b> Marterials and Methods. Data were collected in June 2012 by interviews with 60 students of the University of Camerino (Macerata, Italy) defined as “jurist population” and 159 medical students of the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Rome, Italy) defined as “medical population”. Results. The Authors found that both law and medical students have some knowledge on what <b>nanotechnologies</b> are; {{with regards to the}} ethical issues and risks perception, both categories indicated that <b>nanotechnologies</b> generate bioethical issues. Nevertheless, a high percentage of respondents believed that neither existing technologies nor <b>nanotechnologies</b> pose risks for human health. Opinions on regulation of <b>nanotechnologies</b> are instead different. Conclusions. These preliminary findings underlined the ambiguity surrounding <b>nanotechnologies</b> both concerning the bioethical dimension and risks perception and their regulation. These early data therefore showed a need of additional reflection on these technologies that should be investigated more in detail; moving from students, future scientists and regulators, these data could contribute to clarify the debate on them...|$|R
