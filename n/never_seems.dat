5|$|The primary playable {{character}} in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is the human}} protagonist, a boisterous hunter-gatherer {{who lives in a}} cave in the wilderness. Her eight potential love interests in the original version of the game, who together form the rest of the main cast, are Ryouta Kawara, a rock dove and the protagonist's sickly but hardworking childhood friend; Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, a fantail pigeon and snobbish French aristocrat; Sakuya's older half-brother Yuuya Sakazaki, a popular and flirtatious but strangely secretive fantail pigeon; Nageki Fujishiro, a quiet, bookish mourning dove who <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> to leave the library; San Oko, an athletic, hyperactive fantail pigeon who is obsessed with pudding; Anghel Higure, an eccentric Luzon bleeding-heart who behaves as if he were in some kind of fantasy role-playing game; Kazuaki Nanaki, a kind but narcoleptic button quail and the protagonist's homeroom teacher; and Shuu Iwamine, a creepy, antisocial chukar partridge who serves as the school's doctor. Azami Koshiba, a no-nonsense Java sparrow and takoyaki saleswoman, became a possible love interest in the 2014 remake.|$|E

25|$|By 1558, {{and perhaps}} {{as early as}} 1557, Campbell pursued another bishopric, the bishopric of Brechin, {{possibly}} receiving a nomination from Mary of Guise. The vacancy had been caused {{by the death of}} Bishop John Hepburn in the early summer of 1557. Campbell's proctor in Rome, John Row, attempted to gain permission for his master to abandon the dress Cistercian monk and to hold the bishopric of Brechin with the abbacy of Coupar Angus. Campbell <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> to have been awarded the see.|$|E

25|$|Mrs Prunella Bogart (Richenda Carey) - The elegantly dressed, nasty-tempered Headmistress who {{replaced}} Mrs Trout in Series 3. She is Mrs Trout's sister and she brought along her spoiled nephew, Eamon, {{who wanted to}} replace Bodger as the school handyman. She <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> to do any work, {{despite the fact that}} she is the Headmistress, and spends most of her time in her office eating chocolate, confiscating the children's chocolate, or at the chocolate shop. She is nicknamed 'Mrs Bogey' by Badger and is always looking for ways to make quick money.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte Lucas – Charlotte is Elizabeth's friend who, at 27 {{years old}} (and thus past prime {{marriage}} age), fears becoming {{a burden to}} her family and therefore agrees to marry Mr. Collins to gain financial security. Though the novel {{stresses the importance of}} love and understanding in marriage, Austen <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> to condemn Charlotte's decision to marry for money. She uses Charlotte to convey how women of her time would adhere to society's expectation for women to marry even if it is not out of love, but convenience. Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William Lucas and Lady Lucas, friends of Mrs. Bennet.|$|E
25|$|As in {{the case}} of the other medieval Jewish {{philosophers}} little is known of his life. His family had been distinguished for piety and exegetical skill in Talmud, but though he was known in the Jewish community by commentaries on certain books of the Bible, he <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> to have accepted any rabbinical post. It has been suggested that the uniqueness of his opinions may have put obstacles in the way of his advancement to a higher position or office. He is known to have been at Avignon and Orange during his life, and is believed to have died in 1344, though Zacuto asserts that he died at Perpignan in 1370.|$|E

25|$|Never Better {{is about}} Keith Merchant (Mangan), a {{recovering}} alcoholic in his mid-thirties whose life <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> to get better. His problems come from him being self-centred and preoccupied {{with his own}} flaws. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but his behaviour often turns meetings into a farce, to the annoyance of group leader Doug (Christopher Fairbank). He has a family, with his wife Anita (Ashfield) and two children, Tom and Poppy. Whilst he attempts {{to be a good}} husband and father, his optimism for his family and attempts {{to do the right thing}} tend to lead to even more problems. Outside of AA, he has his friend Richard (Tom Goodman-Hill) for support, although Richard believes that Keith was a better friend when he was drinking.|$|E
25|$|The {{second act}} takes {{place after the}} dinner. In spite of Arabella {{spending}} the entire dinner unconscious, and Paige and Micky joining the meal and messing up the cutlery arrangement, things have evidently gone well. Julie-Ann, having swapped dresses with Paige at some point, attempts to make things up with Arabella, although Arabella <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> to grasp which girl is which. However, things start to go downhill when Derek has a private word with Justin. Derek suggests Justin should move up to Doncaster to take over his garden centre business, oblivious to Justin's hints {{that he is not}} interested. Furthermore, Justin learns from Derek that the reason Derek and Dee fell out with Julie-Ann's two sisters was because {{one of them is a}} lesbian and the other married a Chinese man.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Annette Sefton-Wilcox introduces Rosie Seymour to one of several flats she is minding for a few days. This flat belongs to a Joanna Rupelford, who <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> to be at home (to the point where the labels are still on the pans). In the conversation, it is disclosed that Rosie is an actress with little success behind her (her only role so far being a rabbit in a miserable touring children's production), and no boyfriend, and that she is openly desperate for both. Her one hope is that she is down to the last two for a big role as Jane Eyre, but just after Annette leaves, Rosie receives a call from her agent tell her the part went to the other girl.|$|E

25|$|He fell foul of the East India Company in 1768, {{possibly}} because diamonds were a favourite means for Company employees to secretly remit to Britain the ill-gotten gains of private trade in India {{which they were}} officially forbidden to engage in. He announced in September of that year {{that he intended to}} start up a newspaper in Calcutta (which would have been India’s first modern newspaper), saying that he had “in manuscript many things to communicate which most intimately concerned every individual”, but he was directed to quit Bengal and proceed to Madras and from thence to take his passage to England. Company officials declared him bankrupt, “to the irretrievable loss of his Fortune”, he later claimed. He <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> {{to have been able to}} redeem himself in the eyes of the Company, and in London and elsewhere fought a rearguard action against his many opponents within it.|$|E
25|$|Nenagh Castle {{was built}} c. 1216 {{and was the}} main castle of the Butler family before they moved to Gowran, County Kilkenny in the 14th century. The family later {{purchased}} Kilkenny Castle {{which was to be}} the main seat of their power for the next 500 years. The town was one of the ancient manors of the Butlers who received the grant of a fair from Henry VIII of England. They also founded the medieval priory and hospital of St John the Baptist, just outside the town at Tyone. A small settlement grew up around the castle, but it <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> to have been of any great importance other than as a local market throughout the medieval period. An important Franciscan friary was founded in the town in 1252 in the reign of Henry III of England which became the head of the Irish custody of West Ireland {{and was one of the}} richest religious houses in Ireland. The Abbey was in use for six hundred years; Fr. Patrick Harty, who died in 1817, was its last inhabitant.|$|E
25|$|Alec Smart (Ricky Diamond) - The sly and untrustworthy tenant {{who moves}} into the flat above Bodger's in Series 7. He was always {{thinking}} up schemes to make money, often tricking Mrs Dribelle and Bodger in the process. He sucks up to Mrs Dribelle while secretly trying to scam her. In the episode 'Mrs Dribelle's Big Day' he asks her to marry him, {{with the intention of}} getting his hands on her money. After Mrs Dribelle discovers his plan, she throws him out of the flat. A year later when Bodger and Badger move to Puddleford at the beginning of Series 8 to run a hotel, they are horrified to discover that Mr Smart is their next door neighbour once again. He is also running a hotel, but <b>never</b> <b>seems</b> to have any guests and is always trying to steal Bodger's or trying to outshine his rival in every despicable way possible. He was last seen in the episode 'Doggone' when he kidnapped China the dog in order to obtain a reward for finding him. As he is not seen or mentioned again in the series, it is assumed that he moved away from Puddleford or still lives next door but never mentioned.|$|E
