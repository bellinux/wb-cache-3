In replication schemes, often a J out of N voting pattern (also called quorum) is used in which the quorum waits for J replies to arrive. Integrating a quorum scheme into the Layered Queueing Network (LQN) performance modeling language necessitates the computation of the quorum response time as the J th order statistic. To do so, we need the exact (or an accurate estimation of the) time distribution of individual replies. This distribution was estimated in previous work but only for the special case of (J = N) and yields large errors for J ≪ <b>N.</b> <b>This</b> <b>paper</b> <b>presents</b> a new analytic approach for the derivation of the distributions.
