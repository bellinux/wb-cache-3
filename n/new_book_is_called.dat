50|$|Metro: Last Light is a {{video game}} that is {{considered}} a direct sequel to the game's story rather than the book, and was released in 2013. It {{is not based on}} Metro 2034, because the developers felt it was less fit for a game than the original book. Glukhovsky helped to write the story and dialogue for the game. He realised that the story he wrote for the game was too big, so instead he is planning to publish the whole story in a new book. The <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> Metro 2035.|$|E

40|$|In a new book, legal scholar Mehrsa Baradaran {{argues that}} America has two systems for {{personal}} banking. The rich have personal bank accounts at brick-and-mortar businesses, while the poor either don’t bank {{at all or}} rely on payday lenders and check cashers that charge exorbitant rates and fees. The result, Baradaran says, is a sadly ironic situation where “the less money you have, the more you pay to use it. ” She joins us Tuesday to explain how we got into this mess, and how we might get out of it. Mehrsa Baradaran is an Associate Professor at the University of Georgia School of Law. Her <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> How the Other Half Banks: Exclusion, Exploitation, and the Threat to Democracy...|$|E

5000|$|After the film's {{title was}} chosen, Douglas Adams called Jones {{to tell him}} he had just {{finished}} a <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> to <b>be</b> <b>called</b> The Meaning of Liff; Jones was initially concerned about the similarity in titles, which led to the scene in the title sequence of a tombstone which, when hit by a flash of lightning, changes from [...] "The Meaning of Liff" [...] to [...] "The Meaning of Life".|$|R
50|$|Her <b>newest</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> Poisoned Nation. Poisoned Nation {{links the}} soaring {{epidemics}} of cluster illness to the chemical contamination of our water, air, food and everyday {{products for the}} profit and power of a reckless few. With irrefutable evidence and moving personal stories of the sick and dying, Poisoned Nation demonstrates that the human equivalent of global warming is already upon us. It shows how the government operates in tandem with America’s most notorious polluters, and how they have deceived the public, buried evidence of spreading disease, and suppressed critical scientific data. Poisoned Nation also traces the relationships between organizations whose products cause diseases and those who profit from diagnosing and treating them, {{as well as their}} efforts to avoid research into environmental causes and possible cures. This <b>is</b> an urgent <b>call</b> for action that delineates the problem with such clarity that the truth shines through. A plea is issued to religious leaders of all faiths to work together for change, to create a movement to defeat greed and guide us toward a safer, healthier future.

50|$|But {{with all}} of its contributions, The Worshipbook was vulnerable. Following Vatican Council II there was a great {{resurgence}} of liturgical reform that continues unabated in virtually every branch of the church. Service <b>book</b> revision <b>was</b> begun by every church that had a service book. Presbyterians began to recognize the need to go beyond The Worshipbook. It was therefore no surprise that a <b>new</b> service <b>book</b> <b>was</b> soon <b>called</b> for.|$|R
5000|$|The third book in his {{historical}} trilogy, A Caring Society: The New Deal, the Worker, and the Great Depression {{was less}} well received.

The <b>book</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> [...] "neither fresh nor complete," [...] although critics said it captured well the emotional tenor of the Great Depression and Roosevelt' impact on the American people.|$|R
5000|$|Chang & Eng was a {{commercial}} and critical success, here and abroad, reaching {{a number of}} US national bestseller lists (rising as high as #3 on the New York Post's List).

Never less than poignant, it becomes almost unbearably moving." [...] In the New York Times, critic Michiko Kakutani called it [...] "A spirited and promising debut." [...] Writer Andrew Santella, in The <b>New</b> York Times <b>Book</b> Review, found the novel [...] "a story of heroic longing." [...] He continued, [...] "Strauss's novel—its humor, its humanity, its aching sadness—makes for a fine memorial."

5|$|Initially, {{the library}} had {{a cache of}} books waiting for the {{completion}} and grand opening that was provided by local residents and schools, as Carnegie's gift for the construction did not cover the initial costs of <b>new</b> <b>books.</b> A <b>call</b> <b>was</b> also put out for citizens to donate <b>books</b> to the <b>new</b> facility to expand the collection. In 1907, the Seattle Public Library {{took control of the}} Carnegie library, when Ballard was annexed by the neighboring City of Seattle government. Early Scandinavian immigrants to Ballard and the Pacific Northwest in particular made use of the new facility; Ballard as an area has a strong historical presence of Scandinavian people. Early in the library's existence, it had a turnstile at the entrance to its book stacks, to count the number of book borrowers that passed through. With the arrival of World War I, the Carnegie Library became home to various community activities, such as dispensing information on the war, and also provided Red Cross and English language classes. In 1942, during World War II, one of the first African American librarians in Seattle, Lucille Smith, was assigned to the Carnegie library.|$|R
