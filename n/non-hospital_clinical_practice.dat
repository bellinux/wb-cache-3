The participants were 588 nursing students. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, and Pearson correlation coefficients. The mean scores for emotional intelligence 4. 76 (0. 69), ego resilience 2. 80 (0. 33), and stress in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> 3. 03 (0. 52) were above average. Emotional Intelligence was significantly different according to gender, satisfaction with nursing as a major, and satisfaction in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice.</b> Ego resilience was significantly different according to satisfaction with nursing as a major, satisfaction in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice.</b> Stress in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> was significantly different according to gender, duration of <b>clinical</b> <b>practice,</b> satisfaction with nursing as a major, satisfaction in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice,</b> simulation practice, and main tutor in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice.</b> Significant correlations were found between emotional intelligence, ego resilience and stress in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice.</b> These findings indicate that there is a need to improve emotional intelligence and eg...|$|R

This study translates a <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> guideline on heart failure into review criteria to measure physician performance {{and the effectiveness of}} the <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> guideline. Methods: A panel of 11 family physicians and 1 cardiologist systematically reviewed the <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> guideline for its clinical importance, educational relevance, and evaluative appropriateness. Then a subset of 4 family physicians rigorously applied each recommendation to established criteria for measurability and developed an evaluation tool useful in medical record review. Results: The heart failure <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> guideline was found to be an excellent educational tool. Using it to measure physician performance, however, was limited to diagnostic tests and drug prescribing. Of 45 recommendations, 5 fulfilled criteria for measurability; 1 recommendation had A-level evidence, whereas 2 recommendations had B-level and 2 had C-level evidence.

For hypothesis testing, the collected {{data were analyzed using}} AMOS 8. 0.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to explore the value and the validity of data collected in daily <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> for drug evaluation and cost-effectiveness studies, using data collected on TNFa blocking agents in rheumatoid arthritis. First, the need for and value of information from daily <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> was researched. Together, the results of Chapters 3, 4 and 5 illustrated that treatment of RA patients with anti-TNFa blocking agents in daily <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> was different from what was expected from the performed RCTs and the guidelines developed {{on the basis of}} the RCTs. Data from a daily <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> registry can be used to get insight in the actual use and realized effects of medications in daily <b>clinical</b> <b>practice,</b> in contrast to the controlled setting of a RCT. Furthermore, data from <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> can be used to estimate the impact on the budgets in health care by implementing a new intervention in daily <b>clinical</b> <b>practice.</b> The second part of this thesis addressed the use of patient self reported measures in large daily <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> registries. Because the use of patient self reported measures could be very convenient to evaluate drug therapy in daily <b>clinical</b> <b>practice,</b> its was researched whether these measures could substitute more objective measures like the disease activity score. Chapters 6 and 7 of this thesis showed that patient reported measures cannot substitute objective measures of disease activity. It was shown that response shifts occurred and greatly confounded the outcomes of the patient-self-reported ratings. It was not possible to correct for response shift because it led to the paradoxical result that clinical non-responders increased significantly on a self-reported measure.

40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{research}} {{the use of}} ambiguous language in written information concerning patients' functioning and to identify problems resulting {{from the use of}} ambiguous language in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice.</b> Background. Many projects that aimed to introduce standard terminology concerning patients' functioning in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> are unsuccessful because standard terminology is rarely used in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice.</b> These projects mainly aim to improve communication by reducing ambiguous language. Considering their lack of success, the validity of the argument that language ambiguity is used in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> is questioned. Design. An integrative literature review. Methods. A systematic search of the MEDLINE (1950 - 2012) and CINAHL (1982 - 2012) databases was undertaken, including empirical and theoretical literature. The selected studies were critically appraised using a data assessment and extraction form. Results. Seventeen of 767 papers were included in the review and synthesis. The use of ambiguous language in written information concerning patients' functioning was demonstrated. Problems resulting from the use of ambiguous language in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> were not identified. However, several potential problems were suggested, including hindered clinical decision-making and limited research opportunities. Conclusion. The results of this review demonstrated the use of ambiguous language concerning patients' functioning, but health professionals in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> did not experience this issue as a problem. This finding might explain why many projects aimed at introducing standard terminology concerning functioning in <b>clinical</b> <b>practice</b> to solve problems caused by ambiguous language are often unsuccessful. Language ambiguity alone is not a valid argument to justify the introduction of standard terminology.
