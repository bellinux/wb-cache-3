40|$|Abstract — The time {{synchronization}} is {{very important}} for <b>network</b> <b>testing</b> that is at a long distance. For time synchronization, two different <b>network</b> <b>testing</b> apparatuses uses a network time protocol (NTP) or a geographic position system (GPS). For using GPS with less timing error, an expensive GPS antenna needs to be installed outside the door. NTP is through the network. The network itself causes a time delay and the error in the time delay of the network occurs. So, NTP has not been used to measure a high speed network. This paper has been made in an effort to provide a <b>network</b> <b>testing</b> system using a Standard Wave to facilitate time synchronization with at least two <b>network</b> <b>testing</b> apparatuses, and an operating method thereof. The Standard Wave has extremely little time error. It helps to perform accurate testing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Sensor {{networks}} are emerging {{as one of}} the dominant technologies in ad hoc wireless networking. These networks which consist of hundreds or thousands of tiny sensor nodes are being used for a variety of applications (e. g., environmental monitoring, health care, and military applications). However, sensor {{networks are}} constrained in terms of limited energy and computational resources. As a result, there are numerous networking challenges with sensor networks. At the graduate level, {{there is a need for}} students interested in working on research in sensor networks to have practical training on the technology in this area. This view becomes important given the fact that much of the existing sensor networking research is based upon simulation results rather than on empirical results that would be obtained from using a sensor network that has been deployed in the field or from using a wireless sensor <b>network</b> <b>testbed.</b> There is also value in using a hands-on approach to complement the study of theoretical aspects of sensor networks. In this paper, curriculum components are suggested for a course in wireless sensor networks. These components consist of the course content, the development of a wireless sensor <b>network</b> <b>testbed,</b> and the experimental project(s) that can be implemented on a wireless sensor <b>network</b> <b>testbed.</b> The implementation of these projects on a hardware testbed will enable the effectiveness of proposed approaches for key networking problems in sensor networks to be studied.
