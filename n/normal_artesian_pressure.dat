40|$|The rock {{formations}} {{of the earth}} are great natural reservoirs in which {{a part of the}} water derived from rain and snow is stored. Water levels and <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> in wells register the stages of these natural reservoirs. The changes in water levels or <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> are indicative of the depletion or replenishment of the natural reservoirs. Systematic and periodic measurements of water levels and <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> in wells have been made in Nevada, by State and Federal agencies from time to time. However, only a few of these measurements have ever been published. Under the cooperative arrangement between the State Engineer of Nevada and the Director of the U. S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior, beginning in July 1944, a considerable effort was made to assemble and compile the authentic available records of measurements for publication. Such a compilation provides a permanent record, readily available, for future reference. The result of this compilation is set forth in this report. It is the third in the series of Nevada Water Resources Bulletins prepared by the U. S. Department of Interior, Geological Survey, in cooperation with the State Engineer...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for {{water in the}} Canterbury region, and the realisation that spring flow {{plays an important role}} in many wetland and river systems, requires methods for predicting changes in spring behaviour as Canterbury's groundwater resources are utilised. This study into the flow of groundwater through artesian spring systems provides a better understanding of the impacts of changes in <b>artesian</b> aquifer <b>pressure.</b> The aquifer system of the central coastal Canterbury Plains consists of gravels separated by successive layers of fine sediment. The fine sediment acts as a confining aquitard, creating <b>artesian</b> <b>pressures</b> in the gravel aquifers where the piezometric surface is above ground level. Artesian springs occur in the confining aquitard through localised zones of weakness. Piezometric levels associated with artesian springs in gravel aquifers are not well documented and have never been observed in Canterbury. Examination of near-spring groundwater flow patterns should confirm the shallow artesian aquifer as the main source of water to artesian springs. Little information is available on the relationship between <b>artesian</b> aquifer <b>pressure</b> and <b>artesian</b> spring discharge. Groundwater flow equations indicate that turbulence occurs in the high velocity flow encountered in artesian spring systems. Energy losses should thus be proportional to velocity squared and the pressure - flow relationship is expected to be non-linear. A non-linear relationship would buffer spring discharge against changes in aquifer pressure induced by groundwater abstraction. Field investigations were carried out at two spring sites near Christchurch. Near-spring water levels were observed in the aquifer directly below the spring to confirm it as the principal source of water to the spring. Variations in <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> were then induced via groundwater abstraction from nearby wells in the source aquifer, and changes in spring discharge measured. The upper confined aquifer was confirmed to be the primary source of water for Christchurch's artesian spring systems. The relationship between <b>artesian</b> aquifer <b>pressure</b> and <b>artesian</b> spring discharge was found to be entirely linear for the range of pressures and flows observed. Although theoretical analysis indicates that turbulent flow is occurring at, and close to, the spring vent, the distance over which it occurs is small enough that energy losses due to rapid flow in the groundwater system are negligible. The results imply that any reduction in <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> due to groundwater abstraction will have a direct, linear impact on artesian spring flow...|$|R

40|$|Practically all {{water for}} {{municipal}} and industrial {{use in the}} Fernandina area is supplied by artesian wells. In recent years, the use of artesian water in the area has increased {{to meet the needs}} of expanding industry and increasing population. The total industrial and municipal pumpage has increased from approximately 35 million gallons per day in 1941 to approximately 50 million gallons per day in 1959. Correlated with the increase in water use is the constant decline in the <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> in the area. In many other areas in Florida, such a decline in <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> has resulted in salt-water intrusion into the fresh-water supply. An intrusion of salt water in the Fernandina area would contaminate the existing fresh-water supply and would result in a hardship for the population and seriously injure the economy.

5000|$|Hydraulic (open-system) pingos {{result from}} {{groundwater}} flowing from an outside source, i.e. subpermafrost or intrapermafrost aquifers. Hydrostatic pressure initializes {{the formation of}} the ice core as water is pushed up and subsequently freezes. Open-system pingos have no limitations to the amount of water available unless the aquifers freeze. They often occur at the base of slopes and are commonly known as Greenland type. The groundwater is put under <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> and forces the ground up as it makes an expanding ice core. It is not the <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> itself that forces the ground up, but rather the ice core that is being fed the water from the aquifer. These are often formed in a thin, discontinuous permafrost. These conditions allow an ice core to form, but also provide it with a supply of artesian ground water. If water <b>pressure</b> entering an <b>artesian</b> pingo is strong enough, it can lift the pingo up allowing a sub-pingo water lens to form underneath. However, if the water lens starts to leak water it can cause subsidence which can compromise the structure. [...] These pingos are often oval or oblong shaped. It is still not entirely understood why open system or hydraulic pingos normally occur in unglaciated terrain.|$|R
40|$|Pingos are isolated, conical mounds up to 50 m {{high with}} {{a core of}} ice covered by silt, sand or gravel. They are formed in regions where the ground is {{permanently}} frozen.

30|$|Colloid {{sampling}} procedures in groundwater {{are an important}} aspect of groundwater research. Sampling of groundwater and colloids is often conducted in vertical or near vertical boreholes or wells drilled from the ground surface. However, the <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> in groundwater may decrease to atmospheric pressure, and the in situ oxidation-reduction condition of the groundwater may change during sampling. Furthermore, the subsurface environment may become contaminated by drilling fluid, artifacts such as steel drill bits and rods containing Fe, and meteoric water during drilling (Dideriksen et al. [2007]). Changes in the chemical composition and physicochemical condition of groundwater may induce the formation of anthropogenic colloids and secondary minerals, especially Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides. The chemical composition of groundwater may be affected by co-precipitation and sorption of elements onto newly formed colloids and secondary minerals.|$|R

Subsurface drainage lowers the high water tables, and the main causes of the rise in water table are precipitation, excess irrigation, leaching water, seeps from higher land or irrigation canal and ditches and groundwater under <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure.</b> This technique has gained international acceptance. Subsurface agricultural drainage provides agronomical and environmental benefits in terms of improved crop yield, improved soil trafficability, field operations and reduction in sediment and phosphorus losses from agricultural fields (Kornecki et al. 2001).|$|R

40|$|A {{large part}} of western Manatee County {{is devoted to the}} growing of winter {{vegetables}} and citrus fruits. As in most of peninsular Florida, rainfall in the county during the growing season is not sufficient for crop production and large quantites of artesian water are used for irrigation. The large withdrawals of artesian water for irrigation result in a considerable decline of the artesian head {{in the western part of}} the county. This seasonal decline of the artesian head has become larger as the withdrawal of artesian water has increased. The lowering of the fresh-water head in some coastal areas in the State has resulted in an infiltration of sea water into the water-bearing formations. The presence of salty water in the artesian aquifer in parts of the coastal area of Manatee County indicates that sea water may also have entered the waterbearing formations in this area as a result of the decline of <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> during the growing season.

40|$|A {{number of}} wells {{penetrating}} the Floridan aquifer in eastern Clay County {{were found to}} be losing water to permeable zones above this aquifer. A differential in <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> was observed in closely spaced wells of similar depth. Further investigation. revealed that the pressure differential in the wells was due to the design of the wells, of which there were four principal types. A comparison of the four types of wells in relation to the subsurface geology showed that three types of wells were open to the permeable zones above the Floridan aquifer. In such wells water of relatively high head from the Floridan aquifer moves up through the well bore and out into zones of relatively low head. The estimated water loss from poorly designed wells ranged from 32 to 180 gpm (gallons per minute). The artesian head loss in leaky wells ranged from 3 to 15 feet. A total loss of water of 39 mgd (million gallons per day) was estimated from all the leaky wells in the area. A significant decline of the piezometric surface of the Floridan aquifer was observed in eastern Clay County.

The sample sites were at Byelii Yar and at Goryachii Istochnik (near Parabelâ), both in Tomsk oblastâ. In neither case did the boreholes encounter significant hydrocarbon reserves; they currently overflow under <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> {{at the surface}} and their geothermal water is used in simple spa resorts. In both cases, the waters are highly reducing; they contain H 2 S and methane (CH 4) as dissolved gases, and do not contain detectable concentrations of sulphate and nitrate.

The geothermal resource evaluation was made possible through drilling and preliminary testing of a large diameter well, Lackland AFB No. 1, at the south portion of the base. Phase I of the program had 3 major components: (1) compilation and interpretation of surface and subsurface geologic data to site the well; (2) design of the well; and (3) permitting the well. Phase II consisted of well drilling and preliminary development. The goal of the program was to identify water temperature, water quality, and productivity characteristics of the Hosston aquifer, which preliminary studies suggested might be favorable for direct applications on the base. Results reported herein suggest that heat pumps or other engineering alternatives might be needed for such applications. Results of the well drilling give data on water productivity, quality and temperature.

Dewatering from the aquifer is a common method to improve base stability where ground settlement {{is not a major}} concern. Alternatively, piles readily installed as part of the top-down construction method for multi-propped excavation may be considered to provide base stability and minimize ground settlement outside the excavation. This paper presents results from two centrifuge tests that were conducted to simulate multi-propped excavations in-flight (with and without piles) in soft clay destabilized by hydraulic pressure from an underlying sand aquifer.

The original borehole number is MBHCZ 6 A- 159. It has been registered as TQ 38 NE 1366 in the BGS Single Onshore Borehole Index. The borehole penetrates a 70 metre-thick sequence which, {{from the top}} downwards, passes through made ground and Quaternary fluvial deposits before revealing a 43 metre-thick zone of bedrock mÃ©lange. This mÃ©lange includes material from {{the lower part of}} the Lambeth Group, the Thanet Formation, and the Chalk. It is interpreted as being the product of pervasive soft-sediment deformation formed during a series of short-lived elevated pore water events, based upon the presence of diagnostic geological structures characteristic of ductile deformation, probably during rapid ejection of groundwater under <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure.</b> During these events, fragments of chalk were carried to within 17 metres of the surface, some 20 metres above where the top of the Chalk was encountered in nearby undisturbed sequences. Conversely, the presence of glauconitic sand apparently derived from the adjacent Palaeogene bedrock at 69 m depth, more than 30 m below the top of the Chalk nearby, implies that there was also some downwards movement during mÃ©lange formation. The presence of such a thick disturbed sequence beneath superficial deposits is extremely unusual although not unique. A model is proposed where this structure and internal deformation is explained by processes of pingo formation and decay in a part of the Lea Valley where the bedrock aquifer is confined by an aquitard as little as 3 m thick. Alternatively, it is possible that the structure formed during release of <b>artesian</b> groundwater <b>pressure</b> following fluvial scour. In either case, it is very likely that the structure lies above a fault zone including fractured, possibly karstic chalk, with high groundwater conductivity.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) of these powders showed a transition from smectite at 762 m to corrensite at 1790 m and back to smectite at 1807 m. More detailed XRD analysis with ethylene-glycol solvated samples confirmed the findings of the powder samples (namely a transition from smectite - 3 Ìe corrensite - 3 Ìe smectite). We modeled smectite and corrensite crystallinity with depth and found an increase in the defect free distance of both minerals. Samples around 1790 m showed the presence of smectite, corrensite, and possibly chlorite (or serpentine). We interpret this result to support a discontinuous (stepwise) model for the smectite-chlorite transition. The presence of artesian fluid in this zone is evidence for the importance of high fluid/rock ratios in the smectite- chlorite transition, and the association of high fluid/rock ratios with a discontinuous transition model...|$|R
40|$|Few field {{measurements}} {{are available to}} constrain the diffuse discharge (or vertical leakage) component of the water balance of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB), even though numerical modelling indicates that it accounts for {{over half of the}} outflow of the GAB in South Australia. High leakage rates are observed along the southwestern margin of the GAB where the aquifer is close to the surface with the groundwater under <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure.</b> These zones contain both sporadic springs and distinct areas of leakage into the surface environment as shown by salt deposition at surface and very shallow water tables. These leakage zones typically occur along stratigraphic and structural features. Quantifying the component of vertical leakage occurring along the margin of the GAB will better constrain the water balance of the GAB and increase confidence in sustainable yields from this vital water resource. This project uses evapotranspiration monitoring (eddy correlation, microlysimeters) and soil water chloride profiles to estimate groundwater discharge rates. Preliminary data have been collected from the western side of the Peake-Denison Ranges and the northern edge of the Gammon and Willouran Ranges of South Australia. In these areas, diffuse discharge commonly occurs along or near the outcropping aquifer-aquitard.

Most remaining active springs were visited and surveyed, the physical attributes of the springs described and their current status determined. Recharge springs occur in areas where the evidence suggests the basin is recharged by rainfall and 93 % of the original 245 spring-groups in these areas are still active. Discharge springs occur in sections of the Basin down-gradient of the recharge areas and only 36 % of the original 300 spring-groups in these areas have at least some springs that are still active. The capping of bores could provide a partial restoration of <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> and enhance spring flows. Of the active spring-groups surveyed 26 % have suffered major or total damage as a result of excavation of the wetlands. An emerging threat is the use of exotic grasses as ponded pastures, which have the ability to dominate the habitat of spring wetlands. The potential impacts of other threats including those associated with stock, exotic animals and fire are also discussed. Mitigating these threats requires a conservation strategy that seeks to protect remaining springs with high conservation values...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of soil temperatures, frost heave, thaw consolidation, pore water pressures and downslope soil movements are reported from a turf-banked solifluction lobe at SteinhÃ¸i, Dovrefjell, Norway from August 2002 to August 2006. Mean annual air temperatures over the monitored period were slightly below 08 C, but mean annual ground surface temperatures were around 28 C warmer, {{due to the}} insulating effects of snow cover. Seasonal frost penetration was highly dependent on snow thickness, and at the monitoring location varied from 30 â 38 cm over the four years. The shallow annual frost penetration suggests that the site may {{be close to the}} limit of active solifluction in this area. Surface solifluction rates over the period 2002 â 06 ranged from 0. 5 cm yr 1 {{at the rear of the}} lobe tread to 1. 6 cm yr 1 just behind the lobe front, with corresponding soil transport rates of 6 cm 3 cm 1 yr 1 and 46 cm 3 cm 1 yr 1. Pore water pressure measurements indicated seepage of snowmelt beneath seasonally frozen soil in spring with <b>artesian</b> <b>pressures</b> beneath the confining frozen layer. Soil thawing was associated with surface settlement and downslope soil displacements, but following clearance of the frozen ground, later soil surface settlement was accompanied by retrograde movement. Summer rainfall events caused brief increases in pore pressure, but no further soil movement. Surface displacements exceeded maximum potential frost creep values and it is concluded that gelifluction was an important component of slow near-surface mass movements at this site. Temporal and spatial variations in solifluction rates across the area are likely to be considerable and strongly influenced b...|$|R
