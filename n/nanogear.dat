50|$|The XGameStation was {{originally}} {{conceived of as}} a handheld system called the <b>nanoGear</b> based around the 68HC12 microprocessor, a modern derivative of the 6809. The system would also contain modern derivatives of the 6502 and Z-80 microprocessors, for retro coders and hackers, and to make emulation of classic computer and video game systems easier. After several iterations, the plan changed to use an ARM microprocessor and an FPGA on which a custom designed GPU was implemented. But after finishing this project {{it was decided that}} the resulting system was cost prohibitive and much too advanced for beginners. Instead, the plan was changed again finally resulting in the XGS Micro Edition, based on the SX52 microcontroller. The ARM and FPGA-based system was renamed the XGS Mega Edition after the release of the Micro Edition, and though planned to be sold, it was never released.|$|E

Conventional plasmonic nanostructures are designed as nanoscale analogs of radioantennas and waveguides. Here, we discuss {{an alternative approach}} for plasmonic nanocircuit engineering {{that is based on}} molding the optical powerflow through 'vortex nanogears' around a landscape of local phase singularities 'pinned' to plasmonic nanostructures. We show that coupling of several vortex nanogears into transmission-like structures results in dramatic optical effects, which can be explained by invoking a hydrodynamic analogy of the 'photon fluid'. The new concept of vortex <b>nanogear</b> transmissions (VNTs) provides new design principles for the development of complex multi-functional phase-operated photonics machinery and, therefore, generates unique opportunities for light generation, harvesting and processing on the nanoscale.

40|$|In this paper, a {{new model}} of {{hydrocarbon}} potential energy function is developed in order to produce short range potential which is more accurate than reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential. Short range potential is heavily used in Molecular Dynamics Simulation of nano materials as well as <b>Nanogear.</b> REBO potential is one of the famous potential to compute the potential energy of covalent bonds. Generally, the total potential function is the summation of long range potential and short range potential. Basically, short range potential involve neighboring atoms only with parameters such as bond stretching, angle bending and bond rotation which represent the molecular mechanics. Here, we present our work called Bond Stretching (BS) potential, part of new hydrocarbon potential function, which is the simplest case involving two atoms for hydrocarbon compound. In this BS potential, it take the repulsive and attraction function into account. Both different phenomena can be approximated by piecewise polynomial functions. The two atoms BS potential will be extended further into three atoms angle bending potential which is the ongoing current research...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present work {{deals with}} the wave {{dispersion}} behavior of a rotating nanotube using the nonlocal elasticity theory. The rotating nanobeam is modeled as an Euler–Bernoulli theory. The governing partial differential equation for a uniform rotating beam is derived incorporating the nonlocal scale effects. The spatial variation in centrifugal force is modeled in an average sense. Even though this averaging {{seems to be a}} crude approximation, one can use this as a powerful model in analyzing the wave dispersion characteristics of the rotating nanobeam. Spectrum and dispersion curves are obtained as a function of rotating speed and nonlocal scaling parameter. It has been shown that the dispersive flexural wave tends to behave non-dispersively at very high rotation speeds. Understanding the dynamic behavior of rotating nanostructures is important for practical development of nanomachines. At the nanoscale, the nonlocal effects often become more prominent. The numerical results are simulated for a rotating nanobeam as a waveguide. The results can provide useful guidance for the study and design of the next generation of nanodevices such as blades of a nanoturbine, <b>nanogears,</b> nanoscale molecular bearings etc, that make use of the wave propagation properties of rotating single-walled carbon nanotubes...|$|R
40|$|Materials with {{exceptionally}} high {{contents of}} carbon {{are used in}} technologies with various degrees of added value, from quasi-amorphous materials for carbon electrodes used in e. g. lithium batteries to highly organized materials comprising e. g. nanotubes and fullerenes. The present study aims to test the feasibility of predicting the properties of carbon based materials using (i) molecular modelling and simulation techniques; (ii) application to fullerene as an idealized model of nano-pores in carbon materials; and (iii) available experimental data regarding the behaviour of carbon materials for lithium batteries as validation data. It {{has been found that}} the increase in the H/C atomic ratio has an ambivalent impact on the structural stability of lithium-doped carbon materials, with the ultimate lithium-doped material being the result of the 'tug of war' between the folding of the 'house-of-cards' structure due to increased flexibility of the idealized pore scaffold and the pore expansion due to the doping process coupled with the increase in structural flexibility. With regard to molecular motors, the simulations demonstrate that small numbers of hydrogenated defects may induce large enough structural changes to damage the smoothness of the surface of the <b>nanogears,</b> but the insertion of lithium atoms may stabilize this deleterious effect...|$|R
40|$|Images, {{ranging from}} {{visualizations}} of the nanoscale to future visions, abound within {{and beyond the}} world of nanotechnology. Rather than the contrast between imaging, i. e. creating images that are understood as offering a view on what is out there, and imagining, i. e. creating images offering impressions of how the nanoscale could look like and images presenting visions of worlds that might be realized, it is the entanglement between imaging and imagining which {{is the key to}} understanding what images do. Three main arenas of entanglement of imag(in) ing and the tensions involved are discussed: production practices and use of visualizations of the nanoscale; imag(in) ing the future and the present; and entanglements of nanoscience and art. In these three arenas one sees struggles about which images might stand for nanotechnology, but also some stabilization of the entanglement of imag(in) ing, for example in established rules in the practices of visualizing the nanoscale. Three images have become iconic, through the combination of their wide reception and further circulation. All three, the IBM logo, the Foresight Institute’s <b>Nanogear</b> image, and the so-called Nanolouse, depict actual or imagined technoscientific objects and are thus seen as representing technoscientific achievements – while marking out territory...|$|E
30|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} play {{an important}} role in NEMS because of their excellent electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties. Nanodevices based on carbon nanotubes such as nanogears [5], nanomotors [6, 7], nanobearings [8, 9], and nanoscale electromechanical actuators [10] have been designed. However, tuning the motion of these nanodevices is still an open question. Research documents reported that thermal gradient was used to actuate the coaxial nanotubes [11]. Meanwhile, researchers studied the factors that might influence the motion behavior of carbon nanotubes, including the commensurate or incommensurate state between interfaces [12], the deformation of the carbon nanotubes [13 – 15], and the introduced groups such as hydrogens at the ends of a motor [16]. Among these factors, introducing functional groups on carbon nanotubes is relatively easy to achieve. Researchers have studied the motion and friction properties of surface-fluorinated carbon nanotubes [17], graphene oxide layers with different functional groups [18], and hydrogenated graphene [19, 20]. However, the effect of introduced hydroxyl groups on the motion behavior of carbon nanotubes has not been reported until now. This paper demonstrates that the introduction of hydroxyl groups can tune the rolling or sliding behavior of carbon nanotube. Our study may shed light on directionally controlled motion of sophisticated molecular mechanical systems based on carbon nanotubes, such as rack-and-pinion <b>nanogear.</b> Moreover, for other cylindrical nanomaterials, such as nanoscrolls that have great potential [21], the results also provide a possible way for the control of their motion.|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in recent years in chemical functionalization of fullerene molecules. In some cases, the predominant reaction products are different from those obtained (using the same reactants) from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). One such example is the cycloaddition of o-benzyne to C 60. It is well established that benzyne adds across one of the rings in naphthalene, anthracene and other PAHs forming the [2 + 4] cycloaddition product (benzobicyclo[2. 2. 2. ]-octatriene with naphthalene and triptycene with anthracene). However, Hoke et al demonstrated that the only reaction path for o-benzyne with C 60 leads to the [2 + 2] cycloaddition product in which benzyne adds across one of the interpentagonal bonds (forming a cyclobutene ring in the process). Either reaction product results in a loss of aromaticity and distortion of the PAH or fullerene substrate, and in a loss of strain in the benzyne. It is not clear, however, why different products are preferred in these cases. In the current paper, we consider the stability of benzyne-nanotube adducts and the ability of Brenner's potential energy model to describe the structure and stability of these adducts. The Brenner potential has been widely used for describing diamondoid and graphitic carbon. Recently it has also been used for molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations of fullerenes and nanotubes. However, it has not been tested for the case of functionalized fullerenes (especially with highly strained geometries). We use the Brenner potential for our companion <b>nanogear</b> simulations and believe that it should be calibrated to insure that those simulations are physically reasonable. In the present work, Density Functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to determine the preferred geometric structures and energetics for this calibration. The DFT method is a kind of ab initio quantum chemistry method for determining the electronic structure of molecules. For a given basis set expansion, it is comparable in accuracy to the MP 2 method (better than Hartree Fock, but less accurate than more extensive electron correlation methods such as MP 4 or CCSD). However, for systems with large numbers of basis functions it more efficient than any other methods that include electron correlation effects. In this presentation we show the results of DFT calculations for the reaction of benzyne with naphthalene, C 60, and nanotube models. We compare energies for [2 + 2] and [2 + 4] cycloaddition products. The preferred products for the naphthalene and C 60 reactions have been determined by experiment and, thus, these cases serve as a validation of our quantum chemical approach. We also compare the DFT and Brenner potential results. Finally we can predict the likelihood of reaction between benzyne and nanotubes...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} focuses on the coupling of mechanical and electrical properties of materials and culminates in a direct connection between applied strain to thin-films, thin-film electron binding energy, the energy loss via plastic deformation provided by an indentation, and the substrate resistance. The methods used in this research include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nanoindentation, digital optical microscopy, and sputter coat deposition. It is discovered {{that there is a}} shift in electron binding energy on the scale of 0. 2 eV to 1. 4 eV in gold and palladium thin-films sputtered on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) through the application of strain induced by a convex shape. There is a change in the area beneath the load-displacement curve measured via indentation from 5. 55 x 10 ^- 10 J to 4. 78 x 10 ^- 10 J when the gold-palladium thin-film sputtered on PVDF is changed from the flat arrangement to the convex arrangement. Furthermore, the strain also changed the electrical resistance of aluminum foil, which indicates that the substrate electrical resistance is affected by the induced strain. The internal resistance of a circuit developed for this research changed from 7. 76 ohms for flat samples to 8. 03 ohms and 8. 33 ohms for flat and convex samples, respectively. It is expected that the research can be used to estimate the strain in <b>nanogears</b> and other devices at small length scales...|$|R
40|$|Gears {{based on}} carbon {{nanotubes}} (see figure) {{have been proposed}} as components of an emerging generation of molecular- scale machines and sensors. In comparison with previously proposed <b>nanogears</b> based on diamondoid and fullerene molecules, the nanotube-based gears would have simpler structures {{and are more likely}} to be realizable by practical fabrication processes. The impetus for the practical development of carbon-nanotube- based gears arises, in part, from rapid recent progress in the fabrication of carbon nanotubes with prescribed diameters, lengths, chiralities, and numbers of concentric shells. The shafts of the proposed gears would be made from multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The gear teeth would be rigid molecules (typically, benzyne molecules), bonded to the nanotube shafts at atomically precise positions. For fabrication, it may be possible to position the molecular teeth by use of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or other related techniques. The capability to position individual organic molecules at room temperature by use of an STM tip has already been demonstrated. Routes to the chemical synthesis of carbon-nanotube-based gears are also under investigation. Chemical and physical aspects of the synthesis of molecular scale gears based on carbon nanotubes and related molecules, and dynamical properties of nanotube- based gears, have been investigated by computational simulations using established methods of quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics. Several particularly interesting and useful conclusions have been drawn from the dynamical simulations performed thus far: The forces acting on the gears would be more sensitive to local molecular motions than to gross mechanical motions of the overall gears. Although no breakage of teeth or of chemical bonds is expected at temperatures up to at least 3, 000 K, the gears would not work well at temperatures above a critical range from about 600 to about 1, 000 K. Gear temperature could probably be controlled by use of coolant gases. For a given application, the gears would work well at temperatures below the critical range, provided that the rotational energy was less than the energy required to tilt the teeth through an angle of 20. The predominant mechanism of gear failure would be slippage caused by tilting of teeth. Gears would resume functioning if the slipping gears were decelerated sufficiently...|$|R
