5000|$|For {{almost two}} centuries, the colonialists {{did little to}} adapt their European {{architectural}} habits to the tropical climate. [...] In Batavia, for example, they constructed canals through its low-lying terrain, which were fronted by small-windowed and poorly ventilated row houses, mostly in a Chinese-Dutch hybrid style. The canals became dumping grounds for <b>noxious</b> <b>waste</b> and sewage and an ideal breeding ground for the anopheles mosquitos, with malaria and dysentery becoming rife throughout the Dutch East Indies colonial capital.|$|E

And by {{the second half of}} the 17th century people inside walled Batavia started to build their large countryside estates and villas alongside the Molenvliet Canal, the best examples to survive are former mansion of Reyner de Klerk which was built in rigid European style.|$|E
50|$|Most {{prominent}} {{example of}} the application of sensor-based ore sorting is the rejection of barren waste before transporting and comminution. Waste rejection is also known under the term pre-concentration. A discrimination has been introduced by Robben. Rule of thumb is that at least 25% of liberated barren waste must {{be present in the}} fraction to be treated by sensor-based ore sorting to make waste rejection financially feasible.Reduction of waste before it enters comminution and grinding processes does not only reduce the costs in those processes, but also releases the capacity that can be filled with higher grade material and thus implies higher productivity of the system. A prejudice against the application of a waste rejection process is, that the valuable content lost in this process is a penalty higher than the savings that can be achieved. But it is reported in the literature that the overall recovery even increases through bringing higher grade material as feed into the mill. In addition, the higher productivity is an additional source of income. If <b>noxious</b> <b>waste</b> such as acid consuming calcite is removed, the downstream recovery increases and the downstream costs decrease disproportionally as reported for example by Bergmann. The coarse waste rejected can be an additional source of income if there is a local market for aggregates.|$|E
2500|$|In general, Kuznets curves {{have been}} found for some {{environmental}} health concerns (such as air pollution) but not for others (such as landfills and biodiversity). Advocates of the EKC argue that this does not necessarily invalidate the hypothesis – {{the scale of the}} Kuznets curves may differ for different environmental impacts and different regions. If the search for scalar and regional effects can salvage the concept, it may yet be the case that a given area will need more wealth in order to see a decline in environmental pollutants. In contrast, a thermodynamically enlightened economics suggests that outputs of degraded matter and energy are an inescapable consequence of any use of matter and energy (so holds the second law); some of those degraded outputs will be <b>noxious</b> <b>wastes,</b> and whether and how their production is eliminated depends more on regulatory schemes and technologies at use than on income or production levels. [...] In one view, then, the EKC suggests that [...] "the solution to pollution is more economic growth;" [...] in the other, pollution is seen as a regrettable output that should be reduced when the benefits brought by its production are exceeded by the costs it imposes in externalities like health decrements and loss of ecosystem services.|$|R
40|$|Phosphogypsum is a <b>noxious</b> {{industrial}} <b>waste</b> {{contributing to}} global {{environmental and economic}} problems. This publication focuses above all on phosphogypsum resulting from the processing of apatite as a phosphorus bearing compound, since it contains considerable amounts of lanthanides due to its magma origin. The possibilities of its waste-free processing are large, however they require the application of suitable technologies, frequently expensive ones, and allowing for the individual characteristics of the given waste. The research works conducted so far confirm the possibility of applying phosphogypsum for the recovery of lanthanides, and the process enhances the removal of remaining impurities, thanks to which the purified calcium sulphate (gypsum) may find application {{for the production of}} construction materials...|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1930s Dalby was {{experiencing}} renewed growth and prosperity, reflecting extensive land reclamation {{in the surrounding}} district {{in the wake of}} the eradication of the prickly pear cactus. This <b>noxious</b> weed had <b>wasted</b> thousands of hectares of agricultural and grazing land in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Annual Report of the Department of Public Lands identified Dalby, Chinchilla and Miles as the towns experiencing the most progress. Under the Intermittent Relief Scheme established during the Depression, the Department of Works remodelled and added to the Dalby State School. The Dalby Court House and Police Station were also built in the first half of the 1930s.|$|R
40|$|Focussing upon urban {{responses}} to the perceived hazards posed by butchers and butchery, this paper argues that sanitary measures promulgated throughout England from the 1350 s onwards were based upon complex and sophisticated beliefs about human physiology and the dissemination of disease. The conviction that pestilence was spread by miasmatic air had widespread practical implications for a trade that generated large quantities of noisome waste and frequently stood charged with environmental pollution. Medical theories concerning the crucial role of diet in strengthening (or weakening) an individual's resistance to epidemics, as well as ideas regarding the transmission of toxins through the gaze, also prompted complaints about butchers, which in turn {{gave rise to the}} many regulations concerning their activities that feature so prominently in local and national records. These attempts to safeguard public health had a striking impact on the urban landscape, as new, purpose-built slaughterhouses were constructed on hygienic principles, and attempts were made to confine the worst aspects of butchery to peripheral areas. The disposal of offal and other <b>noxious</b> <b>waste</b> taxed authorities to the limit, and {{led to the development of}} special facilities for removal, which were designed to protect the urban water supply and keep the streets free of filth. At the same time, markets became cleaner and better organised with improved standards of supervision in order to ensure that poorer citizens could obtain cheap and uncontaminated cuts of meat...|$|E
