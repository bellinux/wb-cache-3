5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} <b>now</b> <b>have</b> {{more sophisticated}} deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{then and}} <b>now</b> <b>have</b> been divided over Wilfrid. His {{followers}} commissioned Stephen of Ripon {{to write a}} Vita Sancti Wilfrithi (or Life of Wilfrid) shortly after his death, and the medieval historian Bede also wrote extensively about him. Wilfrid lived ostentatiously, and travelled with a large retinue. He ruled {{a large number of}} monasteries, and claimed to be the first Englishman to introduce the Rule of Saint Benedict into English monasteries. Some modern historians see him mainly as a champion of Roman customs against the customs of the British and Irish churches, others as an advocate for monasticism.|$|E
5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would <b>now</b> <b>have</b> to fight at Salamis.

The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, why or how this decision was made, {{but it is clear that}} they did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism may be {{prevented}} {{in a population}} by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization (USI). Encouraged by the World Health Organization, 130 countries <b>now</b> <b>have</b> USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries {{as a result of}} attempts to reduce salt intake.|$|E

These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.|$|E

5|$|Many {{immigrants}} have established themselves in Brabrand, Hasle and Viby, where {{the percentage of}} inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66% since the year 2000.

In Brabrand and Gellerup, two-thirds of the population <b>now</b> <b>have</b> a non-Danish ethnic background. The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute many cultural flavours hitherto uncommon for the Nordic countries, including Bazar Vest, a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.|$|E
5|$|NY28 was {{originally}} assigned in 1924 to an alignment extending from Colliersville {{in the south}} to Utica in the north via Ilion. From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY28 was routed along several state highways that <b>now</b> <b>have</b> other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, NY28 was realigned between Cooperstown and Mohawk to follow its modern routing. Other than minor realignments in Kingston, Oneonta, and Oneida County, NY28 has remained the same to this day.|$|E
