5|$|Like most Tylopilus species, {{the fruit}} bodies of T.plumbeoviolaceous are not {{recommended}} for consumption because of its bitter taste. The presence of a bitter bolete may spoil a meal, as the bitter taste does <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> with cooking.|$|E
5|$|Greek {{cultural}} influence did <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> {{from the}} Parthian Empire, however, {{and there is}} evidence that the Arsacids enjoyed Greek theatre. When the head of Crassus was brought to Orodes II, he, alongside Armenian king Artavasdes II, were busy watching a performance of The Bacchae by the playwright Euripides (c.480–406 BC). The producer of the play decided to use Crassus' actual severed head in place of the stage-prop head of Pentheus.|$|E
5|$|Transformation {{into human}} form {{is said to}} be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> with the shapeshift.|$|E
6000|$|Byrne shuddered, {{and then}} said to himself {{that he must be}} a little feverish. But Tom had <b>not</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Byrne had just heard of him. And again the young man felt the blood beating in his ears. He sat still expecting every moment to hear through the {{pulsating}} strokes the sound of Tom’s voice. He waited straining his ears, but nothing came. Suddenly the thought occurred to him: “He has <b>not</b> <b>disappeared,</b> but he cannot make himself heard.” ...|$|R

5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste {{is largely due to}} the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely bitter taste that does <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E
5|$|Louise {{spent much}} of her time at Kent House, and she {{frequently}} visited Scotland with her husband. Financial pressures did <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> when Lorne became Duke, and Louise avoided inviting the King to Inveraray, Argyll's ancestral home, because the couple were economising. When Queen Victoria had visited the house before Lorne became Duke of Argyll, there were seventy servants and seventy-four dogs. By the time of Edward VII's accession, there were four servants and two dogs.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{recorded}} {{instances of}} vestigial nuclei {{in any other}} secondary plastid-containing organisms, yet they have been retained independently in the cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes. Plastid gene transfer happens frequently in many organisms, and it is unusual that these nucleomorphs have <b>not</b> <b>disappeared</b> entirely. One theory as to why these nucleomorphs have <b>not</b> <b>disappeared</b> {{as they have in}} other groups is that introns present in nucleomorphs are not recognized by host spliceosomes because they are too small and therefore cannot be cut and later incorporated into host DNA.|$|R
50|$|Bernstein {{declared}} that the massive and homogeneous working class claimed in the Communist Manifesto did not exist, and that contrary to claims of a proletarian majority emerging, the middle class was growing under capitalism and <b>not</b> <b>disappearing</b> as Marx had claimed. Bernstein noted that the working class was not homogeneous but heterogeneous, with divisions and factions within it, including socialist and non-socialist trade unions. Marx himself later in his life acknowledged that the middle class was <b>not</b> <b>disappearing,</b> in his work Theories of Surplus Value. However, due to {{the popularity of the}} Communist Manifesto and the obscurity of Theories of Surplus Value, Marx's acknowledgement of this error is not well known.|$|R
5000|$|Sergey Lavrov, Russian foreign minister, {{accused the}} German {{authorities}} of a tendency [...] "to paint over reality in a politically correct manner for domestic political reasons." [...] The girl had [...] "clearly <b>not</b> <b>disappeared</b> for 30 hours voluntarily." ...|$|R
5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket so that it would <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Dare: The {{daughter}} of Ananias Dare, {{and the first}} English child born in the Americas. In this world, the Roanoke Colony did <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> in the 1580s; when Steve Rogers went into this world he saved the colony, {{which would have been}} killed by starvation. Dare touches the rift caused by Roger's arrival. She has the ability to transform into white-furred animals when frightened, which she later learns to control, and appears to be the equivalent to Alpha Flight's Snowbird who has a similar appearance and powers, though Neil Gaiman had denied this.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{not only}} affects {{in-flight}} operations but can affect ground-based airport operations as well. Small accumulations of ash can reduce visibility, create slippery runways and taxiways, infiltrate communication and electrical systems, interrupt ground services, damage buildings and parked aircraft. Ash accumulation {{of more than}} a few millimeters requires removal before airports can resume full operations. Ash does <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> (unlike snowfalls) and must be disposed of in a manner that prevents it from being remobilised by wind and aircraft.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} at Châlons-sur-Marne. The beautifully {{executed}} canons for the altar {{of the church of}} Notre-Dame at Châlons are almost the only examples of his work which have <b>not</b> <b>disappeared.</b> The Chevalier Delatouche, who was also a poet, died at Châlons.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{characteristic}} of the Batangan dialect is the dual-number pronouns, referring to two things (as opposed to plural, which can be two or more). Although it has <b>not</b> <b>disappeared</b> in some other areas, this form is rarely used in the Manila dialect.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{although}} the codification movement {{put an end}} to the direct application of the Partidas, the legal standards they contain have <b>not</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Most of the principles of the Partidas can be found in the laws of Latin American countries, especially in their civil codes.|$|R
5|$|The animal faces {{a variety}} of {{critical}} threats. Poaching {{has long been a}} problem. Statistics show between 1959 and 1969 Amazonian Brazil alone accounted for 1,000 to 3,000 pelts annually. The species was so thoroughly decimated, the number dropped to just 12 in 1971. The implementation of CITES in 1973 finally brought about significant hunting reductions, although demand did <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> entirely: in the 1980s, pelt prices were as high as US$250 on the European market. The threat has been exacerbated by the otters' relative fearlessness and tendency to approach human beings. They are extremely easy to hunt, being active through the day and highly inquisitive. The animal's relatively late sexual maturity and complex social life makes hunting especially disastrous.|$|E
5|$|With the {{emergence}} of The New Yorker, Benchley was able {{to stay away from}} Hollywood work for a number of years. In 1931, he was persuaded to do voice work for RKO Radio Pictures for a film that would eventually be titled Sky Devils, and he acted in his first feature film, The Sport Parade (1932) with Joel McCrea. The work on The Sport Parade caused Benchley to miss the fall theatre openings, which embarrassed him (even if the relative success of The Sport Parade was often credited to Benchley's role), but the lure of filmmaking did <b>not</b> <b>disappear,</b> since RKO offered him a writing and acting contract for the following year for more money than he was making writing for The New Yorker.|$|E

50|$|As {{the speed}} and ease-of-use of GUIs {{applications}} have improved over time, the use of console applications has greatly diminished, but <b>not</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Some users simply prefer console based applications, while some organizations still rely on existing console applications to handle key data processing tasks.|$|R

50|$|However, gas {{lighting}} of streets has <b>not</b> <b>disappeared</b> completely from some cities, {{and the few}} municipalities that retained {{gas lighting}} now find that it provides a pleasing nostalgic effect. Gas lighting is also seeing a resurgence in the luxury home market for those in search of historical authenticity.|$|R
25|$|The {{agricultural}} estates of the Roman era did <b>not</b> <b>disappear.</b> They {{produced an}} agricultural surplus that {{was sold in}} towns; however slavery was replaced by other labour systems such as serfdom.|$|E
25|$|However, Freyja did <b>not</b> <b>disappear.</b> In Iceland, Freyja {{was called}} upon for {{assistance}} {{by way of}} Icelandic magical staves {{as late as the}} 18th century, and as late as the 19th century, Freyja is recorded as retaining elements of her role as a fertility goddess among rural Swedes.|$|E
25|$|According to German Professor Axel Michaels, the Vedic gods {{declined}} but did <b>not</b> <b>disappear,</b> {{and local}} cults were assimilated into the Vedic-brahmanic pantheon, which changed into the Hindu pantheon. Deities arose {{that were not}} mentioned or barely mentioned in the Vedas, especially Shiva and Vishnu, and gave rise to Shaivism and Vaishnavism.|$|E
60|$|Oliver's clothes {{had been}} torn in the beating he had received; his face was bruised and scratched; and his hair {{scattered}} over his forehead. The angry flush had <b>not</b> <b>disappeared,</b> however; {{and when he was}} pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed.|$|R
60|$|He {{bowed and}} resumed his seat, {{from which he}} had risen quickly at her coming. Mr. Weatherley motioned to him to move up to his side. His face now was a little flushed, but his {{nervousness}} had <b>not</b> <b>disappeared.</b> He was certainly not the same man whom one met at Tooley Street.|$|R

25|$|The {{fashion in}} all cathedral rites of the Mediterranean {{was a new}} {{emphasis}} on the psalter. In older ceremonies before Christianity became the religion of empires, the recitation of the biblical odes (mainly taken from the Old Testament) was much more important. They did <b>not</b> <b>disappear</b> in certain cathedral rites such as the Milanese and the Constantinopolitan rite.|$|E
25|$|The most {{efficient}} way to handle a pollen allergy is by preventing contact with the material. Individuals carrying the ailment may at first believe that they have a simple summer cold, but hay fever becomes more evident when the apparent cold does <b>not</b> <b>disappear.</b> The confirmation of hay fever can be obtained after examination by a general physician.|$|E
25|$|President Calderón {{visited the}} {{disaster}} area and toured {{some of the}} attractions, both {{on the ground and}} by air. He was accompanied by Michoacan's governor Leonel Godoy to survey the damage. As an alternative to mining, Calderón suggested developing tourism in Angangueo as a Pueblo Mágico. However, residents demanded the assurance that the town would <b>not</b> <b>disappear,</b> and that jobs would be available.|$|E
25|$|The Acadian {{population}} {{began to}} become more prosperous and influential during the 1980s as linguistic tensions began to relax (although <b>not</b> <b>disappearing</b> entirely).
