The estimated level of discrimination is high: The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>available</b> housing <b>units</b> about which elderly home-seekers are told is 30 percent fewer than the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>available</b> housing <b>units</b> about which young home-seekers are told.

40|$|We {{show that}} the entropy of the {{distribution}} of avalanche lifetimes in the Kinouchi-Copelli model always achieves a maximum jointly with the dynamic range. This is noteworthy and nontrivial because while the dynamic range is an equilibrium average measure of the sensibility of a sensory system to a stimulus, the entropy of relaxation times is a purely dynamical quantity, independent of the stimulus rate, that can be interpreted as the efficiency of the network seen as a communication channel. The newly found optimization occurs for all topologies we tested, even when the distribution of avalanche lifetimes itself is not a power-law and when the entropy of the size distribution of avalanches is not concomitantly maximized, strongly suggesting that dynamical rules allowing a proper temporal matching of the states of the interacting neurons is the key for achieving good performance in information processing, rather than increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>available</b> <b>units.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 4 captions, submitte...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} the genetic design of functional link networks (FLNs). FLNs are high-order perceptrons (HOPs) without hidden units. Despite their linear nature, FLNs can capture nonlinear input–output relationships, provided {{that they are}} fed with an adequate set of polynomial inputs, which are constructed out of the original input attributes. Given this set, {{it turns out to}} be very simple to train the network, as compared with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). However, finding the optimal subset of units is a difficult problem because of its nongradient nature and the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>available</b> <b>units,</b> especially for high degrees. Some constructive growing methods have been proposed to address this issue. Here, we rely on the global search capabilities of a genetic algorithm to scan the space of subsets of polynomial units, which is plagued by a host of local minima. By contrast, the quadratic error function of each individual FLN has only one minimum, which makes fitness evaluation practically noiseless. We find that surprisingly simple FLNs compare favorably with other more complex architectures derived by means of constructive and evolutionary algorithms on some UCI benchmark data sets. More-over, our models are especially amenable to interpretation, due to an incremental approach that penalizes complex architectures and starts with a pool of single-attribute FLNs.

30|$|The {{challenges}} are similar when items are not shipped from the outlets, but reserved online by a customer {{and picked up}} at the store afterwards (click-and-reserve), as the IT requirements and the picking efforts are identical. Only the packing of a parcel is not required. Therefore, only about one-fifth of the OC retailers currently use this concept. However, click-and-reserve is expected to grow in importance, as it offers also several advantages compared to click-and-collect. It enables shorter order-to-delivery cycles than click-and-collect, as the desired goods can be picked up by customers immediately. Furthermore, click-and-reserve reduces the average transportation costs compared to click-and-collect. However, picking costs are higher at the outlets than at the DC. Click-and-reserve ultimately results in better product availability as orders can be supplied from both inventories at the DC and at stores. While click-and-reserve has been tested in most of the non-food sectors, it is only used to a very limited extent at present in fashion retailing because of several availability challenges. First, the high variation in cuts and colors leads to very few items being available in stores. This limits the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>available</b> <b>units</b> for online reservations, since customers at the store may simultaneously be trying on these items or may have put them into their shopping basket. Second, items may be misplaced by store customers and their current location in the store might not be detectable with affordable effort.|$|E
40|$|A single-server {{queueing}} {{system with}} an infinite buffer is considered. The {{service of a}} customer is possible only {{in the presence of}} at least one unit of energy, and during the service the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>available</b> <b>units</b> decreases by one. New units of energy arrive in the system at random instants of time if the finite buffer for maintenance of energy is not full. Customers are impatient and leave the system without service after a random amount of waiting time. Such a queueing system describes, e. g., the operation of a sensor node which harvests energy necessary for information transmission from the environment. Aiming to minimize the loss of customers due to their impatience (and maximize the throughput of the system), a new strategy of control by providing service is proposed. This strategy suggests that service temporarily stops if the number of customers or units of energy in the system becomes zero. The server is switched off (is in sleep mode) for some time. This time finishes (the server wakes up) if both the number of customers in the buffer and the number of energy units reach some fixed threshold values or when the number of energy units reaches some threshold value and there are customers in the buffer. Arrival flows of customers and energy units are assumed to be described by an independent Markovian arrival process. The service time has a phase-type distribution. The system behavior is described by a multi-dimensional Markov chain. The generator of this Markov chain is derived. The ergodicity condition is presented. Expressions for key performance measures are given. Numerical results illustrating the dependence of a customer’s loss probability on the thresholds defining the discipline of waking up the server are provided. The importance of the account of correlation in arrival processes is numerically illustrated...|$|E
40|$|Dental Medicine (UPSDM). Virtual reality-based {{technology}} (VRBT) {{or advanced}} simulation is currently {{available for the}} instruction of dental students in preclinical restorative procedures. UPSDM {{was one of the}} first schools in the world to have extensive experience with VRBT technology using an advanced simulation unit (DentSim) from DenX, Ltd. UPSDM’s experi-ence consists of several years of research using control and experimental groups, employing students to participate in an investigative project, and using the units for remediation and a supplement to the preclinical laboratory. Currently, all first-year students (Class of 2007 and Class of 2008) are receiving most of their preparative operative training on the VRBT units. UPSDM started with one (beta) version unit in 1998, which was later updated and expanded first to four units and recently to fifteen units. This communication is presenting the studies that were of fundamental importance in making the decision to acquire fifteen units in 2003. The areas of main interest to the SDM concerning this technology were its use in teaching, refreshing, and remediating students in restorative procedures and its effectiveness as a teaching methodology in relation to time, efficiency, and faculty. Several studies with varying parameters were performed at various time points. The limited statistical analysis conducted was not conclusive for all measures, and in some cases the data only suggest areas of possible significance. This is due to the low number of students who could access the limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>available</b> <b>units</b> and the change of protocols in response to student and faculty input.

40|$|Spontaneous neural {{activity}} has been increasingly {{recognized as a}} subject of key relevance in neuroscience. It exhibits nontrivial spatiotemporal structure reflecting {{the organization of the}} underlying neural network and has proved to be closely intertwined with stimulus-induced activity patterns. As an additional contribution in this regard, we report computational studies that strongly suggest that a stimulus-free feature rules the behavior of an important psychophysical measure of the sensibility of a sensory system to a stimulus, the so-called dynamic range. Indeed in this paper we show that the entropy of the distribution of avalanche lifetimes (information efficiency, since it can be interpreted as the efficiency of the network seen as a communication channel) always accompanies the dynamic range in the benchmark model for sensory systems. Specifically, by simulating the Kinouchi-Copelli (KC) model on two broad families of model networks, we generically observed that both quantities always increase or decrease together as functions of the average branching ratio (the control parameter of the KC model) and that the information efficiency typically exhibits critical optimization jointly with the dynamic range (i. e., both quantities are optimized at the same value of that control parameter, {{that turns out to be}} the critical point of a nonequilibrium phase transition). In contrast with the practice of taking power laws to identify critical points in most studies describing measured neuronal avalanches, we rely on data collapses as more robust signatures of criticality to claim that critical optimization may happen even when the distribution of avalanche lifetimes is not a power law, as suggested by a recent experiment. Finally, we note that the entropy of the size distribution of avalanches (information capacity) does not always follow the dynamic range and the information efficiency when they are critically optimized, despite being more widely used than the latter to describe the computational capabilities of a neural network. This strongly suggests that dynamical rules allowing a proper temporal matching of the states of the interacting neurons is the key for achieving good performance in information processing, rather than increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>available</b> <b>units.</b> CAPESFAPESP (10 / 20446 - 5...|$|E
