50|$|The {{yellow to}} orange color is {{produced}} by the chemical compounds bixin and <b>norbixin,</b> which are classified as carotenoids. The fat-soluble color in the crude extract is called bixin, which can then be saponified into water-soluble <b>norbixin.</b> This dual solubility property of annatto is rare for carotenoids. The seeds contain 4.5-5.5% pigment, which consists of 70-80% bixin. Unlike beta-carotene, another well-known carotenoid, annatto-based pigments are not vitamin A precursors. The more <b>norbixin</b> in an annatto color, the more yellow it is; {{a higher level of}} bixin gives it a more orange shade.|$|E

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{effects of}} beta-carotene, oil-soluble (bixin) and water-soluble (<b>norbixin)</b> annatto preparations and mixtures of these carotenoids with {{virgin olive oil}} polar extract were assessed in bulk olive oil and oil-in-water emulsions stored at 60 degreesC. <b>Norbixin</b> was the only carotenoid that inhibited the oxidative deterioration of lipids in both systems. Though bixin and beta-carotene did not retard autoxidation, their mixtures with the polar extract from virgin olive oil enhanced the antioxidant effect of the olive oil extract. <b>Norbixin</b> (2 mM) was of similar activity to delta-tocopherol (0. 1 mM) in stored oil. The combination of <b>norbixin</b> with ascorbic acid or ascorbyl palmitate in oil showed a reduction in formation of volatile oxidation products but not in peroxide value, compared with the analogous sample lacking <b>norbixin.</b> In olive oil-in-water emulsions, <b>norbixin</b> (2 mM) reduced hydroperoxide formation to a similar extent as delta-tocopherol (0. 1 mM), which in turn was a better antioxidant than alpha-tocopherol. A synergistic effect between <b>norbixin</b> and ascorbic acid or ascorbyl palmitate was observed in the emulsion systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Annatto dyes {{are widely}} used in food and are finding {{increasing}} interest also for their application in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry. Bixin is the main pigment extracted from annatto seeds and accounts for 80 % of the carotenoids in the outer coat of the seeds; <b>norbixin</b> being the water-soluble form of the bixin. Typically annatto dyes are extracted from the seeds by mechanical means or solutions of alkali, edible oil or organic solvents, {{or a combination of}} the two depending on the desired final product. In this work CGAs are investigated as an alternative separation method for the recovery of <b>norbixin</b> from a raw extraction solution of annatto pigments in KOH. A volume of CGAs generated from a cationic surfactant (CTAB) solution is mixed with a volume of annatto solution and when the mixture is allowed to settle it separates into the top aphron phase and the bottom liquid phase. Potassium norbixinate presented in the annatto solution will interact with the surfactant in the aphron phase, which results in the effective separation of <b>norbixin.</b> Recovery= 94 % was achieved at a CTAB to <b>norbixin</b> molar ratio of 3. 3. In addition a mechanism of separation is proposed here based on the separation results with the cationic surfactant and an anionic surfactant (bis- 2 -ethyl hexyl sulfosuccinate, AOT) and measurements of surfactant to <b>norbixin</b> ratio in the aphron phase; electrostatic interactions between the surfactant and <b>norbixin</b> molecules result in the fort-nation of a coloured complex and effective separation of <b>norbixin.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier B.

The principle colouring components of annatto is the oil-soluble diapo carotenoid bixin, which is the methyl ester of the dicarboxylic acid <b>norbixin,</b> which is soluble in aqueous alkali. Bixin and <b>norbixin</b> therefore exhibit not only physicochemical properties normally associated with carotenoids but also certain anomalous properties that have an impact on the stability, food colouring applications and importantly the analysis of annatto. This review summarizes the key aspects of the structural determination of bixin (and <b>norbixin)</b> with special attention to cis-trans isomerization and how this links with its chemical structure, spectroscopic properties and stability. The oxidative, thermal and photo stability of annatto and the subsequent implications for its use in the colouring of foods, food processing, and the analysis of foods and beverages are discussed along with important mechanistic, thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. The main analytical techniques used for the chemical characterization of annatto i. e. spectrophotometry, NMR, chromatography (particularly HPLC) and mass spectrometry are reviewed in detail and other methods discussed.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to use natural pigments to replace sodium erythorbate (NaEry), a synthetic compound used as an antioxidant in sausage formulations, and to evaluate the oxidative stability of the samples. Six assays were prepared in which sodium erythorbate (ERY) at 0. 05 g/ 100 g was substituted by <b>norbixin</b> (NOR), lycopene (LYC), zeaxanthin (ZEA), beta-carotene (CAR) or dextrose (used as a control (CON)). Physical, chemical, color, texture and sensory parameters were measured {{on the first day}} and after 45 days of storage at 4 degrees C. All pigments used in the sausage formulations were able to maintain the oxidative stability of the sausages (MDA equivalents < 038 mg/kg). Zeaxanthin and <b>norbixin</b> were the most efficient antioxidants of those tested. This antioxidant effect might be associated with the intermediate polarities of these two compounds, which would allow them to concentrate in the membrane lipids or emulsion interface, where lipid oxidation is most prevalent.

BIX treatment prevented protein oxidation and nitric oxide production and restored superoxide dismutase activity. NBIX treatment did not change most parameters assessed, and at the highest dose, it increased LDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels and showed prooxidant action (increased protein oxidation and nitric oxide levels). These findings suggested that BIX could have an antihyperglycemic effect, improve lipid profiles, and protect against damage induced by oxidative stress in the diabetic state.

A number of plant species are known to possess diabetic control properties. Costus pictus D. Don is popularly known as “Insulin Plant” in Southern India whose leaves have been reported to increase insulin pools in blood plasma. Next Generation Sequencing is employed as a powerful tool for identifying molecular signatures in the transcriptome related to physiological functions of plant tissues. We sequenced the leaf transcriptome of C. pictus using Illumina reversible dye terminator sequencing technology and used combination of bioinformatics tools for identifying transcripts related to anti-diabetic properties of C. pictus. Results A total of 55, 006 transcripts were identified, of which 69. 15 % transcripts could be annotated. We identified transcripts related to pathways of bixin biosynthesis and geraniol and geranial biosynthesis as major transcripts from the class of isoprenoid secondary metabolites and validated the presence of putative <b>norbixin</b> methyltransferase, a precursor of Bixin. The transcripts encoding these terpenoids are known to be Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) agonists and anti-glycation agents. Sequential extraction and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) confirmed the presence of bixin in C. pictus methanolic extracts. Another significant transcript identified in relation to anti-diabetic, anti-obesity and immuno-modulation is of Abscisic Acid biosynthetic pathway.

The {{aim of this study}} was to find out if these compounds (bixin, BIX and <b>norbixin,</b> NOR), protect against DNA-damage caused by the metal. Therefore, rats were treated orally with methylmercury (MeHg) and with the carotenoids under conditions that are relevant to humans. The animals were treated either with MeHg (30 mu g/kg/bw/day), BIX (0. 110 mg/kg/bw/day), NOR (0. 011. 0 mg/kg/bw/day) or combinations of the metal compound and the carotenoids consecutively for 45 days. Subsequently, the glutathione levels (GSH) and the activity of catalase were determined, and DNA-damage was measured in hepatocytes and leukocytes using single cell gel electrophoresis assays. Treatment with the metal alone caused a decrease in the GSH levels (35 %) and induced DNA damage, which resulted in increased DNA migration after electrophoresis in liver and blood cells, whereas no effects were seen with the carotenoids alone. When BIX or NOR were given in combination with organic mercury, the intermediate and the highest concentrations of the carotenoids (1. 0 and 10. 0 mg/kg/bw/day BIX and 0. 1 and 1. 0 mg/kg/bw/day NOR) protected against DNA-damage. Furthermore, we found with both carotenoids, a moderate increase in the GSH levels in both metal-treated and untreated animals, while the activities of catalase remained unchanged.

The PPARγ-signaling pathway is involved in the anticancer effects of carotenoids. Activation of PPARγ partly contributes to the growth-inhibitory effects of carotenoids (β-carotene, astaxanthin, bixin, capsanthin, lutein, and lycopene) on breast cancer MCF 7 cells, leukemia K 562 cells, prostate cancer (LNCaP, DU 145, and PC 3 cells), and esophageal squamous cancer EC 109 cells. PPARγ is the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis. Downregulated PPARγ and PPARγ-target genes have been associated with the suppressive effects of β-carotene and lycopene on 3 T 3 L 1 and C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis. ß-Carotene is cleaved centrally into retinaldehyde by BCO 1, the encoding gene being a PPARγ-target gene. Retinaldehyde can be oxidized to retinoic acid and also be reduced to retinol. β-Carotene can also be cleaved asymmetrically into β-apocarotenals and β-apocarotenones by BCO 2. The inhibitory effects of β-carotene on the development of adiposity and lipid storage are dependent substantially on BCO 1 -mediated production of retinoids. The effects of β-carotene on body adiposity were absent in BCO 1 -knockout mice. Retinoid metabolism is connected with the activity of PPARγ in the control of body-fat reserves. Retinoic acid, retinaldehyde, retinol, and β-apocarotenals exert suppressive effects on preadipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis via downregulation of PPARγ expression in cell culture. The molecular mechanisms underlying retinoic acid effects on adipose-tissue biology and the development of adiposity remain poorly understood. Adiposity can be affected by retinoids through long-lasting effects at critical developmental stages. Retinol saturase increases PPARγ-transcriptional activity and adipocyte differentiation. Other carotenoids that have been reported to suppress adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation in the main via modulation of PPARγ and PPARγ-target genes include astaxanthin, bixin, <b>norbixin,</b> β-cryptoxanthin, fucoxanthin and its metabolites, lycopene, apo- 10 ’-lycopenoic acid, siphonaxanthin, and neoxanthin, except paprika pigments. Lutein, lycopene, and paprika carotenoids reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels by an induction of PPARγ in immune tissues and cells. Lycopene, apo- 10 ’-lycopenoic acid, and astaxanthin might prevent atherosclerosis through modifying cholesterol metabolism via increasing PPARγ expression in macrophages.
