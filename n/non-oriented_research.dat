Basic research in Israel only accounted for 13% of research expenditure in 2013, compared to 16% in 2006.

40|$|This study explores YouTube users’ {{creation}} {{and consumption of}} videos related to primetime Spanish TV series, from a comparative gender perspective. The exploration {{is based on a}} sample of more than 100 short YouTube videos about 21 Spanish TV series broadcast in 2013 by the three most popular mainstream national TV networks in Spain (Telecinco, Antena 3 and La 1). These videos were classified according to the (apparent) gender of their uploaders, their indicators of popularity (number of views, likes, dislikes, comments, and channel subscribers), and the nature of their content (their inclusion of original material with respect to the content broadcast on TV). In addition, the YouTube and TV audiences of the five most popular TV series in 2013 (according to audience share) were examined and compared according to gender. The analysis provided some unexpected results: despite women constituted the majority of the series’ TV audience, male audiences showed greater activity on YouTube around the videos related to such series. Moreover, while men uploaded more videos and scored higher in views and popularity indicators in the video-sharing social network, the videos created by women, comparatively, generated more comments. This study is part of the research project FEM 2012 - 33411, funded by the Basic <b>Non-Oriented</b> <b>Research</b> Sub-Program of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and directed by Dr. Rosario Lacalle Zalduendo...|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21 st century, many golf courses were {{developed}} in the Southeast of Spain, which greatly increased the number of these facilities. Almost all of these golf courses have been accompanied by large residential developments composed of thousands of dwelling units. This article seeks to identify the factors that influence golf courses’ water consumption and estimate the number of dwelling units that an associated residential development needs to have to provide the effluent necessary to fully meet the irrigation needs of a golf course. The study indicates that private golf courses achieve greater levels of irrigation efficiency than public golf courses and that the golf courses associated with residential developments subject the irrigation needs of the grassland to the sale requirements of the real estate properties. The study also estimates that a golf course requires approximately 3000 dwelling units with an average annual occupancy of 33 % to achieve self-sufficiency for irrigation. The results presented in this article are part of three research studies. The first study was carried out by the Human Geography Department thanks to an agreement reached with the Spanish Ministry of Environment in 2006. This study was led by José Ramón Navarro Vera and Armando Ortuño Padilla and was titled “Territorial impact of golf courses and associated operations in the Spanish Levante”. The second study, which is included in a project entitled “Recent urbanisation processes and sustainable water management: an exploration of relationships in the Mediterranean Coast of the Iberian Peninsula (1991 – 2008) ”, was funded by the Spanish Inter-ministerial Commission for Science and Technology (CICYT) as part of its 2009 Funding Programme for Non-oriented Basic Research Projects (CSO 2009 - 12772 - 03 - 03). The main researcher for this second study at the University of Alicante was María Hernández-Hernández, from the Interuniversity Institute for Geography. The third study, titled “Urbanisation and water metabolism in the coast of Alicante: Analysis of trends for the 2000 – 2010 period” (CSO 2012 - 36997 -C 02 - 02), was funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness in the framework of <b>non-oriented</b> <b>research</b> programmes...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} increase in the urban-residential land area of the provincial coastline of Alicante, Spain. This residential growth has mostly affected municipalities that first saw the arrival of tourism in the 1960 s and 1970 s but also affects new territories, primarily those slightly set back from the coastline. The aim of this paper is to highlight the consequences of changes in the urbanised land area over time and space on land resources and, indirectly, the relation between new urban typologies and water demand. To this end, this process will be analysed with a focus on such factors as the intensity of the process, the type of urban development and spatial differences in the rate of construction. The methodology used studies the urbanised land area by means of photogrammetric restitution of land uses in 1956, 1978 and 2013 and the development of cartography according to the dominant types of urban development. This data source will be complemented with statistical information pertaining to housing and water consumption. The results presented in this article are part of three research studies. The first, entitled “Recent urbanisation processes and sustainable water management: an exploration of relationships in the Mediterranean Coast of the Iberian Peninsula (1991 – 2008) ”, was funded by the Spanish Inter-ministerial Commission for Science and Technology (CICYT) as part of its 2009 Funding Programme for <b>Non-oriented</b> Basic <b>Research</b> Projects. The second, “Urbanisation and water metabolism in the coast of Alicante: Analysis of trends for the 2000 - 2010 period” was funded by the Spanish MINECO under grant number CSO 2012 - 36997 -C 02 - 02.

30|$|The {{empirical}} verification {{conducted in}} this study highlights the need that family business governance manages knowledge flows and the conditions of internal entrepreneurship of the operational structure in an efficient and timely manner. Constant support of the enterprise system to entrepreneurship development and effective monitoring of the spin-off firms possibly launched by family members will be vital to manage quasi-market relationships and fuel the parent company’s competitive advantage through a collaborative management of the spin-off. The gradual consolidation, even unconscious, of the cognitive map latent to business processes {{by members of the}} operational structure belonging to the owner family, together with the high degree of autonomy granted to them, can lead to the development of more direct conditions for the creation of spin-off firms. Faced with such a scenario, particularly adherent to the evolutionary paradigm of Italian family-run SMEs, this study helps to understand the need that corporate governance reconciles the diffusion of internal entrepreneurship among family members with the risk of transferring firm-specific skills to ‘non-supportive’ companies. If, on the one hand, in fact, market analysis of inter-organizational relationships between parent and spin-off companies confirms the ability of spin-off promoters to generally undertake the role of stakeholders in relation to the enterprise system, {{it is also true that}} this role may be played by the spin-off firm for various reasons and in different ways (supportive, hostile, <b>non-oriented).</b> The <b>research</b> has shown that in the case of the creation of spontaneous spin-off scripts, there is a significant risk for the parent company to have unconsciously transferred vital knowledge to a highly probable competitor. Thus, one of the major empirical findings of the proposed model lies in the opportunity offered to a family entrepreneur to reconcile his goal of disseminating knowledge within the company, pursuing the creation of a fully integrated operational structure, though there is the possible risk of creating, albeit unconsciously, the conditions for triggering a hostile spin-off process by family members, which disperse the company’s vital knowledge to the benefit of future competitors. The study of the determinants of the scripts underlying spin-off processes helps predict the hypothetical future relations with the spin-off companies and their possible attitude towards the parent company. Closer monitoring of the internal knowledge flows and a better management of the scripts exerting processes which are ‘critical’ for the enterprise will help the entrepreneur manage the spin-off processes in order to integrate the spin-off firms in a ‘quasi-market’ relationship with the parent company. In essence, it will allow the development of a collaborative relationship aimed at creating a family ‘meta-organization’.|$|R
