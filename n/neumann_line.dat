50|$|The {{meteorite}} is hexahedrite iron meteorite. It {{consists of}} meteoric iron (exclusively kamacite) and schreibersite. The {{surface of the}} meteorite is pitted and weathered. Upon etching the meteorite shows <b>Neumann</b> <b>lines.</b> The meteoric iron has Nickel concentrations as low as 1.6%.|$|R
50|$|His wide-ranging {{research}} covered many {{facets of}} geology and mineralogy. He examined the various properties of lime, gypsum and dolomite, and investigated the adsorption of potassium by clay minerals, especially kaolin. In 1893 he demonstrated that twinning {{was the cause}} of <b>Neumann</b> <b>lines</b> found in hexahedrite. His interest in chemical problems associated with geology led to his creation of the journal Chemie der Erde.|$|R
2500|$|Meteoric iron forms a few {{different}} {{structures that}} can be seen by etching or in thin sections of meteorites. [...] The Widmanstätten pattern forms when meteoric iron cools and kamacite is exsolved from taenite in the form of lamellas. Plessite is a more fine-grained intergrowth of the two minerals in between the lamella of the Widmanstätten pattern. <b>Neumann</b> <b>lines</b> are fine lines running through kamacite crystals that form through impact-related deformation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name was}} coined in 1861 and {{is derived from}} the Greek root καμακ- [...] "kamak" [...] or κάμαξ [...] "kamaks", meaning vine-pole. It is a major {{constituent}} of iron meteorites (octahedrite and hexahedrite types). In the octahedrites it is found in bands interleaving with taenite forming Widmanstätten patterns. In hexahedrites, fine parallel <b>lines</b> called <b>Neumann</b> <b>lines</b> are often seen, which are evidence for structural deformation of adjacent kamacite plates due to shock from impacts.|$|R
50|$|His {{principal}} {{interests were}} in general equilibrium theory, {{the history of}} economic thought, and capitalist economic systems. Morishima's economic theory worked towards the accommodation of von Neumann's 1937 multi-sectoral growth model to a general equilibrium model. His research reviewed the works of Marx and Walras. Considering the work of these theorists to be Ricardian, his research worked {{to show that the}} modification of them along von <b>Neumann</b> <b>lines</b> elucidates the theoretical similarities and differences between the positions.|$|R
50|$|The {{meteorite}} is {{a coarse}} octahedrite (mean bandwidth 1.34mm) with narrow cloudy taenite bands separating the kamacite lamellae. Occasional areas of coarse to fine acicular plessite and net plessite are <b>Neumann</b> <b>lines</b> and rhabdites. Sparsely developed Brezina lamellae and fine-grained globular schreibersite are present. At one exterior surface, a heat-affected zone 0.1mm thick containing unequilibrated alpha(sub)2-kamacite is preserved. Cloudy taenite extending into this zone has developed bainitic texture. The {{presence of the}} zone suggests a relatively recent fall.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Neumann</b> <b>lines,</b> or <b>Neumann</b> bands, {{are fine}} {{patterns}} of parallel lines seen in cross-sections of many hexahedrite iron meteorites in the kamacite phase, {{although they may}} appear also in octahedrites provided the kamacite phase is about 30 micrometres wide. They can be seen after a polished meteorite cross-section is treated with acid. The lines are indicative of a shock-induced deformation of the kamacite crystal, and {{are thought to be}} due to impact events on the parent body of the meteorite.|$|R
40|$|A Laplacian {{eigenfunction}} on {{a two-dimensional}} manifold dictates some natural partitions of the manifold; the most apparent one being the well studied nodal domain partition. An alternative partition is revealed by considering {{a set of}} distinguished gradient flow lines of the eigenfunction - those which are connected to saddle points. These give rise to Neumann domains. We establish complementary definitions for Neumann domains and <b>Neumann</b> <b>lines</b> and use basic Morse homology to prove their fundamental topological properties. We study the eigenfunction restrictions to these domains. Their zero set, critical points and spectral properties allow to discuss some aspects of {{counting the number of}} Neumann domains and estimating their geometry...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. The kamacite {{contains}} a general precipitation of micrometre-sized particles of exsolved taenite. Larger particles are found decorating <b>Neumann</b> <b>lines</b> and at kamacite grain boundaries. The coexisting kamacite and taenite {{appear to have}} nickel contents of 6 " 4 % and about 53 %, which are consistent with a temperature ofabout 330 - 60 ~ on the binary iron-nickel equilibrium diagram. WEEKEROO STATION is reported by Hey (1966) as a brecciated coarsest octahedrite of true band width 2 " 55 mm and with silicate inclusions. The macrostructure has been figured by Nininger 095 o) and Wasserburg and Burnett (1969) show a new photo-graph of the same section. Nickel contents of 6 " 89, 7 " 5 I, and 7. 25 have been reporte...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. The Angra dos Reis (iron) {{has been}} studied metallogl"aphically and an attempt {{has been made to}} discuss the {{circumstances}} under which the following elements of structure formed: clear etching and frosty etching kamacite, decorated <b>Neumann</b> <b>lines,</b> giant rhabdites, plate rbabdites, rhabdite clusters, microrhabdites, cohenite, and remelted troilite. The remelted troilite is taken to indicate a shock event. However, since there are no metallographically visible indications of shock in the kamacite and since the back reflection X-ray diffraction pattern shows only very faint Debye-Scherrer arcs superimposed on a pattern of sharp spots, it is concluded that the shock event ook place at a temperature that allowed shock effects to anneal out of the kamacite almost completely. A sub-microscopic precipitate in the metallic matrix is observable with the electron microscope and may represent the final precipitation of phosphide from shocked kamacite. TnE Angra dos Reis (iron) is recorded by Hey (I 966) as a nickel-poor ataxite. The main mass is in the Vatican collection and Salpeter 0957) has recorded it as a hexa-hedrite under the name Pseudo-Angra dos Reis. Our own examination indicates a hexahedrite structure. Salpeter reports that a complete individual of 6175 g and clearly showing flight markings was part of a collection, which was sent from Brazi...|$|R
40|$|River Mountains {{from the}} British Museum Collection and {{a sample of}} Lombard have been pre-pared for {{metallographic}} examination and details of their structures have been mapped {{with the aid of}} a specially constructed X-Y plotting device that is geared to the stage of a metallurgical micro-scope. The following elements of structure have been studied and an attempt has been made to discuss the circumstances under which they were formed: clear etching and frosty etching kamacite, decorated <b>Neumann</b> <b>lines,</b> giant rhabdites, plate rhabdites, rhabdite clusters, microrhabdites, cohenite or decomposed cohenite, and troilite (which in some instances i recrystallized orremelted). In general the range of structural effects i similar to that previously reported for the Angra dos Reis hexahedrite (Min. Mag. I 971, 38, 94 -IOI). The variations of structure are discussed in relation to nickel content and trace element chemistry of the meteorites. THE chemical composition and geographical distribution of hexahedrites has been discussed by Henderson (I 941, 1965). Buchwald (1967) has examined the macro- and microstructures of Indian Valley and of Scottsville. Wasson and Goldstein (1968) have investigated the chemical composition and microstructure of the North Chilean hexahedrites using I g. samples for chemical analysis and approximately 2 - 3 cm...|$|R
50|$|The {{name comes}} from the cubic (i.e. hexahedron) {{structure}} of the kamacite crystal.After etching, hexahedrites do not display a Widmanstätten pattern, but they often do show <b>Neumann</b> lines: parallel <b>lines</b> that cross each other at various angles, and are indicative of impact shock on the parent body. These lines are named after Johann G. Neumann, who discovered them in 1848.|$|R
40|$|This paper gives a {{proof of}} the conjecture, but it remains open whether we can take c = 3. We cannot take c = 2, since 1 -dimensional affine groups AGL(1; F) (F an {{infinite}} field) are soluble, and 2 -transitive in their action on the affine <b>line.</b> <b>Neumann</b> has shown that for finite soluble permutation groups, the number of orbits on triples tends to infinity with the degree. None {{of this has been}} published. There is a related 1 2 Dugald Macpherson result in [2] (Theorem 3. 2), where it is shown that if n k (G; is finite for all positive integers k, then G generates the variety of all groups, that is, G satisfies no non-trivial law. (Observe that by the Downward LowenheimSkolem Theorem, the countability assumption in [2] can be omitted.) I would like to thank Peter Neumann and John Wilson for a number of very helpful comment...|$|R
500|$|Due {{to these}} limitations, a new {{infantry}} anti-tank weapon was required, and this ultimately {{came in the}} form of the Projector, Infantry, Anti-Tank, commonly abbreviated to PIAT. The origins of the PIAT can be traced back as far as 1888, when an American engineer by the name of Charles Edward Munroe was experimenting with guncotton; he discovered that the explosive would yield a great deal more damage if there were a recess in it facing the target. [...] This phenomenon is known as the 'Munroe effect'. The German scientist Egon <b>Neumann,</b> found that <b>lining</b> the recess with metal enhanced the damage dealt even more. By the 1930s Henry Mohaupt, a Swiss engineer, had developed this technology even further and created hollow charge ammunition. This consisted of a recessed metal cone placed into an explosive warhead; when the warhead hit its target, the explosive detonated and turned the cone into an extremely high-speed spike. The speed of the spike, and the immense pressure it caused on impact, allowed it to create a small hole in armour plating and send a large pressure wave and large amounts of fragments into the interior of the target. It was this technology that was utilized in the No. 68 anti-tank grenade.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of moisture within fructose and lactose droplets, subjected to convective drying conditions, was predicted using a convective-diffusion equation {{based on a}} solute fixed coordinate system. The partial differential equation was solved using the method of <b>lines.</b> <b>Neumann</b> and Robbins type boundary conditions were imposed at the centre and at the droplet-air interface, respectively. The temperature history was predicted by coupling the heat balance equation with {{the rate of change}} in average moisture. The {{distribution of}} glass transition temperature (T-g) within the droplet and at the surface layer was predicted. The concept of sticky point temperature (T-sticky) was introduced and used as an indicator of the development of stickiness at the droplet surface. Single droplets were dried in a controlled air stream and their moisture and temperature history were measured experimentally. These data were used to compare with the model predictions. A custom built in situ surface stickiness testing instrument was used to experimentally determine the development of surface stickiness at the droplet surface. These data were used to validate the model on surface stickiness. The model predicted the experimental moisture and temperature histories of fructose and lactose droplets within +/- 5 - 7 % absolute error and +/- 1 - 2 degrees C accuracy. It also predicted the development of surface stickiness of fructose and lactose droplets reasonably well. In test conditions, lactose surface attained non-sticky state through crystallization or transformation into glassy state. Fructose droplets remained sticky even in a bone dry state due to their low T-g. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
