25|$|An <b>n-ary</b> quasigroup with an <b>n-ary</b> {{version of}} {{associativity}} is called an <b>n-ary</b> group.|$|E
25|$|Boolean {{identities are}} assertions {{of the form}} s= t where s and t are <b>n-ary</b> terms, by which we shall mean here terms whose {{variables}} are limited to x'0 through x'n-1. An <b>n-ary</b> term is either an atom or an application. An application m'f'i(t0,...,t'm-1) is a pair consisting of an m-ary operation m'f'i and a list or m-tuple (t0,...,t'm-1) of m <b>n-ary</b> terms called operands.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{arguments}} taken by each operation {{is called the}} arity of the operation. An operation on {0,1} of arity n, or <b>n-ary</b> operation, {{can be applied to}} any of 2n possible values for its n arguments. For each choice of arguments the operation may return 0 or 1, whence there are 22n <b>n-ary</b> operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} axiom schema {{and three}} inference rules axiomatize the Boolean algebra of <b>n-ary</b> terms.|$|E
25|$|R3. From s0= t0,...,s'm-1= t'm-1 infer m'f'i(s0,...,s'm-1)= m'f'i(t0,...,t'm-1), {{where all}} terms si, ti are <b>n-ary.</b>|$|E
25|$|R2. From s= u and t= u infer s= t where s, t, and u are <b>n-ary</b> terms.|$|E
25|$|Now {{what is an}} atom? Conventionally an atom {{is either}} a {{constant}} (0 or 1) or a variable x'i where 0 ≤ i < n. For the proof technique here it is convenient to define atoms instead to be <b>n-ary</b> operations n'f'i, which although treated here as atoms nevertheless mean the same as ordinary terms of the exact form n'f'i(x0,...,x'n-1) (exact in that the variables must listed in the order shown without repetition or omission). This is not a restriction because atoms of this form include all the ordinary atoms, namely the constants 0 and 1, which arise here as the <b>n-ary</b> operations n'f0 and n'f−1 for each n (abbreviating 22n−1 to −1), and the variables x0,...,x'n-1 {{as can be seen}} from the truth tables where x0 appears as both the unary operation 1f2 and the binary operation 2f10 while x1 appears as 2f12.|$|E
25|$|A {{family is}} indexed by an index set. In {{the case of}} a family of {{operations}} forming an algebra, the indices are called operation symbols, constituting the language of that algebra. The operation indexed by each symbol is called the denotation or interpretation of that symbol. Each operation symbol specifies the arity of its interpretation, whence all possible interpretations of a symbol have the same arity. In general it is possible for an algebra to interpret distinct symbols with the same operation, {{but this is not the}} case for the prototype, whose symbols are in one-one correspondence with its operations. The prototype therefore has 22n <b>n-ary</b> operation symbols, called the Boolean operation symbols and forming the language of Boolean algebra. Only a few operations have conventional symbols, such as ¬ for negation, ∧ for conjunction, and ∨ for disjunction. It is convenient to consider the i-th <b>n-ary</b> symbol to be n'f'i as done below in the section on truth tables.|$|E
25|$|A Boolean-valued {{model for}} the {{language}} L consists of a universe M, which {{is a set of}} elements (or names), together with interpretations for the symbols. Specifically, the model must assign to each constant symbol of L an element of M, and to each <b>n-ary</b> function symbol f of L and each n-tuple <a0,...,an-1> of elements of M, the model must assign an element of M to the term f(a0,...,an-1).|$|E
25|$|Interpretation of {{the atomic}} {{formulas}} of L is more complicated. To each pair a and b of elements of M, the model must assign a truth value ||a=b|| to the expression a=b; this truth value is taken from the Boolean algebra B. Similarly, for each <b>n-ary</b> relation symbol R of L and each n-tuple <a0,...,an-1> of elements of M, the model must assign an element of B to be the truth value ||R(a0,...,an-1)||.|$|E
25|$|The finitary {{operations}} on {0,1} may be exhibited as truth tables, thinking of 0 and 1 as the truth values false and true. They can be {{laid out in}} a uniform and application-independent way that allows us to name, or at least number, them individually. These names provide a convenient shorthand for the Boolean operations. The names of the <b>n-ary</b> operations are binary numbers of 2n bits. There being 22n such operations, one cannot ask for a more succinct nomenclature. Note that each finitary operation can be called a switching function.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of an <b>n-ary</b> predicate symbol {{is a set}} of n-tuples of elements of the domain of discourse. This means that, given an interpretation, a predicate symbol, and n elements of the domain of discourse, one can tell whether the predicate is true of those elements according to the given interpretation. For example, an interpretation I(P) of a binary predicate symbol P may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second. According to this interpretation, the predicate P would be true if its first argument is less than the second.|$|E
25|$|The <b>n-ary</b> Boolean {{operations}} themselves {{constitute a}} power set algebra 2W, namely when W {{is taken to}} be the set of 2n valuations of the n inputs. In terms of the naming system of operations n'f'i where i in binary is a column of a truth table, the columns can be combined with Boolean operations of any arity to produce other columns present in the table. That is, we can apply any Boolean operation of arity m to m Boolean operations of arity n to yield a Boolean operation of arity n, for any m and n.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} therefore has two operations {{taking no}} arguments, called zeroary or nullary operations, namely zero and one. It has four unary operations, {{two of which}} are constant operations, another is the identity, and the most commonly used one, called negation, returns the opposite of its argument: 1 if 0, 0 if 1. It has sixteen binary operations; again two of these are constant, another returns its first argument, yet another returns its second, one is called conjunction and returns 1 if both arguments are 1 and otherwise 0, another is called disjunction and returns 0 if both arguments are 0 and otherwise 1, and so on. The number of (n+1)-ary operations in the prototype is the square of the number of <b>n-ary</b> operations, so there are 162 = 256 ternary operations, 2562 = 65,536 quaternary operations, and so on.|$|E
500|$|Groupoids {{are similar}} to groups except that the {{composition}} [...] need not be defined for all a and b. They arise {{in the study of}} more complicated forms of symmetry, often in topological and analytical structures, such as the fundamental groupoid or stacks. Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary <b>n-ary</b> one (i.e., an operation taking n arguments). With the proper generalization of the group axioms this gives rise to an <b>n-ary</b> group. The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.|$|E
2500|$|... {{and given}} an m-ary {{function}} f, and <b>n-ary</b> functions g1, ..., g'm, we can construct another <b>n-ary</b> function ...|$|E
2500|$|An <b>n-ary</b> quasigroup is a {{set with}} an <b>n-ary</b> operation, [...] with , such that the {{equation}} [...] has a unique solution for any one variable if all the other n variables are specified arbitrarily. [...] Polyadic or multiary means <b>n-ary</b> for some nonnegative integer n.|$|E
2500|$|In a structure, an {{interpretation}} ties the function and relation symbols to mathematical objects that justify their names: The interpretation of an <b>n-ary</b> function symbol f in a structure A with domain A {{is a function}} fA:An→A, and the interpretation of an <b>n-ary</b> relation symbol is a relation RA⊆An. Here A'n = A × A × ... × A denotes the n-fold cartesian product of the domain A with itself, and so f is in fact an <b>n-ary</b> function, and R an <b>n-ary</b> relation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{class of}} all <b>N-ary</b> predicates and <b>N-ary</b> {{operations}} of a concrete category (C,U), with N ranging over {{the class of}} all cardinal numbers, forms a large signature. [...] The category of models for this signature then contains a full subcategory which is equivalent to C.|$|E

2500|$|Example 2. All bit vectors {{of a given}} length form a Boolean algebra [...] "pointwise", {{meaning that}} any <b>n-ary</b> Boolean {{operation}} {{can be applied to}} n bit vectors one bit position at a time. For example, the ternary OR of three bit vectors each of length 4 is the bit vector of length 4 formed by oring the three bits {{in each of the four}} bit positions, thus 0100∨1000∨1001= 1101. Another example is the truth tables above for the <b>n-ary</b> operations, whose columns are all the bit vectors of length 2n and which therefore can be combined pointwise whence the <b>n-ary</b> operations form a Boolean algebra.|$|E

2500|$|The {{interpretation}} function I of [...] assigns {{functions and}} relations to {{the symbols of}} the signature. Each function symbol f of arity n is assigned an <b>n-ary</b> function [...] on the domain. Each relation symbol R of arity n is assigned an <b>n-ary</b> relation [...] on the domain. A nullary function symbol c is called a constant symbol, because its interpretation I(c) can be identified with a constant element of the domain.|$|E

[...] An interpretation of a constant symbol of σ in M is simply an element of M. [...] More generally, an interpretation of an <b>n-ary</b> function symbol f is a function from M'n to M. Similarly, an interpretation of a relation symbol R is an <b>n-ary</b> relation on M, i.e. a subset ofM'n.|$|E
