Queen's Park would ultimately become the only Scottish club to reach the final of the FA Cup, although they returned the following year where they again faced Blackburn Rovers.|$|E

5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go back down and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, but he did <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and {{it was difficult to}} take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E

5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey did <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E
5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
5|$|As {{publishing}} {{began to}} change its form in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, large publishing houses pushed out small, independent booksellers. Johnson did <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to form or join one of these new firms. In the late 1790s and early 19th century, Johnson's business declined, particularly as his relatives, John Miles and Roland Hunter, began {{to take over the}} daily operations; Miles was uninterested in the business, and Hunter did not have Johnson's commercial sense or his ability to choose successful manuscripts. In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of his stock.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E

The authors' speeches did <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to sway their audiences towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values.|$|E
5|$|Despite Queen's Park {{entering}} the match as favourites, it was Blackburn Rovers {{who won the}} game by two goals to one with goals from Jimmy Douglas and Jimmy Forrest; Robert M Christie scored for Queen's Park. The Scottish team had a goal disallowed during play, and the referee later {{said that they had}} scored once more but as the players did <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to claim it, he had not bothered to award it. The two teams met once more in the final of the following FA Cup final in 1885.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} weeks of World War II, {{warships}} of the United States Navy, the British Royal Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy bombarded industrial and military facilities in Japan. Most of these bombardments involved battleships and cruisers which caused heavy damage to several of the factories targeted, as well as nearby civilian areas. A major goal of the attacks was to provoke the Japanese military into committing some of its reserve force of aircraft into battle. However, the Japanese did <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to attack the Allied bombardment forces, {{and none of the}} involved warships suffered any damage.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the IAU officially {{released}} a statement to define what constitutes an extrasolar planet and what constitutes an orbiting star. To date, it remains the only official decision reached by the IAU on this issue.

5|$|In {{order to}} run safely on {{multiprocessor}} machines, access to shared resources (like files, data structures) must be serialized so that threads or processes do <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> {{to modify the}} same resource at the same time. In order to prevent multiple threads from accessing or modifying a shared resource simultaneously, DragonFly employs critical sections, and serializing tokens to prevent concurrent access. While both Linux and FreeBSD 5 employ fine-grained mutex models to achieve higher performance on multiprocessor systems, DragonFly does not. Until recently, DragonFly also employed spls, but these were replaced with critical sections.|$|E
