5000|$|On June 18, 1888, {{an act of}} January 25, 1849, {{declaring the}} Saline River to be navigable, was {{repealed}} by the Illinois General Assembly. The river was deemed [...] "impractical" [...] for <b>navigation</b> <b>due</b> to the [...] "anxiousness" [...] of County residents to build bridges across it.|$|R
5000|$|... 'The north star' {{is one of}} {{two common}} {{alternative}} names for Polaris (its other being 'the pole star'). It is the only visible polar star in either hemisphere, and has long been used for <b>navigation</b> <b>due</b> to its constant fixed and unmoving appearance due north in the night sky.|$|R

50|$|Notable cays {{within the}} sea include the Parrot Cays, Sand Bank Cays, and Fish Cays. The {{area around the}} Sand Bank Cays, between Treasure Cay and Whale Cay, is {{notoriously}} treacherous to <b>navigation</b> <b>due</b> to breaking shoals and relatively shallow water. Vessels with a draft greater than 1.2 metres (4 feet) are usually warned to avoid this area.|$|R
50|$|Old {{riverbed}} of the Danube caused {{problems for}} the <b>navigation</b> <b>due</b> to its heavy bending in this area. In order to solve the problem, Austria-Hungary began digging the canal which would straighten {{the flow of the}} river in 1892. After 17 years, the Mohovo-Šarengrad canal was finally finished, and as a result the Island of Šarengrad was formed in 1909.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} was {{a much-needed}} aid to <b>navigation</b> <b>due</b> {{to the number}} of wrecks on the dangerous reefs of Whitburn Steel which lay directly under the water in the surrounding area. In one year alone - 1860 - there were 20 shipwrecks. This contributed to making this coastline the most dangerous in the country, with an average of around 44 shipwrecks per every mile of coastline.|$|R
50|$|Kane harbored {{at a point}} {{thought to}} be 5000 yards seaward from LUELLA Passage, at 2030, nine hours prior to the main attack force. Before an {{advanced}} landing party was about to set off to shore, they discovered that an error had occurred in <b>navigation,</b> <b>due</b> to misinterpretation of the island profile. The group reembarked Kane and proceeded northward approximately 12,000 yards to their corrected position toward LUELLA.|$|R
50|$|Petersburg {{began as}} a trade center for {{agriculture}} {{in the region and}} a shipping point, where a railhead met a point in the Sangamon River that was both navigable and crossable. In recent decades, the depth of the Sangamon River at Petersburg has become too shallow for <b>navigation,</b> <b>due</b> to silting from local farming and from the diverting of natural runoff into artificial reservoirs such as Lake Petersburg and Lake Springfield.|$|R

It also comes with a car charger and car kit inside the box because the GPS decreases the battery life. Both the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and the 5800 Navigation Edition, however, have free lifetime <b>navigation,</b> <b>due</b> to the new version of Ovi Maps.The service is now available at nokia.com.|$|R
5000|$|In 1799 {{the nearby}} Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal company {{proposed}} to connect their canal to the Rochdale canal with an aqueduct across the Mersey and Irwell <b>Navigation.</b> <b>Due</b> mainly to strong objections from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, {{who would have}} suffered a loss of trade, the link was not forthcoming.

However, she soon rejects him upon meeting a male of her species (who is never named). Noah brings the moles onto the island to assist in navigation, having heard legends that golden moles are expert navigators, but to his disappointment the moles turn out to be inept at <b>navigation</b> <b>due</b> to their poor eyesight.|$|R
50|$|The Connecticut River {{carries a}} heavy amount of silt, {{especially}} during the spring snow melt, from {{as far north as}} Quebec. This heavy silt concentration manifests in a large sandbar near the Connecticut's mouth, which has, historically, provided a formidable obstacle to <b>navigation.</b> <b>Due</b> to the difficulty it presents to ships, the Connecticut {{is one of the few}} major rivers in the United States without a major city at its mouth. The Connecticut's major cities - Hartford and Springfield - lie 45 and 69 mi upriver, respectively.|$|R

50|$|Without their {{accuracy}} and {{the accuracy of}} the feats of navigation that marine chronometers enabled, it is arguable that the ascendancy of the Royal Navy, and by extension that of the British Empire, would not have occurred; the formation of the empire by wars and conquests of colonies abroad took place in a period in which British vessels had reliable <b>navigation</b> <b>due</b> to the chronometer, while their Portuguese, Dutch, and French opponents did not. For example: the French were well established in India and other places before Britain, but were defeated by naval forces in the Seven Years' War.|$|R

50|$|Mining in the Garforth area of West Yorkshire {{dates back}} centuries, and the Gascoignes, being major landholders in the area, had owned pits {{since at least}} the 17th century. The {{introduction}} of steam-driven pumps in the 18th century allowed deeper mines to be worked, and extended the usefulness of the Gascoignes' mines. The area around Garforth and Aberford was at a disadvantage compared to other mining regions because of poor transportation. High turnpike fees, and the inability to access the Aire and Calder <b>Navigation</b> <b>due</b> to competing interests owning land on the few miles to the canal meant that the sale of coal to nearby Leeds was uneconomic.|$|R

40|$|Smce the Selective Availability {{was turned}} off, {{one of the}} major error sources in GNSS user {{positioning}} is represented by the deleterious superimposition of the same SIS due to obstruction and ground reflections (multipath). Such an ermr component is the most critical in case of urban (or indoor) <b>navigation</b> <b>due</b> to the high density of possible scatterers around the receiver. In this paper, a multiple Delay Lock Loop (DLL) architecture for navigation receivers, which is derived from the philosophy of the RAKE receiver for communication, is proposed. In this sense, it is quite diITerent from common multipath rejection techniques almady proposed, where the multipath is not tracked.

40|$|GSM-based {{positioning}} {{technology is}} {{more suitable for}} navigation than GPS in urban, indoor and even underground areas. However, it cannot be used for automotive <b>navigation</b> <b>due</b> to its large positioning error (more than 100 m). This paper presents an approach utilizing fractal analysis and wavelet transform to enhance GSM-based positioning accuracy. Fractal theory and analysis is introduced into the research of GSM downlink multipath fading. The GSM base station signal strength data are converted into representations in terms of wavelet bases. The approach performs real-time signal strength processing. Based on strength data of the signals from different base stations, the distances between the receiver and stations are estimated and then the position estimation of the receiver can be applied. The position accuracy can be improved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel shared control algorithm for robotized wheelchairs. The proposed algorithm {{is a new}} method to extend autonomous navigation techniques into the shared control domain. It reactively combines user’s and robot’s commands into a continuous function that approximates a classic Navigation Function (NF) by weighting input commands with NF constraints. Our approach overcomes the main drawbacks of NFs -calculus complexity and limitations on environment modeling- {{so it can be}} used in dynamic unstructured environments. It also benefits from NF properties: convergence to destination, smooth paths and safe <b>navigation.</b> <b>Due</b> to the user’s contribution to control, our function is not strictly a NF, so we call it a pseudo-navigation function (PNF) instead.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} the {{perception}} task of a wearable navigation assistant. Specifically, we have focused on the detection of staircases because of the important role they play in indoor <b>navigation</b> <b>due</b> to the multi-floor reaching possibilities they bring and the lack of security they cause, specially for those who suffer from visual deficiencies. We use the depth sensing capacities of the modern RGB-D cameras to segment and classify the different elements that integrate the scene and then carry out the stair detection and modelling algorithm to retrieve all the information that might interest the user, i. e. the location and orientation of the staircase, the number of steps and the step dimensions. Experiments prove that the system is able to perform in real-time and works even under partial occlusions of the stairway...|$|R

40|$|In the {{embedded}} systems of visual <b>navigation,</b> <b>due</b> to {{the limitations of}} images capture working environment conditions, there are sometimes defects of nonuniform illumination and noisy in the captured images.

In this paper, taking these two limitations into consideration, we proposed an efficient and fast method to determine the threshold value by using integral image and statistical methods {{which is similar to}} the local threshold method and meet the requirement of real-time performance in embedded systems.
