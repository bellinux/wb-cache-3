40|$|To {{observe the}} effects of {{different}} acupuncture manipulations on blood pressure and target organ damage in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), this study used the reinforcing twirling method (1. 5 – 2 -mm depth; rotating needle clockwise for 360 ° and then counter clockwise for 360 °, with the thumb moving heavily forward and gently backward, 60 times per minute for 1 minute, and retaining needle for 9 minutes), the reducing twirling method (1. 5 – 2 -mm depth; rotating <b>needle</b> <b>counter</b> clockwise for 360 ° and then clockwise for 360 °, with the thumb moving heavily backward and gently forward, 60 times per minute for 1 minute, and retaining needle for 9 minutes), and the needle retaining method (1. 5 – 2 -mm depth and retaining the needle for 10 minutes). Bilateral Taichong (LR 3) was treated by acupuncture using different manipulations and manual stimulation. Reinforcing twirling, reducing twirling, and needle retaining resulted in a decreased number of apoptotic cells, reduced Bax mRNA and protein expression, and an increased Bcl- 2 /Bax ratio in the hippocampus compared with the SHR group. Among these groups, the Bcl- 2 /Bax protein ratio was highest in the reducing twirling group, and the Bcl- 2 /Bax mRNA ratio was highest in the needle retaining group. These results suggest that reinforcing twirling, reducing twirling, and needle retaining methods all improve blood pressure and prevent target organ damage by increasing the hippocampal Bcl- 2 /Bax ratio and inhibiting cell apoptosis in the hippocampus in SHR...|$|E
25|$|A {{row counter}} for hand {{knitting}} is a tally counter for counting rows or courses worked, for counting stitch pattern repetitions, or for counting increases or decreases {{of the number}} of stitches in consecutive rows. The first commercially produced one appeared on the market in the 1920s after the general public started regularly knitting from unfamiliar printed and complex patterns. Design variations include on-needle barrel-shaped counters for straight-needle work, stitch-marker counters for knitting on double-pointed and circular <b>needles,</b> complex <b>counters</b> which attempted to assist with decreases, increases and lacework, stand-alone hand-held counters in imitation of the hand-tally, pendant counters worn round the neck and online software for iPhones.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s the UK {{knitting}} accessories manufacturer Millward {{produced the}} Ro-Tally, {{whose name was}} a pun on rotary. Its design was {{very similar to the}} I.X. Products version, it used the same patent number and the precision of engineering was improved, although the inner spring was still too small for 4 mm needles. The Millward Ro-Tally was re-designed quite differently in the 1970s in various sizes, of softer plastic with a plastic spring which fitted large and small <b>needles.</b> These <b>counters</b> were not precisely engineered, so depended on polygonal barrels and outer skin to provide sufficient friction to control unnecessary movement while knitting.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} {{developments in the}} 1920 s that accompanied the birth of coincidence methods, as well as later crucial applications during the 1930 s and 1940 s are presented. In 1924 Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger applied a coincidence method {{to the study of}} Compton scattering with Geiger <b>needle</b> <b>counters.</b> Their experiment confirmed the existence of radiation quanta and established the validity of conservation principles in elementary processes. At the end of the 1920 s, Bothe and Werner Kolhörster coupled the coincidence technique with the new Geiger-Müller counter to study cosmic rays, marking the start of cosmic-ray research as a branch of physics. The coincidence method was further refined by Bruno Rossi, who developed a vacuum-tube device capable of registering the simultaneous occurrence of electrical pulses from any number of counters with a tenfold improvement in time resolution. The electronic coincidence circuit bearing Rossi's name was instrumental in his research on the corpuscular nature and the properties of cosmic radiation during the early 1930 s, a period characterized by a lively debate between Millikan and followers of the corpuscular interpretation. The Rossi coincidence circuit was also {{at the core of the}} counter-controlled cloud chamber developed by Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini, and became one of the important ingredients of particle and nuclear physics. During the late 1930 s and 1940 s, coincidences, anti-coincidences and delayed coincidences played a crucial role in a series of experiments on the decay of the muon, which inaugurated the current era of particle physics.

5000|$|On July 6, 1952, Steen hit it big but he didn't realize {{until three}} weeks later. He was {{drilling}} {{down through the}} layers of sandstone when his drill bit broke off at 197 feet deep just 3 feet short of his goal. Finding this massive deposit of uranium ore only became apparent {{when he took a}} piece of the blackish core he found while drilling weeks earlier back to Cisco. He stopped to fill up his jeep and decided to have the core tested by a friend with a Geiger counter and they found that the piece made the Geiger <b>counter</b> <b>needle</b> go crazy. The high grade uranium deposit was located at Big Indian Wash of Lisbon Valley, southeast of Moab, Utah. (Coordinates: N 38.19000 W 109.26000). Sometimes {{recognized as one of the}} most important deposits of any kind found during the last century, Steen named the claim the [...] "Mi Vida" [...] mine (My Life). The Mi Vida mine was one of the first big strikes of the uranium boom. Steen made millions off his claims, and provoked a [...] "Uranium Rush" [...] of prospectors into the Four Corners region, similar to the Gold Rush of the 1850s in California.6 ...|$|R
5000|$|With its red bodywork, {{inspired}} by the typical Alfa Romeo paintwork, the 2uettottanta is 1797 mm wide, 4212.6 mm long, 1280 mm high and has a wheelbase of 2500 mm. [...] Clean, elegantly lined, simple 2-seater, all-Italian, the car features design cues from the Alfa Romeo Duetto and it has front end that underlines Alfa Romeo character, triangle with Alfa Romeo emblem. The bodywork’s soft curves are set off perfectly by the bold metallic paint. The volumes of the Alfa Romeo 2uettottanta by Pininfarina are light, slender, refined, with shapes that seem to cross the air with ease: the car seems to raise itself from earth and [...] "to go beyond". This {{is the result of}} an optical effect obtained thanks to the line that crosses the car horizontally. The front-end of the 2uettottanta features a central line. To the sides of the Alfa Romeo emblem, there are two air inlets, in a triangular shape. The headlights, based on the last LED technologies, are set under the line that characterizes the entire car. A carbon band in {{the lower part of the}} front end acts as a splitter and conveys the air towards the back. The horizontal line that starts from the front wheel and extends to the posterior wheel drives great dynamism. The back too is characterized by smooth and essential surfaces. The two bumps seem to be born from the volume. They look like floating wings and create the roll-bars at the back of the seats. The inside is spacious and comfortable. The form-fitting sports seats give outstanding support, and our arms are held at a perfect distance for us to clutch the small 14.2-inch-diameter retro-styled three-spoke steering wheel. The driving position is low to the ground and the seatback steeply raked. The major controls are placed logically around the steering column and on the central tunnel, as well as across the upper dash. The detailing includes glowing white Alfa Romeo badges on the centre of the speedometer and rev <b>counter</b> <b>needles.</b> The gearlever is finished in machined aluminum billet. Beautifully integrated into its design is the bright red start button.|$|R
