This pattern implies a block-triangular form (BTF) of the DAE that can be exploited to speed up numerical solution. The paper compares this fine BTF with the usually coarser BTF derived from the sparsity pattern of the signature matrix. It defines a Fine-Block Graph with weighted edges, which gives insight into the relation between coarse and fine blocks, and the permitted ordering of blocks to achieve BTF. It also illuminates {{the structure of the}} set of <b>normalised</b> <b>offset</b> vectors of the DAE, e. g. this set is finite if and only if there is just one coarse block...|$|E
30|$|A {{transportable}} diamond crystal attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer (Agilent Technologies 5500 a) {{was used}} to collect spectra in the 650 – 4000  cm- 1 region. The spectra were collected using Microlab PC software in absorbance mode using 128 scans at 8  cm- 1 resolution. No sample preparation was required and polymers were directly analysed on the diamond window. Intimate contact of the sample with the crystal window was required to give good quality spectra; samples were clamped against the diamond window using a pressure clamp for solids. Samples were often irregularly shaped and ten spectra (n[*]=[*] 10) were recorded across the entire surface of the object under study. Spectra were processed with MATLAB version 7.13. 0.564 (R 2011 b) (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) incorporating PLS_Toolbox version 6.7 (Eigenvector Research Inc., WA, USA). Data were derivatised (Savitzky Golay 1 st derivative filter with 13 points and a 2 nd order polynomial) to remove baseline <b>offset,</b> <b>normalised</b> to the largest peak and then mean centred prior to carrying out PCA. The pre-processing techniques used helped to reduce noise and emphasise any regions of spectral change.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} sample of 10 short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with a robust {{redshift}} determination, discovered by the Swift satellite up to January 2011. We measure their X-ray absorbing column densities and collect data on the host galaxy offsets. We find evidence for intrinsic absorption and no correlation between the intrinsic absorbing column density and the projected offset of the GRB from its host galaxy center. We find that the properties in the gamma regime (T 90, fluence and 1 -s peak photon flux) of short GRBs with "bright" and "faint" X-ray afterglow likely disfavour different prompt emission mechanisms. Host galaxy offset and GRB duration (T 90) do not correlate. Instead, there is a hint of anti-correlation between the effective radius <b>normalised</b> host galaxy <b>offset</b> and T 90. Finally, we examine the properties of short GRBs with short-lived and long-lived X-ray afterglows, finding that some short GRBs with short-lived X-ray afterglows have their optical afterglow detected. In light of this, the X-ray afterglow duration {{does not seem to}} be an unique indicator of a specific progenitor and/or environment for short GRBs.
