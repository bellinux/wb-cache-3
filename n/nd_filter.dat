The first one uses only a polarizer, and the second one a polarizer and a 1000× <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> (ND3.0), which allowed the second shot to have a much longer exposure, smoothing any motion.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common are the {{variable}} <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> and the extreme <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> {{such as the}} Lee Big Stopper.|$|R
50|$|Neutral density (<b>ND)</b> <b>filters</b> {{come in two}} types: {{absorptive}} and reflective.|$|R
50|$|In practice, <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> are not perfect, {{as they do}} {{not reduce}} the {{intensity}} of all wavelengths equally. This can sometimes create color casts in recorded images, particularly with inexpensive filters. More significantly, most <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> are only specified over the visible region of the spectrum and do not proportionally block all wavelengths of ultraviolet or infrared radiation. This can be dangerous if using <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> to view sources (such as the Sun or white-hot metal or glass), which emit intense invisible radiation, since the eye may be damaged even though the source does not look bright when viewed through the filter. Special filters must be used if such sources are to be safely viewed.|$|R

50|$|Reflective {{filters are}} made with a thin {{metallic}} coating and hence operate over a larger bandwidth. An ND 3 metallic filter will be good over 200-2000 nm. The attenuation will rapidly increase outside this spectral region because of absorption in the glass substrate. These filters reflect rather than absorb the incident power, and hence can handle higher input average powers. However, they are less well suited to the high peak powers of pulsed lasers. These filters work fine to about 5 W average power (over about 1 cm2 illumination area) before heating causes them to crack. Since these filters reflect light, one must be careful when stacking multiple ND filters, since multiple reflections among the filters will cause a ghost image {{to interfere with the}} original beam profile. One way to mitigate this problem is by tilting the <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> stack. Assuming that the absorption of the metallic <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> is negligible, the order of the <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> stack doesn’t matter, as it does for the absorptive filters.|$|E
50|$|To create {{ethereal}} looking {{landscapes and}} seascapes with extremely blurred water or other motion, {{the use of}} multiple stacked <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> might be required. This had, {{as in the case of}} variable NDs, the effect of reducing image quality. To counter this, some manufacturers have produced high-quality extreme <b>ND</b> <b>filters.</b> Typically these are rated at a 10-stop reduction, allowing very slow shutter speeds even in relatively bright conditions.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} impact of opacities in the optical pathway and image {{compression}} of 32 -bit raw data to 8 -bit jpg images on quantified optical coherence tomography (OCT) image analysis. METHODS: In 18 eyes of nine healthy subjects, OCT images were acquired from the central macula. To simulate opacities in the optical system, neutral-density (<b>ND)</b> <b>filters</b> with linear absorption spectra were placed between the OCT device and examined eyes. Light reflection profiles (LRPs) of images acquired with various <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> were compared. LRPs of the 32 -bit raw data were compared with those obtained from the 8 -bit jpg compressed images. RESULTS: <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> induced a linear decrease of reflectivity in OCT images, depending on initial signal intensity. Quantitative OCT analysis showed {{no significant difference between}} 32 -bit raw data and 8 -bit jpg files (P > 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative OCT analysis is not significantly influenced by data compression. A mathematical model can correct for optical opacities to improve OCT images...|$|R
5000|$|In {{more modern}} times, {{the use of}} {{graduated}} <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> was popularized by Galen Rowell. Singh-Ray sold them as [...] "The Singh-Ray set of 4 Galen Rowell Graduated Neutral-Density Filters." ...|$|R
5000|$|Instead of {{reducing}} the aperture to limit light, the photographer can add a <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> to limit light, and can then set the shutter speed according to the particular motion desired (blur of water movement, for example) and the aperture set as needed (small aperture for maximal sharpness or large aperture for narrow depth of field (subject in focus and background out of focus)). Using a digital camera, the photographer can see the image right away and choose the best <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> to use for the scene being captured by first knowing the best aperture to use for maximal sharpness desired. The shutter speed would be selected by finding the desired blur from subject movement. The camera would be set up for these in manual mode, and then the overall exposure adjusted darker by adjusting either aperture or shutter speed, noting the number of stops needed to bring the exposure to that which is desired. That offset would then be the amount of stops needed in the <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> to use for that scene.Examples of this use include: ...|$|E
50|$|For an <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> with {{optical density}} d, the {{fraction}} of the optical power transmitted through the filter can be calculated aswhere I is the intensity after the filter, and I0 is the incident intensity.|$|E
50|$|A {{graduated}} <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> is similar, {{except that}} the intensity varies {{across the surface of}} the filter. This is useful when one region of the image is bright and the rest is not, as in a picture of a sunset.|$|E
50|$|In photography, <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> are {{quantified}} {{by their}} optical density or equivalently their f-stop reduction. In microscopy, the transmittance value is sometimes used. In astronomy, the fractional transmittance is sometimes used (eclipses).|$|R
50|$|An inexpensive, {{homemade}} {{alternative to}} professional <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> {{can be made}} from a piece of welder's glass. Depending on the rating of the welder's glass, this can have the effect of a 10-stop filter.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} to this {{are that you}} get multiple <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> in one package, the disadvantage is a loss of image quality caused by both using two elements together and by combining two polarizing filters.|$|R
50|$|A {{neutral density filter}} (<b>ND</b> <b>filter)</b> is {{a filter}} of uniform density which attenuates light of all colors equally. It is used to allow a longer {{exposure}} (to create blur) or larger aperture (for selective focus) than otherwise required for correct exposure in the prevailing light conditions, without changing the tonal balance of the photograph.|$|E
50|$|When using a flash on {{a camera}} with a focal-plane shutter, {{exposure}} time {{is limited to}} the maximal speed (often 1/250th of a second, at best), at which the entire film or sensor is exposed to light at one instant. Without an <b>ND</b> <b>filter,</b> this can result in the need to use f/8 or higher.|$|E
50|$|The MiNT Lens Set {{was also}} {{released}} in the same year. It {{can be used with}} any Polaroid SX-70 camera. The set includes an <b>ND</b> <b>filter,</b> blue filter, yellow filter, close-up lens and a fisheye lens to create different effects. Since The Impossible Project film will exhibit red or yellow colour casts under bright sunlight and hot weather, using a blue filter will correct the white balance to a more natural colour. The yellow filter is used with black & white film to increase image contrast.|$|E
30|$|The third approach, {{which is}} most closely related to this work, is spatial {{multiplexing}} of the image to achieve HDR capture. Here, a single sensor image is used where the response to incident light varies over the sensor. Most previous works achieved this by placing a spatially varying array of <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> {{in front of the}} sensor [2, 24, 25, 27]. Its most familiar application is color imaging via a color filter array (e.g., the Bayer pattern [6]). By avoiding the need for more than one sensor, this design provides a cost-effective solution to achieve robust HDR capture. However, most existing methods still suffer from noise as large portions of the incident light are wasted in the <b>ND</b> <b>filters.</b> By instead focusing on spatially multiplexing the response to incident light using the gain/ISO setting, we can use the entire incident light for high-quality HDR reconstruction.|$|R
5000|$|Although its {{importance}} may have lessened {{with the advent}} of the modern digital darkroom, graduated <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> are still an important tool for professionals because a digital sensor that is clipping ("blown out" [...] or [...] "washed out") captures no usable data in the clipped area, an effect which cannot be corrected with later processing because data has been lost.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that abnormal binocular interactions {{play a key}} role in the amblyopia syndrome and represent a viable target for treatment interventions. In this context the use of partial occlusion using optical devices such as Bangerter filters as an alternative to complete occlusion is of particular interest. The aims of this study were to understand why Bangerter filters do not result in improved binocular outcomes compared to complete occlusion, and to compare the effects of Bangerter filters, optical blur and neutral density (<b>ND)</b> <b>filters</b> on normal binocular function. METHODS. The effects of four strengths of Bangerter filters (0. 8, 0. 6, 0. 4, 0. 2) on letter and vernier acuity, contrast sensitivity, stereoacuity, and interocular suppression were measured in 21 observers with normal vision. In a subset of 14 observers, the partial occlusion effects of Bangerter <b>filters,</b> <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> and plus lenses on stereopsis and interocular suppression were compared. RESULTS. Bangerter filters did not have graded effect on vision and induced significant disruption to binocular function. This disruption was greater than that of monocular defocus but weaker than that of <b>ND</b> <b>filters.</b> The effect of the Bangerter filters on stereopsis was more pronounced than their effect on monocular acuity, and the induced monocular acuity deficits did not predict the induced deficits in stereopsis. CONCLUSIONS. Bangerter filters appear to be particularly disruptive to binocular function. Other interventions, such as optical defocus and those employing computer generated dichoptic stimulus presentation, may be more appropriate than partial occlusion for targeting binocular function during amblyopia treatment.

50|$|Although {{the format}} is {{commonly}} associated with print film, Kodak also produced Kodachrome 110 slide film until 1982.In 2012 Lomography re-introduced slide film for 110 with their Peacock 200 ASA model. However, since not all 110 cameras have a settable ASA dial (low or high, depending on presence of a notch in the cassette), a <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> has to be used over the lens or the exposure compensation dial has to be used where available. Otherwise, over-exposure {{by a factor of}} x2 will result, leading to over-exposed images.|$|E
50|$|Another type of <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> {{configuration}} is the ND-filter wheel. It {{consists of}} two perforated glass disks that have progressively denser coating applied around the perforation {{on the face of}} each disk. When the two disks are counter-rotated in front of each other, they gradually and evenly go from 100% transmission to 0% transmission. These are used on catadioptric telescopes mentioned above and in any system that is required to work at 100% of its aperture (usually because the system is required to work at its maximal angular resolution).|$|E
50|$|The {{use of an}} <b>ND</b> <b>filter</b> {{allows the}} {{photographer}} to use a larger aperture that is at or below the diffraction limit, which varies {{depending on the size}} of the sensory medium (film or digital) and for many cameras is between f/8 and f/11, with smaller sensory medium sizes needing larger-sized apertures, and larger ones able to use smaller apertures. ND filters can also be used to reduce the depth of field of an image (by allowing the use of a larger aperture) where otherwise not possible due to a maximal shutter speed limit.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Strickland Falls in Tasmania, Australia, taken using {{a neutral}} density <b>filter.</b> <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> reduce light {{of all colors}} or {{wavelengths}} equally, allowing an increase in aperture and decrease in shutter speed without overexposing the image. To create the motion blur seen here, the shutter must be kept open for a relatively long time, making it necessary {{to reduce the amount}} of light coming through the lens.|$|R
50|$|<b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> find {{applications}} in several high-precision laser experiments because {{the power of}} a laser cannot be adjusted without changing other properties of the laser light (e.g. collimation of the beam). Moreover, most lasers have a minimal power setting at which they can be operated. To achieve the desired light attenuation, one or more neutral-density filters can be placed {{in the path of the}} beam.|$|R
30|$|The second {{approach}} to HDR capture {{is based on}} using beam splitters to project incident light onto multiple sensors with different exposures. The different exposures {{can be achieved by}} using varying neutral density (<b>ND)</b> <b>filters</b> in front of the sensors [1, 8, 16, 19] or by clever setups of semi-transparent beam splitter arrangements [31]. These systems offer a major advantage over exposure time fusion methods in that they robustly handle motion of the camera and objects in the scene by using the same exposure time for each sensor.|$|R
50|$|Some modern {{automatic}} point-and-shoot cameras do {{not have}} a diaphragm at all, and simulate aperture changes by using an automatic <b>ND</b> <b>filter.</b> Unlike a real diaphragm, this has no effect on depth of field. A real diaphragm when more-closed will cause the depth of field to increase (i.e., cause the background and the subject to both appear more in-focus at the same time) and if the diaphragm is opened up again the depth of field will decrease (i.e., the background and foreground will share less and less of the same focal plane).|$|E
50|$|In 2016 Canon {{announced}} the Canon PowerShot G7 X mark II which follows the original G7 X. It retains the same sensor and lens as its predecessor. The main improvement {{is the new}} DIGIC 7 Processor. In fact the G7 X mark II is the first Canon camera to use this new chip. This new chip leads to better AF performance, object tracking, reduced ISO noise and higher speed burst shooting. Some other improvements are that the screen can now flip both up and down, a new grip, tiltable flash, auto functionality for the <b>ND</b> <b>filter,</b> battery charging over USB, and a new timelapse mode.|$|E
50|$|In {{photography}} and optics, a neutral-density filter, or <b>ND</b> <b>filter,</b> is a filter that reduces or modifies {{the intensity of}} all wavelengths, or colors, of light equally, giving no changes in hue of color rendition. It can be a colorless (clear) or grey filter. The purpose of a standard photographic neutral-density filter {{is to reduce the}} amount of light entering the lens. Doing so allows the photographer to select combinations of aperture, exposure time and sensor sensitivity that would otherwise produce overexposed pictures. This is done to achieve effects such as a shallower depth of field or motion blur of a subject in a wider range of situations and atmospheric conditions.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{multifocal}} {{visual-evoked potential}} (mfVEP) {{has been widely}} {{used in the study}} of diseases of the visual system. However, the sensitivity of the mfVEP in the objective detection of relative field defects has not been determined. This study investigates variations in mfVEP responses while simulating relative field defects by using different luminous transmission masks [neutral density (ND) filters] on the stimulus pattern. Methods: Simulated relative field defects with four different luminous transmissions were obtained by using 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, and 0. 8 <b>ND</b> <b>filters,</b> 5 degrees in size, at two different retinal eccentricities (10 and 16 degrees) on a standard mfVEP dartboard stimulus. Eleven normal subjects were recruited for mfVEP measurements. The response amplitudes and latencies of the N 1 and P 1 of the mfVEP, with and without small simulated relative field defects, were compared. Results: The mfVEP amplitudes of N 1 and P 1 decreased substantially when 0. 6 and 0. 8 <b>ND</b> <b>filters</b> were introduced. The effects were similar at both the 10 - and 16 -degree eccentricities but there was no change in latency with simulated field defects at either location. Conclusions: The mfVEP can detect a simulated relative field defect 5 degrees in size starting with 0. 6 log unit reduction in luminance at both 10 -degree and 16 -degree eccentricities. This illustrates that the sensitivity of the mfVEP measurement is nearly comparable with that of the Humphrey Visual Field Analyser. School of Optometr...|$|R
