Thack urges Michael to become involved in the gay political movement, especially ACT-UP, though Michael prefers to focus on what time he has left. Thack and Brian have become close, but Thack has developed a distaste for Mary Ann, much to Michael's frustration.

His father, Milton William Halsted, worked in construction, and his mother, Lillian Halsted (née Samoyloff), was a Doukhobor and did {{agricultural}} work. Milton abandoned the family when Fred was three. His mother was remarried to John Knight, who raped Fred when he was 8, which he described as [...] "a turning point in his sexual identity." [...] He attended high school in Bakersfield, California and San Jose, California, and he {{described himself as a}} student politician, which led to his failing all his classes. Halsted studied botany at Cal State LA, and subsequently worked as a gardener and was in the <b>nursery</b> <b>plant</b> business; he owned a wholesale nursery in El Monte, California. He later said he looked back on his years as a gardener as the happiest days of his life. He never held a regular job nor had a Social Security number. His long-term lover (though with interruptions) was Joseph Yanoska, who appears in his movies under the name [...] "Joe Yale"; they were called [...] "sadomasochism's heaviest couple".

The incidences of two major problematic nematodes such as root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.) and root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) were 11 % and 3 %, respectively. Strawberry nurseries using upland soil either in fields or in plastic-houses showed were higher infection rates of Pratylenchus spp. or Meloidogyne spp. than others. On the other hand, a strawberry nursery using pots filled with bed soil in plastic-house was the lowest infection rate with 0 %. Phylogenetic relationships and distance analysis were performed for identification of Pratylenchus spp. and Meloidogyne spp. detected from strawberry nurseries. As the results, they were identified as Pratylenchus penetrans, Pratylenchus vulnus and Meloidogyne hapla. Meanwhile, when <b>nursery</b> <b>plants</b> of strawberry infested with P. vulnus transplanted to pots filled with sterilized soil, P. vulnus was detected from soil in pots as 33 % frequency. Thus, P. vulnus can be spread through <b>nursery</b> <b>plants</b> of strawberry infested with that.

40|$|Strawberry {{nursery plants}} require {{chilling}} {{and also a}} high acquisition of phosphorus nutrition for helping capture and transfer energy for its rapid top growth. Soil phosphorus availability can be reduced in presence of high soil Fe, Ca and Mg concentrations in the adsorption process, which can vary with soil water content (SWC) and pH levels. A {{study was conducted in}} two commercial <b>nursery</b> <b>plant</b> production fields in the temperate Atlantic coastal areas in 2008. The objectives were to examine soil P availability, strawberry <b>nursery</b> <b>plant</b> propagation and P acquisition in relation to different soil pH, SWC and Ca, Mg and Fe concentrations. The cultivar ‘Strawberry Festival’ was used in the study and measurements were systematically taken along transects. The strawberry <b>nursery</b> <b>plant</b> propagation and productivity expressed using runners and daughter plants were significantly related to soil P availability, soil water and pH levels (0. 50 < R 2 < 0. 61, P < 0. 05). Soil soluble P concentrations were associated with soil water, pH and Ca, Mg and Fe concentrations. Strawberry produced 25 runners and 17 daughter plants in the soil with the optimal pH (6. 5) and higher SWC and P availability, a 60 % higher nursery productivity than that in the acidic soil (pH 5. 7). Soil P concentrations were decreased while Ca, Mg and Fe cations were high in the acidic conditions. It was suggested that soil P could be fixed rapidly and thus result in low strawberry nursery productivity...|$|E

The 2 x 4 factorial scheme was used, being the factors the two inoculations: inoculated <b>nursery</b> <b>plants</b> with the fungus P. indica and without inoculation and four doses of herbicides: 0, 1. 5, 3. 0 and 6. 0 L ha- 1 for ametryn, 0, 1. 6, 3. 2, 6. 4 L ha- 1 for diuron and 0, 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 6 L ha- 1 for sulfametrazone distributed in a completely randomized design with three replications. The doses of herbicides were applied to substrate before planting.

This research was carried out with the aim to study the rooting of semihardwood cuttings, subjected to different concentrations of indolebutyric acid (IBA), collected in four seasons of the year (autumn, winter, spring and summer).

One hundred and twenty after the planting the following variables were assessed: rooting percentage, number of roots per cutting, length of roots per cutting, cutting callus percentage, cuttings with new shoots and number of cuttings that maintained the initial leaves.

Greenhouse and <b>nursery</b> <b>plant</b> production relies {{on the availability of}} quality water for irrigation and, often involves the use of supplemental lighting to enhance the quality and growth of the plants being produced. Increasing energy costs and more frequent water shortages associated with changing demographics, water use legislation, and climate factors have inspired growers to consider more sustainable approaches to utilizing resources such as water and energy. Precise, crop-specific water and light recommendations are essential to help growers make more sustainable production decisions. Two investigations were conducted to determine the water and light requirements for Heuchera americana 'Dale's Strain ' (heuchera), an herbaceous perennial prized for its variegated foliage.

During the first year in the nursery, the effect of plant density on the percentage of success and vegetative growth was evaluated. During the second year, in the open field and only for one cultivar, the vegetative and reproductive parameters were evaluated in vines with or without bunches. Results in the nursery showed that the row spacing did not affect nursery success. Only the cultivars showed significant effects. Instead, plant density influenced the stock and shoot diameters that were increased by the widest in-row spacing. Results in the field showed that bunch removal affected shoot elongation, daily shoot growth, stem diameter, pruning mass and root mass. Yield was strongly related with the nursery shoot diameter.

Inoculation of T 22 were applied on in vitro-cultured shoots of GiSeLa 6 ® (Prunus cerasus x Prunus canescens) and GF 677 (Prunus amygdalus x Prunus persica), two important varieties utilized as commercial rootstocks. The results showed that fungus inoculation (7 days after shoot transfer in the root-inducing medium), both GiSeLa 6 ® and GF 677 plants survived and showed significant increases in shoot growth and root development, particularly in root length (180 and 136 % of non-inoculated controls, respectively). The microscopical analysis allowed to observe hyphae spreading on root cortex surface of GiSeLa 6 ® (fungus colonization frequency of 20 %) but not on GF 677 roots.

I analyzed 3 ̆e 5, 700 introductions of alien {{reptiles and amphibians}} worldwide to obtain the pathway information necessary for design of informed prevention programs. Six pathways account for {{the large majority of}} introductions: accidental introductions via cargo and the <b>nursery</b> <b>plant</b> trade and intentional introductions for biocontrol, food use, the pet trade, and aesthetic purposes. Pathway importance varies taxonomically, temporally, and geographically. Unlike other taxa for which introductions have been dominated by either accidental pathways alone or intentional pathways alone, reptile and amphibian introductions involve a mix of both. Consequently, prevention programs must involve a two-pronged approach for these taxa: risk assessment of pathways for taxa introduced accidentally and risk assessment of species for taxa introduced intentionally. Because of variation in pathway importance, information on how taxonomic, temporal, and geographic variables co-vary with economic and social data may allow for predictive assessment of pathway risk for accidental introductions. In contrast, some predictive assessment of taxon risk was achieved using variables that measure climate-matching between native and introduced ranges, phylogenetic risk, and prior history of successful taxon establishment...|$|E
