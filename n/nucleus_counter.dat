The University of Minnesota CNC (UMCNC) has a sequential saturator and condenser and uses n-butyl alcohol as the working fluid.

40|$|In {{this work}} some {{results of a}} {{sampling}} campaign, aimed to understand the role and contribution of aerosol on the Venice lagoon system and to assess the possible sources (anthropogenic, crustal or marine), are presented. Aerosol samplings were carried out at Mazzorbetto, in the north Venice Lagoon, during summer 2004 (June-July), by using the following devices: the inertial spectrometer (Inspec), the light particle scattering sampler (Las-X, PMS inc.) and the diffusion battery coupled (TSI, mod. 3040) with a condensation <b>nucleus</b> <b>counter</b> (TSI, mod. 3020). The inertial spectrometer (Prodi V., 1979) allows to sample aerosol on a filter and to separate particles based on aerodynamic diameter. The aerosol was collected on polycarbonate filters and analized with SEM-EDAX device. The elemental analysis were performed in the following size intervals: < 1. 5 μm; 1. 5 - 2. 7 μm; 3. 5 - 4. 5 μm; 4. 7 - 5. 5 μm and 6. 3 - 7. 5 μm.

It appears that a nuclei mode of small, newly formed particles exists in this region. A stronger case is made for a nuclei mode in the upper few kilometers of the troposphere and in the lower few kilometers of the stratosphere.

40|$|A cloud {{condensation}} <b>nuclei</b> <b>counter</b> (CCNC) is used {{to study}} the ability of aerosol particles to serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) depending on their size, chemical composition and the ambient water super saturation. In this study, the new operation mode Scanning Flow CCN Analysis (SFCA) was evaluated for the Continuous-Flow Streamwise Thermal-Graident Cloud Condensation <b>Nuclei</b> <b>Counter</b> from Droplet Measurement Technologies (CCNC DMT- 100). By continuously changing the flow rate through the instrument, while keeping the streamwise temperature gradient and pressure constant, the SFCA enables measurements of entire super saturation spectra with high temporal resolution. The SFCA was evaluated for three magnitudes of the streamwise thermal gradient (4, 10 and 18 K) using three types of calibration particles (sodium chloride, ammonium sulfate and sucrose). By examining the flow rates at which the particles activated into cloud droplets, the critical flow rates {{could be related to}} the critical super saturations found from Köhler theory. In this way, calibrations between the flow rates and super saturations of the CCNC were obtained. Nine calibration curves were obtained in total, one for each substance and streamwise temperature gradient. To verify the validity of the curves, 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. The calibration curves were then compared with each other to evaluate the reability of the operation mode. The SFCA was found to be reliable for streamwise temperature gradients of 4 and 10 K, but somewhat less reliable for a temperature gradient of 18 K. The calibration curves were also found to be the least reliable at the ends. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of the particle size distributions by diffusion batteries requires several different batteries or stages that are normally connected to a single particle counter step by step. In {{order to determine the}} particle size distribution from this sequence of data the aerosol has to be stable within this time interval with respect to both: the concentration and the size distribution. To by-pass this drawback a DB condensation <b>nucleus</b> <b>counter</b> system with seven condensation nucleus counters (CNC) in parallel is used. By technical reasons the diffusion batteries have big differences in their residence time distributions (RTD). Broad RTD will cause smoothing of the concentration fluctuations. For that reason the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with finite time windows for the decomposition of the time convolved data is employed before size distributions are evaluated.

The ER- 2 CNC was calibrated with aerosols of known size and concentration and was found to provide an accurate measure of the number concentration of particles larger than about 0. 02 micron. Since the number distribution of stratospheric aerosols is usually dominated by particles less than a few tenths of micron in diameter, the upper cutoff of the ER- 2 CNC has not been determined experimentally. However, theory suggests that the sampling and counting efficiency should remain near one for particles as large as 1 micron in diameter.

It is shown that the vertical profile of the CN mixing ratio is closely related to that of N 2 O, and that, between the - 71 and - 53 deg latitude, the location of the minima in the CN mixing ratio profile was near the 160 ppbv N 2 O isopleth, indicating that the processes of mixing and subsidence, which determine the inclination of that isopleth, also strongly affect the spatial distribution of the sulfate aerosol. Evidence for new sulfate particle formation is presented and related to the amount of subsidence experienced by air parcels {{in the formation of the}} polar vortex.
