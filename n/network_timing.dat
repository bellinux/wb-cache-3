Our work focuses on <b>network</b> <b>timing</b> channels and provides two main contributions. The first is to quantify {{the threat posed by}} covert <b>network</b> <b>timing</b> channels. The other is to use timing channels to communicate at a low data rate without being detected. In this paper, we design and implement a covert TCP/IP timing channel. We are able to quantify the achievable data rate (or leak rate) of such a covert channel. Moreover, we show that by sacrificing data rate, the traffic patterns of the covert timing channel can be made computationally indistinguishable from that of normal traffic, which makes detecting such communication virtually impossible. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solution by showing significant performance gains in terms of both data rate and covertness over the state-of-the-art...|$|E

40|$|Covert timing {{channels}} {{have been}} considered a significant threat in multi-level systems (MLS) because of their capability in aiding information leakage across level boundaries leading to security policy violations. However, their threat in general purpose systems has not been considered in much detail. In fact, under the commonly assumed threat model, covert timing channels are only induced into a system after the host software or OS has been compromised. As a result, much of the effort is focused on protecting this subversion rather than explicitly addressing the problem of covert timing channels. ^ In this dissertation, we show that this model takes a rather conservative view of the capabilities of covert timing channels and understates the threat they pose in general purpose systems. We describe how, in addition to hiding information leakage, covert timing channels can act as mechanisms that allow sensitive information captured at one system layer to traverse across various hardware/software boundaries within a system, eventually onto the network. This property allows the covert timing channel mechanism to not {{be a part of}} the host OS or software, making their subversion unnecessary. More importantly, it is possible to induce covert <b>network</b> <b>timing</b> channels which do not require an attacker to control the host 2 ̆ 7 s network output subsystem (via software or by compromising hardware). This allows covert timing channels to leak sensitive information over a network under conditions that would usually be assumed to be hostile for this purpose. The central thesis of this work is that covert timing channels are a threat to the security of general purpose networked system. Towards that end, we focus on showing that an attacker, through creative placement of a covert channel source outside the host 2 ̆ 7 s usual trusted computing base (TCB), can create covert timing channels which can aid in the exfiltration of sensitive data over a network. Specifically, we build and analyze two covert <b>network</b> <b>timing</b> channels which can leak secrets over a network without compromising the host OS or its software. Finally, we describe techniques to hide the presence of these superimposed <b>network</b> <b>timing</b> channels from network monitors. ...|$|E

In such <b>networks,</b> <b>timing</b> and synchronization {{plays a key}} role in achieving the required jitter in terms of variance of interdeparture interval.

The jitter (or variance of packet delay) can be reduced to a tolerable level at the receiving Inter Working Function. A tradeoff between delay and jitter is required to achieve the desired jitter.

40|$|Abstract—We discuss {{malicious}} interference based {{denial of}} service (DoS) attacks in multi-band covert <b>timing</b> <b>networks</b> using an adversarial game theoretic approach. A covert <b>timing</b> <b>network</b> operating {{on a set of}} multiple spectrum bands is considered. Each band has an associated utility which represents the critical nature of the covert data transmitted in the band. A malicious attacker wishes to cause a DoS attack by sensing and creating malicious interference on {{some or all of the}} bands. The covert <b>timing</b> <b>network</b> deploys camouflaging resources to appropriately defend the spectrum bands. A two tier game theoretic approach is proposed to model this scenario. The first tier of the game is the sensing game in which, the covert <b>timing</b> <b>network</b> determines the amount of camouflaging resources to be deployed in each band and the malicious attacker determines the optimal sensing resources to be deployed in each band. In the second tier of the game, the malicious attacker determines the optimal transmit powers on each spectral band it chooses to attack. We prove the existence of Nash equilibriums for the games. We compare the performance of our proposed game theoretic mechanism with that of other well known heuristic mechanisms and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, the operating environment of {{wireless sensor networks}} is quite challenging to warrant perfect PHY timing. To account for PHY timing errors, we pursue a joint PHY/network-layer synchronization approach. At the PHY, we adopt a timing synchronization scheme that offers cost-effective wireless ad hoc access. The variance expression of this synchronizer is derived {{to shed light on}} its deviation from the ideal timestamps involved in a <b>network</b> <b>timing</b> protocol. This variance also motivates altering the random medium access control to effect a new network-level timing protocol based on Time-Stamp Broadcast Synchronization (TSBS), capable of attaining accurate clock synchronization with low energy consumption.
