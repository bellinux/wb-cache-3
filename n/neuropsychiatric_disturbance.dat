40|$|Functional {{integrity}} of prefrontal cortico-striatal circuits underlying executive functioning may be compromised by basal ganglia degeneration during Huntington's disease (HD). This study investigated challenged inhibitory attentional control with a shifting response-set (SRS) task whilst assessing neural response via functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) in 35 healthy controls, 35 matched pre-symptomatic (pre-HD) and 30 symptomatic (symp-HD) participants. A ≥ 70 % performance accuracy threshold allowed confident identification of neural activity associated with SRS performance in a sub-set of 33 healthy controls, 32 pre-HD and 20 symp-HD participants. SRS activated dorsolateral prefrontal and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices, premotor, parietal, and basal ganglia regions and deactivated subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Symp-HD participants showed greater prefrontal functional responses relative to controls and pre-HD, including larger activations and larger deactivations in response to cognitive challenge, consistent with compensatory neural recruitment. We then investigated associations between prefrontal BOLD responses, SRS performance accuracy and <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disturbance</b> in all participants, including those below SRS performance accuracy threshold. We observed that reduced prefrontal responsivity in symp-HD was associated with reduced accuracy in SRS performance, and with increased <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disturbance</b> within domains including executive dysfunction, pathological impulses, disinhibition, and depression. These findings demonstrate prefrontal response during inhibitory attentional control usefully characterises cognitive and neuropsychiatric status in symp-HD.

The aim {{of the study was}} to characterize the DMD neuropsychiatric profile fully and to explore underlying genotype/phenotype associations. Method: One hundred and thirty males with DMD (mean age 9 y 10 mo, range 5 - 17 y) in four European centres were included and completed IQ assessment and a neurodevelopmental-screening questionnaire. Of these, 87 underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessment using structured diagnostic interview and parent-reported questionnaires. Results: The overall mean score on the neurodevelopmental questionnaire was significantly abnormal compared with the general population of children (p< 0. 001). On average, intelligence was below the population mean, with intellectual disability observed in 34 males (26 %). Autistic spectrum disorder was identified in 18 (21 %), hyperactivity in 21 (24 %), and inattention in 38 (44 %). Clinical levels of internalizing and externalizing problems were observed in 21 (24 %) and 13 (15 %) respectively. Over a third of males scored more than two measures of emotional, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental problems. Males with mutations at the 3 ′ end of the DMD gene affecting all protein isoforms had higher rates of intellectual disability and clusters of symptoms. Interpretation: Males with DMD are at very high risk of <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and this risk appears to increase with mutations at the 3 ′ end of the gene.

Studying the validity and reliability of an Icelandic translation of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory with Caregiver Distress (NPI-D). NPI-D was administered to 38 primary caregivers of dementia patients. The concurrent validity was explored by statistically comparing the NPI-D to the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Regarding caregiver distress, concurrent validity was established between NPI-D, BEHAVE-AD Global Rating and two other caregiver distress scales. Significant correlation was found when total score on the BEHAVE-AD was compared with total score on the NPI-D. All NPI-D subscales achieved significant correlation with the corresponding BEHAVE-AD subscales apart from the 'depression/dysphoria subscale'. This NPI-D subscale correlated however, significantly with the GDS depression scale, a frequent and well validated measure of depressive symptoms in the elderly population. Cronbach's alpha coefficient indicated a high degree of overall internal consistency among the items of the NPI-D. Interestingly, apathy was the most frequent <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disturbance</b> and the only subscale that differed significantly between dementia severity levels.

40|$|Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) is an {{uncommon}} autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations of the VPS 13 A gene, which encodes for the membrane protein chorein. ChAc presents with progressive limb and orobuccal chorea, {{but there is}} often a marked dysexecutive syndrome. ChAc may first present with <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disturbance</b> such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suggesting a particular role for disruption to striatal structures involved in non-motor frontostriatal loops, such {{as the head of the}} caudate nucleus. Two previous studies have suggested a marked reduction in volume in the caudate nucleus and putamen, but did not examine morphometric change. We investigated morphometric change in 13 patients with genetically or biochemically confirmed ChAc and 26 age- and gender-matched controls. Subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging and manual segmentation of the caudate nucleus and putamen, and shape analysis using a non-parametric spherical harmonic technique. Both structures showed significant and marked reductions in volume compared with controls, with reduction greatest in the caudate nucleus. Both structures showed significant shape differences, particularly in the head of the caudate nucleus. No significant correlation was shown between duration of illness and striatal volume or shape, suggesting that much structural change may have already taken place at the time of symptom onset. Our results suggest that striatal neuron loss may occur early in the disease process, and follows a dorsal-ventral gradient that may correlate with early neuropsychiatric and cognitive presentations of the disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a {{profound}} <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disturbance</b> precipitated by acute illness. Although dementia is the major risk factor this has typically been considered a binary quantity (i. e., cognitively impaired versus cognitively normal) with respect to delirium risk. We used humans and mice to address {{the hypothesis that the}} severity of underlying neurodegenerative changes and/or cognitive impairment progressively alters delirium risk. METHODS: Humans in a population-based longitudinal study, Vantaa 85 +, were followed for incident delirium. Odds for reporting delirium at follow-up (outcome) were modeled using random-effects logistic regression, where prior cognitive impairment measured by Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) (exposure) was considered. To address whether underlying neurodegenerative pathology increased susceptibility to acute cognitive change, mice at three stages of neurodegenerative disease progression (ME 7 model of neurodegeneration: controls, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks) were assessed for acute cognitive dysfunction upon systemic inflammation induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 μg/kg). Synaptic and axonal correlates of susceptibility to acute dysfunction were assessed using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In the Vantaa cohort, 465 persons (88. 4 ± 2. 8 years) completed MMSE at baseline. For every MMSE point lost, risk of incident delirium increased by 5 % (p = 0. 02). LPS precipitated severe and fluctuating cognitive deficits in 16 -week ME 7 mice but lower incidence or no deficits in 12 -week ME 7 and controls, respectively. This was associated with progressive thalamic synaptic loss and axonal pathology. CONCLUSIONS: A human population-based cohort with graded severity of existing cognitive impairment and a mouse model with progressing neurodegeneration both indicate that the risk of delirium increases with greater severity of pre-existing cognitive impairment and neuropathology...|$|E

The following data is presented: Methods used {{in the identification of}} a novel, representative cohort of individuals newly diagnosed with parkinsonism in the Cambridgeshire area. Multiple sources of referral were used to maximise ascertainment over a 21 month case collection period. A crude incidence of PD of 13. 0 / 100, 000 person-years, and of all-cause parkinsonism 15. 9 / 100, 000 person-years is estimated. A comparative analysis with data from a previous incidence study in the same population is presented. An analysis of cognitive heterogeneity in this cohort using the results of a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. A classification system for defining mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI) is presented and discussed. PD-MCI is identified in 17. 4 % of participants at their baseline assessment, and shown to be associated with lower pre-morbid IQ and a greater burden of axial symptoms. A descriptive analysis of the use of two tests which have predictive utility in other neurodegenerative dementias, Paired Associates Learning (PAL) and the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination (ACE), is also presented. An exploration of the frequency and concomitants of <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disturbance</b> in this representative population, with particular emphasis upon apathy and sleep disturbance. Apathy is identified in 22. 8 % and shown to be independently associated with increased age, depression and impairment in executive function. Figures for impairment of nocturnal sleep and excessive daytime somnolence are also presented, the first such description in an unselected PD population. A data-driven analysis of the natural history of progression in PD using data from a previously established incident cohort, followed longitudinally for up to 7. 9 years. A multivariate statistical model is employed to derive a mean rate of motor progression on the commonly used UPDRS- 3 scale of 2. 24 points/year. Axial (gait and postural) PD symptoms are shown to progress most rapidly. Survival analysis methods are used for model progression to a major axial milestone (loss of postural stability) and risk factors for an adverse prognosis are evaluated.

40|$|Efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitor, {{has been an}} important component of the treatment of HIV infection for 10 years and has contributed significantly to the evolution of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The efficacy of efavirenz has been established in numerous ran-domized trials and observational studies in HAART-naive patients, including those with advanced infection. In the ACTG A 5142 study, efavirenz showed greater virological efficacy than the boosted pro-tease inhibitor (PI), lopinavir. Efavirenz is more effective as a third agent than unboosted PIs or the nucleoside analogue abacavir. Some, but not all, studies have suggested that efavirenz (added to two nucleoside {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitors) is more effective than nevirapine. Virological and immuno-logical responses achieved with efavirenz-based HAART have been maintained for 7 years. Dosing convenience predicts adherence, and studies have demonstrated that patients can be switched from PI-based therapy to simplified, once-daily efavirenz-based regimens without losing virological control. The one-pill, once-daily formulation of efavirenz plus tenofovir and emtricitabine offers a particular advantage in this regard.

Results from ordinary least squares regressions using 626 caregiver–care recipient dyads demonstrate that more severe mobility limitations (Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment), social disability (instrumental activities of daily living), <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disturbances</b> related to cognitive decline (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), and depressive symptoms in the elderly subject are positively associated with caregiver psychological distress. Perceived social stress partially accounts for these associations. We also identify certain segments of this caregiver population that are especiall...|$|R
40|$|Although {{patients}} with low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serotonin metabolite levels have been reported, inborn errors of the rate-limiting enzyme of serotonin synthesis (tryptophan hydroxylase, TPH) {{have not been}} described so far. In this study we aimed to evaluate CSF alterations of the serotonin metabolite 5 -hydroxyindolacetic acid (5 -HIAA) in {{patients with}} neurological disorders and to explore a possible TPH deficiency in some of them. A total of 606 patients (286 males, 320 females, mean age 4 years and 6 months, SD 5 years and 7 months) underwent CSF analysis of neurotransmitter metabolites by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Results were compared with values established in a control population. Patients' medical records were reviewed to determine diagnosis and clinical features. A primary defect of biogenic amines was genetically investigated in indicated patients. Low 5 -HIAA was seen in 19. 3 %. Of these, 22. 2 % showed inborn errors of metabolism (mitochondrial disorders being the most frequent at 10. 2 % of low 5 -HIAA patients) and neurogenetic conditions. Other relatively frequent conditions were pontocerebellar hypoplasia (4. 3 %), Rett syndrome (4. 3 %), and among congenital nonetiologically determined conditions, epilepsy including epileptic encephalopathies (26. 4 %), leukodystrophies (6. 8 %), and <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disturbances</b> (4. 2 %). Mutational analysis of the TPH 2 gene, performed in five candidate patients, was negative. Although frequency of secondary alteration of 5 -HIAA was relatively high in patients with neurological disorders, this finding was more frequently associated with some neurometabolic disorders, epileptic encephalopathies, and <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disturbances.</b> No inborn errors of TPH were found. Due to serotonin's neurotrophic role and to ameliorate symptoms, a supplementary treatment with 5 -hydroxytriptophan would seem advisable in these patients...|$|R
