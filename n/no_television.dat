5|$|However, Conway relaxed this stance with Anthrocon's move to Pittsburgh in 2006. While <b>no</b> <b>television,</b> {{magazine}} or tabloid representatives were present, several newspapers {{were invited to}} attend, and did, including the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Pittsburgh City Paper, which printed both a preview and an extensive review. When local television station KDKA-TV showed up, Conway gave a short television interview outside the convention hotel. In November 2006 he gave a radio interview to Dublin's 98FM. Anthrocon still retains tight control over media access, {{not only to the}} convention grounds but to the membership, and has official policy that forbids unmonitored dealings with unauthorized members of the media.|$|E
5|$|After {{not being}} able to host the Games in 1944, Cortina d'Ampezzo was {{selected}} to organise the 1956 Winter Olympics. At the opening ceremonies the final torch bearer, Guido Caroli, entered the Olympic Stadium on ice skates. As he skated around the stadium his skate caught on a cable and he fell, nearly extinguishing the flame. He was able to recover and light the cauldron. These were the first Winter Games to be televised, and the first Olympics ever broadcast to an international audience, though <b>no</b> <b>television</b> rights were sold until the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. The Cortina Games were used to test the feasibility of televising large sporting events. The Soviet Union made its Olympic debut and had an immediate impact, winning more medals than any other nation. Chiharu Igaya won the first Winter Olympics medal for Japan and the continent of Asia when he placed second in the slalom.|$|E

5|$|The 30 contestants {{were divided}} into three teams of ten named Team 1, Team 2 and Team 3, and each group met in a {{different}} London location on 10 June, {{the day of the}} programme's launch. To record what each team did, Russian hired unpaid trainee cameramen. Once the teams were assembled, they were given their challenge: in a year, they had to make £1million. Their first task was to find accommodation for themselves for free for a week. The contestants slowly realised that, despite what their contracts had claimed, they would have to find their own food and accommodation, and would essentially be making their own prize money. Some contestants demanded to meet with Russian, who eventually revealed to them that <b>no</b> <b>television</b> channel had actually commissioned his show. Teams 1 and 3 disbanded within two days.|$|E
5|$|This brought wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to {{the crease}} and exposed the hosts' lower-order. The {{last of the}} {{specialist}} batsmen, Compton nearly departed soon after when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson's off spin. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were <b>no</b> <b>television</b> replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, {{the benefit of the}} doubt was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected. Compton made use of this and attacked Toshack successfully, forcing Bradman to make a bowling change. In fading light, Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans—who attempted a wild slash—to leave England 216/7. Compton reached stumps on 64, accompanied by Alec Bedser, who was on four, as England ended the day at 231/7. Compton had been dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before being missed on 64 by the wicket-keeper from the bowling of Johnston just before stumps.|$|E
5|$|Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. England {{consolidated}} their innings after falling to 2/28. The hosts were content to score slowly and regroup, and Johnson’s first ten overs before lunch yielded only seven runs. However, when Johnson was bowling his second spell after lunch, Jack Crapp hit three driven boundaries in quick succession. Crapp {{was eager to}} use his feet {{to get to the}} pitch of Johnson’s deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. Crapp's counter-attack prompted Bradman to take the second new ball and remove Johnson with the score at 2/96. England then lost three quick wickets to the pacemen to be 5/119. Soon after, Yardley lofted Ernie Toshackwho was bowling leg theoryinto the on-side and Johnson caught him for 22 at forward square leg to leave England at 6/141. Soon after, Compton, the last of the specialist batsmen, nearly departed when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were <b>no</b> <b>television</b> replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, {{the benefit of the doubt}} was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected.|$|E

Eventually the camera was retrieved and brought back to the newsroom. Because of the magnitude of the story and the continuous flow of information coming from various sources, time was of the essence and the camera would take at least twenty minutes to become operational under normal circumstances. The decision was made to dispatch Cronkite to the CBS Radio Network booth to report the events and play the audio over the television airwaves while the crew worked on the camera {{to see if they could}} get it set up quicker.|$|E

500|$|Ten {{years after}} the premiere of Sesame Street, the CTW began experimenting with new technologies. During 1979, it began to plan the {{development}} of a theme park, Sesame Place, which opened during 1980 in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. [...] Three international parks, Parque Plaza Sesamo in Monterrey, Mexico since 1995, Universal Studios Japan, and Vila Sesamo Kids' Land in Brazil were later built. One of the park's features was a computer gallery, which was developed by a small in-house team and included 55 computer programs. The team evolved into the Children's Computer Workshop (CCW) during 1982, which was disbanded and became the Interactive Technologies division of the CTW during the late 1980s. As Sesame Street researcher Shalom M. Fisch stated, <b>no</b> <b>television</b> series could be as interactive as computer games, even [...] "participatory" [...] shows like Blue's Clues or the Sesame Street segment [...] "Elmo's World". The CTW has chosen {{to take advantage of the}} contingent feedback inherent in interactive computer games by developing and creating educational software based upon the television series' content and curriculum.|$|E
500|$|Howe {{was opposed}} in his riding by CCF {{candidate}} Doug Fisher, a {{local high school}} teacher. Fisher's campaign was well financed, with support from his party, the unions, {{and a number of}} corporate enemies Howe had made over the years. Fisher was able to buy up the key time on the local television station—Howe initially scheduled <b>no</b> <b>television</b> appearances. The voters of Port Arthur saw Fisher on television every night, explaining why the Liberals had gone wrong in his view, and what his party proposed to do to correct matters. Called back to his riding after the remainder of his disastrous Prairie tour was canceled, Howe found that Fisher's appeals had caused defections among Liberals. Howe managed to get TV time just before the election and according to Bothwell and Kilbourn [...] "treated his viewers to the sight of a tired, harsh old man, telling them that the nice young fellow that they had been seeing on television {{for the last couple of}} months was, if not a communist himself, then associated with the communists. No one believed him." [...] Fisher defeated Howe by over a thousand votes. Howe was gracious in defeat, shaking Fisher's hand at the television station, and assuring the member-elect's mother, long a Howe admirer, that there were many things for him to do. [...] Howe's defeat came as the Liberals still led narrowly in the reported returns. The Tories forged ahead, and took the greater number of seats, 112 to 105. [...] St. Laurent could have remained in office until Diefenbaker and the Tories defeated him in the House, but chose not to—a course with which Howe agreed. The Liberals left office on 21 June 1957, with Howe the only remaining minister of those sworn in with Mackenzie King in 1935.|$|E
