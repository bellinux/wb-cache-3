5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} took place in India over five months. Khan spent his first two days as director blocking the first scene to be filmed—Ishaan returning {{home from school and}} putting away his recently collected fish—and becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities. Believing that the audience should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of the camera, he chose a simple shooting style {{for the film}} that involved relatively little camera movement.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April, Babli's family filed a First Information Report (FIR) against Manoj and {{his family}} for {{kidnapping}} Babli. On 15 June, Manoj went to court with Babli, testifying that they had married in conformity with the law {{and that he did}} not kidnap Babli. The judge ordered police protection for the two. Chandrapati did not attend the trial so that Babli's family would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> that Manoj and Babli were in town.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for {{communications between}} ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E

5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E

25|$|A private message, or PM for short, is {{a message}} sent in private from a member {{to one or more}} other members. The ability to send {{so-called}} blind carbon copies is sometimes available. When sending a blind carbon copy (bcc), the users to whom the message is sent directly will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of the recipients of the blind carbon copy or even if one was sent in the first place.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of mitempfindung {{is difficult to}} determine exactly, because many individuals would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of having referred itch until the phenomenon is explained to them. Consequently, variability exists within the scientific literature as to the actual {{prevalence of}} referred itch in humans. Mittelmann (1920) has reported that 8 out of 9 people questioned experienced referred sensations. In 1973, Sterling reported that about half of 20 healthy individuals questioned had mitempfindung.|$|E
25|$|The {{only certain}} {{way to prevent}} FAS is to avoid {{drinking}} alcohol during pregnancy. In the United States, the Surgeon General recommended in 1981, and again in 2005, that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy, the latter to avoid damage even in the earliest stages (even weeks) of a pregnancy, as the woman may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> that she has conceived. In the United States, federal legislation has required that warning labels be placed on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988 under the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Henshaw remarked {{modestly}} {{that he had}} <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of it himself, and, {{taking a}} more hopeful view of the situation, whispered himself into such a state of hoarseness that another visit for refreshment became absolutely necessary.|$|R

25|$|The main {{benefits}} of the a posteriori methods are as follows. In this case, the collision detection algorithm need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of the myriad of physical variables; a simple list of physical bodies is fed to the algorithm, and the program returns a list of intersecting bodies. The collision detection algorithm doesn't need to understand friction, elastic collisions, or worse, nonelastic collisions and deformable bodies. In addition, the a posteriori algorithms are in effect one dimension simpler than the a priori algorithms. Indeed, an a priori algorithm must deal with the time variable, which is absent from the a posteriori problem.|$|E
25|$|This {{process has}} been studied {{extensively}} in social psychology as implicit associations and implicit attitudes, a component of implicit cognition. Implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience. Implicit attitudes are not consciously identified (or they are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action towards social objects. These thoughts, feelings or actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware.</b>|$|E
25|$|After his death, Trollope's Autobiography {{appeared}} {{and was a}} best-seller in London. Trollope's downfall {{in the eyes of}} the critics stemmed largely from this volume. Even during his writing career, reviewers tended increasingly to shake their heads over his prodigious output, but when Trollope revealed that he strictly adhered to a daily writing quota, he confirmed his critics' worst fears. The Muse, in their view, might prove immensely prolific, but she would never ever follow a schedule. Furthermore, Trollope admitted that he wrote for money; at the same time he called the disdain of money false and foolish. The Muse, claimed the critics, should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of money.|$|E

25|$|Weinberg and Williams {{observe that}} the {{internet}} can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey’s day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might {{have been part of}} a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile community is not known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.|$|E
25|$|According to the transtheoretical {{model of}} {{behavior}} change, {{also known as}} the stages of change model, states that there are five stages towards behavior change. The five stages, between which individuals may transition before achieving complete change, are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation for action, action, and maintenance. At the precontemplation stage, an individual may or may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior. From precontemplation to contemplation, the individual begins thinking about changing a certain behavior. During preparation, the individual begins his plans for change, and during the action stage the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently. An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months. A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it is very easy for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then fall back into earlier stages. Factors that contribute to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes, and/or personal issues a person is dealing with.|$|E

50|$|A dispute {{had been}} {{triggered}} as well by Campbell's 2002 letter {{in defense of}} Al-Arian.

25|$|It {{also sought}} to take some blame away from Tinsley, because {{he may have been}} {{suffering}} from a form of epilepsy which affected his short term memory, which they argued would have explained why he might have simply <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of the waiting local train.|$|R
60|$|Again Muriel Gascoyne {{astonished}} Austin, for {{though it}} was evident she had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>aware</b> of his presence, she showed no embarrassment, and smiled {{at him with a}} simplicity which, though he had not expected it from her, had in it the essence of all womanly dignity.|$|R
500|$|Nitrogen {{narcosis}} {{is caused}} by the pressure of dissolved gas in the body and produces [...] to the nervous system. This results in alteration to thought processes and a decrease in the diver's ability to make judgements or calculations. It can also decrease motor skills, and worsen performance in tasks requiring manual dexterity. As depth increases, so does the pressure and hence the severity of the narcosis. The effects may vary widely from individual to individual, and from day to day for the same diver. Because of the perception-altering effects of narcosis, a diver may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of the symptoms, but studies have shown that impairment occurs nevertheless. Since the choice of breathing gas also affects the depth at which narcosis occurs, the table below represents typical manifestations when breathing air.|$|E
500|$|Differences {{were made}} between the {{original}} webisodes and the first episodes of the season. One example is the introduction of Druitt. In the webisodes, Druitt murders a prostitute after arriving in Old City, but in the pilot, writer Damian Kindler included dialogue between the two characters before Druitt murders her, {{as a way of}} proving to the audience how evil he is. Another is the ending of [...] "Fata Morgana", where the Morrígan leave the Sanctuary with the Cabal mercenaries; in the webisodes, the sisters escape. Druitt directly tells Ashley in one of the first webisodes that he is her father. In the first season, the producers decided that she would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of this until midway through, and even then, they did not want Druitt to tell her directly, but rather hint it to her, so that Ashley can pick up the pieces herself.|$|E
500|$|The title {{ascribed}} to the hymn, [...] "1 Chronicles 17:16–17", refers to David's reaction to the prophet Nathan telling him that God intends to maintain his family line forever. Some Christians interpret this as a prediction that Jesus Christ, as a descendant of David, was promised by God as the salvation for all people. Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratefulness for God's guidance, that God {{is involved in the}} daily lives of Christians though they may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await. Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly, and was humbled by it. According to Newton, unconverted sinners were [...] "blinded by the god of this world" [...] until [...] "mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired... our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace." ...|$|E
