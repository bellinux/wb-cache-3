50|$|Finally, {{the last}} {{approach}} is to introduce deep level impurities (DLI) into a semiconductor bulk material. This method is similar to highly mismatched alloys, however the doping percentages are much less. The biggest issue with these devices is that the <b>non-radiative</b> <b>recombination,</b> predominantly Shockley-Read-Hall, significantly increases.Significant {{research in this field}} was aimed at achieving “lifetime recovery”, or the ability to increase carrier lifetime by introducing more DLIs. In particular, it was believed that lifetime recovery could be achieved by increasing the DLI concentrations to the insulator to metal transition. Krich, however, disproved this and in the process proposed a “figure of merit” to determine if materials would be suitable for high efficiency IB’s. The idea was that if the <b>non-radiative</b> <b>recombination</b> lifetime was significantly higher than the transit time for an electron to move from the conduction band to the IB, then the material could increase efficiency. Essentially, the electron could reach the IB before recombining, leading to a higher induced photocurrent. This figure of merit has been used to explain why no usable device has been fabricated using highly doped silicon. Chalcogen doped silicon, in particular, have low figures of merit due to their small <b>non-radiative</b> <b>recombination</b> lifetimes. To achieve IB devices, more research {{needs to be done to}} find a bulk semiconductor material that exhibits higher <b>non-radiative</b> <b>recombination</b> lifetimes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} {{radiative}} recombination is slow in indirect band gap materials also means that, under most circumstances, radiative recombinations {{will be a}} small proportion of total recombinations, with most recombinations being non-radiative, taking place at point defects or at grain boundaries. However, if the excited electrons are prevented from reaching these recombination places, they {{have no choice but to}} eventually fall back into the valence band by radiative recombination. This can be done by creating a dislocation loop in the material. At the edge of the loop, the planes above and beneath the [...] "dislocation disk" [...] are pulled apart, creating a negative pressure, which raises the energy of the conduction band substantially, with the result that the electrons cannot pass this edge. Provided that the area directly above the dislocation loop is defect-free (no <b>non-radiative</b> <b>recombination</b> possible), the electrons will fall back into the valence shell by radiative recombination, thus emitting light.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{photoluminescence}} excitation study of silicon nanocrystals in a SiO 2 matrix.

We demonstrate explicitly that saturation is achieved when every nanocrystal has absorbed at least one photon. In nanocrystals where several electron-hole pairs have been created during the excitation pulse, fast <b>non-radiative</b> <b>recombinations</b> reduce their number, leading to the situation that only a single electron-hole pair per nanocrystal can recombine radiatively, producing a photon and contributing to the photoluminescence.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} a {{comparative}} micro-photoluminescence investigation of ZnO hexagonal nanopillars (HNPs) and the seeding layer grown on the off-axis 4 H-SiC substrate. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) results establish that a thin seeding layer continuously covers the terraces of 4 H-SiC prior {{to the growth of}} ZnO HNPs. Low temperature photoluminescence (LTPL) shows that ZnO HNPs are only dominated by strong donor bound exciton emissions without any deep level emissions. Micro-LTPL mapping demonstrates that this is specific also for the seeding layer. To further understand the recombination mechanisms, time-resolved micro-PL spectra (micro-TRPL) have been collected at 5 K and identical bi-exponential decays have been found on both the HNPs and seeding layer. Temperature-dependent TRPL indicates that the decay time of donor bound exciton is mainly determined by the contributions of <b>non-radiative</b> <b>recombinations.</b> This could be explained by the TEM observation of the non-radiative defects in both the seeding layer and HNPs, like domain boundaries and dislocations, generated at the ZnO/SiC interface due to biaxial strain...|$|R

30|$|The {{presence}} of PL of Nd 3 + ions under non-resonant excitation evidenced the efficient energy transfer between Si-np and Nd 3 + ions (Figure 6). The concentration quenching of the PL of Nd 3 + ions that {{was observed in}} Figure 7 is partly explained by cross relaxation processes between Nd 3 + ions and neighboring Nd 3 + ions and/or Nd 2 O 3 nanocrystals as reported in glass matrices [4, 5]. This {{is supported by the}} existence of Nd 2 O 3 nanocrystals in the highest Nd-doped sample (see Figure 4). Besides, non-radiative channels inherent to disorder induced by the Nd incorporation (see Figure 3) can be in competition with the energy transfer mechanism between Si-np and Nd 3 + ions in such nanocomposite systems leading to the common decrease of the PL intensity of Nd 3 + and Si-np. As a consequence, the emission of Nd 3 + ions is more efficient while Si-np are formed, and while the Nd content is low (0.08 at.%). In such conditions, Nd 3 + ions benefit from the sensitizing effect of Si-np and from the weak competition of <b>non-radiative</b> <b>recombinations</b> in the host matrix. The decrease of the PL of Si-np with increasing Nd content ranging from 0.08 to 4.9 at.% (Figure 7) is explained by the raise of energy transfer between Si-np and Nd 3 + ions (which can be luminescent or not), and by the increase of <b>non-radiative</b> <b>recombinations</b> provided by the increase of disorder as shown in Figure 3. Besides, the {{presence of}} a Nd 2 O 3 phase in the host matrix at the highest Nd content significantly modifies the number of oxygen atoms available to form the silicon oxide host matrix consequently leading to the formation of larger Si-np with a higher density. Besides, the formation of Nd 2 O 3 nanocrystals results in the rise of the average interaction distance between Si-np and Nd atoms (agglomerated or not) leading to the occurrence of not-coupled Si-np, which therefore enables emission of light in the visible range. This explains the presence of the PL peak of Si-np in the highest Nd-doped sample (Figure 7) which is significantly shifted to longer wavelengths. The fact that XRD pattern of Si nanocrystals, were detected in the latter sample and not in the lowest Nd-doped sample (Figure 4) may also be attributed to the modification of the Si-np size and density.|$|R
