50|$|Local {{oxidation}} {{of silicon}} surfaces by noncontact atomic-force microscopy is an emerging and promising method for patterning surfaces at the nanometer scale {{due to its}} very precise control of the feature size. The features created with this technique {{can be used for}} the template growth and preferential deposition of different molecules like single molecule magnets, biomolecules and conjugated organic molecules.This method of <b>nanopositioning</b> is an important tool for the fabrication of new nanodevices based on the novel properties exhibited by some nanoparticles and molecules. Potential applications of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) such as Mn12 as bits for information storage or qubits for quantum computation require methods for nanoscale-controlled positioning and/or manipulation of those molecules. The patterning of the Mn12 molecules on a silicon surface is achieved by first derivatizing this surface with a self-assembled monolayer of APTES, which leaves it terminated by amino groups (-NH2). Such termination electrostatically repels the Mn12 molecules. Subsequently, a pattern of silicon dioxide is defined by LON. The SMM molecules are predominantly deposited on the oxide motives because of electrostatic attraction. The electrostatic attraction between the silicon oxide fabricated by LON and the Mn12 molecules achieves the preferential deposition of this molecules with a nanoscale accuracy.|$|E

Piezoelectric transducers, employed ubiquitously in <b>nanopositioning</b> applications are then discussed in detail including practical considerations and constraints on transducer response.

Performance issues are given importance as are problems limiting that performance such as hysteresis and noise which arise in the treatment of control and are then given chapter-length attention in their own right.

Increasing the motion range will overcome {{one of the main}} drawbacks of existing <b>nanopositioning</b> systems, thereby significantly improving the coverage area in nanometrology and nanomanufacturing applications. A single-axis <b>nanopositioning</b> system, comprising a symmetric double parallelogram flexure bearing and a traditional-architecture moving magnet actuator, is designed, fabricated, and tested. A figure of merit for the actuator is derived and shown to directly impact the system-level trade-offs in terms of range, resolution, bandwidth, and temperature rise. While linear feedback controllers provide good positioning performance for point-to-point commands, the tracking error for dynamic commands prove to be inadequate due to the nonlinearities in the actuator and its driver. To overcome this, an iterative learning controller is implemented in conjunction with linear feedback to reduce the periodic component of the tracking error by more than two orders of magnitude. Experimental results demonstrate 10 nm RMS tracking error over 8 mm motion range in response to a 2 Hz bandlimited triangular command. For the XY <b>nanopositioning</b> system, a lumped-parameter model of an existing XY flexure bearing is developed {{in order to understand the}} unexplained variation observed in the transfer function zeros over the operating range of motion.
