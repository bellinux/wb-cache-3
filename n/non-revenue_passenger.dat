2500|$|United Airlines Flight 232 (19 July 1989) – The DC-10 center engine's fan disc shattered, {{severing}} {{hydraulic lines}} and forcing the shutdown of the engine, taking out {{all three of}} the triply redundant hydraulic systems—something that was considered impossible, so there was no emergency procedure for it. As with Japan Airlines Flight 123, they had no control of the flight control surfaces, and used left and right engine throttles to control the aircraft. The misconception with this incident is that the crew handed over the controls to a [...] flight instructor who was on board the flight, but this is in fact incorrect. The original crew remained in control of the aircraft and the DC-10 flight instructor was actually a <b>non-revenue</b> <b>passenger</b> aboard the aircraft who offered his assistance to the captain. Together they managed to land at Sioux Gateway Airport. The wings dipped at the last moment leading to a crash killing 110 of its 285 passengers and one of the 11 crew members. The (somewhat new) concept of current Crew Resource Management was credited extensively by the crew and the NTSB as a leading factor in keeping a truly horrific accident from being much worse, and saving over 180 lives that would have almost surely been lost had the concept of the [...] "Infallible Captain" [...] still been in use.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of accident, the {{aircraft}} was carrying 137 passengers and one <b>non-revenue</b> <b>passenger</b> in the cockpit jumpseat, along with a crew of seven.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 43 people were officially {{reported}} killed, including the aircraft's three crew members, a <b>non-revenue</b> <b>passenger</b> in a jump seat, and 39 {{people on the}} ground. In addition to these fatalities, 11 people were seriously injured and 15 people received minor injuries. The exact number of people killed {{on the ground is}} in dispute, as the building had a high concentration of illegal immigrants.|$|E
50|$|Flight 802 was a {{contract}} cargo flight for the US Military Airlift Command from Travis AFB, California, to Clark AFB, Philippines; Cold Bay {{was the first}} planned stopover. The flight crew consisted of three members, while on board were also three <b>non-revenue</b> <b>passengers,</b> including two company employees.|$|R
50|$|On 4 October 1992, El Al Flight 1862, a Boeing 747-200F cargo jet {{en route}} to Tel Aviv, lost both right-wing engines (#3 and #4) just after taking off from Schiphol and crashed into an {{apartment}} building in the Bijlmer neighbourhood of Amsterdam while attempting {{to return to the}} airport. A total of 43 people were killed, including the plane's crew of three and a <b>non-revenue</b> <b>passenger.</b> In addition to these fatalities, 11 persons were seriously injured and 15 persons received minor injuries.|$|E
5000|$|... 43 {{people died}} in the accident: the four {{occupants}} of the aircraft (three crew and one <b>non-revenue</b> <b>passenger)</b> and 39 people on the ground. This was considerably lower than expected: the police had originally estimated a death toll of over 200, and Amsterdam Mayor Ed van Thijn had said that 240 people were missing. At the time of the crash many potential victims were not at home, possibly because of the pleasant weather on the evening of the crash. Twenty-six people sustained non-fatal injuries; 11 of these were injured seriously enough to require hospital treatment.|$|E
50|$|The term {{deadheading}} {{also applies}} {{to the practice of}} allowing employees of a common carrier to use a vehicle as a <b>non-revenue</b> <b>passenger.</b> For example, an airline might assign a pilot living in New York to a flight from Denver to Los Angeles, and the pilot would simply catch any flight going to Denver, either wearing their uniform or showing ID, in lieu of buying a ticket. Also, some transport companies will allow employees to use the service when off duty, such as a city bus line allowing an off-duty driver to commute to and from work, free.|$|E
