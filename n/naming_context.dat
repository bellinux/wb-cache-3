40|$|In many tasks {{the effects}} of {{frequency}} and age of acquisition (AoA) on reaction latencies are similar in size. However, in picture naming the AoA-effect is often significantly larger than expected {{on the basis of}} the frequency-effect. Previous explanations of this frequency-independent AoA-effect have attributed it to the organisation of the semantic system or to the way phonological word forms are stored in the mental lexicon. Using a semantic blocking paradigm, we show that semantic context effects on naming latencies are more pronounced for late-acquired than for early-acquired words. This interaction between AoA and <b>naming</b> <b>context</b> is likely to arise during lexical-semantic encoding, which we put forward as the locus for the frequency-independent AoA effect...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we {{explored}} the temporal origin of processing differences between first and second language production. Forty highly proficient bilinguals named objects {{of high and low}} lexical frequency aloud for both L 1 and L 2 separately while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The first electrophysiological differences elicited by response language occurred at the same early P 2 peak (similar to 140 - 220 ms) where we observed the onset of the lexical frequency effect, but only for those bilinguals who started naming in an L 1 context and afterwards switched to an L 2 <b>naming</b> <b>context.</b> The bilinguals who named objects in the reverse direction did not display a language effect in the ERPs. Taken together, the data show that the L 2 naming disadvantage originates during the onset of lexical access and seems to be driven by both representational strength, which is lower for L 2 words, and language control demands, which are higher for L 2 words.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that time to name single-digit Arabic numbers is about 15 ms slower when naming trials are interleaved with simple multiplication (e. g., state product of 2 x 3) than when naming digits is interleaved with magnitude comparison (e. g., state larger; 2 up arrow 3). To explain this phenomenon, J. I. D. Campbell and A. W. S. Metcalfe (2008) proposed that the comparison context enables both semantic and asemantic pathways for digit naming but that number-fact retrieval inhibits the semantic route and slows digit naming relative to the comparison context. To test this hypothesis, the authors modified the <b>naming</b> <b>context</b> paradigm by introducing a semantic priming manipulation. They replicated the digit-naming response time advantage for comparison relative to the multiplication context and observed semantic priming only in the comparison context. In comparison blocks, digit naming was 8 ms faster immediately after naming near digit primes (+/- 1) compared to far primes (>= 3), but in multiplication blocks there was no priming. The results reinforce the theory that number-fact retrieval can inhibit the semantic route for digit naming (L. Cohen & S. Dehaene, 1995) and thereby reconfigure the cognitive architecture for naming digits. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Rationale for changes: i) {{we need to}} be able {{to store}} other sorts of {{knowledge}} reference such as cross references, that were not catered for in the original draft. ii) we need to describe more fully how name resolution works, as this was not described in the original draft. iii) there seems to be little point in making the knowledge ref a labelled URI, since we don't make full use of the URI features, so a simpler format is proposed. Replication or retrieval of an attribute on its own is not very useful (it is context-less), so we usually need to know the DN of the entry from which the attribute was obtained, in order to have useful information. Therefore it is quite acceptable that a knowledge reference comprises a combination of the DN of the entry and the attribute it holdings. This allows us to simplify the syntax of the knowledge ref substantially (which cant be bad). When an entry is copied (replicated) both the DN of the entry and its attributes are replicated at the same time, so we can still replicate simplified knowledge references in this way. This is why the proposed sharedRef attribute does not need to be a URI, it can simply be a pointer to the server which holds the <b>naming</b> <b>context</b> named by the DN of the entry in which the sharedRef attribute is held.

40|$|This paper proposes the {{hierarchical}} naming scheme, {{which is a}} way of naming and addressing suitable for large-scale distributed systems. FIrst, assumptions of the systems are provided, and features required for naming in the systems are discussed. Then, the methods for giving location-independent IDs and addresses representing objects' location are proposed. Our scheme constructs global IDs and addresses from locally unique ones. They have relative representations, which are translated if they are transmitted among <b>naming</b> <b>contexts.</b> This ensures uniqueness of IDs while efficiency and availability are preserved. Next the paper introduces methods which make our scheme suitable for mobile <b>naming</b> <b>contexts</b> and dynamic reconfiguration of networks and systems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new and}} {{original}} name evaluation method of attribute names is proposed and elaborated. This method allows an attribute name to be presented in a non-hierarchy fashion and to be evaluated using a hierarchical approach. A three-level name model that supports attribute names for objects in a distributed system {{and the structure of}} <b>naming</b> <b>contexts</b> which bind attribute names onto objects are presented. The <b>naming</b> <b>contexts</b> are represented intuitively with a context-graph. To be able to meet the requirements generated form the name service semantics, a name evaluation model suitable for different name services, i. e. the conventional service, the selection service and the enquiry service is used. This model allows the name evaluation to be implemented efficiently. Moreover, to achieve the effectiveness and the efficiency in the implementation of the name evaluation, we have developed a set of algorithms, each of which is for a particular name service. * This work was partly sup [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The word class {{effect in}} the picture–word {{interference}} paradigm is a highly influential finding that has provided {{some of the most}} compelling support for word class constraints on lexical selection. However, methodological concerns called for a replication of the most convincing of those effects. Experiment 1 was a direct replication of Pechmann and Zerbst (2002; Experiment 4). Participants named pictures of objects in the context of noun and adverb distractors. Naming took place in bare noun and sentence frame contexts. A word class effect emerged in both bare noun and sentence frame naming conditions, suggesting a semantic origin of the effect. In Experiment 2, participants named objects in the context of noun and verb distractors whose word class relationship to the target and imageability were orthogonally manipulated. As before, naming took place in bare noun and sentence frame <b>naming</b> <b>contexts.</b> In both <b>naming</b> <b>contexts,</b> distractor imageability but not word class affected picture naming latencies.

Independent {{of the type of}} context awareness used a consistent approach to <b>naming</b> <b>contexts</b> is required. A novel paradigm for labeling contexts is described based on close range wireless connections between devices and a very simple, unsupervised learning algorithm.

As the learning is unsupervised no user input is required for it to work. Furthermore this approach requires no extra infrastructure or resources to manage the names assigned to the contexts. ...|$|R

Further study of this case indicated that the trouble was not concerned with the class of complex visual stimuli, was not even concerned with facial expressions or unknown faces, was not a perceptual defect, but was related mainly to the operation of individualization. The memory hypothesis was thus retained and supported.
