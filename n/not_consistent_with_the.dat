5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when {{the body of a}} pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E

25|$|Fascist states pursued {{policies}} of social indoctrination through propaganda {{in education and}} the media and regulation of the production of educational and media materials.

25|$|A {{structured}} CM program {{ensures that}} documentation (e.g., requirements, design, test, and acceptance documentation) for items is accurate {{and consistent with}} the actual physical design of the item. In many cases, without CM, the documentation exists but is <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> item itself. For this reason, engineers, contractors, and management are frequently forced to develop documentation reflecting the actual status of the item before they can proceed with a change.

These figures were <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> national trend, it being in opposition. This vote demonstrated the privileged nature of {{the inhabitants of the}} town compared to rural departments with significant pools of workers. The electorate had chosen the positive vote being due to having, according to political analysts, a more privileged population economically and a higher educational level.|$|E
25|$|Amorin et al. {{find that}} the amount of metals, {{including}} the abundance of nitrogen, are different from normal values and that GPs are <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mass-metallicity relation, as concluded by Cardamone et al. This analysis indicates that GPs can be considered as genuine metal-poor galaxies. They then argue that this oxygen under-abundance is due to a recent interaction-induced inflow of gas, possibly coupled with a selective metal-rich gas loss driven by Supernovae winds and that this can explain their findings. This further suggests that GPs are likely very short-lived as the intense star formation in them would quickly enrich the gas.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, American {{intellectual}} Noam Chomsky argued that Israeli {{claims that the}} Palestinian leadership rejected the international consensus calling for a Palestinian state, with borders along the Green Line, were <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> documented record. In 2008 Al Jazeera and Haaretz both reported that elements in the Palestinian leadership, even inside Hamas, {{have called for a}} two-state settlement based on the pre-June 1967 borders (the Green Line). Although Hamas' official policy is committed to Israel's destruction, Ismail Haniya, the prime minister of the Palestinian unity government until June 2007, suggested that a long-term truce with Israel could be achieved if Israel withdrew from territory occupied in 1967.|$|E
25|$|Paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski have {{proposed}} that an excess of extinction events occurs roughly every 26 million years (though many are relatively minor). This led physicist Richard A. Muller to suggest that these extinctions {{could be due to}} a hypothetical companion star to the Sun called Nemesis periodically disrupting the orbits of comets in the Oort cloud, leading to a large {{increase in the number of}} comets reaching the inner Solar System where they might hit Earth. Physicist Adrian Melott and paleontologist Richard Bambach have more recently verified the Raup and Sepkoski finding, but argue that it is <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> characteristics expected of a Nemesis-style periodicity.|$|E
25|$|Although the Department {{recognizes that}} amparos are an {{integral}} aspect of Mexican law designed to protect individuals’ legal rights, the USCA is concerned that amparo appeals are being used excessively in Convention return cases, and that Mexico is allowing taking parents to use the amparo process to delay cases and influence the final outcome {{in ways that are}} <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> principles of the Convention. The Department is encouraged by a recent decision by a Mexican federal judge, which overcame an amparo allowing a child to immediately return to the United States, and hopes this precedent will continue. By streamlining the amparo process in Convention cases, the Government of Mexico could better meet its treaty obligations.|$|E

25|$|The early Christians {{had no way}} to have a copy of {{the works}} that later became the canon and other church works {{accepted}} but not canonized. Much of the original church liturgical services functioned as a means of learning these works. Orthodox Church services today continue to serve this educational function. The issue of collecting the various works of the eastern churches and compiling them into a canon, each being confirmed as authentic text was a long protracted process. Much of this process was motivated by a need to address various heresies. In many instances, heretical groups had themselves begun compiling and disseminating text that they used to validate their positions, positions that were <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> text, history and traditions of the Orthodox faith.|$|E
25|$|Another {{group of}} {{hypotheses}} contended that dark skin pigmentation developed as antibacterial protection against tropical infectious diseases and parasites. Although {{it is true}} that eumelanin has antibacterial properties, its importance is secondary as a physical absorbed to protect against UVR induced damage. This hypothesis is <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> evidence that most of the hominid evolution took place in savanna environment and not in tropical rainforests. Humans living in hot and sunny environments have darker skin than humans who live in wet and cloudy environments. The antimicrobial hypothesis also does not explain why some populations (like the Inuit or Tibetans) who live far from the tropics and are exposed to high UVR have darker skin pigmentation than their surrounding populations.|$|E

Devin Brown, author of Inside Narnia: A Guide to Exploring The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, uses the timeline as a way to reconcile some of the statements concerning the timing of Aslan's appearances in Narnia with other characters' recollection of those appearances.|$|E
