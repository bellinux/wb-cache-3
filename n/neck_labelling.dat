In Trial I, 688 one-day-old male chicks of the Naked <b>Neck</b> <b>Label</b> Rouge strain were used, distributed in a randomized block design arranged according to a 2 x 2 factorial: control diet or diet supplemented with probiotics and prebiotics; and two rearing systems (confined or with access to paddocks - 3 m²/bird), using four replicates with 35 birds each. The birds were reared until 84 days of age following the recommendations of management and nutrition for free-range strains, and had access to paddocks after 35 days of age. Water and food were given inside the experimental poultry house. Birds fed probiotics and prebiotics in the diet and the confined birds showed better performance, carcass yield and meat quality compared to the birds of the other treatments. In Trial II, 128 one-day-old male chicks of the free-range Naked <b>Neck</b> <b>Label</b> Rouge strain were used. The birds were distributed into four treatments: NCC (non-challenged control), NCS (non-challenged supplemented), CC (challenged control) and CS (challenged supplemented).

40|$|Continuous {{arterial}} spin labeling MRI with {{a separate}} <b>neck</b> <b>labeling</b> coil provides a highly sensitive method to image cere-bral blood flow (CBF). In mice, however, {{this has not been}} possible because the proximity of the neck coil to the brain uses the neck coil to significantly saturate the brain signal. To overcome this limitation the cardiac spin labeling (CSL) tech-nique is introduced in which the labeling coil is placed at the heart position. To demonstrate its utility, CSL CBF was applied to image quantitative basal CBF and hypercapnia-induced CBF changes. This approach provides a practical means to image CBF with high sensitivity in small animals, compares favorably to existing mouse CBF imaging techniques, and could broaden CBF applications in mice where many brain disease and trans-genic models are widely available.

40|$|Arterial spin {{labeling}} (ASL) MRI {{provides a}} noninvasive method to image perfusion, {{and has been}} applied to map neural activation in the brain. Although pulsed labeling methods have been widely used in humans, continuous ASL with a dedicated <b>neck</b> <b>labeling</b> coil is still the preferred method in rodent brain functional MRI (fMRI) to maximize the sensitivity and allow multislice acquisition. However, the additional hardware is not readily available and hence its application is limited. In this study, flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) pulsed ASL was optimized for fMRI of rat brain. A practical challenge of FAIR is the suboptimal global inversion by the transmit coil of limited dimensions, which results in low effective labeling. By using a large volume transmit coil and proper positioning to optimize the body coverage, the perfusion signal was increased by 38. 3 % compared with positioning the brain at the isocenter. An additional 53. 3 % gain in signal was achieved using optimized repetition and inversion times compared with a long TR. Under electrical stimulation to the forepaws, a perfusion activation signal change of 63. 7 [*]±[*] 6. 3 % can be reliably detected in the primary somatosensory cortices using single slice or multislice echo planar imaging at 9. 4 [*]T. This demonstrates the potential of using pulsed ASL for multislice perfusion fMRI in functional and pharmacological applications in rat brain...|$|R
40|$|A three-coil {{continuous}} arterial-spin-labeling technique with {{a separate}} <b>neck</b> <b>labeling</b> coil was implemented on a Siemens 3 T Trio for quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CBF fMRI measurements in non-human primates (rhesus monkeys). The optimal labeling power was 2 W, labeling efficiency was 92 ± 2 %, and optimal postlabeling delay was 0. 8 s. Gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) were segmented based on T 1 maps. Quantitative CBF were obtained in 3 min with 1. 5 -mm isotropic resolution. Whole-brain average ΔS/S was 1. 0 – 1. 5 %. GM CBF was 104 ± 3 ml/ 100 g/min (n= 6, SD) and WM CBF was 45 ± 6 ml/ 100 g/min in isoflurane-anesthetized rhesus monkeys, with the CBF GM/WM ratio of 2. 3 ± 0. 2. Combined CBF and BOLD (blood-oxygenation-level-dependent) fMRI associated with hypercapnia and hyperoxia were made with 8 -s temporal resolution. CBF fMRI responses to 5 % CO 2 were 59 ± 10 % (GM) and 37 ± 4 % (WM); BOLD fMRI responses were 2. 0 ± 0. 4 % (GM) and 1. 2 ± 0. 4 % (WM). CBF fMRI responses to 100 % O 2 were − 9. 4 ± 2 % (GM) and − 3. 9 ± 2. 6 % (WM); BOLD responses were 2. 4 ± 0. 7 % (GM) and 0. 8 ± 0. 2 % (WM). The use of a separate neck coil for spin labeling significantly increased CBF signal-to-noise ratio {{and the use of}} small receive-only surface coil significantly increased signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution.

40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Continuous {{arterial}} spin labelling is {{the most}} sensitive technique for perfusion measurements. Several schemes for tag and control scans have been developped to overcome the technical and condeptual problems of this technique. Here, four different approaches for tag and control are simulated and compared experimentally. Subjects and Methods: Four sequence variants are compared that differ only {{in the way the}} tag or control pulses are applied: In CASL, separate tagging coils at the <b>neck</b> <b>label</b> the inflowing blood with one long pulse [1]. In ACASL, the tag is applied by the same coil used for imaging [2], but, due to technical constraints, this pulse has to be interrupted at regular intervals. For multi-slice acquisition (ms-ACASL) the control scan uses an oscillating pulse to avoid nonsymmetric magnetization transfer effects [3]. In PCASL [4], the tag is composed {{of a large number of}} short pulses and gradient shapes, with the control scan modifying the puls phases as to be transparent to the flowing spins. These four tagging techniques have been simulated and implemented on a Siemens Trio with an EPI-readout. The simulations were used to optimize the parameters of all sequences. Results: Two volunteers were examined with each of the four techniques, as well as with a standard FAIR sequence as representative of pulsed ASL. For all CASL measurements, the tagging duration was 2 s; with a delay of 1 s before acquiring 7 slices (ss-ACASL: 1 slice). Only the center slice was used for futher analysis. Figure 1 shows the perfusion images as generated with FSL from the same slice in one volunteer acquired with all five sequences. Voxels with a significant perfusion signal (Z = 3. 7) are red. Sensitivity differences between the sequences result in a different number of significant voxels...|$|R

O delineamento {{experimental}} foi inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 4 x 2 x 2, ou seja, quatro linhagens (Ross- 308, Pescoço Pelado Label Rouge, Caipirinha e Paraíso Pedrês), dois sistemas de criação (confinamento e semiconfinamento) e dois sexos, com duas repetições por tratamento, sendo que cada ave retirada ao acaso aos 56 dias de idade foi considerada uma unidade experimental, totalizando 64 aves. A linhagem Ross apresentou maior peso vivo e maiores pesos de carcaça, de pernas, de carne de penas e do músculo flexor longo do hálux e maiores rendimentos de carcaça e de carnes de pernas que as outras linhagens. A maior massa muscular das aves selecionadas para alta taxa de crescimento está relacionada ao aumento na área dos três tipos de fibras musculares (SO, FOG e FG). Machos apresentaram maior massa muscular e musculatura mais glicolítica que fêmeas. O sistema de semiconfinamento alterou a composição de fibras musculares esqueléticas dos machos, tornando-a mais oxidativa, porém, esse efeito não foi observado nas fêmeas. The {{effect of}} strain, breeding system and sex on body weight, carcass and leg yield, and morphologic aspects of skeletal muscle fibers of flexor hallucis longus muscle of broiler chickens was evaluated in this study.

Ross strain had the highest values of body weight, weights of legs and meat of legs and weight of flexor hallucis longus muscle and highest values of carcass yield and meat of leg yield. The higher muscle mass of birds selected for high growth is related to an increase {{in the area of the}} three types of muscle fibers evaluated (SO, FOG and FG). Males presented higher muscle mass and a musculature higher in fast-glycolityc-type fibers than females.
