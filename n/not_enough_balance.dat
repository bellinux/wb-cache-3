The paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} identifying the level of penetration and maturity of linked data technologies, as a specific facet of the W 3 C open model for the semantic Web, {{in the field of}} libraries, archives and museums. Method. The paper applies the conceptual framework of the classical theory of diffusion of innovations, along with patterns of life-cycle analysis of technologies (hype cycle) developed by Gartner Group. We compose a model for the analysis of global factors, adapted to the nature of linked data technology. Results. A framework for identifying the level of maturity of the linked data technology drivers is outlined. Our analysis indicates that, despite the intense activity detected in the libraries and archives sector, there is still <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>balance</b> between publication, consumption, regulation and technologies to state that we are entering in the phase of maturity. Conclusions. More linked data initiatives aimed at apps and consumer data are needed, besides exploiting collaborative aspects and build further networks with entities outside the field of libraries, archives and museums. We assume that leadership from the biggest institutions will continue and open innovation will be intensified...|$|E

If that does not provide an answer, then we must evaluate the search or seizure under traditional standards of reasonableness by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests. Looking to Carroll v. United States, the first automobile exception case from 1925, the Court found there that the Framers would hold that the whole car could be searched if there was probable cause to believe it contained contraband. Likewise, the Court opined in United States v. Ross that the Carroll doctrine permitted searches of all containers found in a vehicle there was probable cause to search. Going one step further, however, the Court held that even if the historical perspective was <b>not</b> <b>enough,</b> a <b>balancing</b> of the relative interests weigh decidedly in favor of allowing searches of passenger's belongings because of the reduced expectation of privacy in and the mobility of automobiles. Also, passengers in cars are more likely engaged in a common enterprise with the driver and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing. Also, their proximity enables them to hide contraband in other's belongings as readily as in other containers in the car ... perhaps even surreptitiously, without the passenger's knowledge or permission. While these factors will not always be present, the balancing of interests must be conducted with an eye to the generality of cases. Thus, specific probable cause to the container was not required.|$|R

These arrangements will replace the Cotonou scheme, which requires these countries to eliminate their tariffs on 'substantially' all their European imports. Based on a general equilibrium analysis, this study estimates the potential effects of these agreements by considering different levels of reciprocity in the commitments of the Sub-Saharan African countries. It shows that the 'standard' EU proposal, whereby Sub-Saharan African countries would cut tariffs on 80 per cent of their European imports, would <b>not</b> be <b>enough</b> to <b>balance</b> {{the outcome of the}} Economic Partnership Agreements. As a result of the asymmetries between European and African protections and supply-side capacities, African countries could experience a balance of trade deficit of USD 1. 8 billion associated with a 0. 1 per cent decrease in GDP. This proposal, which also induces an industrial restructuring to the benefit of the agro-processing industries, will create a significant fiscal burden. A lesser level of commitment could largely mitigate these unfavourable results; by reciprocating tariff eliminations on only 60 per cent of their European imports, African countries would reduce the trade imbalance and fiscal losses induced by these agreements by 21 and 51 per cent respectively.
