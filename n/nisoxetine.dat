50|$|<b>Nisoxetine</b> elicits local (cutaneous) but not {{systemic}} analgesia. Compared to lidocaine, {{a common}} anesthetic, <b>nisoxetine</b> is more potent (by four folds) and exhibits longer drug action towards producing cutaneous anesthesia.

However, it is unclear whether <b>nisoxetine</b> may cause toxicity to the neuronal or subcutaneous tissues, which still needs to be investigated in the future.|$|E
50|$|Preclinical {{studies in}} humans using <b>nisoxetine</b> were {{conducted}} in the 1970s, and side effects of the drug were examined. Doses ranging from 1 mg to 50 mg do not result in any changes in base line values in haematologic tests, routine blood chemistries, or coagulation parameters. Larger doses produce some side effects, but no electrocardiographic changes are observed in any doses. Injections with doses of tyramine in humans while receiving <b>nisoxetine</b> results in a decreased responsiveness to tyramine with increased duration of administered <b>nisoxetine.</b> Another effect of <b>nisoxetine</b> administration is that subjects require much smaller doses of norepinephrine to produce the same blood pressure responses as those who receive a placebo. In other words, subjects exhibit an increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after <b>nisoxetine</b> administration. Preclinical test conclude that the drug, in tested doses, appears to be safe for use in humans.|$|E

50|$|In {{lean and}} obese mice, {{selective}} and combined norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition reduces food intake and body weight. Yet selective reuptake inhibitors of norepinephrine and dopamine (<b>nisoxetine</b> and a substance codenamed GBR12783, respectively) independently {{have no effect}} on food intake in mice. However, when given in combination, there is profound inhibition of food intake. This demonstrates a synergistic interaction between dopamine and norepinephrine in controlling ingestive behavior, similar to the action of SNRIs. The fact that <b>nisoxetine</b> alone does not affect food intake suggests that norepinephrine alone is insufficient to affect feeding or that the blocked reuptake of norepinephrine by <b>nisoxetine</b> is acting in the wrong place. Unlike <b>nisoxetine,</b> its sulfur analog thionisoxetine reduces food consumption in rodents and is a more promising treatment for obesity and eating disorders.|$|E
50|$|Preclinical {{studies in}} humans were also {{performed}} in 1976 {{to evaluate the}} safety and possible mechanism of <b>nisoxetine.</b> At doses capable of blocking the uptake of norepinephrine and tyramine at nerve terminals, <b>nisoxetine</b> did not produce any substantial side effects.

50|$|<b>Nisoxetine,</b> {{originally}} synthesized in the Lilly research laboratories {{during the}} early 1970s, is a potent and selective inhibitor for the reuptake of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) into synapses. It currently has no clinical applications in humans, although it was originally researched as an antidepressant. <b>Nisoxetine</b> is now widely used in scientific research as a standard selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

50|$|N-Methyl-PPPA, or N-methyl-3-phenoxy-3-phenylpropan-1-amine, is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake {{inhibitor}} (SNRI) {{which was}} developed by Eli Lilly from diphenhydramine in the early 1970s while in search of new antidepressants, but was never marketed.

50|$|NET {{regulation}} {{is linked to}} altered dopamine transmission and schizophrenia-like behaviors. <b>Nisoxetine</b> is a NET inhibitor and reverses some schizophrenia-linked behavior. NET activities regulate NE as well as DA equilibrium. In addition, for normal DA clearance a functional DAT is necessary which suggests that DAT dysfunction may contribute to schizophrenia.|$|E
50|$|Later, however, {{researchers}} considered ways {{in which}} subtle chemical differences in the PPA series could selectively inhibit 5-HT uptake, which {{eventually led to the}} synthesis of nisoxetine's 4-trifluoremethyl analogue, fluoxetine. <b>Nisoxetine</b> was never marketed as a drug due to a greater interest in pursuing the development of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).|$|E
50|$|An {{essential}} {{activity of}} local anesthetics is the blockade of sodium channels. In this way, local anesthetics {{are able to}} produce infiltrative cutaneous analgesia, peripheral neural blockades, as well as spinal/epidural anesthesia. Due to nisoxetine’s sodium channel blocking effect, {{it is also possible}} that it may also have a local anesthetic effect. <b>Nisoxetine</b> is able to suppress the nicotine-evoked increase of hippocampal norepinephrine in a dose-dependent nature through effects on the functioning of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is also able to inhibit tetradotoxin-facilitated sensitive inward sodium currents in rat superior cervical ganglia.|$|E
50|$|Evidence that synephrine {{might have}} some central effects comes from the {{research}} of Song and co-workers, who studied the effects of synephrine in mouse models of anti-depressant activity. These researchers observed that oral doses of 0.3 - 10 mg/kg of racemic syephrine were effective in shortening the duration of immobility produced in the assays, but did not cause any changes in spontaneous motor activity in separate tests. This characteristic immobility could be counteracted by the pre-administration of prazosin.Subsequent experiments using the individual enanatiomers of synephrine revealed that although the d-isomer significantly reduced the duration of immobility in the tail suspension test, at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg, the l-isomer had no effect at the same dose.In mice pre-treated with reserpine, an oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg d-synephrine significantly reversed the hypothermia, while l-synephrine required a dose of 1 mg/kg to be effective.Experiments with slices of cerebral cortex taken from rat brain showed that d-synephrine inhibited the uptake of 3H-norepinephrine with an IC50 = 5.8 μM; l-synephrine was less potent (IC50 = 13.5 μM).d-Synephrine also competitively inhibited the binding of <b>nisoxetine</b> to rat brain cortical slices, with a Ki = 4.5 μM; l-synephrine was less potent (Ki = 8.2 μM).In experiments on the release of 3H-norepinephrine from rat brain cortical slices, however, the l-isomer of synephrine was a more potent enhancer of the release (EC50 = 8.2 μM) than the d-isomer (EC50 = 12.3 μM). This enhanced release by l-synephrine was blocked by <b>nisoxetine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{forebrain}} sensor of peripheral cues that relays {{information about}} the availability of energy and storage is the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH), and it contains two types of cells that have opposing effects on energy balance. These two types of cells are neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing cells, which cause hyperphagia and energy conservation, and cells that pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which are related to hypophagia and increased energy expenditure. NPY and norepinephrine are both localized in select neurons {{in the brain and}} periphery. A norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, such as <b>nisoxetine,</b> could potentially cause anorexia by decreasing activity of cells that express NPY and norepinephrine.|$|E
50|$|Clomipramine was a {{predecessor}} to {{the development}} of the more recent SSRIs. There was, in fact, a time prior to the SSRIs when selective NRIs were being considered (c.f. talopram and melitracen). In fact, it is also believed that the selective NRI <b>nisoxetine</b> was discovered prior to the invention of fluoxetine. However, the selective NRIs did not get promoted in the same way as did the SSRIs, possibly due to an increased risk of suicide. This was accounted for on the basis of the energizing effect that these agents have. Moreover, NRIs have the additional adverse safety risk of hypertension that is not seen for SSRIs. Nevertheless, NRIs have still found uses.|$|E
5000|$|... 3H-NIS binds {{with high}} {{affinity}} (Kd = 0.7 nM) and selectivity to a homogenous population of {{sites that are}} associated with norepinephrine uptake in the rat brain. Specific 3H-NIS binding increases as sodium concentration is raised, and binding of 3H-NIS is barely detectable in the absence of sodium. Binding of 3H-NIS is sodium-dependent because sodium ions are necessary for the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine. This binding is also heat-sensitive, where heating rat cerebral cortical membranes reduces the amount of specific binding. <b>Nisoxetine</b> (Ki = 0.7 + 0.02 nM), as well as other compounds that have a high affinity for norepinephrine uptake sites (DMI, MAZ, maprotiline), act as potent inhibitors of 3H-NIS binding to rat cortical membranes.|$|E
50|$|In {{treating}} depression, it was {{theorized that}} substances that could enhance norepinephrine transmission, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), could diminish {{the symptoms of}} clinical depression. The origins of <b>nisoxetine</b> can be found within the discovery of fluoxetine (Prozac, by Eli Lilly). In the 1970s, Bryan B. Molloy (a medicinal chemist) and Robert Rathbun (a pharmacologist) began a collaboration to search for potential antidepressant agents that would still retain the therapeutic activity of TCAs without undesirable cardiotoxicity and anticholingergic properties. The antihistamine drug diphenhydramine was found to inhibit monoamine uptake in addition to antagonizing histamine receptors, and this inhibition of monoamine uptake became a potential application for treating depression. As a result, Molloy, along with colleagues Schmiegal and Hauser, synthesized members of the phenoxyphenylpropylamine (PPA) group as analogues of diphenhydramine.|$|E
50|$|Several reuptake inhibitors {{contain an}} aryloxypropanamine scaffold. This {{structural}} motif has potential for high affinity binding to biogenic amine transports. Drugs containing an aryloxypropanamine scaffold have selectivity profile for norepinephrine and serotonin transporters {{that depends on}} the substitution pattern of the aryloxy ring. Selective NRIs contain a substituent in 2' position of the aryloxy ring but SSRIs contain a substituent in 4' position of the aryloxy ring. Atomoxetine, <b>nisoxetine</b> and reboxetine all have a substitution group in the 2' position and are selective NRIs while compounds that have a substitution group in the 4' position (like fluoxetine and paroxetine) are SSRIs. Duloxetine contains a phenyl group fused at the 2' and 3' positions, therefore it has dual selective norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitory effects and has similar potencies for the both transporters. The nature of the aromatic substituent also has a significant influence on the activity and selectivity of the compounds as inhibitors of the serotonin or the norepinephrine transporters.|$|E
40|$|Preclinical {{studies with}} <b>nisoxetine</b> (Compound 94939) (3 -[o-Methoxyphenoxy]-N-methyl- 3 -phenylpropylamine HCl) had shown {{it to have}} {{antidepressant}} properties and to be almost devoid of anticholinergic activity and depressant effects on cardiac conduction (in contrast to the commonly used tricyclic antidepressants from which <b>nisoxetine</b> significantly differs in structure). Placebo and <b>nisoxetine</b> (10 - 20 mg b. d. for 7 days) were administered to normal volunteers in a single-bind crossover study. Adverse side effects were minimal. There were no significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure seen when no other drugs were given. The effect of <b>nisoxetine</b> on uptake of biogenic amines was utilized to study its mechanism of action. The transient rise in blood pressure seen after an intravenous bolus of tyramine decreased by one-half to two-thirds while the rise in blood pressure upon continuous noradrenaline infusion was enhanced some two-to eight-fold. Both effects occurred after on dose and were greater with larger doses and chronic administration. In vitro, <b>nisoxetine</b> inhibits 5 -HT uptake into platelets. However, platelets harvested from subjects receiving chronic <b>nisoxetine</b> administration did accumulate 5 -HT. Plasma concentration of <b>nisoxetine</b> in these individuals was shown to be lower than that needed to block 5 -HT uptake. We concluded that <b>nisoxetine,</b> in safe doses, specifically increased the sensitivity of noradrenaline and decreased tyramine responsiveness, presumably by blocking uptake at the axonal membrane. In contrast, in these clinical doses it had virtually no effect on 5 -HT uptake into platelets...|$|E

As previously reported, continuous infusion of cocaine {{for seven days}} or GBR 12909, a selective dopamine uptake inhibitor, produced significant decreases in prodynorphin (PDYN) gene expression in the hypothalamus. Cocaine also produced {{a significant increase in}} PDYN mRNA in the caudate putamen, whereas GBR 12909 has no effect and the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine decreases PDYN mRNA in the same brain region. The effect of the selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor <b>nisoxetine</b> was examined on PDYN gene expression. <b>Nisoxetine</b> or vehicle was infused continuously for 7 days via osmotic minipump into male rats. This treatment produced significant increases in PDYN gene expression in the hypothalamus (183 % of control), nucleus accumbens (142 % of control) and hippocampus (124 % of control) and a significant decrease in the caudate putamen (69 % of control). These data suggest that <b>nisoxetine</b> affects PDYN gene expression and support a role for NE in the mechanisms underlying the effects of chronic exposure to psychoactive drugs. Moreover, <b>nisoxetine,</b> as well as fluoxetine, decreases PDYN mRNA in the caudate putamen, in contrast to the up-regulation produced by cocaine. Thus, the inhibition of NE uptake alone cannot account for the cocaine-induced increase of PDYN gene expression.
