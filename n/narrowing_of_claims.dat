The PTAB used the “broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI)” standard, which is “generally used in USPTO office actions.” Versata challenged that and argued for a <b>narrower</b> interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>claim</b> language. The court agreed with the USPTO, stating that the Federal Circuit had already decided that issue in the Cuozzo case. The court affirmed the PTAB’s claim construction.|$|R

The evidence suggests that Owen assumed the leadership of the committee briefly following the death of the original chairman in November 1912.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} empirically how the Japanese patent {{system has}} affected postwar growth in Japanese total factor productivity. The {{system has been}} criticized for several reasons, including that it encourages numerous filings <b>of</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>claims</b> that build incrementally on fundamental technologies developed by domestic and foreign inventors. Stated in different terms, the system was designed to promote technological catch-up and diffusion through incremental innovation. However, its effectiveness in achieving this purpose has not been studied systematically. We provide econometric evidence that the technology diffused through the Japanese patent system had a significant and positive impact on Japan’s technical progress...|$|R
40|$|This Essay is {{the third}} {{in a series of}} pieces {{exploring}} elements of the Court’s past and present equal protection jurisprudence. Here, we consider the concept of equality endorsed within the Fourteenth Amendment by looking to constitutional text and structure, and most importantly, the historical moment that produced the Reconstruction Amendments. We argue specifically that even though equality has previously been described as a nondescript or 2 ̆ 2 empty 2 ̆ 2 concept - capable of being interpreted as either a formalist mandate to treat all persons the same or as a means to ensure equal outcomes for certain historically disfavored groups - it should be read in light of the societal changes the Reconstruction Amendments ostensibly sought to achieve in the lives of freed slaves. We then consider what measure of equality can be ensured given the Court’s contemporary approach to adjudicating constitutional discrimination claims. We critique two of the Court’s jurisprudential innovations in the area of antidiscrimination law as particularly unhelpful: (1) reliance on a tiered-system of analysis for suspect classification claims; and (2) the requirement of the presence of purposeful governmental discrimination, rather than disparate impact, for proving constitutional discrimination claims. We argue that these approaches foreclose all but a very <b>narrow</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> and undermine the type of protection the Fourteenth Amendment could and should guarantee, especially in light of its origins...|$|R
40|$|Beyond the {{mammography}} debate: {{a moderate}} perspective C. Kaniklidis, Research Director, No Surrender Breast Cancer Foundation*a After some decades of contention, one can almost despair and conclude that (paraphrasing) “the mammography debate {{you will have}} with you always. ” Against that sentiment, in this review I argue, after reflecting {{on some of the}} major themes of this long-standing debate, that we must begin to move beyond the <b>narrow</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> and counterclaim to seek consensus on what the balance of methodologically sound and critically appraised evidence demonstrates, and also to find overlooked underlying convergences; after acknowledging the reality of some residual and non-trivial harms from mammography, to promote effective strategies for harm mitigation; and to encourage deployment of new screening modalities that will render many of the issues and concerns in the debate obsolete. To these ends, I provide a sketch of what this looking forward and beyond the current debate might look like, leveraging advantages from abbreviated breast magnetic resonance imaging technologies (such as the ultrafast and twist protocols) and from digital breast tomosynthesis—also known as three-dimensional mammography. I also locate the debate within the broader context of mammography in the real world as it plays out not for the disputants, but for the stakeholders themselves: the screening-eligible patients and the physicians in the front lines who are charged with enabling both the acts of screening and the facts of screening at their maximally objective and patient-accessible levels to facilitate informed decisions...|$|R

5000|$|In 2006 Consumer Watchdog, {{through its}} {{attorney}} the Public Patent Foundation, also challenged three patents {{held by the}} Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) that cover fundamental stem cell lines and techniques. The patent office found {{that none of the}} patents could stand as they were, but WARF <b>narrowed</b> the <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> all three patents, and the resulting claims were upheld in 2008. Consumer Watchdog was able to appeal on only one of the patents, and it did so, and in 2010 the appeals board decided that the amended <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> the patent were not patentable. [...] However, WARF was able to re-open prosecution of the case and did so, amending the claims again to make them more narrow, and in January 2013 the amended claims were allowed. [...] In July 2013, Consumer Watchdog announced that it would appeal the decision to allow the <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> the '913 patent to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), the federal appeals court that hears patent cases. [...] At a hearing in December 2013, the CAFC raised the question of whether Consumer Watchdog had legal standing to appeal; the case could not proceed until that issue was resolved.|$|R
40|$|The 2011 Supreme Court case Stern v. Marshall defined {{which claims}} {{bankruptcy}} courts {{had the authority}} to adjudicate, but it’s complicated holding left lower courts perplexed. Specifically, the Stern decision created “Stern claims”—claims that bankruptcy courts have the statutory, but not the constitutional, authority to adjudicate. Subsequent cases, such as Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison and Wellness International Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, have grappled with whether Stern claims should be treated as “core” claims, which bankruptcy courts can enter final judgments on, or “non-core” claims, which bankruptcy courts can only enter final judgments on if the litigating parties consent. The Supreme Court in Wellness held that parties could impliedly consent to Stern claim adjudication by bankruptcy courts, but the Court’s test to determine implied consent is ambiguous and has caused further disagreement among lower courts. This Note analyzes the Court’s interpretation of parties’ implied consent to bankruptcy court adjudication <b>of</b> Stern <b>claims</b> in Wellness, explains why the interpretation is too broad, and offers solutions to narrow consent in these cases. Potential solutions include: (1) creating a <b>narrower</b> definition <b>of</b> Stern <b>claims,</b> (2) extending the holding of Executive Benefits and addressing consent, (3) amending Section 157 or Federal Bankruptcy Rule 7012 (b) to include Stern claims, and (4) implementing the “balancing test” used in cases decided prior to Stern to determine whether bankruptcy courts have the authority to adjudicate certain claims...|$|R

SAB findings were studied in respect to the classification of asthma and also examined with results of pulmonary function test, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy. 1. <b>Narrowing</b> <b>of</b> the central airway was observed in almost all cases and 19 cases showed <b>narrowing</b> <b>of</b> the peripheral airways.

The mean value of V(50) /V(25) was increased and the mean value of %V(25) was decreased in patients with <b>narrowing</b> <b>of</b> the peripheral airways and also in patients with uneven appearance of the alveolar figure. 4.
