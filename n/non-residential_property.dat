25|$|Little new {{construction}} {{took place during}} the 1860s, due to the war and its aftermath. The Second Empire Olive Opera House at 63-67 Central Avenue, built around 1865, remains the district's oldest <b>non-residential</b> <b>property.</b> Croton Avenue saw some development at that time, particularly the rowhouses at 4 and the commercial building at 12. On Main Street the buildings between 157 and 161 also date to this time, but those that remain have been altered enough to no longer be contributing. The building at 121 Main Street, built around 1865, does retain enough integrity. After the war, the village built a monument to the 42 men who had been killed in action with the Union Army at South Highland and Croton.|$|E

25|$|Property tax {{is imposed}} on real {{property}} by the state, by counties, and by school districts. In general, personal-use personal property {{is not subject}} to property taxation. On the other hand, property tax is levied on most business-use personal property. The taxable value of property is 1/3 of the assessed value. A tax rate of about 30 mills is applied to the taxable value, resulting in an effective tax rate of about 1%. In the 2005 tax year the average millage was about 26.47 for residential property and 29.80 for <b>non-residential</b> <b>property.</b> Assessed values of residences cannot be increased by more than 3% per year unless the residence is remodeled or sold. Property tax deductions are available for military veterans and heads of household.|$|E

50|$|The {{creation}} of a new offence for squatting was proposed by Mike Weatherley, Member of Parliament (MP) for Hove in East Sussex, who had been campaigning against squatting since being elected to Parliament in 2010. In a consultation held in 2011, the government raised the option of criminalising squatting in commercial (<b>non-residential)</b> <b>properties.</b> Following responses to the consultation indicating a lower level of concern over such squatting, it indicated that it had no current plans to extend the definition of the offense.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{classes of}} {{property}} are completely exempt - houses temporarily unoccupied because the resident is in care, for example, or holiday homes. Properties {{in the process}} of being sold or let are likewise exempt. The tribunal is not required to grant requests which comply with the requirements, and where it does grant the request there is an appeals process for property owners. The orders cannot be granted for partly occupied buildings - so it cannot be used on an empty set of lodger's rooms within a house - or for <b>non-residential</b> <b>properties.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Tennessee Department of Health has {{recommended}} that the appropriate government bodies assure the swift cleanup of properties requiring remediation, and that all areas filled with soil from Cypress Creek should be located and tested. In addition, Velsicol is responsible for removing soil from contaminated residential properties, landscaping the property {{under the guidance of}} the property owner, and storing the contaminated soil on the Velsicol property before it can be disposed of. Once this process is complete, Velsicol must address <b>non-residential</b> <b>properties</b> adversely affected by the company’s dumping.|$|R
50|$|Compounding {{this factor}} is the {{exceptionally}} low income for most asylum seekers, arising from their inability to work legally in Australia (an issue that will be comprehensively discussed below). These low wages limit housing options for asylum seekers and leaves them susceptible to {{a higher risk of}} exploitation. Substandard housing conditions clearly follows from this difficulty. One instance in Adelaide found 20 temporary protection visa holders living in a single address, while a service provider in Sydney reported instances where people seeking asylum had been convinced by real estate agents to rent <b>non-residential</b> <b>properties</b> such as warehouses with dividers between the beds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{historic}} district is basically rectangular in shape, with {{the village of}} Namur just north of its southern boundary. To the west and north, it is bordered by Green Bay and County Road [...] "K", and to the east it is bordered by the properties on Thruway Road. Covering about 3500 acre, the district includes over 180 historically significant buildings, most of them farm-related buildings. There are 41 separate farmsteads, each averaging more than five buildings. Properties were typically developed between 1880 and 1930. <b>Non-residential</b> <b>properties</b> include the St. Mary's Catholic Church and parsonage house in Namur, and the Harold Euclide General Store, built in 1916.|$|R

50|$|H.R. 3370 {{would reduce}} federal flood {{insurance}} premium rates for some properties that are sold, were uninsured as of July 2012, or where coverage lapsed {{as a result}} of the policyholder no longer being required to maintain coverage. Excess premiums collected on these policies since the beginning of fiscal year 2014 would be refunded to the policyholder. In addition, H.R. 3370 would limit the amount that the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) could increase premium rates for individual policyholders (with some exceptions) and for all policyholders within the same risk classification. The legislation also would place an annual surcharge of $250 for all NFIP policies covering <b>non-residential</b> <b>properties</b> or non-primary residences and $25 for all other policies.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{proximity}} to transit on property values {{has become a}} key question in {{the debate on the}} relationships between public infrastructure investment and economic development. The focus has been on value captured by residential proper ties, with far fewer studies examining <b>non-residential</b> <b>properties.</b> Furthermore, few studies differentiate the effect of rail access and the effect of access to major interac tions that later become station sites, and even fewer addressed the gradient of the accessibility effect. Based on the economic theory of firm location choice, this study develops hedonic pricing models to assess the value-added of the Hiawatha LRT on commercial and industrial properties, using data on properties sold before and after its completion. The results show that the LRT has induced a significant price premium for properties nearby and that the impact extends to almost 0. 9 miles away from LRT stations...|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} is bounded {{on the north}} by Berwick Lane and Sefton Drive, where it abuts the Edgewood Historic District-Sally Greene Homestead Plats historic district, and is bounded on the south by the centerline of Chiswick Road. The house lots in the district are slightly larger than those {{of some of the}} plats to the north, ranging in size from 6,000 to 8,000 square feet. Most of the houses are between one and 2-1/2 stories in height and of wood frame construction, although there are a few houses where brick or stucco has been applied to the exterior. Setbacks from the street are typically moderate, and the lots are wide enough to include side yards and space for garages, which in some cases were added later. The only <b>non-residential</b> <b>properties</b> are a single commercial building on Broad Street, and the portions of Stillhouse Cove Park which fall within the district boundaries.|$|R
50|$|Analysis of HM Revenue and Customs {{data for}} {{property}} transaction completions in the United Kingdom between 2005 and 2013 shows that, unlike residential lending, mortgage lending for <b>non-residential</b> <b>property</b> {{was on the}} decline prior to the 2008-2009 global recession.

40|$|Published sources {{claim that}} ‘one in six’ {{properties}} are at overall flood risk in England and Wales. However, {{an attempt to}} replicate that proportion using publicly available data proved difficult, estimating one in five properties in England and one in four properties in Wales at overall flood risk, and even higher risk estimates for <b>non-residential</b> <b>properties</b> alone, especially in Wales. For comparative purposes, a primary analysis was conducted which found that the estimated fluvial and tidal flood risk for properties (residential and nonresidential) is one in twelve in England and one in nine in Wales. Discussions include {{the importance of the}} unit of analysis (people/properties) and also of property type (households/businesses). This paper reveals several discrepancies in published data and proportions at risk, and will emphasise that if ‘good evidence’ is needed to informpolicy, then we need to be very specific about what kinds of risk, and to whom, we are reporting...|$|R
40|$|With {{an annual}} loss {{averaging}} 580 M€ between 1990 and 2014, floods {{are the main}} natural catastrophe (Nat Cat) risk for the French Nat Cat compensation scheme. As part of its role in this scheme, the Caisse Centrale de Réassurance (CCR) offers state guaranteed reinsurance programs and has been modelling the risk of flooding since 2003. This model {{is based on the}} traditional valuation approach of direct tangible costs which pairs a physical model with exposure through damage curves. CCR wishes now to widen the studied damage scope to insured and noninsured economic costs and has been collaborating with the SAF research laboratory from the Institute of Financial and Insurance Sciences (ISFA) since 2014. CCR’s model has been used to estimate the insured direct damage to residential and <b>non-residential</b> <b>properties</b> and it is now being developed to include damage to vehicles, agriculture and network infrastructures. Research is also being carried out to take into account business interruptions and indirect losses using an Input-Output model.

40|$|JTLU vol 5, no 1, pp 65 - 82 (2012) This paper {{tries to}} build on {{traditional}} value capture measures, to estimate the potential {{of some of these}} mechanisms for the Lisbon subway by examining their ability to mitigate the system’s operation and development costs. The study focus is on the municipality of Lisbon where this system mainly operates. This research uses spatial hedonic pricing models of the real estate of the region, calibrated on previous stages of the study, to assess the extent to which transportation infrastructure is currently capitalized into the real estate market. The paper uses a Monte Carlo simulation procedure to estimate a synthetic population of residential and <b>non-residential</b> <b>properties</b> that matches the census blocks statistics, measuring the subway valuation for each synthetic property and aggregating the results for the whole municipality. This potential value capture estimate is then used to estimate an annual tax that could be charged under different value capture measure configurations (i. e., land value tax, special assessment). The results suggest that there is significant potential for the use of this instrument to finance the subway infrastructure...|$|R
