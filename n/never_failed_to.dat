5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999–1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and <b>never</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> live up to his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed {{with a high level of}} suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Marlins' first-round picks {{have won}} {{championship}}s with the franchise. Charles Johnson (1992) won a World Series title on the 1997 championship team and Josh Beckett (1999) won with the 2003 team. Beckett also {{went on to}} be a part of the Boston Red Sox 2007 World Series championship team. Chris Coghlan (2006) is the only first-round pick of the Marlins to win the Rookie of the Year Award, taking the honor in 2009. None of their first-round picks have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame or won the Most Valuable Player or Cy Young Award. The Marlins have made three selections in the supplemental round of the draft and have made the first overall selection once (2000). They have also had five compensatory picks since their first draft in 1992. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Marlins have <b>never</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> sign a first-round pick.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} NBA full season (1957–58), Russell {{became the first}} player in NBA history to average more than 20 rebounds per game for an entire season, a feat he {{accomplished}} 10 times in his 13 seasons. Russell's 51 rebounds in a single game is the second-highest performance ever, only trailing Chamberlain's all-time record of 55. He still holds the NBA record for rebounds in one half with 32 (vs. Philadelphia, on November 16, 1957). Career-wise in rebounds, Russell ranks second to Wilt Chamberlain in regular season total (21,620) and average per game (22.5), and he led the NBA in average rebounds per game four times. Russell is the all-time playoff leader in total (4,104) and average (24.9) rebounds per game, he grabbed 40 rebounds in three separate playoff games (twice in the NBA Finals), and he <b>never</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> average at least 20 rebounds per game in any of his 13 post-season campaigns. Russell also had seven regular season games with 40 or more rebounds, the NBA Finals record for highest rebound per game average (29.5 rpg, 1959) and by a rookie (22.9 rpg, 1957). In addition, Russell holds the NBA Finals single-game record for most rebounds (40, March 29, 1960, vs. St. Louis, and April 18, 1962, vs. Los Angeles), most rebounds in a quarter (19, April 18, 1962 vs. Los Angeles), and most consecutive games with 20 or more rebounds (15 from April 9, 1960 – April 16, 1963). He also had 51 in one game, 49 in two others, and twelve straight seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds. Russell was {{known as one of}} the most clutch players in the NBA. He played in 11 deciding games (10 times in Game 7s, once in a Game 5), and ended with a flawless 11–0 record. In these eleven games, Russell averaged 18 points and 29.45 rebounds.|$|E

During the {{colonization}} of Spain, Christianity heavily influenced the lives of Filipinos which lead to religious pieces and performances throughout the country. The most important group of plays influenced by Spain is called komedya which varies between two themes: the secular and the religious. For example, a play called Tibag which talks about the search of Elena and Constantino for the Cross of Christ is still performed in some towns. Although this religious play is still performed, the most important religious piece to this day is called the sinakulo or commonly called the passion of Christ which is usually performed during the Lenten season.|$|E

With that, he promised to the consistory, under the oath, that he <b>never</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> perform his conjugal responsibilities. His wife, however, accused him of lying and perjury, and {{in order not to}} discredit the Ministry of Finance, Kovalevsky was forced to resign as Deputy Finance Minister in 1902.
