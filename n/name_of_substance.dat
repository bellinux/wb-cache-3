6000|$|The {{next thing}} the objectors bring against the {{existence}} of spirits, is, that it is nonsense for men {{to say that there}} are such beings of which it is impossible for a man to have any notion, and they insist upon it that it is impossible for any man to form an idea of a spiritual substance. As to this part, the defendants rejoin, that they think our late most judicious Mr. Locke, in his elaborate and finished Essay on the Human Understanding, has fairly made out, that men have as clear a notion of a spiritual substance as they have of any corporeal substance, matter, or body; and that there is as much reason for admitting {{the existence of}} the one, as of the other; for that if they admit the latter, it is but humour in them to deny the former. It is in book the 2nd, chap. 29, where he reasons thus: [...] "If a man will examine himself concerning his notion of pure substance in general he will find he has no other idea of it, but only a supposition of he knows not what support of such quality which are capable of producing simple ideas in us, which qualities are commonly called accidents. Thus, if we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal substance, as horse, stone, &c., though the idea we have of either of them be but the complication or collection of those several simple ideas, or sensible qualities which we use to find united in the thing called horse, or stone; yet because we cannot conceive how they should subsist alone, not one in another, we suppose them to exist in, and be supported by some common subject; which support we denote by the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance,</b> though it be certain we have no clear or distinct idea of that thing we suppose a support. The same happens concerning the operations of our mind, viz., thinking, reasoning, and fearing, &c., which we concluding not to subsist of themselves, and not apprehending how they can belong to body, we are apt to think these the actions of some substance which we call spirit; whereby it is evident, that having no other notion of matter, but something wherein those many sensible qualities which affect our senses do subsist, by supposing a substance wherein thinking, knowing, doubting, and a power of moving, &c., do subsist, we have as clear a notion of the nature or substance of spirit, as we have of body: the one being supposed to be, without knowing what is, the substratum to those simple ideas which we have from without; and the other supposed, with a like ignorance of what it is, to be the substratum of these operations which we experiment in ourselves within. It is plain, then, that the idea of corporeal substance in matter, is as remote from our conceptions and apprehensions as that of spiritual substance, and therefore from our not having any notion of the substance of spirit, we can no more conclude its not existence, than we can for the same reason deny the existence of body; it being as rational to affirm there is no body, because we cannot know its essence, as it is called, or have the idea of the substance of matter, as to say, there is no spirit, because we know not its essence, or have no idea of a spiritual substance." [...] Mr. Locke also, comparing our idea of spirit with our idea of body, thinks there may seem rather less obscurity in the former than the latter. Our idea of body he takes to be an extended solid substance, capable of communicating motion by impulse; and our idea of soul is a substance that thinks, and has a power of exciting motion in body by will or thought. Now, some perhaps will say they comprehend a thinking thing, which perhaps is true; but, he says, if they consider it well, they can no more comprehend an extended thing; and if they say, they know not what it is thinks in them, they mean they know not what the substance is of that thinking thing; no more, says he, do they know what the substance is of that solid thing; and if they say they know how not how they think, he says, neither do they know how they are extended, how the solid parts are united, or where to make extension, &c.|$|E

It appears that the author mis-numbered the pages; no actual content is missing. The problem of this {{dissertation}} {{is that of the}} relations of change and identity with special reference to its treatment in the philosophical writings of Borden Parker Bowne. The historical backgrounds of the problem are investigated in order to shed light on Bowne's views. 	The problem of change and identity {{is one of the most}} difficult and persistent as well as one of the most ancient problems of thought. Traces of it may be found in history as far back as early Indian philosophy. The Rg Veda (about 1500 - 1000 B. C.), which is one of the most ancient monuments of civilization that we possess, develops a cosmic pantheism according to which a persistent unitary being manifests itself through the numberless forms of our changing world. In the subsequent philosophies of the Brahmanas, Upanishads, and later Hindu and Sanskrit literatures, the crudity of this primitive view is attenuated, but pantheism,continues to be the characteristic note. The concepts of Brahma and Atman, as universal and individual realities respectively, are important developments in : the evolution of the problem in the second period of Indian philosophy (1000 - 500 B. C.). In the third period, that of the Hindu and Sanskrit literatures of Vedanta, Vaiseshika, Nyaya, Sankya, Yoga, Mimansa, (from 500 B. C. on), the problem shifts from cosmology to psychology, from the objective world to the world of mind. Two concepts are specially significant during this period, namely, that of Manas Inferior, the changing mind; and that of Manas Superior, the unchanging soul. 	The problem of change and identity is also treated in the Chinese philosophy, especially in the Tao Teh King of Lao-Tze, with its theory of Reason as a metaphysical ultimate, in which "the ten thousand things" find explanation and justification. Lao-Tze also anticipates the theory of "Opposites" that is to appear later on in Greek philosophy. Not until the Greek pre-Socratics, however, do we find the problem methodically treated. We may even say that the fundamental theme of Greek Pre-Socratic Philosophy, is that of change and identity. The Milesians, the Eleatics, Empedocles, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Pythagoras all aimed at the same problem through the same question :-What is the one root and trunk of the tree whose branches constitute the many phenomena of the world? 	Socrates contributes to the clarification of the issue with his view of the logical importance of the Concept. Plato enriches thought about the problem of identity with his Ideas, and Aristotle gives it final form for the Greek period by distinguishing between logical identity, metaphysical identity, and identity as object of the intellect. 	After Aristotle, the Scholastics spoke of Substance as the only true being, the only unchanging reality. Locke and Hume referred to it as the "unknown cause" of impressions not originated in the senses. Berkeley identified it with Mind. Descartes spoke of matter as extended substance, of mind as unextended substance, and of God as the fundamental underlying substance that connects matter and mind. Spinoza identified substance with nature, and nature he called God. In him, therefore, the principle of identity is nature itself. Leibniz, however, is to be credited with a major contribution. He made reality to consist of individual monads, varying in degrees of self-consciousness, self-direction, and ability to realize themselves. Identity, therefore, he identified with Being itself, but Being he identified with activity. Kant's position with respect to the problem in question is rather problematic because of his so-called Dinge an sich and all the ambiguities of his Categories. But it can at least be said that for Kant identity is one of the functions of the mind. Mind imposes it upon its world of phenomena. Schelling does away with Kant's noumena, and speaks of the Absolute, as the organic whole, in which all theses and antitheses find ultimate explanation. Identity, for him, is a function of the Absolute. Hegel makes this Absolute an organic dialectical whole, objective cosmic spirit. Identity for Schopenhauer is of the nature of the universal will-to-be. This is the metaphysical ultimate in which he finds all continuity. 	 	Hermann Lotze (1817 - 1881) goesbeyond previous thinkersinhisanalysis of change and identity. For him, the problem finds solution only on the plane of personality. Only persons change while remaining identical. Change and identity taken abstractly are logical contradictories. In personal experience they find exemplification and explanation. 	 	Borden Parker Bowne, student of Lotze, owes much to his teacher in the position he occupies with respect to the problem of change and identity, but does not depend completely on the line of argument laid out by Lotze. Bowne (1847 - 1910) treats the problem of change and identity from the points of view of psychology, logic, epistemology, metaphysics, and religious and social thought. The main steps of his argument in psychology run as follows: The reality of the self is a primary condition of the mental life. Sensations require an organizing agent and consciousness is the agent. The essence of self is memory, and the essence of memory is recognition. Recognition is impossible if the recognizing agent is not identical with itself. In his argument from the point of view of logic, stress is laid on identity as the fundamental function of all faculties, on the unity of the mental subject, and on the necessity of this unity for all inference, memory, and knowledge. Mind is the coordinator of the one and the manifold; and the notion is its shorthand expression for the many. From the point of view of epistemology, attention is called to the mind as active and constitutive in sensation, for mind is the relational principle. Apart from this principle experience is impossible. Recurrence of experience itself is possible only to a universalizing intelligence. The problem of change and identity belongs especially in the field of metaphysics. Bowne's argument in this field begins by way of definitions and penetrating analyses of the terms of change and identity and their corresponding implications. The two terms taken abstractly contradict each other. Identity and change are concretely found only in consciousness. Hence, personality, the common ground of both, is the only solution to the problem. Unity is ultimate. "The heavens are crystallized' mathematics," and nature is a thought world. Knowledge of nature implies mind at both ends, the knower and the known. The universe is a "logical togetherness. " 	Bowne applies the metaphysics of change and identity to the daily experiences of the social process. The progressive element in society is the factor of change; the conservative, the factor of identity. Bowne's position is that of a social organism, where change is stimulated through discussion and criticism as instruments of progress, and permanence is stimulated through the spiritual growth of the church as conserver of value achieved. 	The following problems and observations are some of the results of our investigation. (1) Like Herbart, Bowne (for pedagogical reasons) starts with "concepts" already given to us in experience. He taught his students by pointing out the contradictions implied in such concepts. But it is not necessarily true that this method is the most pedagogical. 	(2) Bowne's metaphysics of change and identity has undergone numerous changes of special interest during his revisions of his works. In 1882 Bowne published his Metaphysics. In 1898 it was revised. The revised Metaphysics lays more emphasis on logic than does the original edition of 1882, and stresses more the element of identity than the element of change. The author is also more careful of the connotation of his words. A benign attitude is observed in the revised edition toward Heraclitus, as over against the unfavorable previous treatment that he received in the first edition. 	(3) Throughout the treatment of the problem of change and identity, Bowne is not consistent in naming his principle of permanence. Sometimes it is called intelligence, sometimes, soul. At times, it is given the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance.</b> At other times he calls it monad; but he also calls it ego, and self. 	(4) Up to 1897 Bowne seems to have limited the term experience to physical sensations as we may infer from his discussion of apriorism and empiricism; but afterwards, experience comes to mean for Bowne all the data of self-consciousness, as we may infer from his discussion of the Kantian categories. 	(5) Bowne is not consistent in his theory of soul; neither is he consistent in his attitude towards logic. He attacks logic as a discipline, but expects from it more than any other philosopher naturally would. In method of exposition he himself is a most rigorous logician. 	 	(6) In his social theory, there are also apparent contradictions, at least between his atomistic individualism and his organic pluralism. 	 	(7) The most important problem in the metaphysics of Bowne, however, is his metaphysics of time. For him, "God is timeless and changeless. " But in several passages, Bowne tells us that "Change is a fact in reality itself," that "the divine activity is temporal," and "Time is eternally coexistent with God. " It appears impossible to reconcile Bowne's contradictory views on time. How can thought reconcile the timelessness of God with the activity of God? If personality is the essential metaphysical ultimate, time must be metaphysically real. 	A serious problem remains unsolved in this investigation, namely, the respect in which the self in Bowne explains the problem of change and identity. Is it because the self as such is permanent and unchanging, or because it experiences both the changing and the permanent? Of course, if the latter be the case, change and identity are fundamental characteristics of the self; but in the case of Bowne, we can neither affirm the later nor the former, in view of the fact that Bowne's theories of the soul are obscure and contradictory...|$|E

But in PHILOSOPHICAL inquiries and debates, where general truths are to be established, and consequences drawn from positions laid down, there the precise signification <b>of</b> the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> will be found not only not to be well established but also very hard to be so. For example: he that shall make malleability, or a certain degree of fixedness, a part of his complex idea of gold, may make propositions concerning gold, and draw consequences from them, that will truly and clearly follow from gold, taken in such a signification: but yet such as another man can never be forced to admit, nor be convinced of their truth, who makes not malleableness, or the same degree of fixedness, part of that complex idea that the name gold, in his use of it, stands for.|$|R

60|$|Upon this ground {{it is that}} I am bold {{to think}} that {{morality}} is capable of demonstration, as well as mathematics: since the precise real essence of the things moral words stand for may be perfectly known, and so the congruity and incongruity of the things themselves be certainly discovered; in which consists perfect knowledge. Nor let any one object, that the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> are often to be made use of in morality, {{as well as those}} of modes, from which will arise obscurity. For, as to substances, when concerned in moral discourses, their divers natures are not so much inquired into as supposed: v.g. when we say that man is subject to law, we mean nothing by man but a corporeal rational creature: what the real essence or other qualities of that creature are in this case is no way considered. And, therefore, whether a child or changeling be a man, in a physical sense, may amongst the naturalists be as disputable as it will, it concerns not at all the moral man, as I may call him, which is this immovable, unchangeable idea, a corporeal rational being. For, were there a monkey, or any other creature, to be found that had the use of reason to such a degree, as to be able to understand general signs, and to deduce consequences about general ideas, he would no doubt be subject to law, and in that sense be a MAN, how much soever he differed in shape from others <b>of</b> that <b>name.</b> The <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> if they be used in them as they should, can no more disturb moral than they do mathematical discourses; where, if the mathematician speaks of a cube or globe of gold, or of any other body, he has his clear, settled idea, which varies not, though it may by mistake be applied to a particular body to which it belongs not.|$|R
60|$|This is {{a natural}} and almost {{unavoidable}} imperfection in almost all the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> in all languages whatsoever, which men will easily find when, once passing from confused or loose notions, they come to more strict and close inquiries. For then they will be convinced how doubtful and obscure those words are in their signification, which in ordinary use appeared very clear and determined. I was once in a meeting of very learned and ingenious physicians, where by chance there arose a question, whether any liquor passed through the filaments of the nerves. The debate having been managed a good while, by variety of arguments on both sides, I (who {{had been used to}} suspect, that the greatest part of disputes were more about the signification of words than a real difference in the conception of things) desired, that, before they went any further on in this dispute, they would first examine and establish amongst them, what the word LIQUOR signified. They at first were a little surprised at the proposal; and had they been persons less ingenious, they might perhaps have taken it for a very frivolous or extravagant one: since {{there was no one there}} that thought not himself to understand very perfectly what the word liquor stood for; which I think, too, none of the most perplexed <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances.</b> However, they were pleased to comply with my motion; and upon examination found that the signification of that word was not so settled or certain as they had all imagined; but that each of them made it a sign of a different complex idea. This made them perceive that the main of their dispute was about the signification of that term; and that they differed very little in their opinions concerning SOME fluid and subtle matter, passing through the conduits of the nerves; though it was not so easy to agree whether it was to be called LIQUOR or no, a thing, which, when considered, they thought it not worth the contending about.|$|R
