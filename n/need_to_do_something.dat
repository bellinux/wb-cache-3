500|$|Feeling the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different, Planché {{turned to}} a {{translation}} of the féerie folie (French: fairy tale) Riquet à la Houppe, which he had written some years earlier. The play was a success, {{and became the first}} of 23 [...] "fairy extravaganzas", most of which were based on the fairy tales of Madame d'Aulnoy. Planché's fascination with her work led the press to refer to him as Madame d'Aulnoy's [...] "preux chevalier" [...] (French: devoted knight) and similar epithets. Planché's coined the term [...] "extravaganza", defining it as [...] "the whimsical treatment of a poetical subject".|$|E
500|$|However, {{before the}} filming of the video, the band was still {{finishing}} the album and when the time to shoot the video came, Lee didn't conceive an idea about how it should look like. As she felt the song was different for the band, Lee knew that they didn't want to [...] "go the classic, sort of fantastic, epic [...]" [...] Lee asked her sister Carrie to help her around {{the concept of the}} video. Her sister said that they should film the video for the song in New York and Lee agreed with her idea, [...] "She just started saying things that were right on. She was like, 'This should be in New York. You guys <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different, this song feels different.' And she started talking about running across the Brooklyn Bridge, and it being where I live, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is great.'" [...] However, the final shot of the video filmed at Coney Island was Lee's own idea. The shot represented the band coming back in the world and [...] "heading into the unknown, coming into a new world".|$|E

500|$|In August 2008, The Straits Times {{said that}} Thumboo's [...] "most {{powerful}} legacy" [...] was [...] "spearheading {{the creation of}} a Singapore literature in English", although Thumboo himself downplayed his pioneering role by commenting: [...] "There were not that many people writing in 1965, so you had the feeling that you had to create something. But you don't stand there and say, 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> to help go about creating something, and you do it." [...] He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia, including The Flowering Tree (1970), Seven Poets (1973) and The Second Tongue (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore (1985) and The Fiction of Singapore (1990). In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003). Still Travelling, an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Wilson, Ted Danson, and Jean Smart {{completed}} the principal cast by January 2015. Wilson appeared as officer Lou Solverson, Danson as sheriff Hank Larsson, and Smart as Floyd Gerhardt, the matriarch of the Gerhardt crime family. Wilson's casting was unique {{because he was}} the only performer to portray an already established character; Keith Carradine played Lou for the show's first season, set 27 years after the events of season two. As such, Hawley did not want to take cues from Carradine because Lou was [...] "at a different point" [...] in his life, although Wilson analyzed Carradine's performance to a point. Wilson was persuaded by Fargo critical accolades and commercial success; the actor said: [...] "There have been several times that you’ve given your heart and soul to an independent film and more often than not it doesn’t match up to any commercial success or people seeing your film. So [...] were like, 'You <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that people see'." [...] Danson found learning the Minnesota accent difficult; to improve, he began practicing {{as soon as he was}} signed, often on set before filming began. Smart's role required an older look, which producers achieved by cutting and dyeing her hair, and Hawley gave the actress a book of paintings by Andrew Wyeth to explain her character.|$|E

The tour was a success, with many fans writing into SLF's message board saying how much they enjoyed it, and how fired up the band seemed to be. After much discussion regarding the status of McMordie within the band after the tour, on 21 April 2006, Burns posted on the message board [...] "For the time being Mr. McMordie is happy to continue as long as his busy schedule allows. It may be that occasionally we have to bring on a [...] "substitute", if he is up to his eyes and we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> but hopefully we can avoid that."

2500|$|Formally, {{assuming}} the axiom of choice, the cardinality {{of a set}} X is the least ordinal number α such {{that there is a}} bijection between X and α. [...] This definition is known as the von Neumann cardinal assignment. [...] If the axiom of choice is not assumed we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different. [...] The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set X (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and Principia Mathematica) is as the class [...] of all sets that are equinumerous with X. This does not work in ZFC or other related systems of axiomatic set theory because if X is non-empty, this collection is too large to be a set. In fact, for X ≠ ∅ there is an injection from the universe into [...] by mapping a set m to {m} × X and so by the axiom of limitation of size, [...] is a proper class. The definition does work however in type theory and in New Foundations and related systems. [...] However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with X that have the least rank, then it will work (this is a trick due to Dana Scott: [...] it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set).|$|E

2500|$|The {{function}} of genes {{is to provide}} the information <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> make molecules called proteins in cells. Cells are the smallest independent parts of organisms: the human body contains about 100 trillion cells, while very small organisms like bacteria are just one single cell. A cell is like a miniature and very complex factory that {{can make all the}} parts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> produce a copy of itself, which happens when cells divide. There is a simple division of labor in cells—genes give instructions and proteins carry out these instructions, tasks [...] like building a new copy of a cell, or repairing damage. Each type of protein is a specialist that only does one job, so if a cell <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> new, it must make a new protein <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this job. Similarly, if a cell <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> faster or slower than before, it makes more or less of the protein responsible. Genes tell cells what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> by telling them which proteins to make and in what amounts.|$|R

5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|R
