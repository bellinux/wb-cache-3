5|$|Boron nitride is {{insoluble}} in {{the usual}} acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and <b>nitrides,</b> such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Na2CO3, NaNO3, Li3N, Mg3N2, Sr3N2, Ba3N2 or Li3BN2, which are therefore used to etch BN.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{category}} of <b>nitrides</b> are the interstitial <b>nitrides</b> of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned {{in the gaps}} in a metallic cubic or hexagonal close-packed lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500°C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.|$|E

40|$|This paper present {{mathematical}} model which developed {{to predict the}} <b>nitrided</b> layer thickness (case depth) of gas <b>nitrided</b> and plasma <b>nitrided</b> austenitic stainless steel according to Fick’s first law for pure iron by adapting and manipulating the Hosseini’s model to fit the diffusion mechanism where <b>nitrided</b> structure formed by <b>nitrided</b> AISI 316 L austenitic stainless steel. The {{mathematical model}} later tested against various actual gas <b>nitriding</b> and plasma <b>nitriding</b> experimental results with varying <b>nitriding</b> temperature and <b>nitriding</b> duration {{to see whether the}} model managed to successfully predict the <b>nitrided</b> layer thickness. This model predicted the coexistence of ε-Fe 2 - 3 N and γ΄-Fe 4 N under the present <b>nitriding</b> process parameters. After the validation process, it is proven that the mathematical model managed to predict the <b>nitrided</b> layer growth of the gas <b>nitrided</b> and plasma <b>nitrided</b> of AISI 316 L SS up to high degree of accuracy...|$|R

5|$|Boron nitride (along with Si3N4, NbN, and BNC) is {{reported}} to show weak fibrogenic activity, and to cause pneumoconiosis when inhaled in particulate form. The maximum concentration recommended for <b>nitrides</b> of nonmetals is 10mg/m3 for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, unlike such metals as {{iron and}} nickel, does not suffer from {{hydrogen}} embrittlement. However, it does suffer from nitrogen embrittlement, reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle <b>nitrides</b> {{at the high}} temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.|$|E
5|$|Crucibles used {{to contain}} {{plutonium}} {{need to be}} able to withstand its strongly reducing properties. Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, <b>nitrides</b> and silicides can tolerate this. Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA new <b>nitriding</b> {{technology}} using active screen plasma <b>nitriding</b> (ASPN) {{was carried}} out in order to increase the <b>nitriding</b> speed of AISI 5140 steel. The fast <b>nitriding</b> process is based upon the different solubility and diffuse rate of nitrogen atoms in austenite and in ferrite of steel respectively. First, the <b>nitriding</b> samples were heated above the eutectoid temperature for a few minutes to dissolve a large amount of nitrogen and form a nitrogen-rich layer {{on the surface of the}} <b>nitrided</b> samples. Then, the <b>nitriding</b> temperature was decreased below the eutectoid temperature and kept the temperature for a long time to make the dissolved nitrogen in the nitrogen-rich layer diffuse into ferrite. The two different <b>nitriding</b> processes were carried on alternately. Experimental results indicate that the fast <b>nitriding</b> process not only enhances the <b>nitriding</b> speed remarkably, but also keeps the high hardness of the <b>nitrided</b> layer. The new fast <b>nitriding</b> technology with nitrogen-rich layer can be explained with “absorption- diffusion” model...|$|R
5000|$|Boron nanosheets (BNNS) {{defined as}} single or few layers of boron <b>nitride</b> whose aspect ratio is small. [...] However, {{there are a}} couple {{variations}} of 2D boron <b>nitride</b> structure. Boron <b>nitride</b> nanoribbons (BNNR) are boron <b>nitride</b> nanosheets with significant edge effects and have widths that are smaller than 50 nanometers. Boron <b>nitride</b> nanomeshes (BNNM) are boron <b>nitride</b> nanosheets that are placed upon specific metal substrates.|$|R
5|$|Many {{covalent}} binary <b>nitrides</b> are known. Examples include cyanogen ((CN)2), triphosphorus pentanitride (P3N5), disulfur dinitride (S2N2), and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). The essentially covalent {{silicon nitride}} (Si3N4) and germanium nitride (Ge3N4) are also known: silicon nitride in particular {{would make a}} promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the group 13 <b>nitrides,</b> most of which are promising semiconductors, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and silicon carbide and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in borazine ("inorganic benzene"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of the metals itself is difficult due to their reactivity. The formation of oxides, <b>nitrides</b> and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are reacted with coal and chlorine to form the chlorides (MCl4). The chlorides of the metals are then reacted with magnesium, yielding magnesium chloride and the metals.|$|E
5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form <b>nitrides,</b> and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.|$|E
40|$|In {{search of}} {{opto-electronic}} nano materials, we often come across Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes (GaN-NT) with excellent electrical and optical characteristics. Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes are predominantly semiconducting {{and have been}} less explored in its application as a transistor channel through Density Functional Theory (DFT). Comparing Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes with Boron <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes (BN-NT) and Carbon nanotubes (CNT), we have obtained distinguishing features of Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes. In this work, Transistor simulation with Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes has been reported with the nanotube as channel. Properties of various configurations of nanotubes are compared among Carbon, Boron <b>Nitride</b> and Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes...|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous {{graphitic carbon}} <b>nitride</b> {{was used as}} both a nanoreactor and a {{reactant}} for the synthesis of ternary metal <b>nitride</b> nanoparticles. By infiltration of a mixture of two metal precursors into mesoporous carbon <b>nitride,</b> the pores act first as a nanoconfinement, generating amorphous mixed oxide nanoparticles. During heating and decomposition, the carbon <b>nitride</b> second acts as reactant or, more precisely, as a nitrogen source, which converts the preformed mixed oxide nanoparticles into the corresponding <b>nitride</b> (reactive templating). Using this approach, ternary metal <b>nitride</b> particles with diameters smaller 10 nm composed of aluminum gallium <b>nitride</b> (Al−Ga−N) and titanium vanadium <b>nitride</b> (Ti−V−N) were synthesized. Due to the confinement effect of the carbon <b>nitride</b> matrix, {{the composition of the}} resulting metal <b>nitride</b> can be easily adjusted by changing the concentration of the preceding precursor solution. Thus, ternary metal <b>nitride</b> nanoparticles with continuously adjustable metal composition can be produced...|$|R

5|$|In {{hydrides}} and <b>nitrides,</b> protactinium {{has a low}} {{oxidation state}} of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250°C, and the nitride {{is a product of}} ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride. This bright yellow solid is stable to heating to 800°C in vacuum. Protactinium carbide PaC is formed by reduction of protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400°C. Protactinium forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH4)4. It has an unusual polymeric structure with helical chains where the protactinium atom has coordination number of 12 and is surrounded by six BH4− ions.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming <b>nitrides</b> and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Thorium borides, carbides, silicides, and <b>nitrides</b> are {{refractory}} materials, as {{are those}} of uranium and plutonium, and have thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels. All four heavier pnictogens (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides ThH2 and Th4H15, the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5–8K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. The hydrides are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Plasma <b>nitriding</b> is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} to improve the mechanical properties and tribological properties of AISI 316 L steel because it has many advantages over other surface treatment techniques. One of this advantage is plasma <b>nitriding</b> allows nitrogen diffuse into steel at low temperature (below 500 o C). In this study, <b>nitriding</b> of an AISI 316 L was performed in high density plasma <b>nitriding</b> system using 70 %N 2 : 30 %H 2 gas mixture at 400 o C and 480 o C for 2, 4, and 8 hours. Optical Emission Spectroscopy with optical probe was used for plasma diagnosis. The properties of <b>nitrided</b> specimen were investigated through micro hardness measurement.

The <b>nitriding</b> process took place in shorter time with the <b>nitriding</b> rate three {{times higher than the}} conventional DC plasma <b>nitriding</b> processes at medium temperature. <b>Nitriding</b> rate, maximum surface hardness, and <b>nitrided</b> layer thickness increase with increasing of <b>nitriding</b> temperature and <b>nitriding</b> times...|$|R

5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable <b>nitrides</b> and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the cases}} of most other {{refractory}} metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable <b>nitrides</b> and carbides. Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes. Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide-graphite composite material {{that is one of the}} hardest materials ever synthesized. Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum-tungsten-copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys. There are two tantalum aluminides, TaAl3 and Ta3Al. These are stable, refractory, and reflective, and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{like the}} Kibble balance also permit more {{flexibility}} in choosing materials with especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt10Ir could continue to be used so that the specific gravity of newly produced mass standards {{would be the same}} as existing national primary and check standards (≈21.55g/ml). This would reduce the relative uncertainty when making mass comparisons in air. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, osmium-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum's propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric mercury proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like <b>nitrides</b> could be investigated for their suitability to isolate these new alloys.|$|E
40|$|Metal oxide {{semiconductor}} capacitors with oxidized {{thick and thin}} <b>nitride</b> films of two different <b>nitride</b> thicknesses were used to study the conduction and charge-trapping behavior under positive stress bias to the upper electrode. Although the top oxide thickness {{of the two groups}} of oxidized <b>nitride</b> films is the same, the charge-trapping character-istics are different. It was found that due to the positive stress to the upper electrode of oxidized thick <b>nitride,</b> the gate voltage is shifted to the negative direction, whereas in oxidized thin <b>nitride,</b> it is shifted to the positive direction, just like the <b>nitride</b> films. It was also observed that in <b>nitride</b> films, irrespective of <b>nitride</b> thickness, due to the positive stress bias, the gate voltage is shifted to the positive direction. From the experimental results of oxidized thick and thin <b>nitride,</b> it can be inferred that in oxidized thick <b>nitride,</b> due to electron injection from the lower electrode, holes are generated in the <b>nitride</b> film and are trapped near the interface. As a result of trapped holes near the interface of the top oxide and <b>nitride,</b> as well as a shallow electron trap centered below the conduction band of the <b>nitride,</b> a large increase in current is observed in oxidized thick <b>nitride.</b> On the other hand, in oxidized thin <b>nitride</b> films for the same positive stress bias, only a few holes are generated in the <b>nitride</b> film because most of the injected electrons from the lower electrode tunnel through the <b>nitride</b> and are trapped in the top oxide. Also shallow trap centers are generated below the conduction band of the thin <b>nitride</b> films. As a result of fewer trapped holes in the interface, the increase of current in oxidized thin nitrid...|$|R

5|$|Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods {{as that of}} diamond: Cubic {{boron nitride}} is {{produced}} by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of {{a small amount of}} boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their <b>nitrides,</b> their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive shock wave. The shock wave method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The boron <b>nitrides</b> are {{notable for}} {{the variety of}} {{structures}} that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure, called cubic boron nitride (tradename Borazon), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds {{can be viewed as}} a coordinate covalent bond, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acidic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.|$|E

Alternative methods of synthesis are a high temperature reaction of lanthanide metals with ammonia or the decomposition of lanthanide amides, Ln(NH2)3. Achieving pure stoichiometric compounds, and crystals with low defect density has proved difficult. The lanthanide <b>nitrides</b> are sensitive to air and hydrolyse producing ammonia.|$|E
