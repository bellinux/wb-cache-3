This paper presents results of a survey into the attitudes and values of farmers within the designated <b>Nitrate</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Zones</b> (NVZs) in Scotland. A typology based on perceptions towards water quality management was developed using factor and cluster analysis techniques. Three types were identified as 'resistors', 'apathists' and 'multifunctionalists'. The 'resistors' and the 'multifunctionalists' had similar approaches to land use management, but then diverged {{in terms of their}} perceptions towards the environment, water management and the NVZ regulations in particular. The apathists were indifferent towards the aims of the regulation and to water quality management in general. This was also evidenced by their lack of uptake of voluntary measures for improving water quality. The lack of engagement from the 'apathists', which represent around a third of the responses to the survey, is particularly problematic for policy makers.

We compare the voluntary adoption of water quality management techniques between farmers within a designated <b>Nitrate</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Zone</b> (NVZ) with those outside the zone across Scotland. Divergent groups emerge towards the purpose of the regulation, responsibility towards water pollution issues and compliance towards the regulation. There were significantly higher levels of adoption of some voluntary water quality measures by members of the non-designated group. We argue that engagement with these farmers should not focus purely on the biophysical division under which they are designated but should include the range of attitudinal alignments should include across designations in order to change social norms.

40|$|Nitrate {{derived from}} {{agricultural}} activity {{is a threat}} to Scotland's surface water and groundwater environment. The pollution of groundwater by nitrate can impact drinking water in aquifers in addition to the quality of base-flow to many streams and rivers. European legislation (in the form of the Nitrates Directive) requires that waters with a nitrate concentration of greater than 50 mg-NO 3 l- 1 (and those at risk of exceeding this concentration) should be identified and the catchment areas designated as <b>Nitrate</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Zones</b> (NVZs). Groundwater NVZs for Scotland were developed using a risk-based methodology which combined several Scottish national scale datasets in a GIS. The risk of nitrate leaching was determined from soil, climate and land use data. Digital solid and superficial geology data (at 1 : 50 000 scale) were interpreted to give an indication of aquifer vulnerability. The final zones were then determined by identifying local surface water catchments associated with areas of greatest nitrate leaching and aquifer vulnerability. The results of the vulnerability/risk analysis were broadly consistent with the available nitrate data for much of Scotland. Groundwater nitrate data were collated from the monitoring network of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), water authority boreholes and private water supplies, with additional new data collected from targeted sites. Within the NVZs, 25 % of approximately 1700 samples exceeded 50 mg-NO 3 l- 1 compared to the rest of Scotland, where less than 5 % of approximately 700 samples exceeded this concentration.

This study involved 43 monitoring sites and 32 rivers in Estonia. The temporal trends were assessed using the partial Mann-Kendall (PMK) test, which was adapted to account for the influence of water discharge.

High spatial variability in the groundwater dating made it difficult to estimate catchment means, but the range was estimated to lie between 15 and 60 years. A catchment hydrology and nitrate model was used to explore the effect of simple changes in land management on reducing nitrate concentrations, as well as associated time scales of recovery.

40|$|The 1991 EU Nitrate Directive was {{designed}} to reduce water pollution from agriculturally derived nitrates. England and Wales implemented this Directive by controlling agricultural activities within their most <b>vulnerable</b> areas termed <b>Nitrate</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Zones.</b> These were designated by identifying drinking water catchments (surface and groundwater), at risk from nitrate pollution. However, this method contravened the Nitrate Directive because it only protected drinking water and not all waters. In this paper, a GIS was used to identify all areas of groundwater <b>vulnerable</b> to <b>nitrate</b> pollution. This was achieved by constructing a model containing data on four characteristics: {{the quality of the}} water leaving the root zone of a piece of land; soil information; presence of low permeability superficial (drift) material; and aquifer properties. These were combined in a GIS and the various combinations converted into a measure of vulnerability using expert knowledge. Several model variants were produced using different estimates {{of the quality of the}} water leaving the root zone and contrasting methods of weighting the input data. When the final models were assessed all produced similar spatial patterns and, when verified by comparison with trend data derived from monitored nitrate concentrations, all the models were statistically significant predictors of groundwater nitrate concentrations. The best predictive model contained a model of nitrate leaching but no land use information, implying that changes in land use will not affect designations based upon this model. The relationship between nitrate levels and borehole intake depths was investigated since there was concern that the observed contrasts in nitrate levels between vulnerability categories might be reflecting differences in borehole intake depths and not actual vulnerability. However, this was not found to be statistically important.

Four fertilization systems were compared at field scale: slurry+mineral, slurry, farmyard manure and mineral at a target rate of 315 + 130 kg ha- 1 N for maize and ryegrass respectively. Fertilization rates of organic fertilizers varied according to their variable N content. NUE of organic fertilizers was not significantly different from that of mineral for maize if N rates were near to target. Organic fertilizers had very low NUE for the ryegrass. The soil water nitrate concentration was very variable in time with minimum in spring and maximum in autumn-winter. At district area, the average N surplus was closely correlated with the N input. The study provided sufficient evidence that N pollution of groundwater occurs in autumn-winter and that there are margins to increase the crop N use efficiency by reducing the actual N inputs without significant reduction of crop yield, but with increased costs for the disposal of effluents outside the NVZ. </br...|$|E

The model has been calibrated and validated against Environment Agency discharge and solute chemistry data, as well as a data set collected from a river site immediately upstream of the estuary tidal limit. Upstream measurements of denitrification at six sites have been used to evaluate nitrate removal rates in vegetated and non-vegetated conditions. Results show that sediments underlying vegetation were associated with significantly higher rates of nitrate removal than un-vegetated sediments (with an average increase of 245 %). These data have been used to scale up rates of nitrate loss to the whole catchment scale and have been implemented via the model.

The EU's Nitrates Directive (91 / 676 EC) and its associated <b>Nitrate</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Zone</b> (NVZ) legislation were extended in Scotland in 2003, requiring more farmers to adopt more sustainable land management practices. This paper presents results from a qualitative socio-economic study of the motivations and management practices of 30 farmers located within the Strathmore and Fife NVZ. It was found that these farmers rarely consider environmental issues beyond the boundaries of their farms unless the productive capacity and economic viability of their farms are affected. Despite contrary evidence, the farmers did not believe that they were responsible for any water quality problems, nor is the intrinsic linkage between catchment and coastal zone management established in their minds. They were suspicious of agri-environmental funding opportunities, and tend to regard the bureaucracy involved in applying for funding as more of a problem than it is worth. Experience of environmental regulations has left many with concerns about rules changing in unfavourable ways. Many of the farmers are dependent on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidy support, and the proposed de-coupling of direct payments from production is regarded with suspicion.

Monitoring the results and total pollution load of effluent discharged to the receiving water body from 2007 to 2008 are used to assess the treatment level of WWTPs and the need to establish higher treatment requirements. Estonian national standards, due to the fact that Estonian water bodies are small and vulnerable to pollution, are stricter than the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) requirements. If the requirements given in UWWTD are not sufficient to achieve a good status for water bodies, it is proven that wastewater discharge adversely affects the receiving water body and this discharge is one of the important point-pollution sources for water bodies, additional stricter wastewater treatment requirements are needed. WWTPs with a more than a 2, 000 population equivalent (p. e.) should be regulated vigorously to guarantee their compliance with the requirements, because WWTPs with more than 2, 000 p. e. count for 80 % of the total pollution load. A pollution load from WWTPs of less than 2, 000 p. e. on the receiving water bodies is marginal; however, the extent of the impact of each individual WWTP depends on, among other things, the characteristics of the wastewater, the turbulence of the receiving water body and the area’s sensitivity as well as other pressure sources...|$|E

Model performance was examined by comparing the simulations and measurements of irrigated grapevine crops (variety Tempranillo) over various soil types.

40|$|In {{the northwestern}} part of Europe, many surface waters suffer from {{eutrophication}} through diffuse losses of nutrients from agriculture to surface water and relatively high nitrate concentrations in groundwater in <b>nitrate</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones.</b> A {{lot of research}} and policy has been devised to decrease these losses. The northwestern European countries (Denmark, NW Germany, Belgium (Flanders), United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands) are working together in an active policy-science working group to improve water quality by evaluating the impact of implemented nutrient management strategies. More insight into the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different mitigation options under specific circumstances is needed. Therefore, each country has prepared factsheets with specific information for the top six mitigation options. Based on this information, general factsheets were made to compare the effects and cost-effectiveness of mitigation options between the NW European countries. The results are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{the analysis of the}} influence of Nitrate Directive on agricultural business. In an agricultural enterprise ?A? is analysed livestock manure and mineral fertilization in the years 2007 - 2010. The theoretical part describes Government Order 103 / 2003 on the designation of <b>nitrate</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>zones</b> and on the use and storage of fertilizers and livestock manure, crop rotation, and the implementation of erosion control measures in these zones. The Nitrates Directive requires application of a general landspreading limit of 170 kg per hectare for nitrogen from livestock manure. The analytic part of the thesis contains characteristics of the enterprise A. In this part, the consumption of fertilizers applied on the arable land and on the grassland for each year are calculated including the fertilization costs. Solutions and improvements for the enterprise have been suggested {{on the basis of the}} results...|$|R
