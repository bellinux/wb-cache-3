40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the distribution}} of employee income in Slovenia in the period 1991 – 2009. The analysis is based on two different datasets, both derived from the personal income tax files. It was shown that income inequality of employees income has somewhat increased in this period, using the Gini coefficient as the indicator of income inequality. Though increases in income inequality were moderate according to this summary measure, rather largest changes did occur {{at the very top}} of the income distribution, i. e. top 5 per cent and top one per cent of employees. Income inequality of employees’ net income (i. e. <b>net</b> of employee <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and personal income tax) remained fairly stable in this time period. In other words, the changes in personal income tax dampened to a large degree the effects of increasing inequality in {{the distribution of}} employee gross income. This was also established using the Kakwani index of progressivity. Increases in progressivity of the personal income tax came in leaps, mostly following the introduction of new income tax legislation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of various}} {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD) treatments was compared using two different cost measures. The first measure, gross social costs, excluded output gains due to treatment, whereas the second measure, <b>net</b> <b>social</b> costs, included output gains from both market and nonmarket activities. The cost-effectiveness criterion was the cost-per-life year gained or the implicit value of a year of life. The lower the cost-per-life year gained, the more costeffective the treatment was. Four ERSD treatments were evaluated over 20 years. Home dialysis and transplantation were more cost-effective than in-center dialysis, regardless of whether gross or <b>net</b> <b>social</b> costs were used.

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to assess the net {{distributive}} impact of state expenditures and revenues on labour income in Greece for the 1958 - 95 period. This effect is measured by the <b>net</b> <b>social</b> wage defined as the difference between the total benefits received by labour from state spending and the labour taxes. We also discuss certain issues related to the empirical methodology employed in the present and similar studies and the way its inconsistent use has affected inter-country comparisons of the <b>net</b> <b>social</b> wage in the literature. Our empirical findings for Greece indicate that for the entire period no redistribution of income in favour of labour has taken place via the actions of the state. The average <b>net</b> <b>social</b> wage is very close to zero even though during the last decade we observe an increasing involvement of the state in the reproduction of labour. The positive <b>net</b> <b>social</b> wage of the few recent years coincided with high public deficits and appears to be a result of slow growth, high unemployment rates and compensation for the adverse developments for labour in the market distribution of income. ...|$|R

30|$|Public {{economics}} literature highlights two alternative {{definitions of}} the nature of <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> On the one hand, they can represent a deferred salary if the link between <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and <b>social</b> benefits (pensions and unemployment benefits) is high. This is the case of pension systems with defined contributions. On the other hand, they might be considered a regular payroll tax (such as the labour income tax), if the tax-benefit link is weak, {{as is the case in}} many defined-benefit pay-as-you-go pension systems. In this paper we opt for an intermediate position, so <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> would be treated as a particular labour tax whose revenues are partially affected by social security financing.

40|$|Public social {{protection}} can be funded through either <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> or general taxation. Does this matter for employment? Yes, {{for a number}} of reasons. First, <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> tend to weigh on labour costs and thus may affect employment – unless workers are prepared to accept lower net wages to compensate for <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> Other funding bases like income taxes and value-added taxes may also raise labour costs, but because they are typically levied on broader population groups – and not just wage earners – they may be less detrimental to employment than <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> The chapter also considers the specific cases of switching to taxes on capital, including real estate, and activities detrimental to environment. Second, the “progressivity ” of the funding system also matters. Adverse employment effects can be alleviated by taxing less low-paid employment than high-paid employment. Third, strengthening the link between <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and pension entitlements and introducing experience-rating for certain social schemes like sickness benefits may be helpful. 157 4.

40|$|Comparative {{household}} micro income databases do {{not report}} {{the level of}} social transfers after taxation. Consequently, disaggregated redistributive analyses {{of the welfare state}} are based on gross income components. In most countries, however, social insurance benefits are subject to taxation. In such instances, the level and equalising effect of social insurance to income inequality are overestimated, both in absolute terms and in relation to nontaxable benefits. One way to avoid this problem is to estimate the level of <b>net</b> <b>social</b> insurance by the use of a so-called proportional tax estimation technique. This technique, however, causes a misspecification of the level of <b>net</b> <b>social</b> insurance in cases where taxation is established at the individual level. In this paper we therefore apply the proportional tax estimation technique for validity analyses on household income data. The question is to what extent this estimation of taxes misspecifies the level of <b>net</b> <b>social</b> insurance. It is found that the proportional tax estimation is viable when separating social and fiscal policies in comparative analyses on household micro income data. The underestimation of the level of <b>net</b> <b>social</b> insurance which is due to the application of the proportional tax estimation technique is negligible compared with the overestimation occurring from not taking taxes into account.
