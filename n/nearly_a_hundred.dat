5|$|In Cuba, the hurricane's {{impact was}} {{extremely}} severe: the storm destroyed <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> ships and likely killed hundreds of individuals across the island, and also inflicted extensive crop damage and widespread flooding. The hurricane capsized nearly all crafts docked at Havana Harbor, {{and of the}} 104boats in the harbor prior to the storm's arrival, only 12remained after it subsided. Between 40and 50other cargo vessels were impaired, with significant structural damage in the city proper also observed. Damage to houses, crops, and shipping was catastrophic throughout the island; the storm was reportedly the worst in Cuban history at the time, more severe even than an earlier hurricane in 1844. Waves were high enough to reach the lanterns of the Morro Castle lighthouse. While no concrete death toll was established, reports indicated the deaths of several dozen individuals during the entire course of the storm, while other records noted that hundreds of deaths had possibly occurred across the island.|$|E

Sheridan was at the time at Winchester, on his return from Washington. His wild ride to the field of battle, and his saving the day, can never be forgotten, for they have been made immortal by the genius of T. BUCHANAN READ, whose thrilling poem upon this subject is the most soul-searching lyric of the war. In this last and crowning victory of the campaign, the Twenty-Fourth bore a brilliant part, losing here its commanding officer, mortally wounded, and many others in death and wounds. <b>Nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hundred</b> of its officers and men were placed hors-de-combat on this bloody field, on which no regiment in all the Union army fought more heroically, or more steadfastly than the Iowa Twenty-fourth. The same may be safely said, too, of its conduct at Winchester and Fisher’s Hill. During the campaign its losses were nearly two hundred, officers and men.|$|R
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|As the two armies {{returned}} to winter quarters, Francis I of France replaced Boutières with François de Vendôme, Count of Enghien, a prince with no experience commanding an army. Francis also sent additional {{troops to the}} Piedmont, including several hundred heavy cavalry, some companies of French infantry from Dauphiné and Languedoc, and a force of quasi-Swiss from Gruyères. In January 1544, Enghien laid siege to Carignano, which was defended by Imperial troops {{under the command of}} Pirro Colonna. The French were of the opinion that d'Avalos would be forced to attempt a relief of the besieged city, at which point he could be forced into a battle; but as such pitched battles were viewed as very risky undertakings, Enghien sent Blaise de Lasseran-Massencôme, seigneur de Montluc, to Paris to ask Francis for permission to fight one. Montluc apparently convinced Francis to give his assent—contingent on the agreement of Enghien's captains—over the objections of the Comte de St. Pol, who complained that a defeat would leave France exposed to an invasion by d'Avalos's troops at a time when Charles V and Henry VIII of England were expected to attack Picardy. Montluc, returning to Italy, brought with him <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> volunteers from among the young noblemen of the court, including Gaspard de Coligny.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February, the 5th Light Infantry {{stationed}} at Singapore {{was among the}} few units to mutiny successfully. Nearly eight hundred and fifty of its troops mutinied {{on the afternoon of}} the 15th, along with <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> men of the Malay States Guides. This mutiny lasted almost seven days, and resulted in the deaths of 47 British soldiers and local civilians. The mutineers also released the interned crew of the SMS Emden, who were asked by the mutineers to join them but refused and actually took up arms and defended the barracks after the mutineers had left (sheltering some British refuges as well) until the prison camp was relieved. The mutiny was suppressed only after French, Russian and Japanese ships arrived with reinforcements. Of 200 people tried at Singapore, 47 mutineers were shot in public executions, the rest were transported for life to East Africa. Most of the rest were deported for life or given jail terms ranging between seven and twenty years. In all 800 mutineers were either shot imprisoned or exiled Some historians, including Hew Strachan, argue that although Ghadar agents operated within the Singapore unit, the mutiny was isolated and not linked to the conspiracy. Others deem this as instigated by the Silk Letter Movement which became intricately related to the Ghadarite conspiracy.|$|E

5|$|Originally a garden, {{the demand}} for more {{accommodation}} for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by Bishop Robinson {{at the suggestion of}} his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, {{as a result of a}} benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of the First quad are repeated on them — only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819, they were joined up to the Front quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated – the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of Basil Champneys, and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the Provost's Lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityBeginning {{with the}} {{publication}} of the Boston News Letter in 1704, as the first continuous newspaper in British America, the public prints developed apace. By 1754 <b>nearly</b> half <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> different newspapers had gone to press in the colonial centers of the Western Hemisphere. Accompanying the rise of newspaper publication as an inviting business venture was the rapid development of the economic, political, and cultural relations among the several British colonies, at a tempo undreamt of by the less opulent inhabitants of the seventeenth century. Significantly, the most influential and long-lived prints were published in the burgeoning urban centers of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Annapolis, Williamsburg, and Charles Town, where there existed the greatest promise of sufficient rewards for the gathering and dissemination of news. The rise and swift growth of the public press was largely a result of the expanding intercolonial civilization, which threatened by mid-century to obliterate the narrow provincial boundaries of an earlier era. Perhaps the most important factor facilitating the enlargement of journalistic opportunities was the accumulation of surplus capital. Certainly a substantial amount of money was needed to assure a publisher of a successful venture into the field of the newspaper, especially since the cost of erecting and maintaining a physical plant was not insignificant. Moreover, it was early learned that the paid advertisement, which was itself a concomitant of surplus capital, represented the chief source of income to the publisher of an eighteenth century newspaper.
