40|$|Independently of {{the amount}} of adipose tissue, certain {{patterns}} of fat distribution increase the risk of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Although the ratio of waist to hip (WHR) circumferences has been consistently related to diabetes mellitus, it is possible that only two measures do not completely characterize fat topography. The current study, therefore, examines the cross-sectional relation of six <b>girths</b> (waist, hip, <b>neck,</b> bust, wrist, and ankle) to diabetes mellitus in 43, 595 women. As compared with non-diabetics, Quetelet index (kg/m 2) and all circumferences were elevated among diabetics. Stratified analyses showed that WHR, and waist, <b>neck,</b> and bust <b>girths</b> were consistently related to diabetes independently of the degree of overweight. As estimated from a logistic regression model that simultaneously controlled for age and all anthropometric variables, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was positively related to Quetelet index, and to the waist, bust, and <b>neck</b> <b>girths,</b> with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1. 4 to 2. 6. However, diabetes was inversely related to hip (OR = 0. 61) and ankle (OR = 0. 73) girths; p less than 0. 005 for each association. Although cross-sectional in nature, these results suggest that an adverse body fat distribution {{is not limited to the}} abdominal region, but that a relative preponderance of adipose tissue in various regions of the upper body is associated with diabetes mellitus in women...|$|R

40|$|The {{domestic}} dog may be {{the most}} morphologically diverse terrestrial mammalian species known to man; pedigree dogs are artificially selected for extreme aesthetics dictated by formal Breed Standards, and breed-related disorders linked to conformation are ubiquitous and diverse. Brachycephaly [...] foreshortening of the facial skeleton [...] is a discrete mutation that has been selected for in many popular dog breeds e. g. the Bulldog, Pug, and French Bulldog. A chronic, debilitating respiratory syndrome, whereby soft tissue blocks the airways, predominantly affects dogs with this conformation, and thus is labelled Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS). Despite the name of the syndrome, scientific evidence quantitatively linking brachycephaly with BOAS is lacking, but it could aid efforts to select for healthier conformations. Here we show, in (1) an exploratory study of 700 dogs of diverse breeds and conformations, and (2) a confirmatory study of 154 brachycephalic dogs, that BOAS risk increases sharply in a non-linear manner as relative muzzle length shortens. BOAS only occurred in dogs whose muzzles comprised less than half their cranial lengths. Thicker <b>neck</b> <b>girths</b> also increased BOAS risk in both populations: a risk factor for human sleep apnoea and not previously realised in dogs; and obesity was found to further increase BOAS risk. This study provides evidence that breeding for brachycephaly leads to an increased risk of BOAS in dogs, with risk increasing as the morphology becomes more exaggerated. As such, dog breeders and buyers should be aware of this risk when selecting dogs, and breeding organisations should actively discourage exaggeration of this high-risk conformation in breed standards and the show ring...|$|R

2500|$|In the US, {{ready-to-wear}} {{sizes of}} dress shirts traditionally consist of two numbers [...] such as 15½34, {{meaning that the}} shirt has a <b>neck</b> [...] in <b>girth</b> (measured from centre of top button to centre of corresponding buttonhole) and a sleeve [...] long (measured from midpoint of the back and shoulders to the wrist). However, {{to reduce the number}} of sizes needed to be manufactured and stocked, an average sleeve length is sometimes given in the form 15½34/35 (indicating a <b>neck</b> [...] in <b>girth</b> and a [...] sleeve). Since the cuff frequently features two buttons, the cuff diameter can be reduced so that the cuff does not come down over the hand, allowing the shirt to fit the shorter length. Since the sleeve and neck size do not take into account waist size, some shirts are cut wide to accommodate large belly sizes. Shirts cut for flat stomachs are usually labeled, [...] "fitted", [...] "tailored fit" [...] "athletic fit" [...] or [...] "trim fit". The terms for fuller cut shirts are more varied ("Traditional", [...] "Regular" [...] etc.) and are sometimes explained on a shirt maker's website.

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate performance and biometrics of lambs fed different sources of forage. Twenty-four six-month-old Santa Inês female lambs were randomly allocated to four experimental diets and housed in individual stalls. They weighed on average 26. 35 ± 0. 20 kg. The diets were coast cross hay (HAY), cassava hay (CAS), dehydrated by-product of pea crop (PEA) and saccharin (SAC). The diets were formulated with the same amount of protein and energy with fixed levels of forage (60 %) and concentrate (40 %). Adaptation to the diet took 7 days, with 45 days on experiment. Weights and biometric measurements were obtained every fortnight and feed intake three times a week. Rights half-carcasses were weighed and sectioned into retail cuts, rib, loin, shoulder, belly, neck and leg, which were weighed individually. Weight gain in lambs was significantly different between diets, with those fed saccharin gaining more. Overall, treatments did not significantly affect biometric measurements. There was a significant difference for feed intake and live weight at the end of the experiment. Animals fed PEA and SAC showed the best results. Average positive correlations were found between biometric measurements and live weight. Treatment PEA had heavier hot (14. 36 kg) and cold (14. 01 kg) carcass weights than the other groups. Hot carcass kill-out was higher for animals fed PEA as well as ham weight, belly, <b>neck</b> and heart <b>girth.</b> The weight of the abdominal viscera (%) for lambs fed CAS was greater than those fed SAC and PEA.

40|$|Background: UK male {{offshore}} workers typically increased in weight by 19 % since 1985, {{and are also}} heavier than the background UK male population. Aim: To conduct an anthropometric survey on UK {{offshore workers}}, employing the latest portable 3 D scanning technology, to quantify size and shape change associated with weight increase and identify differing physique groups among the sample. Method: 588 male offshore workers within seven pre-determined weight categories were scanned, using the Artec L portable 3 D scanner, in three different postures; whilst wearing form-fitting clothing and while wearing a survival suit. 404 of the 588 participants also undertook a helicopter window escape task. Results: The sample population had average weight of 90. 5 kg, and matched the weight distribution of the workforce {{population as a whole}} (chi squared= 11. 7; 11 df, P> 0. 05). Five extracted <b>girths</b> (<b>neck,</b> chest, waist, hip and wrist) were found be 13. 5 % greater than in 1985, with the highest average measurement 17. 3 % greater at the waist. The 99 th percentile of extracted measures had increased more than twice that of the 1 st percentile (18. 3 % v 8. 9 % increase respectively). The reliability of extracted measures was high with average TEM of 1. 15 %. 11 distinct physique clusters were identified, across four morphological somatotypes, displaying a tendency towards endomorphic and mesomorphic phenotypes and a predisposition towards obesity (average BMI= 28. 3 kg/m 2). 51 % of the sample successfully passed through the smallest industry standard escape exit, with the best morphological prediction of window egress giving a predictive accuracy of 73. 5 %. Conclusion: The dramatic increase in size and shape within the offshore workforce over the last 30 years represents an ‘expanding universe’ of physique and weight variability. The challenge this presents to designers is considerable in ensuring the on-going ergonomic fit of the industry’s working environment for the offshore population. Oil and Gas UK...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{whether there are differences}} in results when evaluating cervical range of motion (ROM) with radiographic analysis, a bubble goniometer, and a dual inclinometer and whether particular physical parameters are related to cervical ROM. Methods: We evaluated the cervical ROM of 115 volunteers with each of the 3 clinical methods. Tape measurements of <b>neck</b> <b>girth,</b> distance from chin to sternal notch, and distances from ears to acromion were also recorded, along with sex and age. Interrater and intrarater reliabilities were determined, and the Pearson product moment correlation test and t test were performed on all data. Results: Cervical ROM as determined by radiographic analysis was greater than that obtained with either a dual inclinometer or a bubble goniometer. All tape measurements were weakly correlated with all 3 means of cervical ROM evaluation, {{with the exception of the}} measurement of ear lobes to acromion, which did not correlate with radiographic analysis. There were also differences found in cervical ROM by sex and by age, with female subjects and younger subjects having a greater ROM.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to relate {{seasonal}} hematology changes with the rest of physiological variations suffered by red deer, such as antler and biometrics cycle, and to assess the relationship between hematology and the effort performed in antler development. Blood samples were taken from 21 male red deer every 4 weeks during 18 months. Samples were analyzed for the main hematological parameters. Simultaneously, biometrics measurements were taken, such as antler length, body weight, body condition score, testicular diameter (TD), and thoracic and <b>neck</b> <b>girth.</b> All the blood cell types (erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets) showed seasonal variations, increasing as antler cleaning approached, as did hematocrit and hemoglobin. The final size of antlers was negatively related to leukocyte count, nonlymphoid leukocyte count, red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean platelet volume, and TD, whereas it was positively related to body condition during antler growth. Huge seasonal variations in some hematological values have been found to be related to changes in antler and biometrics measurements. Since these variations are even greater than the caused by deer handling, they should be taken into account when evaluating hematology in deer populations.

It is characterized by short duration, high intensity bursts of activity. The purpose of this research was to determine anthropometric and physical fitness profile of male elite and non-elite boxers of Manipur and to compare the two groups. Materials and Methods: Nineteen subjects were selected as elite boxers and twenty-four were non-elite boxers of Manipur. A cross-sectional study was conducted on anthropometric measurements and physical fitness ability tests on 33 subjects (elite and non-elite boxers). Statistical analysis was done using descriptive statistics, t-test and logistic regression with the help of SPSS version 15 software. Results: Results showed elite boxers have significantly reduced <b>neck</b> <b>girth</b> and calf girth as compare to non-elite boxers. Elite boxers have significantly lower sub scapular skin fold (SSF) and supra iliac skin fold (SISF) than their counterparts. Higher stature, larger BTB and lower percent fat are associated with higher performance in boxing. Sit ups (SU), standing Broad Jump (SBJ), Plat taping (PT), Sit and reach (SAR) and Harvard Step Test (HST) are predicted as most contributing factors enhancing performance level among the physical fitness components. Elite boxers are found to have more functional strength (sit ups), higher explosive strength (SBJ), more agility (PT), cardio-vascular endurance and flexibility (SAR) than non-elite boxers.

Results were compared with those obtained by the underwater weighing method (UW). The true head volume was calculated from the difference in BV, with and without head submersion. Stepwise regression analysis provided an equation to predict the head volume (HV) from the head girth (HG), the head length (HL), the head breadth (HB), the <b>neck</b> <b>girth</b> (NG), the face length I (FLI), the face length II (FLII), and the cheek girth. The equation for males was HV= 0. 185 ^*(HG) + 0. 122 ^*(FLII) - 8. 925, r^ 2 = 0. 678, SEE= 0. 216. The equation for females was HV= 0. 131 ^*(HG) - 0. 026 ^*(NG) + 0. 112 ^*(FLI) - 6. 760, r^ 2 = 0. 747, SEE= 0. 154. Cross-validation of predicted HV showed that the correlation coefficients were r= 0. 759, SEE= 0. 193 and r= 0. 749, SEE= 0. 193, for males and females respectively.

A 3  ×  2 factorial arrangement (3 genotype ×  2 concentrate levels) was used to randomly allocate 36 goats (15.2  ±  0.30  kg initial weight); 12 goats from each genotype with age about 1  year were divided randomly into two groups for a feeding trial of 90  days. The two concentrate levels were L 1 and L 2, where L 1 and L 2 are levels fed to animals {{at the rate of}} 1 and 1.5  % BW, respectively. Hay was fed ad libitum with 20  % refusal rate. The mean daily dry matter intake of the goats was 520.5  g/day. The intake was about 67  g/day higher for L 2 than L 1 goats. Consequently, L 2 goats had significantly (p <  0.05) higher average daily gain, dressing percentage, primal carcass cuts and total non-carcass fat than those fed L 1. Among genotypes, HH goats were found to have higher (p <  0.05) carcass weight, heart girth, <b>neck</b> <b>girth,</b> and carcass cuts (legs and shoulders) than SS goats. However, they were not better in dressing percentage than SS goats. Compared to Bati goats, HH goats had significantly (p <  0.05) wider rib-eye area, heavier ribs/racks weights, and better dressing percentage. Despite smaller body size, the performance of SS goats was comparable to Bati goats. In conclusion, the study indicates the potential of Ethiopian indigenous goats to produce optimum amount of meat when supplemented with concentrate at the rate of 1.5  % body weight.|$|E
40|$|Football {{accounts}} for {{a significant portion of}} the 1. 275 million concussions per year. Neck strength has been theorized to possibly assist in the attenuation of severe impacts and possibly prevent football-related concussions. The purpose of this study was to investigate potential differences in isometric neck strength in flexion, extension, and lateral flexion right/left between concussed high school football players and matched non-concussed football players. Sixteen high school players that suffered a football-related concussion during the 2010 competition season comprised the research group, and were later matched to a player that did not suffer a concussion, on the basis of age, height, weight, and position of play. Measurements included: (1) maximal isometric neck strength in flexion, extension, lateral flexion right/left; (2) range of motion in the same directions; (3) neck length and girth; and (4) height and weight. A multiple analysis of variance was performed to determine if between-group differences existed in isometric neck strength. In addition, covariate analyses were performed with neck strength serving as responses, group membership as the independent variable, and body weight, neck length, <b>neck</b> <b>girth,</b> and cervical range of motion as covariate separately. Results revealed no significant differences in isometric neck strength between concussed and non-concussed players. Additionally, covariate analyses revealed no significant group differences. Differences in neck strength might not have been observable due to small sample size and subjects 2 ̆ 7 age and undeveloped musculature. Future research should include eccentric neck strength, rather than isometric, in older players with electromyography. Measuring neck strength eccentrically in conjunction with electromyography would yield measurements that are more applicable to the cervical response during head impacts. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives - Applying {{geometric}} similarity predictions of body dimensions to specific occupational groups {{has the potential}} to reveal useful ergonomic and health implications. This study assessed a representative sample of the male UK offshore workforce, and examined how body dimensions from sites typifying musculoskeletal development or fat accumulation, differed from predicted values. Methods - A cross sectional sample was obtained across seven weight categories using quota sampling, to match the wider workforce. In total, 588 UK offshore workers, 84 from each of seven weight categories, were measured for stature, mass and underwent 3 D body scans which yielded 22 dimensional measurements. Each measurement was modeled using a body-mass power law (adjusting for age), to derive its exponent, which was compared against that predicted from {{geometric similarity}}. Results - Mass scaled to stature 1. 73 (CI: 1. 44 - 2. 02). Arm and leg volume increased by mass 0. 8, and torso volume increased by mass 1. 1 in contrast to mass 1. 0 predicted by geometric similarity. <b>Neck</b> <b>girth</b> increased by mass 0. 33 as expected, while torso girth and depth dimensions increased by mass 0. 53 - 0. 72, all substantially greater than assumed by geometric similarity. Conclusions - After controlling for age, offshore workers experience spectacular 'super-centralization' of body shape, with greatest gains in abdominal depth and girth dimensions in areas of fat accumulation, and relative dimensional loss in limbs. These findings are consistent with the antecedents of sarcopenic obesity, and should be flagged as a health concern for this workforce, and for future targeted research and lifestyle interventions.

40|$|Extremely brachycephalic, or short-muzzled, dog breeds such as pugs, French bulldogs, and bulldogs {{are prone}} to the conformation-related {{respiratory}} disorder-brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS). Affected dogs present {{with a wide range}} of clinical signs from snoring and exercise intolerance, to life-threatening events such as syncope. In this study, conformational risk factors for BOAS that could potentially aid in breeding away from BOAS were sought. Six hundred and four pugs, French bulldogs, and bulldogs were included in the study. Soft tape measurements of the head and body were used and the inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated. Breed-specific models were developed to assess the associations between the conformational factors and BOAS status based on functional grading. The models were further validated by means of a BOAS index, which is an objective measurement of respiratory function using whole-body barometric plethysmography. The final models have good predictive power for discriminating BOAS (-) and BOAS (+) phenotypes indicated by the area under the curve values of > 80 % on the receiver operating curves. When other factors were controlled, stenotic nostrils were associated with BOAS in all three breeds; pugs and bulldogs with higher body condition scores (BCS) had a higher risk of developing BOAS. Among the standardized conformational measurements (i. e. craniofacial ratio (CFR), eye width ratio (EWR), skull index (SI), <b>neck</b> <b>girth</b> ratio (NGR), and neck length ratio (NLR)), for pugs EWR and SI, for French bulldogs NGR and NLR, and for bulldogs SI and NGR showed significant associations with BOAS status. However, the NGR in bulldogs was the only significant predictor that also had satisfactory inter-observer reproducibility. A NGR higher than 0. 71 in male bulldogs was predictive of BOAS with approximately 70 % sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, stenotic nostrils, BCS, and NGR were found to be valid, easily applicable predictors for BOAS (+) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Obesity is a {{major problem}} in modern horse keeping. It has long been known that obese ponies are at higher risk of {{developing}} laminitis. Together with several other risk factors such as insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, it contributes to the ‘equine metabolic syndrome’. The effect of management of obesity lies in limiting the food intake and stimulating exercise. Gluco balance® is a nutraceutical supplement based on herbs sold as a supporting remedy to lower the excessive body condition and improve the peripheral insulin sensitivity. Hypothesis: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if Gluco balance® has effect on body condition and fat accumulation in a group of overweight Shetland ponies (BCS ≥ 6. 5). Material and Methods: Fourteen overweight Shetland ponies, randomly divided into a control and a test group, were kept on dry pasture with ad libitum water for 6 weeks. Gluco balance® (6 gram) mixed with 14 ml of plain water was administered orally to the test group twice daily. The control group received a placebo containing 15 ml of water orally twice daily. Body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), cresty neck score (CNS), neck- heart- and umbilical girth were monitored. Subcutaneous fat thickness was measured by ultrasonography at six locations (retroperitoneal near the falciform ligament, axillary, withers, rib-eye, rump and tailhead) on a weekly basis. Statistical analysis was performed by a general linear mixed model with group, week and group/time interaction as fixed factors. P-value < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: No significant findings in group/time interaction were present in any parameter. A significant time effect was found in BW, neck- heart- and umbilical girth (direct and after standardization with withers height), retroperitoneal and rib-eye fat thickness. A significant group effect was seen in rump and tailhead fat thickness, and in the <b>neck</b> <b>girth</b> after standardization with withers height. Conclusion: Gluco balance® did not seem to have any significant effect on body condition and fat accumulation in this experiment. A decrease in body weight and adiposity was seen in the test and control group, probably as a result of a shortage in pasture...|$|E
40|$|Between 1969 and 1972 growth {{data were}} {{collected}} from 175 zebra E quus burchelli antiquorum and 138 zebra embryos and foetuses from the Central District of the Kruger National Park, Republic of South Africa. Statistical analysis of data indicated no significant difference between body mass of adult stallions (range == 267, 3 to 373, 3 kg; mean = 318, 5 kg; n = 57) and adult non-pregnant mares (range = 272, 6 to 386, 9 kg; mean = 321, 6 kg; n = 51) (t = 0, 587). The heaviest zebra had a body mass of 429, 4 kilogram. This was a pregnant mare carrying a 35, 2 kg foetus. Von Bertalanffy growth curves indicated that shoulder heights in young zebra may reach the adult range by one year of age, the adult body mass range is, however, only attained after three years of age. These curves also showed that age classification of free roaming zebra is only reliable up to the age of about two years, after which individual variation is too great. Stallions were significantly taller at the shoulder than mares (mean = 1, 8 cm) (t = 2, 032) and neck thickness was the only body dimension showing visible sexual dimorphism in adults. Here the stallion had a <b>neck</b> <b>girth</b> on average 8, 1 cm greater than the mare. Regression equations for estimating body mass from body dimensions were calculated by using a standard logarithmic transformation and fitting a linear regression by the method of least squares and also by undertaking standard straight line linear regression analyses. Exponential curves obtained by the first method indicated that growth was not isometric (not linear) and that the ratios of any of the dimensions of length to body mass were con- stantly changing, i. e. growth is allometric. Marked allometric growth differences existed between the two sexes except {{in the case of the}} heart girth-body mass relationship. Comparison of growth data from E. b. antiquorum with that of E. b. boehmi from Tanzania (Sachs 1967), indicates that E. b. antiquorum is considerably larger. Body masses differ by an average of 70 kg and 102 kg for stallions and mares respectively. Average birth mass for zebra was 33, 7 kg. The largest foetus had a body mass of 39, 0 kilogram. Foetal growth curves are provided. The first signs of body stripes occur at between 250 and 270 days of pregnancy (gestation period = 375 days). </p...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} large maintained weight losses on body composition, adipose tissue distribution and cardiovascular risk factors, i. e. systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose, insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and uric acid. Methods: Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) is an ongoing prospective intervention study of obesity. The intervention consists of three types of bariatric surgery. The matched control group receives conventional anti-obesity treatment at primary health care centres. Inclusion criteria for the intervention study are age 37 to 60 years, BMI * 34 kg/m 2 for men and * 38 kg/m 2 for women. Ultimately, the two treatment groups will contain 2000 individuals each and the follow-up {{will be at least}} 10 years. The use of anthropometric equations, calibrated by means of a multicompartment CT technique, made it possible to estimate lean body mass (LBM), subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) masses from weight, height and the sagittal diameter with errors less than 22 %. Results: Two risk patterns were identified. One body composition risk factor pattern, in which the VAT and SAT masses were positively related to risk factors, while LBM showed negative associations. The other pattern was a subcutaneous adipose tissue distribution risk factor pattern. SAT in {{the upper part of the}} body as estimated by <b>neck</b> <b>girth</b> was positively associated to cardiovascular risk factors, while the reverse was true for a lower body SAT distribution as estimated by thigh girth. All risk factors except cholesterol were markedly improved two years after bariatric surgery. The two-year incidence of diabetes was reduced 30 -fold after a 23 % weight loss. In an eight-year perspective, surgically treated patients had lost 16 % of their initial body weight while the controls had gained 1 %. Surgical treatment reduced the eight-year incidence of diabetes five-fold while it had no effect on the incidence of hypertension. The more pronounced increase in pulse pressure by age seen in the obese could be modified by weight reducing gastric surgery. Conclusions: Body composition and adipose tissue distribution are closely related to cardiovascular risk factors, also in the severely obese. The metabolic profile is markedly improved by gastric surgery. The effect of surgery on the increasing pulse pressure indicates that the atherosclerotic process may be slowed down by weight reduction...|$|E
40|$|Thursday Poster - CKD: Complications - 1 : no. TH-PO 631 BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} sleep apnea in the non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) population have not been well characterized. A handful of studies performed to date have yielded highly variable prevalence rates due to cohort heterogeneity and inter-study inconsistencies in sleep apnea definition. This study sought to determine the association of sleep apnea with non-dialysis CKD by recruiting a uniform cohort to undertake overnight polysomnography (PSG). METHODS: 141 male Chinese CKD patients, aged 40 to 60 years old, were recruited to undergo overnight PSG. Height, weight, <b>neck</b> <b>girth,</b> estimated glomerular filtration rate, spot urinary protein excretion and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score were collected at baseline. The {{prevalence and}} severity of both sleep apnea and associated nocturnal hypoxemia (NH) were determined across {{the full spectrum of}} non-dialysis CKD. RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 15) and NH (Sleep Heart Health Study arbitrary definition) was 35. 5 % and 10. 6 % respectively in this study population, which had a mean (± SD) age and BMI of 51. 44 ± 6. 05 y and 26. 05 ± 4. 22 kg/m 2. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for sleep apnea by body mass index (BMI) and proteinuria were 1. 18 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 02 - 1. 37; P ≤ 0. 05) and 2. 60 (95 % CI 2. 56 - 2. 61; P ≤ 0. 05) respectively. The adjusted OR for median cohort oxygen desaturation index (ODI) by BMI and proteinuria were 1. 23 (95 % CI 1. 05 - 1. 45; P ≤ 0. 05) and 2. 60 (95 % 2. 56 - 2. 61; P ≤ 0. 05). However, no significant correlation between prevalence and severity of sleep apnea and NH with progressive renal deterioration was observed. Furthermore, an ESS score above 10 showed no significant mean difference in AHI and ODI when compared to a score below 10. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep apnea is prevalent in the Chinese non-dialysis CKD population and strongly correlated with BMI and proteinuria, but not renal function. The study results also indicate that ESS is an investigative tool that lacks discriminatory power in patients with renal insufficiency. This study supports the need to maintain high clinical vigilance for sleep apnea when attending to CKD patients with significant proteinuria. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The studies {{described}} in this thesis investigated physiological and behavioural aspects of reproduction in farmed fallow deer. The initial studies examined puberty. Pubertal development in fallow does (Section 2. 1) {{was associated with a}} significant rise in mean serum progesterone levels between 10 and 15 months of age, which declined back to earlier prepubertal levels immediately before the onset of oestrous activity at 16 months of age. Almost all (55 / 56) pubertal does exhibited first oestrus at, or close to, 16 months of age and the mean date of this oestrus was not significantly different from that of first oestrus of the breeding season for older does. Prepubertal fallow bucks (Section 2. 2) exhibited a markedly seasonal growth pattern, with entire bucks growing at a significantly greater rate than castrated bucks from 9 months of age. Both groups of bucks showed a progressive increase of serum testosterone and androstenedione levels from 12 months of age. However, while this increase was sustained until 16 months of age in the entire bucks, the castrated bucks exhibited a more transient and lower magnitude elevation of serum testosterone levels between 12 and 14 months of age. Castrated bucks failed to develop pedicles. Other aspects of reproductive physiology were investigated in adult animals. First oestrus of fallow does (Section 3. 1) was naturally synchronised within a 12 day period in late April to early May. Mean length (±sd) of the first oestrous cycle was 21. 0 ± 0. 64 days, but mean cycle length increased significantly as the breeding season progressed. The duration of the breeding season was 65 - 135 days (3 - 6 oestrous cycles) and was positively related to doe age. There was an indication that one or more short-lived luteal cycles from silent ovulations occurred before first oestrus and these may have helped to synchronise this oestrus. Some does appeared to have silent ovulations at the termination of the breeding season. Hormonal changes around oestrus were investigated by hourly blood sampling of six fallow does (Section 3. 2). The preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge was initiated an hour before the onset of oestrus and there was an indication of a small rise in progesterone secretion at the onset of oestrus. However, serum oestradiol- 17 β levels showed wide variation during the sampling period (46 hours) with only a slight tendency to rise at the onset of oestrus. Serum androstenedione levels exhibited a marked elevation (2 x basal levels) immediately at the onset of oestrus and remained elevated for a further 6 hours. It is proposed that androstenedione may be influential in the expression of oestrous behaviour. Conception rates, gestation lengths and live-weight/serum progesterone profiles during the gestating period were examined (Section 3. 3). Over a 2 year period, 82. 7 % of does run with fertile bucks conceived at first oestrus matings and 96. 0 % conceived by second or third oestrus matings. There were no significant effects of fawn sex, doe age or sire on gestation length and the mean (±sd) overall length (n= 88) was 234. 2 ± 2. 7 days. In 1983, pregnant does (n= 55) exhibited marked live-weight gains (+ 10 kg) during the third trimester of pregnancy, whereas non-pregnant does (n= 14) showed only slight gains (+ 2 kg) over the same period. Pregnant does maintained high levels of serum progesterone (> 5 ng/ml) during gestation, while non-pregnant does exhibited cyclical fluctuations of progesterone secretion during the breeding season (April to October) but low levels (< 1. 0 ng/ml) at the cessation of cyclic activity. The annual cycles of live-weight, <b>neck</b> <b>girth</b> and serum testosterone levels of adult entire and prepubertally castrated fallow bucks were investigated in addition to the annual cycles of testis size and spermatozoal production of the entire bucks (Section 3. 4). Entire bucks, which were always significantly heavier (14 - 18 %) than the castrated bucks, exhibited marked live-weight changes, with most rapid live-weight gains occurring over spring and summer months (October to February) and marked live-weight losses during the rut period (April-May). Castrated bucks exhibited similar, but less pronounced, live-weight changes. Furthermore, pre- and post-rut changes in <b>neck</b> <b>girth</b> and serum testosterone levels observed in entire bucks were apparent to a lesser degree in castrated bucks. However, {{there was no evidence of}} testosterone secretion in adult castrated bucks. Testicular diameter measurements of entire bucks were poorly correlated with live-weight. The seasonal pattern of changes in testicular size was similar to that for <b>neck</b> <b>girth,</b> both presumably reflecting the observed pattern of testosterone secretion. While there was no significant seasonal variation in mean ejaculate volume (collected by electro-ejaculation), there was considerable variation in spermatozoal characteristics. Viable spermatozoa were absent during summer months (November to January). However, concentrations of viable spermatozoa increased progressively from about February, two months before the rut, and reached peak concentrations in September, four months after the rutting period. Rutting behaviour of fallow bucks was observed in 1983 (Section 4. 1). Groaning vocalisations occurred only during the period of first oestrus matings (~ 14 days) and there was a close association between the intensity of groaning activity on anyone day and the number of does exhibiting oestrus on that day. Over a 40 day period spanning the period of first oestrus matings, there were marked changes in primary activities. Of particular interest were the significant decrease in grazing activity immediately before and during the mating period and the associated significant increases in standing, walking, investigatory and agonistic activities. There was a 25 % loss of buck live-weight associated with rutting activity. Mating sequences of fallow deer were recorded on 21 occasions in 1983 (Section 4. 2). Most does were observed to exhibit characteristic pre-oestrous behaviour, including fence pacing and aggression towards herd mates, between 12 and 24 hours before the onset of oestrus. Overt oestrus was always associated with fervent self-grooming (preening) behaviour by the doe and a marked change in receptivity towards the sexual advances of the buck. Courtship was characterised by repeated non-copulatory mounts by the buck (mean ±sd = 16. 4 ± 6. 8 mounts including copulation), although the mean (±sd) interval from the first mount to copulation was only 14. 8 ± 10. 4 minutes. The mount to service ratio was higher than reported for other cervid species, although the courtship interval was similar. Oestrus and courtship were apparently terminated at copulation. The allocation of primary activities during the mating season was investigated in 1983 for 60 fallow does (Section 4. 2). While there was significant circadian variation in group grazing, resting, standing and walking activities, there were only minor changes in group daily activity allocations during a 40 day period spanning the mating period. Artificial manipulation of reproductive seasonality was investigated in a series of experiments. In the first experiment (Section 5. 1) there was no apparent effect of the date of pre-rut buck introduction to mating groups on the onset of oestrus or the incidence of silent ovulations in does. In the second experiment (Section 5. 2) fertile oestrus was induced, three weeks before that of control does, in 20 / 21 (95. 2 %) does each treated intravaginally with a progesterone CIDR (14 days) followed by an i. m. injection of 500 i. u. PMSG. Ovulation rates ranged from 1 to 4 but were inversely related to PMSG dose/kg live-weight. Non-ovulating, luteinized follicles were a feature of PMSG treatment, particularly at higher dose rates and only 3 / 21 (14. 3 %) does conceived at the induced oestrus. Non-conceiving does returned to oestrus 21 - 27 days later, with the length of the oestrous cycle being positively related to the relative mass of luteinized structures. Does with multiple corpora lutea had higher serum progesterone levels during the oestrous cycle than does with a single corpus luteum. There was an indication that induced does influenced the onset of oestrous activity in herd-mate controls. In the third experiment (Section 5. 3) fertile oestrus was induced, eight weeks before that of untreated does, in 6 / 13 (46. 2 %) does treated with progesterone CIDRs followed by the continuous infusion of GnRH (125 ng/h or 250 ng/h) via osmotic mini-pumps. However only one (16. 7 %) of these does conceived and produced a viable fawn. The remaining does returned to anoestrum until the onset of the natural breeding season. In the fourth experiment (Section 5. 4) daily oral administration of melatonin to entire fallow bucks during summer was successful in advancing temporarily some aspects of reproductive seasonality. In particular, treated bucks exhibited a transient phase of accelerated neck hypertrophy and earlier initiation of spermatozoal production...|$|E
