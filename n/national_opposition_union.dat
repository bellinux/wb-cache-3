5|$|In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to {{capitalist}} reformers between 1989 and 1991 {{and many}} Western observers expected {{the same in}} Cuba. Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with Manuel Noriega's right-wing government in Panama – despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega – but it was overthrown in a U.S. invasion in December 1989. In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas, were defeated by the U.S.-funded <b>National</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>Union</b> in an election. With {{the collapse of the}} Soviet bloc, the U.S. secured a majority vote for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. Cuba asserted that this was a manifestation of U.S. hegemony, and refused to allow an investigative delegation to enter the country.|$|E

He was a delegate at the 1991 Sovereign National Conference, and at the Conference he famously declared [...] "never again!" [...] (plus jamais ça!).|$|R
50|$|After {{the suicide}} of Getúlio Vargas, his Vice President João Café Filho took office. Prior to Vargas' death, Brazil was living a time of intense {{political}} division, with the right-wing <b>opposition</b> <b>National</b> Democratic <b>Union</b> (UDN), high-level military officers and the mass media openly trying to depose him following the attempted assassination of right-wing journalist Carlos Lacerda, allegedly ordered by Vargas.|$|R

25|$|In 1987, {{due to a}} {{stalemate}} with the Contras, the Esquipulas II treaty was brokered by Costa Rican President Óscar Arias Sánchez. The treaty's provisions included a call for a cease-fire, freedom of expression, and national elections. After the February 26, 1990 elections, the Sandinistas lost and peacefully passed power to the <b>National</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>Union</b> (UNO), an alliance of 14 opposition parties ranging from the conservative business organization COSEP to Nicaraguan communists. UNO's candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, replaced Daniel Ortega as president of Nicaragua.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. role Nicaragua was a {{controversial}} {{topic in the}} 1980s. The Reagan administration had sought to overthrow the socialist Daniel Ortega by funding the right-wing Contras, resulting in the Iran–Contra affair. Bush and Secretary of State Baker sought to find a bipartisan way to settle the issue, and {{with the support of}} Congress, they ended military aid to the Contras in return for a promise from Ortega to hold full and free elections in 1990. In the election, Ortega was defeated by Violeta Chamorro of the <b>National</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|E

The {{international}} response was mixed, with the European Commission, the United States and the Southern African Development Community praising the elections as generally fair, while Human Rights Watch has questioned the legitimacy of this result. UNITA accepted the MPLA's victory.|$|R
50|$|Legislative {{elections}} {{were held in}} El Salvador on 12 March 1972. The result was {{a victory for the}} National Conciliation Party, which won 39 of the 52 seats. However, the election was marred by massive fraud and the Central Election Council disquaified the candidates of the <b>opposition</b> <b>National</b> Opposing <b>Union</b> (an alliance of the Christian Democratic Party, the National Revolutionary Movement and the Nationalist Democratic Union) in five out of fourteen constituencies. Voter turnout was 56.7%.|$|R
50|$|Maikano retired on 31 December 1993, but Biya {{called him}} out of {{retirement}} to serve as Government Delegate to the Urban Commune of Garoua in 1996. Biya appointed Maikano to that post following {{the victory of the}} <b>opposition</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> for Democracy and Progress (UNDP) in Garoua's municipal election; the atmosphere in the city was tense and Maikano, as the representative of the government, was greeted with hostility from the UNDP. According to Maikano, however, he was not interested in confrontation and intended only to improve the situation in Garoua through dialogue and his experience.|$|R
25|$|The Nicaraguan Revolution of 1979 to {{overthrow}} the Somoza regime and the 11-year-long Contra War of the 1980s further devastated {{the city and its}} economy. To make matters worse, a series of natural disasters, including Hurricane Mitch in 1998, made economic recovery more difficult. After winning the presidential election in 1990, the <b>National</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>Union</b> began the reconstruction of Managua began in earnest. More than 300,000 Nicaraguans returned from abroad bringing their expertise and needed capital. Businesses mushroomed, new housing projects and schools were constructed, the airport was expanded and modernized, streets were widened, older malls were repaired and new ones were built, and buildings were cleaned up. In 2006, after the Sandinista National Liberation Front came back into power, literacy, health and reconstruction programs were expanded.|$|E
500|$|Under her direction, La Prensa {{continued}} {{to criticize the}} government and its policies despite threats and government-forced shutdowns. When Daniel Ortega announced that elections would be held in 1990, Chamorro {{was selected as the}} candidate for the opposition group known as the <b>National</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>Union</b> ( [...] , UNO). This 14-party alliance ranged from conservatives and liberals to communists and because of idealistic differences had difficulty in devising any political platform other than a promise to end the war. Despite polls indicating a victory for the incumbent Sandinista President Ortega, Chamorro won the election on 25 February 1990, becoming the first elected female head of state in the Americas.|$|E
500|$|From 1987, a {{conglomerate}} of 14 {{political parties}} began working {{together in the}} hope of defeating the Sandinistas should an election come about. By 1989, efforts by Costa Rican President Óscar Arias and other Central American leaders had persuaded Ortega to hold elections. He agreed not only to free elections, but to the monitoring of the process. The conglomerate of opposition, now calling itself the <b>National</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>Union</b> ( [...] , UNO) agreed upon a formula to select a consensus candidate. After five rounds of voting, Chamorro was appointed the presidential candidate for UNO. Her platform primarily consisted of two key promises: ending the civil war and ending mandatory military service. It also played heavily on her simplicity, her faith, common sense, and the image of her being the [...] "queen-mother" [...] and the wife of a martyr.|$|E

2500|$|The FSLN {{lost to the}} <b>National</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>Union</b> by 14 {{points in}} {{elections}} on February 25, 1990. ABC news had been predicting a 16-point Sandinista victory. [...] At the beginning of Violeta Chamorro's nearly 7 years in office the Sandinistas still largely controlled the army, labor unions, and courts. Her government made moves towards consolidating democratic institutions, advancing national reconciliation, stabilizing the economy, privatizing state-owned enterprises. From 1990 to 2001, Nicaragua fell from 60th to 116th {{in the world in}} terms of human development, and has become the poorest of America after Haiti, according to United Nations Development Programme.|$|E
2500|$|By 1989 the U.S.-orchestrated {{paramilitary}} war {{and economic}} isolation inflicted severe economic suffering on Nicaraguans. The Contras' supervisors knew that, like in any democratic system, {{when the economy}} declines voters usually vote the incumbents out. They also knew that Nicaraguans had been exhausted from the war's carnage, including 30,865 {{people who had been}} killed by the end of 1989. Thus by the late 1980s the internal conditions in Nicaragua had deteriorated so drastically that Washington's approach towards the 1990 elections differed greatly from 1984. Instead of managing another boycott, the Bush administration decided to promote an opposition victory. The United States, through the National Endowment for Democracy, organized a united opposition, the <b>National</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>Union</b> (Unión Nacional Opositora, UNO), out of fourteen dissimilar microparties. It then promoted UNO candidates-in particular presidential nominee Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. Washington thus [...] "micromanaged the opposition" [...] and exerted massive external pressure on the electorate. Contra attacks escalated from voter registration in October 1989 until election day. President Bush received Violeta Chamorro at the White House and promised to end the war and the economic embargo should she win.|$|E
