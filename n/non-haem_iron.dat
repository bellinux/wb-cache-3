40|$|The {{characterization}} of the hydroxylamine oxidase from the heterotrophic nitrifier Paracoccus denitrificans GB 17 indicates the enzyme to be entirely distinct from the hydroxylamine oxidase from the autotrophic nitrifier Nitrosomonas europaea. Hydroxylamine oxidase from P. denitrificans contains three to five <b>non-haem,</b> non-iron-sulphur <b>iron</b> atoms as prosthetic groups, predominantly co-ordinated by carboxylate ligands. The interaction of the enzyme with the electron-accepting proteins cytochrome C 556 and pseudoazurin is mainly hydrophobic.

40|$|International audienceThe {{continuous}} {{recycling of}} haem iron following phagocytosis and catabolism of senescent and damaged {{red blood cells}} by macrophages is a crucial process in the maintenance of systemic iron homoeostasis. However, {{little is known about}} macrophage iron handling in haemolytic states resulting from a deficiency in antioxidant defences. Our observations indicate that the recently described chronic, but moderate regenerative, haemolytic anaemia of aged SOD 1 (superoxide dismutase 1) -knockout mice is associated with red blood cell modifications and sensitivity to both intra- and extra-vascular haemolysis. In the present study, we have characterized the molecular pathways of iron turnover in the liver of Sod 1 -deficient mice. Despite iron accumulation in liver macrophages, namely Kupffer cells, we did not measure any significant change in <b>non-haem</b> liver <b>iron.</b> Interestingly, in Kupffer cells, expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in haem degradation, haem oxygenase- 1, and expression of the iron exporter ferroportin were both up-regulated, whereas the hepcidin mRNA level in the liver was decreased in Sod 1 -/- mice. These results suggest that concerted changes in the hepatic expression of iron- and haem-related genes in response to haemolytic anaemia in Sod 1 -/- mice act to reduce toxic iron accumulation in the liver and respond to the needs of erythropoiesis...|$|R
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} water-soluble gas encountered by bacteria endogenously as an intermediate of denitrification and exogenously {{as one of the}} radical species deployed by macrophages against invading pathogens. Bacteria therefore require a mechanism to detoxify NO. Escherichia coli flavorubredoxin and its associated oxidoreductase, encoded by the norV and norW genes respectively, reduces NO to nitrous oxide under anaerobic conditions. Transcription of the norVW genes is activated in response to NO by the sigma(54) -dependent regulator NorR, a member of the prokaryotic enhancer binding protein family. NorR binds co-operatively to three enhancer sites to regulate transcription of both norVW and the divergently transcribed norR gene. In the present paper, we show that disruption of any one of the three GT-(N(7)) -AC NorR binding sites in the norR-norVW intergenic region prevents both activation of norVW expression and autogenous repression of the norR promoter by NorR. We have recently demonstrated that the N-terminal GAF (cGMP-specific and -stimulated phosphodiesterases, Anabaena adenylate cyclases and Escherichia coli FhlA) domain of NorR contains a <b>non-haem</b> mononuclear <b>iron</b> centre and senses NO by formation of a mono-nitrosyl iron complex.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the quinone-binding region of PS II using exchange reactions to replace key components. Bicarbonate was replaced by formate and QB by exogenous quinones or herbicide. The effects of these changes were monitored using the ESR signals from the QA iron-semiquinone and Fe 3 + <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> components. We observed that QB binding caused characteristic changes in the Q−A ESR signal and confirmed that the characteristics of Q−A depend on bicarbonate binding. The <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> was oxidised only under conditions where bicarbonate was bound. The characteristics of bicarbonate binding were observed in Phormidium laminosum PS II, showing that the bicarbonate effect occurs in cyanobacteria. The results support a hypothesis which gives a central role to bicarbonate in providing the conditions for electron transfer in both cyanobacteria and higher plant PS II.

We therefore examined the spatial and temporal profile of changes in cortical iron and iron homeostatic proteins during pneumococcal meningitis. Infection {{was associated with a}} steady and global increase of <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> in the cortex, particularly in neuronal cell bodies of layer II and V, and in capillary endothelial cells. The <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> increase was associated with induction of haem oxygenase (HO) - 1 in neurones, microglia and capillary endothelial cells, whereas HO- 2 levels remained unchanged, suggesting that the <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> increase might be the result of HO- 1 -mediated haem degradation. Indeed, treatment with the haem oxygenase inhibitor tin protoporphyrin (which completely blocked the accumulation of bilirubin detected in HO- 1 -positive cells) completely prevented the infection-associated <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> increase. The same cells also displayed markedly increased ferritin staining, the increase of which occurred independently of HO activity. At the same time, no increase in DNA/RNA oxidation was observed in infected animals (as assessed by in situ detection of 8 -hydroxy[deoxy]guanosine), strongly suggesting that ferritin up-regulation protected the brain from iron-induced oxidative damage. Thus, although pneumococcal meningitis leads to an increase of cortical <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron,</b> protective mechanisms up-regulated in parallel prevent iron-induced oxidative damage.

40|$|The major iron binding protein (IBP) of larvalM. mordax has an {{estimated}} molecular weight (354, 000), subunit molecular weight (18, 000) and pI (5. 1) {{identical to those}} recorded previously for larvalG. australis. The IBP in larvalG. australis {{has also been shown}} to be relatively heat stable and to react immunologically with antihorse spleen ferritin. The weight of total <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> in the whole body, and both the ferritin and haemosiderin iron components, increased with increasing body weight in larvalG. australis. While the concentration of ferritin iron remained similar throughout larval life, the concentration of total <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> and haemosiderin iron increased rapidly in animals up to a body weight of 0. 1 – 0. 2 g, but thereafter rose only slowly throughout the rest of larval life. This implies that any iron in excess of the amount required for the maintenance of a constant ferritin concentration is converted into haemosiderin iron, and that once <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> has reached a particular concentration (c. 500 – 600 mgrg g– 1), the rate of iron accumulation is greatly reduced. While the larvae of bothG. australis andM. mordax had very high plasma iron levels (> 19, 000 mgrg 100 ml– 1), the former had significantly greater concentrations of iron in the whole body (702 vs. 267 mgrg g– 1) and more particularly in the nephric fold (7382 vs. 224 mgrg g– 1). A greater reservoir of <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> could facilitate the maintenance of the large amounts of haem and erythrocytic ferritin present in this species {{as a result of an}} exceptionally high haemoglobin concentration and red blood cell number.

40|$|The {{canonical}} structural motif for co-ordination of <b>non-haem</b> ferrous <b>iron</b> in metal-dependent oxygenases is {{a facial}} triad of two histidine residues and one aspartate or glutamate residue. This so-called 2 -His- 1 -carboxylate metallocentre is often accommodated in a double-stranded β-helix fold with the iron-co-ordinating residues {{located in the}} rigid core structure of the protein. At the sequence level, the metal ligands are arranged in a HXD/E [...] . H motif (where {{the distance between the}} conserved histidine residues is variable). Interestingly, cysteine dioxygenase, among a growing number of other iron(II) oxygenases, has the carboxylate residue replaced by another histidine. In the present review, we compare the properties of 3 -His and 2 -His- 1 -carboxylate sites based on current evidence from high-resolution crystal structures, spectroscopic characterization of the metal centres and results from mutagenesis studies. Although the overall conformation of the two metal sites is quite similar, the carboxylate residue seems to accommodate a slightly closer co-ordination distance than the counterpart histidine. The ability of the 2 -His- 1 -carboxylate site to fit a site-directed substitution by an alternatively co-ordinating or non-co-ordinating residue with retention of metal-binding capacity and catalytic function varies among different enzymes. However, replacement by histidine disrupted the activity in the three iron(II) oxygenases examined so far...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{relation}} between several measures of body iron and atherosclerotic disease, particularly {{acute myocardial infarction}} (AMI), is debated. This is of specific interest since iron is frequently included in supplementation and fortification of foods. We assessed the {{relation between}} dietary iron intake {{and the risk of}} non-fatal AMI. Design: Case-control study. The information was collected by interviewers using a food-frequency questionnaire tested for validity and reproducibility. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were obtained by multiple unconditional logistic regression models, including terms for energy and alcohol intakea, as well as for sociodemographic factors, tobacco and other major recognised risk factors for AMI. Setting: Milan, Italy, between 1995 and 1999. Subjects: Cases were 507 patients, below age 79 years, with a first episode of non-fatal AMI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospital for a wide spectrum of acute conditions unrelated to known or potential AMI risk factors. Results: Compared with patients in the lowest tertile of total iron intake, the OR was 0. 48 (95 % CI 0. 29 - 0. 82) for those in the highest tertile. The corresponding value for haem iron was 0. 71 (95 % CI 0. 48 - 1. 06), for <b>non-haem,</b> non-alcohol <b>iron</b> was 0. 80 (95 % CI 0. 51 - 1. 24) and for iron derived from alcoholic beverages was 0. 60 (95 % CI 0. 40 - 0. 90).

The G 277 S transferrin mutation has been implicated as a risk factor for iron deficiency in menstruating women.

Aim of the study: To undertake a pilot study to investigate the effect of carrying the G 277 S transferrin mutation on <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> absorption from a meal in young menstruating women compared to wild-type controls. Methods: Menstruating women with low iron stores (serum ferritin < 30 μg/l) or who had suffered from iron deficiency anaemia or had a family history of anaemia were recruited (n = 162). Haematological parameters were analysed, including haemoglobin, ferritin, total-iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation. <b>Non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> absorption from a meal was measured in 25 non-anaemic women either with the G 277 S/G 277 G (n = 10) or the wild type G 277 G/G 277 G (n = 15) genotype. The incorporation of stable isotopes of iron into erythrocytes was used to measure absorption. Results and Conclusions: There were no significant differences in iron status indices or <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> absorption between genotypes. However, G 277 S carriers did not show the usual inverse association between iron stores and <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> absorption.

The aims of this study were: (1) to assess iron intake, its determinants and its most important food sources and; (2) to evaluate the relation of iron intake and status in European adolescents. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Two non-consecutive 24 -h recalls were completed by a computerised tool. The socio-demographic and socio-economic data were collected by a self-reported questionnaire. Weight and height were measured. A distinction was made between haem and <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron.</b> RESULTS: The total iron intake was significantly higher among boys (13. 8 mg/day; n = 1077) than girls (11. 0 mg/day; n = 1253). About 97. 3 % of the boys and 87. 8 % of the girls met the estimated average requirement, and 72. 4 % of the boys and 13. 7 % of the girls met the recommendation for bio-available iron intake. The ratio of haem/non-haem iron intake was lower for girls than boys. Meat (19. 2; 76 %) and bread and rolls (12. 6; 3. 9 %) contributed most to total and haem iron intake. Bread and rolls (13. 8 %) and meat (10. 8 %) contributed most to <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> intake. Age, sex and body mass index were associated with iron intake. Only red blood cell concentration was significantly negatively associated with total, haem and <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> intake.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} {{the way in which}} larvae of the lamprey Geotria australis counteract the potential problems of the very high concentrations of <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> they contain and thereby avoid the deleterious effects associated with iron overload in other vertebrates. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} ascertaining whether increasing concentrations of iron are accompanied by (i) change to a less readily available form of iron and (ii) an increase in the activity of those detoxifying enzymes responsible for minimizing the production of harmful hydroxyl radicals via the Haber-Weiss reaction. The mean concentrations of haemosiderin and ferritin in larval G. australis were each far higher in the nephric fold than in either the liver or intestine, but all these concentrations were much greater than those in rat liver. Since haemosiderin releases iron far more slowly than ferritin, the iron it contains is much less readily available to catalyse the Haber-Weiss reaction. It is thus relevant that (i) <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> in the nephric fold occurred to a greater extent as large dense haemosiderin granules than as ferritin molecules and (ii) the proportion of iron in the form of haemosiderin rose with increasing concentration of total <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron.</b> A strong correlation was also recorded between the activity of superoxide dismutase in the nephric fold and the concentrations of total <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> and its haemosiderin and ferritin components. This demonstrates that enzyme detoxification of O 2. - rises with increasing amounts of iron. The exceptional iron concentrations in the nephric fold were not reflected by a greater measured activity of superoxide dismutase than that found in other tissues. However, the nephric fold was shown to contain an augmentation factor which is presumed to enhance the activity of this enzyme in vivo.

40|$|Binuclear iron {{sites with}} {{bridging}} ligands feature {{in a number}} of important <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> proteins. Haemerythrin is the respiratory protein in marine worms. In addition, there are the enzymes ribonucleotide reductase, important in DNA synthesis; purple acid phosphatases with as yet unknown function; and methane monooxygenase, from methanotropic bacteria, which catalyses the insertion of O into C-H bonds. The variety of techniques used in their structural characterization is described from an historical viewpoint. Finally, the reactivity and mechanisms of action of these proteins are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} tea on iron {{absorption}} was studied in human volunteers. Absorption from solutions of FeCl 3 and FeSO 4, bread, {{a meal of}} rice with potato and onion soup, and uncooked haemoglobin was inhibited whether ascorbic acid was present or not. No inhibition was noted if the haemoglobin was cooked. The effect on the absorption of <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> was ascribed {{to the formation of}} insoluble iron tannate complexes. Drinking tannin-containing beverages such as tea with meals may contribute to the pathogenesis of iron deficiency if the diet consists largely of vegetable foodstuffs...|$|E
40|$|Weekly {{intramuscular}} {{injections of}} 3 mg of iron as horse spleen ferritin into adult Geotria australis over 10 weeks, {{resulted in a}} progressive increase in that form of iron in the serum. However, as with control animals, the ferritin in the liver of injected lampreys consisted of one subunit type, whose M 2 (20300) differed {{from those of the}} two subunit types of horse spleen ferritin. Thus, lampreys had converted horse spleen ferritin iron into endogenous ferritin iron, presumably in their liver. Marked rises in hepatic <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> during the first 2 weeks and between weeks 8 and 10 of iron injections were accompanied by pronounced increases in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. This rise, which parallels the rise in SOD activity that occurs as iron increases during the very protracted upstream migration of G. australis, is consistent with the view that SOD protects against iron-mediated damage by removing the superoxide radical, which facilitates the formation of the highly toxic hydroxyl radical. A levelling off of the iron concentration between weeks 2 and 8 was accompanied by a decline in SOD activity, even though <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> levels were well above those of control animals. Enhanced SOD activity may therefore only be required when there is an elevated flux of iron in the liver through low-molecular-mass intermediates. A small amount of ferritin iron was converted into the more inert haemosiderin iron...|$|E
40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of iron in New Zealand beef either {{alone or}} {{as part of}} a 'typical' New Zealand meal was investigated. The solubility of iron and its in vitro absorption by mouse intestinal tissue were used to evaluate iron bioavailability. The solubility of haem and/or <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> in meat (beef longissimus muscle), vegetables and meat-plus-vegetables was investigated. Samples were cooked and then subjected to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion with pepsin followed by a combination of pancreatic enzymes and bile. Cooking at 65 °C for 90 minutes reduced the soluble iron concentration in meat by 81 % and reduced the haem iron concentration by 27 %, which coincided with a 175 % increase in <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> concentrations. However, gastrointestinal digestion increased the solubility of iron in cooked meat (333 %), vegetables (367 %) and meat-plus-vegetables (167 %). A proportion (35 %) of the haem iron in the meat was broken down by the action of pancreatic enzymes leading to a 46 % increase in <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> concentrations, although {{this was not the case}} for the meat-plus-vegetables. Validation studies showed that mouse intestinal segments mounted in Ussing chambers maintained integrity and viability, and were responsive to glucose, theophylline and carbachol. Intestinal tissue from iron deficient mice was then used in the Ussing chambers to investigate the absorption of iron from ferrous gluconate and the soluble fractions of meat, vegetables and meat-plus-vegetables after gastrointestinal digestion. Results indicated a trend towards a higher absorption of iron from meat and ferrous gluconate, compared to vegetables and meat-plus-vegetables. However, iron absorption results were difficult to interpret due to the wide variation in the data. This variation was possibly due to errors associated with the sample processing and the analysis of iron, which was by inductively coupled-mass spectroscopy. Overall, the present study showed that before estimations can be made on the bioavailability of food iron, the effects of the cooking and gastrointestinal digestion processes must be considered. Further, the use of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion followed by the use of Ussing chambers to assess intestinal absorption is a potentially valuable system for assessing mineral bioavailability...|$|E

MCD has provided significant insight {{into the nature of}} the axial donors at haem centres and, more recently, sophisticated methods for the analysis of MCD spectra have had a major impact on the study of the electronic structures of the ground states of a range of Cu, <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> and Mo-containing active sites. This detail, together with data from other complimentary spectroscopies, has {{played a major role in}} defining the chemistry underpinning the catalysis achieved by these metal centres...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of action of desferrioxamine in the inhibition of the catalysis of iron-induced oxidative damage has been ascribed to its ability to chelate available ferric ion (Kb = 1031). However, recent work has proposed that the trihydroxamate moiety of desferrioxamine can also be involved in electron transfer reactions involving the Superoxide radical, peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide mixtures and ferryl myoglobin radicals. In this study we report evidence for the ability of desferrioxamine to inhibit peroxidative damage to pathological membranes with which <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> is associated through a {{mechanism of}} action as a lipid chain breaking antioxidant, independently of its iron chelating properties...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEPR {{studies of}} bacterioferritin (BFR), an iron-storage protein of Escherichia coli [1993, Biochem. J. 292, 47 - 56. ], have {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> (III) (NHI) sites within the protein coat which {{may be involved in}} iron uptake and release. When nitric oxide was used as an EPR spin probe of the Fe(II) state of the NHI sites, two distinct mononuclear NHI species were found. Under certain conditions, an iron dimer was also observed. The reaction of phosphate with NHI species has been investigated. Results point to a function for this anion in core nucleation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of the bicarbonate effect was investigated by monitoring flash-induced pH changes. In control chloroplasts the proton yields exhibit a binary oscillation with a period of four. In CO 2 -depleted chloroplasts the binary oscillation disappears and only the period four pattern remains, which can be described by proton liberation in the water-oxidizing system. It is concluded that bicarbonate {{is involved in the}} protonation of Q 2 −B. The affinity of bicarbonate to its binding site is much lower in the presence of dithionite. It is suggested that bicarbonate exerts its influence through being a ligand for the <b>non-haem</b> <b>iron</b> between QA and QB...|$|E
