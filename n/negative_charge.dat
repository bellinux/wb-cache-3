5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a <b>negative</b> <b>charge,</b> either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a <b>negative</b> <b>charge</b> represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external field {{is caused by the}} electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net <b>negative</b> <b>charge.</b> When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanism for the}} Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction consists of nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the carbonyl or imine group. A <b>negative</b> <b>charge</b> is transferred to the heteroatom and because the sulfonium cation is a good leaving group it gets expelled forming the ring. In the related Wittig reaction, {{the formation of the}} much stronger phosphorus-oxygen double bond prevents oxirane formation and instead, olefination takes place through a 4-membered cyclic intermediate.|$|E

5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the <b>negative</b> <b>charge</b> is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E
5|$|Catalysis is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of <b>negative</b> <b>charge</b> on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E
5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a <b>negative</b> <b>charge</b> when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E
40|$|Mutant yeast actins {{were used}} to {{determine}} the role of actin's N-terminal <b>negative</b> <b>charges</b> in force generation. The thin filament was selectively removed from bovine cardiac skinned muscle fibres by gelsolin, and the actin filament was reconstituted from purified G-actin. In this reconstitution, yeast wild-type actin (2 Ac: two N-terminal <b>negative</b> <b>charges),</b> yeast mutant actins (3 Ac and 4 Ac), and rabbit skeletal muscle actin (MAc) were used. The effects of phosphate, ATP and ADP on force development were studied at 25 °C. With MAc, isometric tension was 77 % of the initial tension owing to the lack of a regulatory system. With 2 Ac, isometric tension was 10 % of the initial tension; with 3 Ac, isometric tension was 23 %; and with 4 Ac, isometric tension was 44 %. Stiffness followed a similar pattern (2 Ac < 3 Ac < 4 Ac < MAc). A similar trend was observed during rigor induction and relaxation. Sinusoidal analysis was performed to obtain the kinetic constants of the cross-bridge cycle. The results showed that the variability of the kinetic constants was ≤ 2. 5 -fold among the 2 Ac, 4 Ac and MAc muscle models. When the cross-bridge distribution was examined, there was no significant reapportionment among these three models examined. These results indicate that force supported by each cross-bridge is modified by the N-terminal <b>negative</b> <b>charges</b> of actin, presumably via the actomyosin interface. We conclude that two N-terminal <b>negative</b> <b>charges</b> are not adequate, three <b>negative</b> <b>charges</b> are intermediate, and four <b>negative</b> <b>charges</b> are necessary to generate force...|$|R

5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>charge,</b> and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, {{one more}} than the {{extremely}} stable configuration of the noble gas neon. Because of this and its low first ionization energy of 495.8 kJ/mol, the sodium atom {{is much more likely}} to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a <b>negative</b> <b>charge.</b> This process requires so little energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (4562 kJ/mol), because the 10th electron is closer to the nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the Na+ cation.|$|E
5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried <b>negative</b> <b>charge.</b> By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value {{that was more than}} a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E
40|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>charges</b> in the glycocalyx of {{red blood}} cells (RBC) and {{vascular}} endothelial cells (EC) facilitate frictionless blood flow through blood vessels. Na+ selectively shields these charges controlling surface electronegativity. The question was addressed whether the ambient Na+ concentration controls RBC-EC interaction. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) adhesion forces between RBC and endothelial glycocalyx were quantified. A single RBC, mounted on an AFM cantilever, was brought in physical contact with the endothelial surface and then pulled off. Adhesion forces were quantified (i) after enzymatic removal of <b>negative</b> <b>charges</b> in the glycocalyx, (ii) under different ambient Na+ and (iii) after applying the intracellular aldosterone receptor antagonist spironolactone. Removal of <b>negative</b> surface <b>charges</b> increases RBC-EC interaction forces. A stepwise increase of ambient Na+ from 133 to 140 mM does not affect them. However, beyond 140 mM Na+ adhesion forces increase sharply (10 % increase of adhesion force per 1 mM increase of Na+). Spironolactone prevents this response. It is concluded that <b>negative</b> <b>charges</b> reduce adhesion between RBC and EC. Ambient Na+ concentration determines the availability of free <b>negative</b> <b>charges.</b> Na+ concentrations in the low physiological range (below 140 mM) allow sufficient amounts of vacant <b>negative</b> <b>charges</b> so that adhesion of RBC to the endothelial surface is small. In contrast, Na+ in the high physiological range (beyond 140 mM) saturates the remaining <b>negative</b> surface <b>charges</b> thus increasing adhesion. Aldosterone receptor blockade by spironolactone prevents Na+ induced RBC adhesion to the endothelial glycocalyx. Extrapolation of in vitro experiments to in vivo conditions leads to the hypothesis that high sodium intake {{is likely to increase}} the incidence of thrombotic events...|$|R
50|$|All cell {{membranes}} have <b>negative</b> <b>charges</b> (Zeta potential) {{which makes it}} difficult for two cells to come close together. When opsonins bind to their targets they boost the kinetics of phagocytosis by favoring interaction between the opsonin and cell surface receptors on immune cells.

5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a <b>negative</b> <b>charge</b> on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a <b>negative</b> <b>charge.</b> The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal <b>negative</b> <b>charge</b> of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E

Since current can be the flow of either positive or <b>negative</b> <b>charges,</b> or both, a convention is needed for the direction of current that is independent {{of the type of}} charge carriers.

5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in <b>negative</b> <b>charge</b> states by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are documented.|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net <b>negative</b> <b>charge</b> of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{naturally}} occurring isotope of hydrogen, known as protium, {{has a single}} proton and no neutrons. In ionic compounds, it can take on either a positive charge, becoming a cation composed of a bare proton, or a <b>negative</b> <b>charge,</b> becoming an anion known as a hydride. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and spectrum of the hydrogen atom has {{played a key role}} in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E

5|$|While H2 is {{not very}} {{reactive}} under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements. Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative, such as halogens (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), or oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge. When bonded to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with the hydrogen of other similar molecules, a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that {{is critical to the}} stability of many biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as metals and metalloids, where it takes on a partial <b>negative</b> <b>charge.</b> These compounds are often known as hydrides.|$|E
5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>charge.</b> This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The {{two sets of}} reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, this is like a simple electric circuit, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. These enzymes are like a battery, as they perform work to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in electric potential, with the N-side having a <b>negative</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E

The solar wind magnetic field controls the direction of the thermal flow of the electrons and causes an asymmetry of the <b>negative</b> <b>charging</b> of the downstream-side surface. The <b>negative</b> <b>charging</b> and the potential drop are largest at the position where the solar wind magnetic field is perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} non-magnetized body.

General trends obtained by two-dimensional numerical simulations on double-gate (DG) structures are whenever possible qualitatively correlated with experimental data obtained on FinFETs. We show that the presence of <b>negative</b> <b>charges</b> at the gate edges while degrading the subthreshold behavior and analog figures of merit (especially for long-channel devices) can result in apparent improved control of short-channel effects and higher Gmmax.
