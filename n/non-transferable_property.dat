40|$|Abstract A proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme {{allows a}} proxy to re-encrypt a {{ciphertext}} for Alice (delegator) to a ciphertext for Bob (delegatee) without seeing the underlying plaintext. With {{the help of}} the proxy, Alice can delegate the decryption right to any delegatee. However, existing PRE schemes gener-ally suffer from {{at least one of the}} followings. Some schemes fail to provide the <b>non-transferable</b> <b>property</b> in which the proxy and the delegatee can collude to further delegate the decryption right to anyone. This is the main open problem left for PRE schemes. Other schemes assume the existence of a fully trusted private key generator (PKG) to generate the re-encryption key to be used by the proxy for re-encrypting a given ciphertext for a target delegatee. But this poses two problems in PRE schemes if the PKG is malicious: the PKG in their schemes may decrypt both original ciphertexts and re-encrypted ciphertexts (referred as the key escrow problem); and the PKG can generate re-encryption key for arbitrary delegatees without permission from the delegator (we refer to it as the PKG despotism problem). In this paper, we propose the first non-transferable proxy re-encryption scheme which successfully achieves the <b>non-transferable</b> <b>property.</b> We show that the new scheme solved the PKG despotism problem and key escrow prob-lem as well. Further, we find that the new scheme satisfies requirements of data dissemination control which seeks to control information and digital ob-jects even after they have been delivered to a legitimate recipient. We explore the potential of adopting our new scheme to achieve data dissemination con-trol and implement a non-transferable re-encryption based encrypted PC/USB file system. Performance measurements of our scheme demonstrate that non-transferable re-encryption is practical and efficient...|$|E

For the bilateral alternating-offers model, a single optimization program significantly reduces the computational burden. Furthermore, water prices and property rights result from exploiting the Second Welfare Theorem. Both issues are discussed and applied to a bilateral version of the theoretical river basin model in Ambec and Sprumont (2002). Directions for future research are provided.

40|$|Discussing {{a number}} of distinctions and {{definitions}} by Kant, Hegel, Helmholtz, Duhem, Cohen & Nagel, Bergman & Spence, Hempel, Carnap, Agazzi, and others, we propose a taxonomy of properties employed in different sciences. In the first part we discuss how properties (including relations and meta-properties) are conventionally singled out from basic characters through qualitative, comparative or quantitative concepts. We thus distinguish properties into qualitative and quantitative, and quantitative properties into distributed and undistributed, intensive and extensive. Mental properties do not differ from physical ones in being qualitative rather than quantitative, but qualitative or intensive rather than extensive. On the other hand, objective prediction functions are possible even for qualitative properties. In the second part we distinguish extensive properties into additive, additive up to the whole, and compoundable according to other functions. We thus find that quantities may be limited or unlimited, constitutive or accessory, transferable or <b>non-transferable.</b> Moreover, all <b>properties</b> may be either intrinsic or extrinsic, structural or behavioural, essential or accidental, and these distinctions {{should not be confused}} with one another. Finally, our characterization of the intensive-extensive distinction shows it is more neat and objective than granted by Hempel and Carna...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In Eurocrypt’ 98, Blaze et al. {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} proxy re-encryption (PRE). It allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a ciphertext originally intended for Alice into one which can be decrypted by Bob, without the proxy knowing the corresponding plaintext. PRE has found many applications, such as in encrypted e-mail forwarding [8], distributed secure file systems [1, 2], multicast [10]cloud computation etc. However, all the PRE schemes until now require the delegator (or the delegator and the delegatee cooperatively) to generate the re-encryption keys. We observe {{that this is not}} the only way to generate the re-encryption keys, the encrypter also has the ability to generate re-encryption keys. Based on this observation, we introduce a new primitive: PRE +, which is almost the same as the traditional PRE except the re-encryption keys generated by the encrypter. Interestingly, this PRE + can be viewed as the dual of the traditional PRE. Compared with PRE, PRE + can easily achieve the <b>non-transferable</b> <b>property</b> and message-level based finegrained delegation, while these two properties are very desirable in practical applications. We first categorize PRE + as the single-hop and multi-hop variant and discuss its potential applications, then we give the definition and security model for the single-hop PRE +, construct a concrete scheme and prove its security. Finally we conclude our paper with many interesting open problems. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of very large, diverse, complex, and distributed datasets generated from internet transactions, emails, videos, business information systems, manufacturing industry, sensors and {{internet of things}} etc., cloud and big data computation have emerged as a cornerstone of modern applications. Indeed, on the one hand, cloud and big data applications are becoming a main driver for economic growth. On the other hand, cloud and big data techniques may threaten people and enterprises’ privacy and security due to ever increasing exposure of their data to massive access. In this paper, aiming at providing secure cloud data sharing services in cloud storage, we propose a scalable and controllable cloud data sharing framework for cloud users (called: Scanf). To this end, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive, namely, PRE+, which {{can be seen as}} the dual of traditional proxy re-encryption (PRE) primitive. All the traditional PRE schemes until now require the delegator (or the delegator and the delegatee cooperatively) to generate the re-encryption keys. We observe that this is not the only way to generate the re-encryption keys, the encrypter also has the ability to generate re-encryption keys. Based on this observation, we construct a new PRE+ scheme, which is almost the same as the traditional PRE scheme except the re-encryption keys generated by the encrypter. Compared with PRE, our PRE+ scheme can easily achieve the <b>non-transferable</b> <b>property</b> and message-level based fine-grained delegation. Thus our Scanf framework based on PRE+ can also achieve these two properties, which is very important for users of cloud storage sharing service. We also roughly evaluate our PRE+ scheme’s performance and the results show that our scheme is efficient and practica for cloud data storage applications.

40|$|Encryption {{helps to}} ensure that {{information}} within a session is not compromised. Authentication and access control measures ensure legitimate and appropriate access to information, and prevent inappropriate access to such resources. While encryption, authentication and access control {{each has its own}} responsibility in securing a communication session, a combination of these three mechanisms can provide much better protection for information. This thesis addresses encryption, authentication and access control related problems in cloud and distributed environments, since these problems are very common in modern organization environment. The first one is a User-friendly Location-free Encryption System for Mobile Users (UFLE). It is an encryption and authentication system which provides maximum security to sensitive data in distributed environment: corporate, home and outdoors scenarios, but requires minimum user effort (i. e. no biometric entry, or possession of cryptographic tokens) to access the data. It makes users securely and easily access data any time and any place, as well as avoids data breach due to stolen/lost laptops and USB flash. The multi-factor authentication protocol provided in this scheme is also applicable to cloud storage. The second one is a Simple Privacy-Preserving Identity-Management for Cloud Environment (SPICE). It is the first digital identity management system that can satisfy “unlinkability”and “delegatable authentication” in addition to other desirable properties in cloud environment. Unlinkability ensures that none of the cloud service providers (CSPs), even if they collude, can link the transactions of the same user. On the other hand, delegatable authentication is unique to the cloud platform, in which several CSPs may join together to provide a packaged service, with one of them being the source provider which interacts with the clients and performs authentication, while the others are receiving CSPs which will be transparent to the clients. The authentication should be delegatable such that the receiving CSP can authenticate a user without a direct communication with either the user or the registrar, and without fully trusting the source CSP. The third one addresses re-encryption based access control issue in cloud and distributed storage. We propose the first non-transferable proxy re-encryption scheme [16] which successfully achieves the <b>non-transferable</b> <b>property.</b> Proxy re-encryption allows a third-party (the proxy) to re-encrypt a ciphertext which has been encrypted for one party without seeing the underlying plaintext {{so that it can be}} decrypted by another. A proxy re-encryption scheme is said to be non-transferable if the proxy and a set of colluding delegatees cannot re-delegate decryption rights to other parties. The scheme can be utilized for a content owner to delegate content decryption rights to users in the untrusted cloud storage. The advantages of using such scheme are: decryption keys are managed by the content owner, and plaintext is always hidden from cloud provider. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
