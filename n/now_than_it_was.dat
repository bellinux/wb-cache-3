5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's working poor. Some have embraced the Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no better <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{at the time of}} Orwell's writing.|$|E
25|$|Cyprinids {{are highly}} {{important}} food fish; they are fished and farmed across Eurasia. In land-locked countries in particular, cyprinids {{are often the}} major species of fish eaten because they make the largest part of biomass in most water types except for fast-flowing rivers. In Eastern Europe, they are often prepared with traditional methods, such as drying and salting. The prevalence of inexpensive frozen fish products made this less important <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in earlier times. Nonetheless, in certain places, they remain popular for food, as well as recreational fishing, and have been deliberately stocked in ponds and lakes for centuries for this reason.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, the International Court of Justice, {{prompted}} {{especially by}} New Zealand, has declared {{the deployment of}} nuclear weapons to be illegal. This justifies taking an even stronger stance on where they may be carried. The numbers of those weapons, and the States holding them, have increased, despite {{the end of the}} cold war. Uncertainties around the intentions of nuclear states and the location and safety of weapons have made disarmament an even more urgent priority <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the 1980s. Secondly, nuclear fuel reprocessing has gone global, with shipments of highly hazardous plutonium mixed-oxide fuel and high-level waste passing regularly between Japan and Europe, sometimes through the Tasman Sea.|$|E
500|$|During his {{lifetime}} Disraeli's opponents, {{and sometimes even}} his friends and allies, questioned whether he sincerely held the views he propounded, or whether they were adopted by him as essential to one who sought to spend his life in politics, and were mouthed by him without conviction. Lord John Manners, in 1843 {{at the time of}} Young England, wrote, [...] "could I only satisfy myself that D'Israeli believed all that he said, I should be more happy: his historical views are quite mine, but does he believe them?" [...] Blake (writing in 1966) suggested that it is no more possible to answer that question <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> then. Nevertheless, Paul Smith, in his journal article on Disraeli's politics, argues that Disraeli's ideas were coherently argued over a political career of nearly half a century, and [...] "it is impossible to sweep them aside as a mere bag of burglar's tools for effecting felonious entry to the British political pantheon." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} of terrestrial flowering plants and some consider it to be {{the smallest}}. Due its small size, petiteplant {{has been used as a}} common name. Because it is so easily overlooked, it is probably much more abundant than records indicate. It is found in moist areas, usually in soils that are sandy or derived from granite. It is common along the edges of soil-filled depressions on top of rocks. It is often seen in cemeteries and clearings for power lines. Because it is common in habitats that are maintained by humans, but not intensively cultivated, it is probably more abundant <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> naturally.|$|E

30|$|We {{often say}} that foresights are about thinking, debating and shaping the future [23, 24]. We {{requested}} the experts to engage mostly into the thinking and debating stages of foresighting. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> apparently easier {{to think and}} debate the future <b>than</b> to shape <b>it,</b> but does this imply that our anticipation of how to shape the future contains more uncertainty the longer the time perspective? Arguably, the nearer the future, the easier <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> to shape <b>it,</b> so the action space is wider a month from <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> perceived to be in 2030 +.

2500|$|In December 2007, Palin {{wrote an}} opinion column {{in which she}} {{described}} her opposition to the listing of polar bears as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, stating her position {{was based on a}} review of expert opinion. In it she stated that the polar bear population is more numerous <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> forty years ago, and [...] "there is insufficient evidence of polar bears becoming extinct in the foreseeable future." [...] Alaskan state biologists and environmental groups disagreed with Palin's position. [...] After Dirk Kempthorne, the Republican Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior listed the bear as threatened on May 14, 2008, Palin sued the federal government, claiming that the listing would adversely affect energy development in the bears' habitat off Alaska's northern and northwestern coasts, while again questioning the scientific basis for the listing.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} tour, the itinerary was expanded from the initial 12 dates to an eventual 21 dates running from 10 November in Frome until 16 December in Norwich, (with a non-tour acoustic gig at a benefit event for London's Wilton Hall venue thrown in for good measure). Likewise as {{with the previous}} tour, Ant completed the entire schedule and to further hugely positive reviews. [...] The Irish Evening Herald praised his concert of 25 November at Dublin's Vicar Street venue: [...] "He ain't like other performers, this guy. One drum kit could never be {{good enough for the}} likes of Stuart Leslie Goddard ... Plastic Surgery? A terrific opener. Stand and Deliver? Even better <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> then. Prince Charming? Terrific, as always. And hey, that Marc Bolan tribute at the end more than sealed the deal ... {{there was no time for}} chit chat. [...] Which, incidentally, pretty much sums up Adam's live performance these days: no chit chat and no messing about. A straight-up display of raw, often deafening post-punk, Adam's way of keeping the crowd happy is to play as many tunes as possible. [...] He's well aware of what the people came to hear, so he gives it to them. Better still, his voice remains in fine shape. Oh, and as for the 'Posse'? Let's just say that 'The Good, The Mad and The Lovely' is a more than suitable moniker.". The Southern Daily Echo heaped similar adulation upon the concert of 18 November 2011 at Eastleigh's Concorde Club: [...] "Adam Ant, along with his backing band of The Good, the Mad and the Lovely possee, showed he can still rock, even in his mid-50s now. We wanted to hear the greatest hits, and Adam duly delivered ... The crowd lapped it all up ... It was a brilliant evening." ...|$|E
