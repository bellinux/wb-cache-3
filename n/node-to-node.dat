5000|$|A certain {{category}} of small-world networks {{were identified as}} a class of random graphs by Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz in 1998. They noted that graphs could be classified according to two independent structural features, namely the clustering coefficient, and average <b>node-to-node</b> distance (also known as average shortest path length). Purely random graphs, built according to the Erdős-Rényi (ER) model, exhibit a small average shortest path length (varying typically as the logarithm {{of the number of}} nodes) along with a small clustering coefficient. Watts and Strogatz measured that in fact many real-world networks have a small average shortest path length, but also a clustering coefficient significantly higher than expected by random chance. Watts and Strogatz then proposed a novel graph model, currently named the Watts and Strogatz model, with (i) a small average shortest path length, and (ii) a large clustering coefficient. The crossover in the Watts-Strogatz model between a [...] "large world" [...] (such as a lattice) and a small world was first described by Barthelemy and Amaral in 1999. This work was followed by a large number of studies, including exact results (Barrat and Weigt, 1999; Dorogovtsev and Mendes; Barmpoutis and Murray, 2010).Braunstein [...] found that for weighted ER networks where the weights have a very broad distribution, the optimal path scales becomes significantly longer and scales as N1/3.|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} and efficient use of communication technologies during the disaster sce-narios is vital for the relief and rescue works {{as well as for}} the disaster affected people. During the disaster scenarios, links between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Core Network (CN) might be broken in the disaster affected areas. If the link between such affected eNodeBs can be established, the data from the user can be transported to the network via <b>node-to-node</b> communication. Thus, this utilization of cellular mobile networks for the communication during such scenarios can be a key technological achievement. The goal of this thesis is to study the possible realization of the BS of the mobile network as a sensor node during the disaster scenarios for the detection of such scenari-os and to study the possible implementation of the <b>node-to-node</b> communication be-tween the BSs for the reliable delivery of the user data to the network. This thesis exam-ines the possibility of this inter-node communication for 3 rd Generation Partnership Pro-ject (3 GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE). The merits of the LTE technology and its specifications have been deeply studied. The calculation in the analysis part shows that <b>node-to-node</b> communication is pos-sible in LTE. A probable frequency reuse plan for the <b>node-to-node</b> communication, which is proposed in this thesis, is a result of the bandwidth scalability property of LTE. The result from the theoretical analysis shows that Signal to Interference plus Noise Ra-tio (SINR) of 5. 92 dB can be achieved during such communication. This SINR value can support Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation technique with 3 / 4 or 4 / 5 code rate for the bandwidth of 2. 5 MHz. The Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology in the LTE specification helps to provide additional increase in the data rates. The simplest communication mode can provide the data rates of 1. 86 Mbps whereas 4 x 4 MIMO can provide up to 7. 5 Mbps. Further, the proposed framework can be considered as the base for the implementation of <b>node-to-node</b> communication. This master thesis work has considered LTE as a communication technology for the study of a probable communication technology during the disaster scenarios. The flexi-bility in the utilization of the bandwidth in LTE provides the possibility for the <b>node-to-node</b> communication. The utilization of frequency band in Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) also provides the possibility for the <b>node-to-node</b> communica-tion as well. However in Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), the frequency band is the limitation for implementing the <b>node-to-node</b> communication.

40|$|In this paper, the {{distributed}} <b>node-to-node</b> consensus {{problem is}} addressed {{for a class}} of linear multi-agent systems with time-varying pinning links by using relative state feedback. The coordination goal in the present work {{is to make the}} states of each follower track those of its corresponding leader asymptotically where {{only a small fraction of}} followers can sense the states of their corresponding leaders through some switched communication channels. By using tools from M-matrix theory and stability analysis of switched systems theory, it is theoretically shown that such a <b>node-to-node</b> consensus in the closed-loop multi-agent systems can be guaranteed if each follower can be directly or indirectly influenced by at least one leader over some uniformly bounded time intervals, with the inner coupling matrix as well as the coupling strength being appropriately designed.

40|$|Contact {{analysis}} {{is an important}} branch of solid mechanics. Numerical simulation using the finite element method has become the dominant approach recently {{because of the high}} nonlinearity of contact problems. In the traditional Lagrangian description for solid mechanics, the numerical nodes are attached to the material particles, making it impossible to maintain <b>node-to-node</b> contact due to independent deformation. Various node-to-segment or segment-to-segment treatments are proposed to discretize the contact interface. But some issues still exist. Specifically, mesh distortion or element entanglement may be present if deformation is large. A new <b>node-to-node</b> approach for 2 D contact/impact problems subject to finite deformation is proposed in this report to offer an alternative approach to these traditional methods, wherein <b>node-to-node</b> contact is maintained throughout the contact process. This method is based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian algorithm (ALE). One or both bodies in the two-body contact problem have an ALE mesh, which is independent of the material particles and has prescribed motion set to maintain <b>node-to-node</b> contact. The strategy of the ALE mesh motion has two steps: (1) to move nodes in the active set to maintain <b>node-to-node</b> contact (2) to smooth ALE mesh to improve mesh quality using the Laplacian or angle-based smoothing algorithm. Problems of interest in this study are contact/impact problems wherein the implicit mid-point rule is used as the primary time stepping algorithm to find the solution incrementally. In order to conserve the system energy, the persistency condition is incorporated as the contact constraint. The augmented Lagrangian method is primarily used to apply contact constraints. Non-classical Coulomb friction laws are used where friction is present. Several quasi-static and impact examples are given to demonstrate the performance and validity of the new approach. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
