5|$|A-10s of the 23rd TFW were {{deployed}} to Bridgetown, Barbados during Operation Urgent Fury, the American Invasion of Grenada. They provided air {{cover for the}} U.S. Marine Corps landings {{on the island of}} Carriacou in late October 1983, but did not fire weapons as Marines met <b>no</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division faced almost <b>no</b> <b>resistance</b> as {{they drove}} east towards Belgrade, {{capturing}} Našice, Osijek, Vinkovci and Vukovar during the day. On the night of 11/12 April, they captured Sremska Mitrovica, Ruma and secured a crossing over the Danube via an undamaged bridge near Bogojevo.|$|E
5|$|According to the Earps' {{version of}} events, {{the fight was}} in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in {{violation}} of local ordinance, aggressively threatened the lawmen and defied a lawful order to hand over their weapons. The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offering <b>no</b> <b>resistance,</b> and were shot in cold blood by the Earps. Sorting out who {{was telling the truth}} was difficult and remains so.|$|E

5|$|At 9:30p.m., the Sa'iqa company {{reported}} an Israeli armored column advancing towards the fort. Two Egyptian tanks {{on the west}} bank opened fire, forcing the Israeli tanks and armored vehicles to withdraw. The company continued eastwards, eventually reaching the crossroads, facing <b>no</b> <b>resistance</b> along the way. With the reinforcing anti-tank teams, the company established defensive positions, and el-'Abassi dispatched patrols to secure the roads leading to the fort.|$|E
5|$|Epidemics accidentally {{introduced}} by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza. These diseases, together with typhus and yellow fever, had {{a major impact on}} Maya populations. The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous New World peoples had <b>no</b> <b>resistance</b> were a deciding factor in the conquest; they decimated populations before battles were even fought. It is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E
5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly {{comparable to those}} found in neutron stars – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with <b>no</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 8 September, A Company's {{reconnaissance}} platoon was {{tasked with}} using a gun truck and scouting {{the area around}} the village of Kusonje. The platoon encountered <b>no</b> <b>resistance</b> before it reached the village, where it was ambushed by Croatian Serb troops. The platoon's gun truck was disabled and the ZNG troops abandoned it and took shelter in a nearby house.|$|E
5|$|Pritchard {{learned from}} local {{residents}} {{that about a}} mile and a half to the north there was a military camp. Not knowing whether this was Davis and his group or the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, he approached cautiously. He soon identified the camp as Davis's. At first dawn, Pritchard charged the camp, which was so surprised and overwhelmed that it offered <b>no</b> <b>resistance</b> and yielded immediately.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, he was {{commander}} of the First Infantry Division (stationed in Turnu Severin) and, later, of the Second Army Corps in Craiova. In 1912, he became a Major General, and, in 1911-1913, he was Chief of the General Staff. In the latter capacity, Averescu organized the actions of Romanian troops operating south of the Danube in the Second Balkan War (the campaign against Bulgaria, during which his troops met <b>no</b> <b>resistance).</b>|$|E

5|$|The Abbasid force met <b>no</b> <b>resistance</b> as they pillaged {{their way}} to the fortress. Once there, they began {{constructing}} siege engines and trying to fill its moat, but their progress was obstructed by the defenders’ own artillery. Then the Abbasids tried to launch a surprise night attack against a section of the fortress where there were no walls; the attack was repelled by the Byzantines, who hurled great logs, weighed with stones, against them.|$|E
5|$|The Germans invaded Hungary on Sunday, 19 March 1944, meeting <b>no</b> <b>resistance.</b> Following Hungary's {{annexation}} in 1941 {{of parts}} of Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, there were 725,000 Jews in the country, as well as over 60,000 Jewish converts to Christianity and others the Nazis counted as Jews, according to Yehuda Bauer. Most were liberal Jews and fully assimilated, nearly 30 percent were Orthodox, and a small minority were Zionists.|$|E
5|$|When the Commonwealth of Virginia seceded {{from the}} Union on May 23, the {{regiment}} {{was ordered to}} assist in the occupation of Arlington Heights and Alexandria, Virginia, directly across the Potomac River from Washington. On May 24, the regiment boarded the steamers Baltimore and Mount Vernon and was transported across the Potomac, landing at the Alexandria wharves under the guard of the gunboat Pawnee. The 11th New York was one of eight to enter Virginia, and Ellsworth's men met <b>no</b> <b>resistance</b> as they moved through the streets.|$|E

5|$|While Richard was at Mile End, the Tower {{was taken}} by the rebels. A force of rebels, {{separate}} from those operating under Tyler at Mile End, approached the castle, possibly in the late morning. The gates were open to receive Richard on his return and a crowd of around 400 rebels entered the fortress, encountering <b>no</b> <b>resistance,</b> possibly because the guards were terrified by them.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{the lead}} T-34s reached the minefield, they {{came under heavy fire}} from the fort's garrison. Soon all three tanks were either {{destroyed}} or damaged, so the combat engineers proceeded to breach the minefield on their own. Israeli aircraft began strafing and bombing the Egyptian forces for over {{two and a half hours}} while encountering <b>no</b> <b>resistance,</b> leading to the destruction of all six tanks and five vehicles. The Israelis bombed Egyptian forces at the minefield and on an area of the strip stretching two kilometers towards Port Fouad. Under fire from the air and from the fort, the attack bogged down to a complete halt before the Egyptians began to retreat. Salah ordered his battalion to assume defensive positions east of Port Fouad to repel any Israeli counterattack and to regroup.|$|E
5|$|As {{the months}} passed, and the privations in Constantinople increased, the pro-Kantakouzenos faction {{in the capital}} grew as the Empress refused even to {{consider}} negotiations. Twice agents were sent to assassinate Kantakouzenos, but they failed. The Empress eventually fell out with Patriarch John Kalekas, who was deposed in a synod on 2 February 1347. On the same night, supporters of Kantakouzenos opened the disused Golden Gate, and Kantakouzenos entered the city with 1,000 men. Meeting <b>no</b> <b>resistance,</b> his troops surrounded the Palace of Blachernae, the imperial residence, the next morning, but the Empress refused to surrender for several days, still fearful of the fate that awaited her. Kantakouzenos' men grew impatient and stormed part of the palace complex, and John V persuaded his mother to accept a settlement.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the invading army's entry into Laconia, Sparta was only lightly defended. The {{majority}} of the Spartan army had accompanied Areus on campaign in Crete, where the Lacedaimonians were supporting the polis of Gortyn. As such, Sparta must have seemed like an easy target to Pyrrhus. Arriving outside Sparta in the evening, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack immediately {{to take advantage of the}} dearth of defenders. Pyrrhus decided against launching an immediate offensive as he feared the destruction that would be wrought by his Gallic soldiers if they were to enter the city at night. Anticipating <b>no</b> <b>resistance,</b> Pyrrhus order his army to make camp and prepared to enter Sparta in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered by {{the failure}} of the English Short Parliament, the Scottish Parliament {{declared}} itself capable of governing without the king's consent, and in August 1640 the Covenanter army moved into the English county of Northumberland. Following the illness of the earl of Northumberland, who was the king's commander-in-chief, Charles and Strafford went north to command the English forces, despite Strafford being ill himself with a combination of gout and dysentery. The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years' War, had far greater morale and training compared to their English counterparts. They met virtually <b>no</b> <b>resistance</b> until reaching Newcastle upon Tyne, where they defeated the English forces at the Battle of Newburn and occupied the city, as well as the neighbouring county of Durham.|$|E
5|$|By September 1993, CANBAT 1 was {{relocated}} from Sector West to Sector South (northern Dalmatia and Lika). The UNPFROFOR mandate in Croatia expired on 31 March 1995, and the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 981 {{establishing the}} United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) instead. Sector West {{was captured by}} the HV in Operation Flash in early May 1995, with <b>no</b> <b>resistance</b> from UN peacekeepers. The main axis of the first day's HV advance was the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway, as anticipated by the planners of Operation Backstop.|$|E
