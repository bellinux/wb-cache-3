2500|$|The drug {{aprotinin}} (Trasylol, previously Bayer and now <b>Nordic</b> <b>Group</b> pharmaceuticals), is {{the small}} protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), [...] or basic trypsin inhibitor of bovine pancreas an antifibrinolytic molecule that inhibits trypsin and related proteolytic enzymes. Under the trade name Trasylol, aprotinin {{was used as a}} medication administered by injection to reduce bleeding during complex surgery, such as heart and liver surgery. Its main effect is the slowing down of fibrinolysis, the process that leads to the breakdown of blood clots. The aim in its use was to decrease the need for blood transfusions during surgery, as well as end-organ damage due to hypotension (low blood pressure) as a result of marked blood loss. The drug was temporarily withdrawn worldwide in 2007 after studies suggested that its use increased the risk of complications or death; this was confirmed by follow-up studies. Trasylol sales were suspended in May 2008, except for very restricted research use. In February 2012 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific committee reverted its previous standpoint regarding aprotinin, and has recommended that the suspension be lifted. Nordic became distributor of aprotinin in 2012.|$|E

40|$|Scots pine tar {{has been}} used for wood {{protection}} in the Nordic countries for over a millennium. Pine tar is in particular used on old traditional wooden buildings and structures and it is important for protection of cultural heritage in the Nordic countries. In the EU review program under the Biocidal Products Directive 98 / 8 /EC (BPD) pine tar was considered as a biocidal active substance (wood preservative) to be evaluated in the review program. However, it was unclear if pine tar had a sufficient biocidal efficacy to fall under the Biocidal Products Directive. In order to clarify that question the <b>Nordic</b> Biocides <b>Group</b> under the <b>Nordic</b> Chemicals <b>Group</b> decided to initiate this study on the fungicidal efficacy of pine tar. This joint Nordic project was carried out by SP Swedish National Testing and Research Institute and supervised by the <b>Nordic</b> Biocides <b>Group</b> under the <b>Nordic</b> Chemicals <b>Group.</b> The project was financed by the Nordic Council of Ministers through the <b>Nordic</b> Chemicals <b>Group,</b> Danish Environmental Protection Agency and the Directorate for Cultural Heritage of Norway...|$|R

The paper maps the current legal framework and international fisheries agreements in the North East Atlantic Ocean which forms the basis for allocation agreements. It considers the relevance of the biological status of the fish stocks and the economic situation of the coastal states in the area for the allocation of fishing rights and further proposes a dynamic allocation methodology and a decision making process including the handling of allocation conflicts.

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of "societal security" is applied {{in some other}} Nordic countries to coordinate policy and action on all (non-military) internal emergencies, terrorist, man-made or natural. It stresses a society-based rather than sovereignty-based outlook and should empower economic and social actors to help build their own security. An elite opinion survey in Iceland, spring 2008, suggests that many Icelanders would welcome such an approach {{as a way to}} update, balance, and widen ownership of national security policies. Many think it would help avoid any departmental monopoly and enhance the head of government’s coordinating role. The concept would however need major adaptation to Iceland’s threat profile - where natural disasters and economic interdependence loom larger - and in order to preserve independent non-state competences such as the volunteer rescue force. An Icelandic move in this direction could facilitate cooperation with the <b>Nordic</b> <b>group</b> but also EU and other institutions...|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing {{productions}} and the value of aquaculture is now about to pass the value of capture fisheries. Among the Nordic countries, Norway in particular has been able to create a large aquaculture industry with high growth rates over a number of years. The other Nordic countries have only had limited growth, but have a high unutilised potential. There is a need to identify opportunities and limitations for increased growth with due care for sustainability and environment. This report identifies seven focus areas with special potential for creation of a sustainable, competitive Nordic aquaculture sector. These areas are new feeds, better use and reuse of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon), value adding of by-products, technological and regional development, domestication of new species and reduction of energy consumption. The aquaculture sector with its strengths and weaknesses is described for each of the Nordic countries. The report is compiled on basis of contributions from a <b>Nordic</b> <b>group</b> of experts.
