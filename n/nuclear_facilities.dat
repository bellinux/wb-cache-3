5|$|The book {{is divided}} into 27 chapters, with a prelude, coda, {{bibliography}} and index. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, <b>nuclear</b> <b>facilities,</b> and artworks. It is written {{from the point of}} view of a science journalist with explanations and testimonies backing his predictions. There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March, the Alsos Mission reached Heidelberg, where {{important}} {{scientists were}} captured including Walther Bothe, Richard Kuhn, Philipp Lenard, and Wolfgang Gertner. Their interrogation revealed that Otto Hahn {{was at his}} laboratory in Tailfingen, while Werner Heisenberg and Max von Laue were at Heisenberg's laboratory in Hechingen, and the experimental natural uranium reactor that Heisenberg's team had built in Berlin had been moved to Haigerloch. Henceforth, {{the main focus of}} the Alsos Mission was on these <b>nuclear</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Württemberg area.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} a self-proclaimed general named Kilbaba (Mubaba in the Super NES version) seizing control of an unnamed, fictional Gulf state. Installing himself as dictator, Kilbaba quickly begins fortifying his {{position}} with military weapons and installations, including <b>nuclear</b> <b>facilities</b> with which to build bombs. The United States decides to send in a single helicopter, piloted by the player's unnamed character and aided by a co-pilot, to infiltrate and destroy Kilbaba's forces {{in a series of}} swift strikes.|$|E

5|$|Grand Coulee Dam is a {{concrete}} gravity dam on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, built to produce hydroelectric power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally {{had only two}} powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the United States by nameplate-capacity at 6,809 MW. However, in terms of yearly power production, Grand Coulee places fifth {{after a number of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>facilities</b> to the south, like Palo Verde west of Phoenix. This is because river flow varies throughout the year. For example, while the dam may generate at nameplate-capacity in the spring, decreased river flow in the fall means less power can be generated the rest of the year, resulting in a lower capacity factor.|$|E

25|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>facilities</b> {{should not}} {{jeopardise}} their safety {{in case of}} earthquakes or other hostile external events. Therefore, their seismic design is based on criteria far more stringent than those applying to non-nuclear facilities. The Fukushima I nuclear accidents and damage to other <b>nuclear</b> <b>facilities</b> that followed the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami have, however, drawn attention to ongoing concerns over Japanese nuclear seismic design standards and caused other many governments to re-evaluate their nuclear programs. Doubt has also been expressed over the seismic evaluation and design of certain other plants, including the Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant in France.|$|E

25|$|On 5 November 2012, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his {{willingness}} to mount a unilateral attack on Iran's <b>nuclear</b> <b>facilities</b> even without US support. This conflicts with experts' assessments that US support is needed {{in the form of}} the newer GBU-31 bunker busting bombs, which are required to penetrate some of Iran's reinforced <b>nuclear</b> <b>facilities</b> such as the Fordo site. Israel currently only has the GBU-28 bunker busting munitions, which are said to be insufficient. However, with the announcement by Netanyahu being made on the eve of the 2012 Presidential elections, tensions between the two allies are likely to rise.|$|E
