5|$|Unlike {{most other}} British canals, the Manchester Ship Canal was never nationalised. In 1984 Salford City Council used a {{derelict}} land grant {{to purchase the}} docks at Salford from the Ship Canal Company, rebranding the area as Salford Quays. Principal developers Urban Waterside began redevelopment work the following year, by which time traffic on the canal's upper reaches had declined {{to such an extent}} that its owners considered closing it above Runcorn. In 1993 the Ship Canal Company was acquired by Peel Holdings; as of 2014 it is owned and operated by Peel Ports, which also owns the Port of Liverpool. The company announced a £50billion Atlantic Gateway plan in 2011 to develop the Port of Liverpool and the Manchester Ship Canal as a way of combating increasing road congestion. Their scheme involves the construction of a large distribution centre to be named Port Salford and an additional six sites along the canal for the loading and unloading of freight. Peel Ports predict that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> transported along the canal could increase from the 8,000 carried in 2010 to 100,000 by 2030.|$|E

In terms of ship categories, Greece ranks first in both tankers and dry bulk carriers, fourth in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers,</b> and fifth in other ships. However, today's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s.

About 80 per cent of port freight is transported by road. A 2006 Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission study also found the number of light commercial vehicles on Melbourne roads was growing faster than the rise in cars and trucks and that this growth affects congestion, especially around retail centres.|$|E

Kota Kinabalu Port mainly handles loose/bulk cargo, while SBCP {{operates}} as a naval base for the Royal Malaysian Navy and an oil depot in addition to handling containerised cargo. In 2004, Kota Kinabalu Port handled about 3.6million tonnes of freight cargo, the third highest in the state after Sandakan Port and Tawau Port. However, it handles the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> in the state, with [...] of containers handled in 2006.

40|$|Tactical {{planning}} {{models for}} liner shipping {{problems such as}} network design and fleet deployment usually minimize the total cost or maximize the total profit subject to constraints including ship availability, service frequency, ship capacity, and transshipment. Most models in the literature do not consider slot-purchasing, multi-type containers, empty container repositioning, or ship repositioning, and they formulate the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> to transport as continuous variables. This paper develops a mixed-integer linear programming model that captures all these elements. It further examines from the theoretical point of view the additional computational burden introduced by incorporating these elements in the planning model. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate {{the effects of the}} elements on tactical planning decisions. Results demonstrate that slot-purchasing and empty container repositioning have the largest impact on tactical planning decisions and relaxing the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> as continuous variables has little impact on the decisions...|$|R

40|$|Container-based {{application}} deployments {{have received}} significant attention in recent years. Operating system virtualization based on containers {{as a mechanism}} to deploy and manage complex, large-scale software systems has become a popular mechanism for application deployment and operation. Packaging application components into self-contained artifacts has brought substantial flexibility to developers and operation teams alike. However, this flexibility comes at a price. Practitioners need to respect numerous constraints ranging from security and compliance requirements, to specific regulatory conditions. Fulfilling these requirements is especially challenging in specialized domains with large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> stakeholders. Moreover, the rapidly growing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> images to be managed due {{to the introduction of}} new or updated applications and respective components, leads to significant challenges for container management and adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Smart Brix, a framework for continuous evolution <b>of</b> <b>container</b> application deployments that tackles these challenges. Smart Brix integrates and unifies concepts of continuous integration, runtime monitoring, and operational analytics. Furthermore, it allows practitioners to define generic analytics and compensation pipelines composed of self-assembling processing components to autonomously validate and verify containers to be deployed. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach by evaluating our framework using a case study from the smart city domain. We show that Smart Brix is horizontally scalable and runtime of the implemented analysis and compensation pipelines scales linearly with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> application packages...|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{imbalances}} {{in international}} trade activities, shipping companies accumulate a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> unnecessary empty <b>containers</b> in the import-dominant ports, whilst request a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> empty <b>containers</b> in export-dominant ports. The logistics challenge to shipping companies is to better manage and control their <b>containers,</b> which consist <b>of</b> company-owned <b>containers</b> and leased containers. The multi-port empty container allocation problem {{is concerned with the}} allocation <b>of</b> empty <b>containers</b> from supply ports to demand ports. In this paper, optimal pairs of critical policies, (U, D) for one port, which are importing empty containers up to U when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> empty <b>containers</b> in the port is less than U, or exporting empty containers down to D when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> empty <b>containers</b> is larger than D, doing nothing otherwise, are adapted to multi-port case so that decision-makers can make decisions about allocating the right amounts <b>of</b> empty <b>containers</b> to the right ports at the right time. This allocation problem has been formulated and the heuristic methods are designed according to that the average cost using (u, d) policy at one port is convex in u and d. Furthermore, the examples show that, using the heuristic algorithm, the result in the inland line case is quite close to the lower bound, even the distance is not so close in the global line case...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} {{analysis of the}} planning horizon effects on empty container management for multimodal transportation networks. A distinctive aspect of our analysis is that we consider three different modes explicitly, namely truck, rail and river barge. The barge mode makes the network structure and underlying operational problem interesting, {{since it is the}} slowest and cheapest of the three modes. To analyze how the planning horizon affects the empty container flows in such a multimodal network, we develop an integer programming model. We discuss the sensitivities of initial inventory at each <b>container</b> pool, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> pools in the system, and transport mode usage to the length of planning horizon. We conduct controlled experiments using the actual Mississippi River basin network. Our results show that the application of long planning horizon (used on a rolling basis) can give a better empty container distribution for the earlier periods. The longer horizon allows better management <b>of</b> <b>container</b> outsourcing and also encourages use of cheaper but slower transportation modes, such as barge. However, the advantages of using a rolling horizon might be small for a system that has a sufficient <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>container</b> pools since such a system has small end-of-horizon effects. We finally discuss related issues that one needs to consider when determining the length of planning horizon...|$|R
