5000|$|The book {{chronicles the}} behind-the-scenes {{corporate}} battle surrounding American late-night talk shows, leading up to, and after, Johnny Carson's 1992 retirement {{as host of}} NBC's The Tonight Show. The book primarily details the power struggle between David Letterman and Jay Leno to succeed Carson as the [...] "King of Late Night", NBC choosing Leno over Letterman as the <b>next</b> <b>Tonight</b> Show host, and Letterman later moving to rival network CBS.|$|E
5000|$|Duke Street Records {{would release}} FM's <b>next</b> album, <b>Tonight</b> on vinyl and CD. This was FM's first CD release. The CD edition {{included}} five bonus tracks taken from Con-Test (tracks 1 to 4, and 6). [...] This {{acquisition of the}} rights to Con-Test led to a CD edition of the full album on Duke Street in 1987, but Duke Street did not reissue it on vinyl.|$|R
5000|$|McDonald {{had signed}} on to Vanguard Records as a solo {{performer}} and went to Nashville with Sam Charters to record his first solo album in a small studio known as Bradley's Barn. McDonald and his band were still together, but the relationship was faltering, and they would breakup soon after CJ Fish was released. McDonald was backed by well-regarded country musicians like Grady Martin in recording sessions for the album. Songs included were Guthrie favorites like [...] "Tom Joad" [...] and [...] "This Land is Your Land". Although the studio musicians {{did not know the}} compositions McDonald wanted, they learned incredibly fast. Recording for the ten tracks took only a day to complete. With the spare recording time, more country standards were completed for McDonald's <b>next</b> album, <b>Tonight</b> I'm Singing Just For You. The tracks were meant to retain the spirit of Guthrie's recordings so the songs were only adjusted to compliment McDonald's own style.|$|R
5000|$|On August 4, Fielder and {{teammate}} Manny Parra {{got into}} a scuffle in the dugout during {{a game against the}} Cincinnati Reds in which Parra was the starting pitcher. They were having a brief conversation, which led to Parra throwing his jacket down and Fielder shoving him. Fielder had to be restrained by teammates Ray Durham, Dave Bush, J. J. Hardy, Ryan Braun, and pitching coach Mike Maddux. ESPN reported that night that the dispute was over Parra heading back to the clubhouse after being pulled from the game instead of staying in the dugout to watch the Brewers bat in the <b>next</b> inning. Baseball <b>Tonight</b> also reports the exchange was started when Parra told Fielder to [...] "get off his fat ass and play defense." [...] Manager Ned Yost said reporters asking questions about the incident was as rude as [...] "going over to the neighbors' house after they've been fighting and asking about it." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our <b>next</b> single Beautiful <b>Tonight</b> being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting {{one foot in front of}} the other. The song reminds us of the early days when we put out [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|R
