Although Priangan batiks can use {{a wide range of}} colours, a {{preference}} for indigo is seen in some of its variants. <b>Natural</b> <b>indigo</b> dye made from Indigofera is among the oldest known dyes in Java, and its local name tarum has lent its name to the Citarum river and the Tarumanagara kingdom, which suggests that ancient West Java was once a major producer of <b>natural</b> <b>indigo.</b> Noted Priangan batik is produced in Ciamis, Garut, and Tasikmalaya. Other traditions include Batik Kuningan influenced by batik Cirebon, batik Banten that developed quite independently, and an older tradition of batik Baduy.|$|E

25|$|Another major, though erratic, {{export item}} was indigo dye, which was {{extracted}} from <b>natural</b> <b>indigo,</b> and {{which came to}} be grown in Bengal and northern Bihar. In late 17th and early 18th century Europe, blue clothing was favoured as a fashion, and blue uniforms were common in the military; consequently, the demand for the dye was high. In 1788, the East India Company offered advances to ten British planters to grow indigo; however, since the new (landed) property rights defined in the Permanent Settlement, didn't allow them, as Europeans, to buy agricultural land, they had to in turn offer cash advances to local peasants, and sometimes coerce them, to grow the crop. The European demand for the dye, however, proved to be unstable, and both creditors and cultivators bore {{the risk of the}} market crashes in 1827 and 1847. The peasant discontent in Bengal eventually led to the Indigo rebellion in 1859-60 and to the end of indigo production there. In Bihar, however, indigo production continued well into the 20th century; the centre of indigo production there, Champaran district, became the staging ground, in 1917, for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's first experiment in non-violent resistance against the British Raj.|$|E
2500|$|Another war of {{the blues}} {{took place at the}} end of the 19th century, between indigo and {{synthetic}} indigo, discovered in 1868 by the German chemist Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer. The German chemical firm BASF put the new dye on the market in 1897, in direct competition with the British-run indigo industry in India, which produced most of the world's indigo. In 1897 Britain sold ten thousand tons of <b>natural</b> <b>indigo</b> on the world market, while BASF sold six hundred tons of synthetic indigo. The British industry cut prices and reduced the salaries of its workers, but it was unable to compete; the synthetic indigo was more pure, made a more lasting blue, and was not dependent upon good or bad harvests. In 1911, India sold only 660 tons of <b>natural</b> <b>indigo,</b> while BASF sold 22,000 tons of synthetic indigo.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{abundance}} of colors found in the murals and other objects that correspond to the Classic Mayan period (600 - 900 A. D.), a peculiar hue captured the interest of researchers. The most well known researcher was Merwin who first identified the pigment in 1931. [1] In 1946 Gettens named the hue Maya blue, or Azul Maya, when it {{was believed to be}} found only in Mayan regions. [2] However, the pigment is encountered not only on wall paintings and pottery from ancient Mayan sites, but in many other places in Central America as well. Therefore, there are open questions as to whether there was ancient technology transfer by the Mayans to other cultures or if the other cultures discovered this technology on their own. Reconstruction of the method that pre-Hispanic artists used to create exceptional paints has been a challenge. The pigment is not a copper mineral and has no relation to natural ultramarine, ground Lapis Lazuli or Lazurite as originally thought. The Azul Maya pigment is composed of a natural clay (Palygorskite) and a <b>natural</b> dye (<b>indigo)</b> and has unprecedented stability when exposed to acid, alkalis, solvents, and bio-corrosion. This report presents the research conducted at the University of Texas El Paso (UTEP) and at the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares (ININ) that has been dedicated to the reconstruction of techniques used by Meso-american painters in the manufacture of the Maya Blue pigment.

2500|$|A {{variety of}} plants have {{provided}} indigo throughout history, but most <b>natural</b> <b>indigo</b> {{was obtained from}} those in the genus Indigofera, which are native to the tropics. [...] The primary commercial indigo species in Asia was true indigo (Indigofera tinctoria, also known as I. sumatrana). A common alternative used in the relatively colder subtropical locations such as Japan's Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan is Strobilanthes cusia. Dyer's knotweed (Polygonum tinctorum) was the most important blue dye in East Asia until the arrival of the Indigofera species from the south, which yield more dye. In Central and South America, the species grown is I. suffruticosa (añil). In Europe woad containing the same dye was used for blue-dying. Several plants contain indigo, but low concentrations make them difficult to work with and the color is then more easily tainted by other dye substances, typically leading to a greenish tinge.|$|E

30|$|The {{colorfastness}} to washing (color {{change and}} staining) showed a higher chance of commercialization in all manufactured and existing commercial denim fabrics. However, {{the results of}} colorfastness to light showed differently; the colorfastness of the denim fabrics that used the chemical dyestuff as the warp yarn was four grades above while that of the denim fabric that used the natural dyestuff was graded as grade 3 or grade 3 – 4. When compared with the existing denim fabric products (S 1, S 2), the developed denim fabrics using synthetic dyestuff as the warp yarn {{seemed to have no}} problem in merchandising. On the other hand, the colorfastness to light of the <b>indigo</b> <b>natural</b> dyestuff was lower than the chemical dyestuff, which indicated the stability against daylight was slightly lower. However, considering that denim fabric products such as jean pants and jean jackets were recognized as premium denim fabrics in which the indigo dyes gradually disappear in the course of repeated washing and dehydration, we believe that the denim fabric using the natural dyestuff as the warp is able to commercialize sufficiently.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the historic and present-day techniques employed for colouration using indigo, the oldest known natural blue dye. It has been mostly used for dyeing the popular denim jeans. Fabrics for other fashionable garments are also dyed using indigo. In recent times, {{the use of}} plant-based indigo {{has been replaced by}} its chemically indentical counterpart. This chapter begins with an outline regarding indigo formation in plants so as to highlight the chemisty involved in converting insoluble indigo into its water soluble leuco-form by reduction. this reversible conversion is critical to bring about textile colouration because only this form can be absorbed by textile fibres. Next traditional indigo dyeing and priniting methods that evolved across the globe are briefly reviewed. This is followed by a discussion on present day industrial practices. the use of alternate chemicals in teh indigo colouration process with a focus on minimising undesirable effects on the environment is highlighted. Catering to the present trend that prefers the use of natural to manufactured raw materials, a comparison between the colouring effectiveness of <b>natural</b> and synthetic <b>indigo</b> is included...|$|R
30|$|Indigotin {{is known}} {{to be one of the}} most fast natural dye since dyeing with indigo {{involves}} vat dyeing process which forms insoluble indigotin dye molecules within the fiber (Crews, 1987; Padfield & Landi, 1996). However, in a recent study on the degradation of indigotin in solution it was found that indigotin was highly susceptible to degradation by H 2 O 2 treatment with UV radiation forming isatin as main degradation product (Ahn et al., 2014). Similar oxidative degradation would have occurred by the thermal treatment of this study. It is interesting that indigotin in silk dyeing also showed a high degree of degradation by thermal treatment when the dye {{is known to}} be one of the most fast <b>natural</b> dye. Although <b>indigo</b> dye forms insoluble indigotin molecules within the fiber, the dye molecules do not have any chemical bonding sites with fiber nor it has possible sites for forming aggregates within themselves (Ahn et al., 2014). Therefore small indigotin particles are merely trapped in the amorphous area of the fiber (Ahn et al., 2014) which enable easy attack from external oxidative degradation forces.|$|R

40|$|This article {{highlights}} the hitherto unexplored varying binding modes of the deprotonated <b>natural</b> dye <b>indigo</b> (H 2 L) and its bidirectional noninnocent potential. The reaction of H 2 L with the selective metal precursor Ru-II(acac) (2) (CH 3 CN) (2) (acac(-) = acetylacetonate) {{leads to the}} simultaneous formation of paramagnetic Ru-III(acac) (2) (HL-) (1; blue solid) and diamagnetic Ru-II(acac) (2) (L) (2; red solid), which have been characterized by standard analytical, spectroscopic, and structural analysis. Crystal structures establish that the usual trans configurated and twisted monodeprotonated HL- and unprecedented cis configurated nearly planar dehydroindigo (L) bind to the {Ru(acac) (2) } metal fragment via the N-,O and N,N donors, forming six- and five-membered chelates, respectively. It also reveals the existence of intramolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen-bonding interaction between the NH proton and C=O group at the back face of the coordinated HL-, {{in addition to an}} intermolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding between the NH proton of HL- of Molecule B and oxygen atom of the nearby acac of the second molecule (Molecule A) in the asymmetric unit of 1. The specific role of the electron-rich {Ru(acac) (2) } metal fragment in stabilizing the cis-configuration of the electron-deficient L in 2 has been pointed out. Both 1 and 2 exhibit reversible one-electron oxidation and successive three reductions with varying K-c (comproportionation constant) values in the range of 10 (18) - 10 (6). The potentials for the redox processes of 2 are positively shifted with respect to those of 1. The involvement of the metal or HL-/L or mixed metal-HL-/L-based orbitals in the accessible redox processes of 1 '' and 2 '' has been analyzed by spectroelectrochemistry, EPR at the paramagnetic states, and DFT calculated MO compositions/spin density distributions. The collective consideration of the experimental results and DFT/ID-DFT data has ascertained the participation of both the metal fragment {Ru(acac) (2) } and the HL-/L in the redox processes, which in effect result in mixed electronic structural forms of 1 '' and 2 '' (n = + 1, 0, - 1, - 2, - 3) ...|$|R
