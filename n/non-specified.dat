5|$|Regardless of {{acceptance}} from major religious hierarchies, early religious objections to Darwin's theory are still used {{in opposition to}} evolution. The ideas that species change over time through natural processes and that different species share common ancestors seemed to contradict the Genesis account of Creation. Believers in Biblical infallibility attacked Darwinism as heretical. The natural theology of the early 19th century was typified by William Paley's watchmaker analogy, an argument from design still used by the creationist movement. Natural theology included a range of ideas and arguments from the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of theistic evolution were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a <b>non-specified</b> role in guiding evolution and creating humans. This position has been adopted by denominations of Christianity and Judaism in line with modernist theology which views the Bible and Torah as allegorical, thus removing the conflict between evolution and religion.|$|E

40|$|Gibson {{argued that}} illusory {{pictorial}} displays contain "inadequate" information (1966, p. 288) {{but also that}} a "very special kind of selective attention" (p. 313) can dispel the illusion -suggesting that adequate perceptual information could in fact be potentially available to observers. The present paper describes Gibson's treatment of geometrical illusions and reviews pertinent empirical evidence. Interestingly, Gibson's insights have been corroborated by recent findings of inter- and intra-observer variability in susceptibility to visual illusions {{as a function of}} culture, learning and task. It is argued that these findings require a modification of the general Gibsonian principle of perception as the detection of specifying information. Withagen and Chemero's (2009) evolutionary motivated reconceptualization of perception predicts observers' use of both specifying and <b>non-specifying</b> information and inter- and intra-observer variability therein. Based on this reconceptualization we develop an ecological approach to visual illusions that explains differential illusion effects in terms of the optical variable(s) detected.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} scheduling of resource-constrained {{maintenance and}} operations is an emerging theory that is attracting {{the attention of}} both researchers and practitioners. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to capture the uncertainty in the development of a model that schedules both preventive maintenance and operational activities. Fuzzy logic is employed to transform the human expertise into IF-THEN rules. The approach has the advantage of revealing semantic uncertainty with the associated <b>non-specifying</b> measures. The methodology applied tracks the error values in terms of results in linguistic variable. The result obtained indicates the feasibility of tracking the uncertain measures in the model discussed. Thus, the study may be applicable to both production system and transportation organizations that are engaged in both maintenance and operational activities. The research has serious implication in terms of the ability to monitor the imprecision that were introduced in the previous models. This obviously provides a more reliable framework for researchers and practitioners interested in maintenance scheduling operation. The paper is new in that, it demonstrates the application of fuzzy logic in a form that was never documented...|$|R
2500|$|Five of the demos {{created for}} Radio Wars {{were not used}} on the final product. Just over half the songs that {{appeared}} on the album were recorded in LA: [...] "Treasure Hunt", [...] "Nightingale", [...] "Ms. Bell's Song/Radio Wars Theme", [...] "Golden Web", [...] "Into the Chaos" [...] (minus the strings), and the hidden track, [...] "To LA". After the band returned from Los Angeles, they recorded [...] "It Ain't You", [...] "Let's Be Kids", and [...] "Digital Hearts" [...] at AIR Studios in London. Session musicians recorded string and brass instruments {{for a number of}} the tracks at Mayfair Studios. The last song to be recorded for Radio Wars was a 1950s style ballad entitled [...] "How Long", which Joel had written the lyrics for. The rest of the band liked it, so arrangements were made to go back into a <b>non-specified</b> London studio where they spent two days recording it. Twenty-two songs had been created by the end of their recording sessions, in July 2008. The album was mixed by Cenzo Townshend at Olympic Studios.|$|E

50|$|In 1991, game theorist Ariel Rubinstein {{described}} {{alternative ways}} of understanding the concept.

Apparently random choices are then seen as consequences of <b>non-specified,</b> payoff-irrelevant exogeneous factors. However, it is unsatisfying to have results that hang on unspecified factors.|$|E

The percentage of males to females has fluctuated but has been about 55% to 45%. In 1960, it was almost 50% male to 50% females. In 1881, the male population was predominantly in agriculture and the females were in domestic services or offices and <b>non-specified</b> occupations.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the ability}} to use the long filenames, by this time FFS {{compared}} very poorly to other available filesystems on the platforms it was available for. Apart from these extra dostypes, there are little or no functional difference between FFS and FFS2 (although some older <b>non-specified</b> bugs may have been dealt with) and should still not be used except for legacy purposes.

50|$|In {{addition}} to his work as the Chabad Shliach to Los Angeles, Raichik also continued his practice of traveling around the United States {{for a number of}} months each year to spread Judaism and pave the way for future Shluchim to that particular place. Another one of his functions as a traveling emissary of the Lubavitcher Rebbe was to collect money (known as maimed, מעמד), which were personal funds for the Rebbe's private usage.

50|$|Ngn2 has two serines, S231 and S234, {{which can}} be {{phosphorylated}} by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (Gsk3). The importance of this phosphorylation was determined by using mice that express a mutated form of Ngn2 protein which has the serines from the previously mentioned phosphorylation sites mutated into alanines, which cannot be phosphorylated. These mutant mice have a decreased number of motor neurons and an increased number of V2 interneurons, suggesting that phosphorylation is necessary for driving expression of genes related to motor neuron fate but not V2 interneuron fate and <b>non-specified</b> neural fate.|$|E

Sahelian non-denominational Muslims have demonstrated an aversion to austere religious measures.

5000|$|Understandably, Anagallis arvensis is {{less often}} used in folk {{medicine}} worldwide, than where {{it has long been}} familiar in its countries of origin. In various countries however, the plant material has been applied externally to slow-healing ulcers and wounds. It also has been applied as an expectorant and as a remedy for pruritus, rheumatism, haemorrhoids, rabies, leprosy, and snake-bite. Anagallis has been used in treatment of <b>non-specified</b> types of phthisis, and of kidney-related conditions such as dropsy and chronic nephritis. It was used as an antidepressant in ancient Greece, and to treat various mental disorders in European folk medicine, leading to the German name Gauchheil (Gauch meaning [...] "fool" [...] or [...] "cuckoo", and heil meaning [...] "heal"). Generally however, documented evidence for clinical efficacy is lacking. Anagallis arvensis also is known in homeopathy as Anagallis Arvensis Herba, and used against various rashes and nervous complaints.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout 1912, ĐSK played friendlies {{in parts}} of Austria-Hungary {{populated}} by South Slavs. First such trip outside of Sarajevo was {{to the city of}} Split where ĐSK played local side Hajduk. The first match took place on 7 April 1912 and Hajduk won, 4-1. A day later on 8 April, the teams played another match with ĐSK winning this time, 2-1. Curiosity from the Split visit was that posters announcing the two matches around the city billed ĐSK as [...] "Osman" [...] for <b>non-specified</b> reasons. This probably stemmed from the fact that [...] "ĐSK" [...] as club name was informally used even amongst its players so the Split hosts decided to make up a name for their guests' club on the spot. They seemingly found the male Muslim name Osman to be sufficiently funny and decided to print it on the posters as the club's official name.|$|E
