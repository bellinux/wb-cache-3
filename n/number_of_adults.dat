In 1998, Patton personally chaired a task force on adult education, and 18months later, the task force's recommendations were incorporated into a bill sponsored by Williams. The bill, which increased and equalized funding and tied continuing funds to successful performance by individual adult-education programs, passed both houses of the General Assembly unanimously.

Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings.

25|$|Japanese macaques live in matrilineal societies, {{and females}} {{stay in their}} natal groups for life, while males move out before they are sexually mature. Macaque groups tend to contain a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> of both sexes. In addition, a macaque troop {{contains}} several matrilines. These matrilines may exist in a dominance hierarchy with all members of a specific group ranking over members of a lower-ranking group. Temporary all-male groups also exist, composed of those that have recently left their natal groups and are about to transfer to another group. However, many males spend ample time away from any group and may leave and join several groups.|$|E

One individual was bundled relatively completely, separating it from the other bones which enabled the archaeologists to make inferences on the entire skeleton rather than individual bones. The changes noted on the bones showed clear signs of old age. This is important because older individuals are sometimes lost in the archaeological record due to the frailty of their bones.|$|E

25|$|The hairy rove beetle is {{considered}} beneficial {{in the environment}} {{because it is a}} successful scavenger and predator. However, infestation of houses has been reported by this beetle. A reason why C. maxillosus infests houses is not known for certain, but a study of rearing this beetle in the laboratory has shown that adults like to lay eggs in fresh sand and not sand that is old or contaminated. To solve the problem of infestation certain pesticides have been found to affect the adults and larvae of this beetle and can be used to control their numbers. Atroban, a chemical pesticide composed of permethrin (0.05%), decreases the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> and larvae of the family Staphylinidae. Short term reductions of this family were caused by a chemical named demethoate (0.05%). Both of these pesticides were tested on moist spots on poultry dung.|$|E
500|$|The OA {{is a part}} of the Boy Scout program. Youth {{members are}} elected by Boy Scout troops and Varsity Scout teams. To be {{eligible}} for induction, a Scout must have achieved the rank of First Class, spent at least 15 days and nights camping within the last two years (six of which at a resident camp), and gain the approval of their unit leader. Once elected, a youth must complete their Ordeal within one year. Adults who had not previously joined the Order as a youth member may become members by being nominated by the unit, district, or council committee and then approved by the lodge adult selection committee. Adults must meet the same camping requirement. In addition, at least one youth from the adult's troop or team must be elected to the OA in that year for an adult to be nominated.
