5|$|The {{consequences}} of the decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among those who}} were dismissed from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> his work to be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E
5|$|The CoE mistakenly {{believed}} that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover {{the area of the}} large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G. Gladdens purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row out of the path of the rising lake waters. In order to do this, it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel. The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled. The fireplaces, as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down. Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been {{at the base of the}} amphitheater. They were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were used to decorate the lawns of their Town and Country restaurant and motel. The chairs are still located in Rogers; however, they now sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park without any plaque or marker indicating their significance. The concrete couch was left in place at the base of the amphitheater, because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> to try to move it.|$|E

25|$|On 27 August 1803, Durutte {{received}} {{promotion to}} general of division {{in spite of}} Napoleon Bonaparte's dislike of officers from Moreau's army. He {{became a member of}} the Légion d'Honneur on 11 December 1803 and a commander of the Légion on 9 June 1804. His former relationship with Moreau, who was exiled from France, then caused trouble. When asked to put his signature on a document agreeing with Napoleon's appointment as emperor of France, Durutte remained true to his republican beliefs and refused to sign. When his officers also offered to join him in defiance, he dissuaded them so their careers would not be ruined. After this incident, apparently <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> to have anything to do with him except Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout, who gave him command of the island of Elba.

25|$|In 1900, {{when he was}} 13 years old, {{his mother}} was {{approached}} {{by one of the}} owners of the Brandon Mill and he started to play for the mill's baseball team. He was the youngest player on the team. He was paid $2.50 to play on Saturdays (equivalent to $ today). He was originally placed as a pitcher, but one day he accidentally broke another player's arm with a fastball. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> to bat against him so the manager of the team placed him in the outfield. His hitting ability made him a celebrity around town. Around that time he was given a baseball bat which he named Black Betsy. He was compared to Champ Osteen, another player from the mills who made it to the Majors. He moved from mill team to mill team in search of better pay, playing semi-professional baseball by 1905.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Richter {{talked with}} {{producers}} Frank Marshall and Neil Canton about filming {{one of his}} screenplays. Out of this meeting, Canton and Richter formed their own production company and decided that Buckaroo Banzai {{would be the first}} film. Under their supervision, Mac Rauch wrote a 60-page treatment entitled, Lepers from Saturn. They shopped Mac Rauch's treatment around to production executives who were their peers but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> to take on such unusual subject matter by two first-time producers and a first-time director. Canton and Richter contacted veteran producer Sidney Beckerman at MGM/United Artists, with whom Canton had worked before. Beckerman liked it and introduced Richter and Canton to studio chief David Begelman. Within 24 hours they had a development deal with the studio. It took Mac Rauch {{a year and a half}} to write the final screenplay and during this time, the Lepers from the treatment became Lizards and then Lectroids from Planet 10. Much of the film's detailed character histories were taken from Mac Rauch's unfinished Banzai scripts.|$|E

With the rapid evolution of his illness, doctors planned to amputate his leg but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> to take responsibility for such an act. Operated seven times, he was cared for only by Aspasia during the four weeks which lasted his agony. Under the effect of the blood poisoning, the young King suffered terribly and his cries of pain were heard in the entire Royal Palace. On 19 October he became delirious and called out for his mother. However, the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to re-enter the country. In St. Moritz, where she was exiled {{with the rest of the}} royal family, the Queen begged the Hellenic authorities to let her take care of her son but Venizelos remained adamant. Finally, Dowager Queen Olga, widow of George I, was allowed to travel alone to Athens to be with her grandson. But delayed by rough seas, she arrived two hours after the King's death, on 25 October 1920. Informed by telegram that night, other members of the royal family learned of the death with sadness.|$|E

The first film from this contract was The Fog. Initially, the second film {{that he was going to}} make to finish the contract was The Philadelphia Experiment, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt that something was missing and recalls, [...] "This was basically a straight action film.

Describing the terror Lydia causes for Zoe, a spokesperson for the serial stated: [...] "Zoe can’t believe it when Lydia admits the parachute was meant for her. As soon as she realises Lydia wanted her dead she tries to run. That’s when Lydia pulls out a knife and stabs her." [...] This led to a fight between Lydia and Charlotte who arrives with Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge). They both fight to grab the knife while an unconscious Zoe bleeds, ultimately leading to the arrest of Lydia when the police arrive. She is later charged with the murder of Sarah and the attempted murder of Zoe.

500|$|Concerned about likely Whig {{opposition}} to the coinage bill, McKay got his fellow Democrat, New Hampshire Senator Charles Atherton, to introduce the bill in the Senate on February 1, 1849—Atherton {{was chairman of the}} Senate Finance Committee. [...] McKay introduced a version of the bill into the House on February 20; debate began the same day. The dollar was attacked on ground it would be too small; the double eagle on the claim that it would be heavily abraded in circulation, and would become lightweight. [...] McKay did not respond substantively, but stated that if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> these denominations, they would be unasked-for at the Mint, and would not be coined. Pennsylvania Representative Joseph Ingersoll, a Whig, spoke against the bill, noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations. [...] Ingersoll stated that a twenty-dollar piece would be [...] "doubled into a ponderous and unparalleled size". Nevertheless, the bill providing for the issuance of the gold dollar and double eagle passed both houses by large margins, and was signed into law by President James K. Polk on March 3, 1849. According to numismatist David Lange, [...] "the double eagle was a banker's coin intended to simplify transfers of large sums between financial institutions and between nations".|$|E
500|$|Larrys {{sales were}} very poor at first, with only 4,000 copies sold upon its release. Some resellers refused {{to handle the}} game, while others refused to {{advertise}} it, and one refused to list the game on its list of best sellers. A Sierra employee quit and a potential employee refused to work on Larry. Lowe stated, [...] "My initial reaction was that I had wasted six months of my life." [...] Word-of-mouth spread quickly, however, and by the year's end, the game became a commercial success, selling over 250,000 copies. It sold over 300,000 units in total. According to Sierra's marketing director John Williams, [...] "Obviously lots of retailers were selling lots of Leisure Suit Larry, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> to admit it". It also became widely pirated, including in the Soviet Union. According to Lowe, a film adaptation was considered and he was flown to Hollywood to demonstrate the game in person. Footage from the game {{was used in the}} 1990 music video for Sailor's song [...] "The Secretary". Sierra received what Williams described as a [...] "deluge" [...] of mail opposing its release of Larry after he wrote a series of articles for Computer Gaming World discussing his company and the industry's views on adult software. However, a significant number of the game's players were women. Leisure Suit Larrys success resulted {{in a long line of}} sequels and spin-off titles.|$|E
500|$|McKay got {{his fellow}} Democrat, New Hampshire Senator Charles Atherton, to {{introduce}} the bill to authorize the gold dollar and the double eagle in the Senate on February 1, 1849—Atherton {{was chairman of the}} Senate Finance Committee. [...] McKay introduced a version into the House on February 20; debate began the same day. The dollar was attacked by congressmen from the Whig Party, then in the minority, {{on the grounds that it}} would be too small, would be counterfeited and in bad light might be mistakenly spent as a half dime, the coins being similar in size. [...] McKay did not respond substantively, but stated that if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> these denominations, they would not be called for at the Mint, and would not be coined. Pennsylvania Representative Joseph Ingersoll, a Whig, spoke against the bill, noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations, and that the idea had been repeatedly turned down, whenever considered. Another Whig, Massachusetts's Charles Hudson, related that Patterson had sent a real and a counterfeit gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to tell the difference. McKay made no answer to these claims, but others did, including New York Congressman Henry Nicoll, who assured the House that the counterfeiting allegations were greatly exaggerated. [...] The point was, he indicated, that the double eagle and gold dollar were wanted by the public, and, in the case of the gold dollar could help money circulate in small communities where banknotes were not accepted. Connecticut Representative John A. Rockwell, a Whig, tried to table the bill, but his motion was defeated. [...] The bill passed easily, and met only minimal opposition in the Senate, becoming law on March 3, 1849.|$|E
