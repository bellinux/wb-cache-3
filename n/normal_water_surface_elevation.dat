40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} layer integrated morphodynamic {{model has}} been developed to predict the hydrodynamic, sediment transport and morphological processes in a regulated reservoir. The model {{was based on an}} existing sediment transport model, with improvements being made. A bed evolution module based on the mass balance equation has been developed to determine the bed level change due to sediment transport. The horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient was equated to the depth averaged eddy viscosity, based on the horizontal velocity distribution while the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient was evaluated using the layer integrated form of the - equations. This scheme enhances the accuracy of the computed velocity and suspended sediment concentration distributions. The highly accurate ULTIMATE QUICKEST scheme was used to represent the advective terms in solving the advective-diffusion equation for suspended sediment transport. An explicit finite difference scheme has been developed for the bed sediment mass balance equation to calculate bed level changes. The numerical model was verified against laboratory data obtained from experiments in a trench and a partially closed channel. A physical model was constructed to represent the flow, sediment transport and morphodynamic processes in Hamidieh regulated reservoir. The physical model was designed based on the Froude similarity law and was undistorted. The model sediment size was determined in such a manner that the same ratio of particle fall velocity to shear velocity is maintained for both the model and prototype reservoir. Stokes law was used in calculating the particle fall velocity. The physical model results confirmed that the <b>normal</b> <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> in the reservoir should increase by up to 25 cm in order to reach the nominal flow discharge diverted to the intakes. The numerical model was then applied to the scaled physical model of the reservoir and the associated water intakes and sluice gates. Various scenarios were tested to investigate the effects of different situations of diverting flow and sediment transport regimes, as well as to establish how these operations affect the morphodynamic processes in the reservoir and the vicinity of hydraulic structures. The model predictions agreed with measured data generally well. The numerical model results revealed the possibility of forming sedimentary islands in the regulated reservoir and it is uneconomical to set up a dredging zone near the one of the intakes. In summary, the integrated numerical and physical modelling approach showed many benefits and could help to optimize time and budget for design hydraulic structures.

The series data on sea <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> is irregular waves which are a superposition of several regular waves. Therefore, <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> parameters are usually based on statistical parameters. Statistical parameter ofwater surface {{can be obtained by}} performing frequency analysis on data series of <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> elevationobtained by field measurements. The <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> can be also determined by converting dataseries of water pressure obtained by pressure sensors. In this paper, the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> that has asmall oscillation period is calculated based on two methods i. e. method of linear wave theory and methodTransform Fast Fourier (FFT). The <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> that is calculated by using linear wave theorymethod is converted directly from data series of water pressure that consists of hydrostatic pressure anddynamic pressure. FFT method has two steps to convert water pressure to become <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevation.</b> First of all data series of water pressure is fragmented into several regular waves based on their frequencies. Secondly, In order to reduce errors, water level fluctuations with high frequencies are removed from the databased on the maximum frequency that can be recorded by the measuring instrument.

40|$|Improvements in the {{resolution}} of satellite imagery have enabled extraction of <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> {{at the margins of}} the flood. Comparison between modelled and observed <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> provides a new means for calibrating and validating flood inundation models, however the uncertainty in this observed data has yet to be addressed. Here a flood inundation model is calibrated using a probabilistic treatment of the observed data. A LiDAR guided snake algorithm is used to determine an outline of a flood event in 2006 on the River Dee, North Wales, UK, using a 12. 5 m ERS- 1 image. Points at approximately 100 m intervals along this outline are selected, and the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> recorded as the LiDAR DEM elevation at each point. With a planar <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> from the gauged upstream to downstream water elevations as an approximation, the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> at points along this flooded extent are compared to their ‘expected’ value. The pattern of errors between the two show a roughly normal distribution, however when plotted against coordinates there is obvious spatial autocorrelation. The source of this spatial dependency is investigated by comparing errors to the slope gradient and aspect of the LiDAR DEM. A LISFLOOD-FP model of the flood event is set-up to investigate the effect of observed data uncertainty on the calibration of flood inundation models. Multiple simulations are run using different combinations of friction parameters, from which the optimum parameter set will be selected. For each simulation a T-test is used to quantify the fit between modelled and observed <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations.</b> The points chosen for use in this T-test are selected based on their error. The criteria for selection enables evaluation of the sensitivity of the choice of optimum parameter set to uncertainty in the observed data. This work explores the observed data in detail and highlights possible causes of error. The identification of significant error (RMSE = 0. 8 m) between approximate expected and actual observed elevations from the remotely sensed data emphasises the limitations of using this data in a deterministic manner within the calibration process. These limitations are addressed by developing a new probabilistic approach to using the observed data...|$|R
