40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to propose an indicator to assess and rank environmental problems caused by production within the food manufacturing sector of Thailand. The factors used to calculate the real benefit included the costs of natural resources, energy and transportation, fertilizer and pesticides, and sanitary and similar service. The highest environmental cost in terms of both natural resources materials and energy and transportation was ice, while the highest environmental cost for fertilizer and pesticides was coconut and palm oil. Confectionery had the highest environmental cost for sanitary and similar services. Overall, real estate gained the highest real benefit, while repair <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> <b>elsewhere</b> had the lowest real benefit for the company. If Thailand uses an indicator of environmental harm, especially within the food manufacturing sector, it could help to formulate efficient policies and strategies for the country in three areas of development, which are social, economic, and environmental development...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the long term trend of pediatric injuries in Veneto Region (North-East of Italy) over 10 years, evaluating if seasonality in injury hospitalisations exists. Regional data on hospital admissions during the period 2000 - 2009 were analysed. Injury was defined as any condition identified by the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th edition, Clinical Modification (ICD- 9 -CM) codes 800 - 999, excluding late effects from injury (ICD- 9 -CM codes 905 - 909), and complications of surgical and medical care, <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> <b>elsewhere</b> (ICD- 9 -CM code 995 - 999) in the first diagnostic field. Cyclic trends in seasonality of injuries were tested with Nam test. Thirty-five thousand seven hundred and fifty-one hospitalisations due to an injury have been recorded. Significant seasonal variation in hospitalisations for injuries was observed, with a summer to winter ratio ranging from 1. 8 for minor injuries to 2. 0 for severe injuries (p < 0. 001). The observed pattern of increased admission in the summer months should guide resource planning and implementation of preventive strategies...|$|R

40|$|C atatonia is a motor dysregulation {{syndrome}} among psychiatric asylum patients thatwas delineated in 1874. The syndrome was so well characterized {{that within}} a fewyears its prevalence among psychiatric populations was reported from 6 % to 38 %,averaging 15 % of hospitalized patients in the years since. 1 In the midâ€“ 20 th century, as psychiatric practice shifted from the asylum to the ambulatory clinic {{with an emphasis on}} psy-chotherapy and the prescription of psychotropic agents, the role of the medical examination was degraded and the recognition of catatonia languished. 2 The perceived tight bond between catato-nia and the diagnosis of schizophrenia led to the widespread assumption that catatonia is mainly a form of psychosis and is <b>not</b> appropriately <b>classified</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> 3 Interest in catatonia among clinical neu-rologistswanedwith the recognitionof cata-tonia limited to a classic retarded formwith posturing, rigidity, staring, immobility, and mutism. A recent case report in theNewEn-gland Journal ofMedicine describes a young woman with well-defined catatonia that is neither recognized nor treated except as a passing mention in the case analysis. 4 A...|$|R
