50|$|Kerr's chief legacy for {{the state}} of Oklahoma is a series of water {{projects}} and dams that made the Arkansas River into a <b>navigable</b> <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> system. During his term as governor, Kerr witnessed the devastation caused by flooding of the Arkansas River and its tributaries due to the river's shallowness, which prevented river traffic from reaching Oklahoma. His first bill in Congress created the Arkansas, White and Red River Study Commission, which planned the land and water development in this region. He died before he saw the commission's work come to fruition as the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, a series of 17 locks and dams making the waterway navigable from the Tulsa Port of Catoosa to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1970 and 1975, the Corps {{developed}} {{a plan for}} massive sea gates for the region east of New Orleans that would prevent storm surge from flowing through Lake Borgne and into Lake Pontchartrain through the Rigolets and Chef Menteur passes. Referred to as the Barrier Plan, it included a series of levees along the lake Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW), a <b>navigable</b> <b>inland</b> <b>waterway.</b> A small group, led by Luke Fontana, {{filed a lawsuit against}} the Barrier Plan in 1976 over the Corps’ Environmental Impact Study (EIS). In Save our Wetlands v Rush, the plaintiffs claimed that the Corps’ EIS did not meet the requirements of Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The court agreed with Fontana noting, among other things, that the EIS was based on obsolete data and that the Corps’ biological analysis ‘relied entirely on a single telephone conversation with a marine biologist.’ Judge Charles Schwartz issued an injunction preventing further progress on the barrier option until the Corps revised its EIS. However, the Corps did not return and, in 1980, concluded that an alternative option of higher levees providing hurricane protection was less costly, less damaging to the environment and more acceptable to local interests ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{illustrate}} the potential of using inland waterway transport (IWT) for the distribution of new passenger cars in adequate operation areas in Europe. In this context, the advantages of the currently developed car-carrier "NEWS" including a calculation of external costs are evaluated. The European Union (EU) is endowed with a <b>navigable</b> <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> network of approximately 36, 000 km. The share of freight transport is insignificant compared to other transport modes like road or rail. Opportunities to promote the modal shift favoring IWT can be found in markets that are rarely exploited by IWT - such as the transport of new passenger cars. Starting with the location of the assembly plants in the EU and the identification of car types assembled in each plant, the study defines the transport flows from the respective assembly plants to selected European countries. For the calculation of the potential, a methodology has been developed. To increase the competitiveness of IWT, a car-carrier called "NEWS" is being developed. Its significant features beyond the state-of-the-art are an active ballast tank enabling adaptable draught and an adaptable LNG-electric energy- and propulsion system increasing resource efficiency (up to 30 %), and decreasing harmful exhaust emissions. Moreover, the capacity of the ship is more than 50 % higher compared to other car-carriers on rivers such as Danube. A transport scenario of a specific transport route has been developed including the calculation of external costs such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to show the advantages of IWT and NEWS...|$|E
40|$|Hydrological {{conditions}} in the Gippsland lakes, Australia's largest <b>navigable</b> <b>inland</b> <b>waterway,</b> have changed markedly since European settlement, {{largely as a result}} of the creation in 1889 of a permanent artificial opening to the Southern Ocean at Lakes Entrance. It was proposed by E. C. F. Bird in the 1960 's that increased salinity in the Gippsland Lakes would cause Swamp Scrub communities dominated by the Swamp Paperbark Melaleuca ericifolia Sm., to replace the existing Reed communities dominated by Phragnites australis (Cav.) Trin. Ex Steud. This process seems to have been operating in one of the largest of the Ramsar-listed wetlands in the Gippsland Lakes complex, Dowd Morass State Game Reserve, where regional natural-resource managers and other stakeholders were concerned that increasing salinization, combined with changes to wetting and drying cycles, were causing changes in the floristics and condition of wetland vegetation. To test whether changes were taking place in the vegetation of Dowd Morass, we analyzed a suite of historical aerial photographs, covering the period 1964 2003, of the distribution of various plant communities in the wetland. The area of M. ericifolia-dominated Swamp Scrub increased by 72 % over the 39 year period, whereas the area of P. australis-dominated Reed communities declined by 26 %. Although such a shift is consistent with the predictions made by E. C. F. Bird's salinity-mediated model of vegetation change, it is unlikely that salinity alone was the factor responsible for the increasing dominance by M. ericifolia. Instead, it is likely that, under the conditions of near-permanent inundation in Dowd Morass, the presence of microtopographical relief played a major role in allowing Swamp Scrub to become the dominant vegetation type...|$|E
40|$|The St. Lawrence Seaway and Power Project, built cooperatively between 1954 and 1959 by Canada and the United States, is {{the largest}} <b>navigable</b> <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> {{in the world and}} the largest borderlands project ever {{undertaken}} jointly by two countries. This thesis combines diplomatic, political, and environmental history to chart the course of domestic and international negotiations, particularly in the 1945 - 1954 period, that resulted in the bilateral 1954 agreement to build the seaway. The focus is on the Canadian federal government and to a lesser extent the U. S. federal government, as well as involved state and provincial governments and their public power utilities. These negotiations are extremely revealing in terms of the history of Canadian-American relations, and this thesis also examines issues connected to North American attitudes toward water resources, state-building, high modernism, and technology in the early Cold War period. After a number of failed attempts at a cooperative waterway, in the late 1940 s the Liberal government of Louis St. Laurent began to explore the possibility of an all-Canadian seaway, and backed by widespread public support, had adopted this as policy by 1952. The drive for an all-Canadian seaway stemmed from various forms of nationalism which framed the St. Lawrence as an exclusively "Canadian" resource that was intimately tied to Canadian identity. However, the Truman administration and different American interests deemed a unilateral Canadian waterway to be an economic and national security threat to the United States, and delayed the requisite power licenses needed for Canada to undertake the transborder St. Lawrence project. Canada partly contributed to this situation by repeatedly making vague offers to leave the door open project. The Eisenhower administration also stalled Ottawa's efforts to "go it alone" until American participation was finally sanctioned by Congress in 1954 and the requisite licenses were granted. The St. Laurent government then reluctantly acquiesced to the American desire for a joint endeavour in order to maintain harmonious Canada-U. S. relations, although Canada did extract key concessions from Washington about the shape and placement of the project...|$|E

Blockade runners were built and operated by British naval interests, although by late in the war the C.S. Navy operated some. A few new vessels were built or purchased in Britain, notably the CSS Shenandoah and the CSS Alabama. These warships acted as raiders, wreaking havoc with commercial shipping.
