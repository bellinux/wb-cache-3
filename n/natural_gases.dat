25|$|An ideal {{material}} {{on which a}} temperature scale can be based is the ideal gas. The pressure exerted by a fixed volume and mass of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its temperature. Some <b>natural</b> <b>gases</b> show so nearly ideal properties over suitable temperature ranges {{that they can be}} used for thermometry; this was important during the development of thermodynamics and is still of practical importance today. The ideal gas thermometer is, however, not theoretically perfect for thermodynamics. This is because the entropy of an ideal gas at its absolute zero of temperature is not a positive semi-definite quantity, which puts the gas in violation of the third law of thermodynamics. The physical reason is that the ideal gas law, exactly read, refers to the limit of infinitely high temperature and zero pressure.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of {{individual}} compounds {{was made possible}} in the late 1990s and early 2000s with advancements in mass spectrometry. The Thermo Delta+XL transformed measurements as the first instrument capable of compound specific isotope analysis. It was then possible to look at smaller samples with more precision. Hydrogen isotope applications quickly emerged in petroleum geochemistry by measuring oil, paleoclimatology by observing lipid biomarkers, and ecology by constructing trophic dynamics. Modern advances are currently underway in the clumped isotope composition of methane after development of the carbonate thermometer. Precise measurements are also enabling focus on microbial biosynthetic pathways involving hydrogen. Ecologists studying trophic levels are especially interested in compound specific measurements for construction of past diets and tracing predator-prey relationships. Highly advanced machines are now promising position specific hydrogen isotope analysis of biomolecules and <b>natural</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{abundance}} of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in the United States {{because of the}} number of existing <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reserves and the recent advances in extracting unconventional reserves has been one of the main drivers for low <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> prices. A question arises of what is the optimal use of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> as a transportation fuel. Is it more efficient to use <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in a stationary power application to generate electricity to charge electric vehicles, compress <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> for onboard combustion in vehicles, or re-form <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> into a denser transportation fuel? This study investigates the well-to-wheels energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from various <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> to transportation fuel pathways and compares the results to conventional gasoline vehicles and electric vehicles using the US electrical generation mix. Specifically, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> vehicles running on compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> are compared against electric vehicles charged with electricity produced solely from <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> combustion in stationary power plants. The results of the study show that the dependency on the combustion efficiency of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in stationary power can outweigh the inherent efficiency of electric vehicles, thus highlighting the importance of examining energy use on a well-to-wheels basis...|$|R

40|$|China {{has become}} a net {{importer}} of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{as a result of}} rapidly increasing consumption in recent years. A production peak would exist since <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> is an exhaustible resource. As conventional <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> production peak approaches, the development of unconventional <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> is attracting increasing attention. China's unconventional <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reserves are abundant, but exploration {{is still in its infancy}} stage. Thus, with the increasing quest for low-carbon development and China's <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> price reform, studying the impacts of unconventional gas development on China's <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> supply and price reform under different scenarios has practical significance. In this paper we predict China's <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> production trends in different scenarios and forecast <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> demand. This paper concludes that the exploitation of unconventional <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> will greatly improve China's annual <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> production, and delay the production peak year. This is important for China's <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> supply security as it can decrease dependence on imported gas.
