5|$|The {{addition}} of the extra docking port caused {{the adoption of the}} Almaz-derived twin-chamber propulsion system first used on Salyut 3 and 5, with the two engine nozzleseach producing 2.9kilonewtons of thrustmounted peripherally {{on either side of the}} aft port. Salyut 6 introduced a Unified Propulsion System, with both the engines and the station's control thrusters running on unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide,</b> drawn from a common set of pressurized tanks, allowing the refueling capabilities of the visiting Progress tankers to be exploited to the maximum effect. The entire engine and fuel storage assembly was contained within an unpressurized bay at the rear of the station, which was the same diameter as the main pressurized compartment. However, the replacement of the Soyuz engine used on previous stations with the bay meant that the station kept a similar overall length to its predecessors. The main engines could not be fired if the rear docking port was in use, hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by the visiting spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Dinitrogen tetroxide, {{commonly}} referred to as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide,</b> is the chemical compound N2O4. It is a useful reagent in chemical synthesis. It forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Other oxidizers besides oxygen {{can be used}} {{to produce}} a flame. Hydrogen burning in {{chlorine}} produces a flame and in the process emits gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) as the combustion product. Another of many possible chemical combinations is hydrazine and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> which is hypergolic and commonly used in rocket engines. Fluoropolymers {{can be used to}} supply fluorine as an oxidizer of metallic fuels, e.g. in the magnesium/teflon/viton composition.|$|E
25|$|The Titan II had {{debuted in}} 1962 as the Air Force's second-generation ICBM {{to replace the}} Atlas. By using hypergolic fuels, it could be stored {{for long periods of}} time and be easily readied for launch in {{addition}} to being a simpler design with fewer components, the only caveat being that the propellant mix (<b>nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> and hydrazine) was extremely toxic compared to the Atlas's liquid oxygen/RP-1. However, the Titan had considerable difficulty being man-rated due to early problems with pogo oscillation. The launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from Cape Kennedy.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Western designs, the R-21 used a cold launch {{solid rocket}} to eject the missile from the flooded launch tube before the main motor ignited. This allowed {{missiles}} {{to be launched}} in a water depth of 40-60m. The propulsion system used an IRFNA-amine fuel, AK-27I/TG-02. AK-27I {{was a mixture of}} 73% nitric acid, 27% <b>nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide,</b> and an iodine passivant. The fuel was originally used in the Wasserfall rocket under the name TONKA-250 and consisted of 50% triethylamine and 50% xylidine. This gave the R-21 a range of , double that of first-generation sub-launched missiles. The Naval Institute Guide suggests that the range was initially 1300km, and extended to 1650km later {{in the life of the}} missile. There was a single warhead of approximately 800 kilotons.|$|E
25|$|On 14 October 2010, {{engineers}} at {{the launch pad}} first discovered a small leak in a propellant line for Discoverys orbital maneuvering system (OMS) engines. The leak was detected after they noticed a fishy smell coming from the aft of the shuttle, {{thought of as a}} sign of fuel vapor in the air. Upon inspection, the leak was found at a flange located at the interface where two propellant lines met in Discoverys aft compartment. The line carried monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) propellant, one of two chemicals (the other is an oxidizer, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide)</b> used to ignite the OMS engines. Engineers replaced an Air Half Coupling (AHC) flight cap. However, the new cap failed to solve the problem since vapor checks still showed signs of a leak. An aspirator was activated to collect the vapor at the leak-site allowing work to continue in other locations around the aft segment of Discovery.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> {{is used as}} an {{oxidizer}} in one of {{the more}} important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature. In early 1944 research on the usability of dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by German scientists, although the Nazis only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for S-Stoff (fuming nitric acid). It became the storable oxidizer of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. It is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel. One of the earliest uses of this combination was on the Titan family of rockets used originally as ICBMs and then as launch vehicles for many spacecraft. Used on the U.S. Gemini and Apollo spacecraft and also on the Space Shuttle, it continues to be used as stationkeeping propellant on most geo-stationary satellites, and many deep-space probes.|$|E

The spacecraft was designed to carry [...] of propellant and helium pressurizer for the LVA.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{propulsion}} unit was mounted above the orbiter bus.

SuperDraco engines are a much more powerful version of the Draco thrusters, which will be initially used as landing and launch escape system engines on the version 2 Dragon spacecraft, Dragon 2.|$|E
2500|$|The {{propulsion}} subsystem {{consisted of}} a 400N main engine and twelve 10N thrusters, together with propellant, storage and pressurizing tanks and associated plumbing. The 10N thrusters were mounted in groups of six on two 2-meter booms. The fuel for the system was [...] of monomethylhydrazine and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide.</b> Two separate tanks held another [...] of helium pressurant. The propulsion subsystem was developed and built by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm and provided by West Germany, the major international partner in Project Galileo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tendency}} of N2O4 to reversibly break into NO2 {{has led to}} research into its use in advanced power generation systems as a so-called dissociating gas. [...] "Cool" [...] dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated, causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight. [...] This hot nitrogen dioxide is expanded through a turbine, cooling it and lowering the pressure, and then cooled further in a heat sink, causing it to recombine into <b>nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> at the original molecular weight. [...] It is then much easier to compress to start the entire cycle again. [...] Such dissociative gas Brayton cycles {{have the potential to}} considerably increase efficiencies of power conversion equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first stage}} of the Jarvis vehicle was {{designed}} to use two Rocketdyne F-1 engines, powered by RP-1 rocket fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX); these were the same engines used by the Saturn V's first stage. The second stage would use a single Rocketdyne J-2 LOX/liquid hydrogen (LH2) engine, while the third stage was intended to utilise eight Marquardt R-4D reaction control system thrusters, fueled by a hypergolic mix of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> and monomethylhydrazine (N2O4/MMH), to provide final boost, and {{to allow for the}} deployment of multiple payloads into different orbits. Jarvis was designed to be capable of carrying payloads of up to [...] in diameter; as many as six satellites could be carried on a single rocket, and it was suggested that the Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation be deployed in this manner.|$|E
2500|$|A flame is {{a mixture}} of {{reacting}} gases and solids emitting visible, infrared, and sometimes ultraviolet light, the frequency spectrum of which depends on the chemical composition of the burning material and intermediate reaction products. In many cases, such as the burning of organic matter, for example wood, or the incomplete combustion of gas, incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red-orange glow of 'fire'. This light has a continuous spectrum. Complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single-wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame. Usually oxygen is involved, but hydrogen burning in chlorine also produces a flame, producing hydrogen chloride (HCl). Other possible combinations producing flames, amongst many, are fluorine and hydrogen, and hydrazine and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide.</b> Hydrogen and hydrazine/UDMH flames are similarly pale blue, while burning boron and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of [...] "Green Dragon".|$|E
