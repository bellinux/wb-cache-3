This finding has led him to propose new chemical links between smoking and metabolic diseases, including that <b>nornicotine</b> causes aberrant protein glycation and thus provides an unrecognized pathway {{for the development of}} the pathology of tobacco abuse; additionally <b>nornicotine</b> also catalyzes the covalent modification of certain prescription drugs such as the commonly used steroid, prednisone. These findings were crucial to his group’s publication on the glycation of the amyloid β-peptide by <b>nornicotine,</b> proposing the hypothesis that there is a fortuitous chemical dynamic between smoking and Alzheimer's disease. More recently, Janda’s group has found that <b>nornicotine</b> can also catalyze the isomerization of retinal molecules, implicating <b>nornicotine</b> in the pathology of both age-related macular degeneration as well as smoking-related developmental abnormalities.

50|$|Peak plasma {{levels of}} {{nicotine}} occur 2-10 min after smoking tobacco. Nicotine undergoes a large first-pass effect {{during which the}} liver metabolizes 80-90%. Protein binding ranges from 4.9% to 20%. The apparent volume of distribution varies between 1 and 3 l/kg. The metabolites include isomethylnicotinium ion, <b>nornicotine,</b> cotinine, and nicotine-1-N-oxide. Nicotine passes into breast milk in small quantities. In addition to nicotine, tobacco smoke contains small amounts of the alkaloids anatabine, anabasine, <b>nornicotine,</b> N-methylanabasine, anabaseine, nicotine N'-oxide, myosmine, β-nicotyrine, cotinine, and 2,3'-bipyridyl.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nornicotine</b> is an {{alkaloid}} {{found in}} various plants including Nicotiana, the tobacco plant. It is chemically similar to nicotine, {{but does not}} contain a methyl group.|$|E
50|$|NNN is a {{derivative}} of nicotine that {{is produced in}} the Curing of tobacco, in the burning of tobacco (such as with cigarettes), and in the acidic conditions of the stomach. Nicotine is converted into <b>Nornicotine</b> via Nicotine N-Demethylase (NND), an enzyme found in the tobacco plant that works by removing the methyl group from the nitrogen on the 5-membered ring of nicotine. From there, <b>Nornicotine</b> undergoes nitrosation (the conversion of organic compounds into nitroso derivatives by gaining a Nitrosonium (N=O) group) on that same nitrogen, converting it to NNN.|$|E
50|$|It {{has long}} been known that the active {{constituent}} in Australia's various Nicotiana species is nicotine. Twentieth century chemical analysis found that both nicotine and <b>nornicotine,</b> a drug four times as toxic as nicotine, are usually present in Duboisia hopwoodii, and the concentrations of these chemicals can vary widely from region to region. In one study, specimens from Western Australia and western Queensland were found to contain mainly nicotine while the active constituent of South Australian and central Australian Duboisia hopwoodii was predominantly the more toxic <b>nornicotine.</b> It has been proposed that these variations may be due to differences in rainfall, harvest season and soil salinity and acidity.|$|E
5000|$|Indigenous Australians mix {{the dried}} leaves {{of a small}} {{population}} of D. hopwoodii growing around the Mulligan River with wood ash to make a variety of pituri, the traditional Aboriginal chewing mixture. D. hopwoodii plants from this region are high in nicotine and low in the much more toxic drug <b>nornicotine,</b> whereas those found in some other parts of Australia can have very high levels of <b>nornicotine</b> and are sometimes used to contaminate water holes and stun animals to help in hunting. [...] The paleontologist Dr Gavin Young named the fossil agnathan Pituriaspis doylei after the plant, as {{he thought he might}} be hallucinating, as though under the effects of pituri, upon viewing the fossil fish's bizarre form.|$|E
50|$|Pyridine {{alkaloids}} {{are present}} in tobacco as free bases and salts. Nicotine accounts for 90-95% of the plant's pyridines with <b>Nornicotine</b> and anatabine accounting for roughly 2.5% each. Pyridyl functional groups present in minute amounts include anabasine, myosmine, cotinine and 2, 3′-bipyridyl.|$|E
50|$|Nicotine is metabolized in {{the liver}} by {{cytochrome}} P450 enzymes (mostly CYP2A6, and also by CYP2B6) and FMO3, which selectively metabolizes (S)-nicotine. A major metabolite is cotinine. Other primary metabolites include nicotine N-oxide, <b>nornicotine,</b> nicotine isomethonium ion, 2-hydroxynicotine and nicotine glucuronide. Under some conditions, other substances may be formed such as myosmine.|$|E
50|$|While no {{epidemiological}} evidence directly {{supports the}} notion that nicotine acts as a carcinogen {{in the formation of}} human cancer, research has identified nicotine's indirect involvement in cancer formation in animal models and cell cultures. Nicotine increases cholinergic signalling and adrenergic signalling in the case of colon cancer, thereby impeding apoptosis (programmed cell death), promoting tumor growth, and activating growth factors and cellular mitogenic factors such as 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Nicotine also promotes cancer growth by stimulating angiogenesis and neovascularization. In one study, nicotine administered to mice with tumors caused increases in tumor size (twofold increase), metastasis (nine-fold increase), and tumor recurrence (threefold increase). N-Nitrosonornicotine (NNN), classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 1 carcinogen, has been shown to form in vitro from <b>nornicotine</b> in human saliva, indicating <b>nornicotine</b> is a carcinogen precursor. The IARC has not evaluated pure nicotine or assigned it to an official carcinogenic classification.|$|E
5000|$|Anatabine (uh-nat-uh-been,-bin) {{is one of}} {{the minor}} {{alkaloids}} found in plants in the Solanaceae family, which includes the tobacco plant and tomato. Commercial tobacco plants typically produce alkaloids at levels between 2% and 4% of total dry weight, with nicotine accounting for about 90% of the total alkaloid content, and the related compounds anabatine, <b>nornicotine,</b> and anabasine making up nearly all the rest. [...] These compounds are thought to be biologically active, and part of plants' natural defense system against insects.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nornicotine</b> is a {{secondary}} tobacco alkaloid that {{is produced by}} the N-demethylation of nicotine. <b>Nornicotine</b> production and accumulation in tobacco are undesirable because <b>nornicotine</b> serves as the precursor in the synthesis of the well characterized carcinogen N′-nitrosonornicotine during the curing and processing of tobacco. Although <b>nornicotine</b> is typically a minor alkaloid in tobacco plants, in many tobacco populations {{a high percentage of}} individuals can be found that convert a substantial proportion of the nicotine to <b>nornicotine</b> during leaf senescence and curing. We used a microarray-based strategy to identify genes that are differentially regulated between closely related tobacco lines that accumulate either nicotine (nonconverters) or <b>nornicotine</b> (converters) as the predominant alkaloid in the cured leaf. These experiments led to the identification of a small number of closely related cytochrome P 450 genes, designated the CYP 82 E 2 family, whose collective transcript levels were consistently higher in converter versus nonconverter tobacco lines. RNA interference-induced silencing of the CYP 82 E 2 gene family suppressed the synthesis of <b>nornicotine</b> in strong converter plants to levels similar to that observed in nonconverter individuals. Although each of the six identified members of the P 450 family share > 90 % nucleotide sequence identity, sense expression of three selected isoforms revealed that only one (CYP 82 E 4 v 1) was involved in the conversion of nicotine to <b>nornicotine.</b> Yeast expression analysis revealed that CYP 82 E 4 v 1 functions as a nicotine demethylase. Identification of the gene(s) responsible for nicotine demethylation provides a potentially powerful tool toward efforts to minimize <b>nornicotine</b> levels, and thereby N′-nitrosonornicotine formation, in tobacco products...|$|E

40|$|The interoceptive {{stimulus}} {{effects of}} nicotine acquire control over behavior. This observation, among others, {{suggests that the}} stimulus effects of nicotine are important {{in the development and}} tenacity of tobacco dependence. Despite this importance, there has been little research examining whether non-reinforced presentations (extinction) of a ligand that share stimulus effects of nicotine will weaken responding controlled by nicotine. Rats were trained to discriminate nicotine (0. 4 mg/kg) from saline using a discriminated goal-tracking task in which nicotine signaled intermittent access to sucrose; sucrose was withheld on saline sessions. Experiment 1 examined substitution for nicotine by ABT- 418, <b>nornicotine,</b> epibatidine, varenicline, or cytisine in 4 -min extinction tests. Experiments 2 to 5 [low dose nicotine (0. 05 mg/kg), ABT- 418, <b>nornicotine,</b> or varenicline, respectively] examined whether substitution for nicotine would persist if extinction tests were increased to 20 min and repeated daily for 6 days. Finally, generalization of this extinction back to the nicotine training stimulus was assessed. Full substitution in brief 4 -min extinction tests was seen for ABT- 418, <b>nornicotine,</b> epibatidine, varenicline, and cytisine. Low-dose nicotine, ABT- 418, <b>nornicotine,</b> and varenicline, evoked only a partial ‘nicotine-like’ response in the first 20 -min extinction test. With repeated extinction, only low-dose nicotine, <b>nornicotine,</b> and varenicline continued to substitute. Extinction with <b>nornicotine</b> and varenicline transferred back to nicotine as indicated by a partial conditioned response to the training stimulus. Interpretations regarding ‘nicotine-like’ effects of a ligand depend {{on the nature of the}} test. Understanding the processes mediating transfer of extinction learning with potential pharmacotherapies may reveal new treatment targets...|$|E
40|$|Nicotine or <b>nornicotine</b> enriched with stable {{isotopes}} {{in either}} the N?-methyl group or the pyrrolidine-N were fed to Nicotiana plumbaginifolia suspension cell cultures that do not form endogenous nicotine. The metabolism of these compounds was investigated by analysing the incorporation of isotope into other alkaloids using gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS). Nicotine metabolism primarily resulted in the accumulation of <b>nornicotine,</b> the N?-demethylation product. In addition, six minor metabolites appeared {{during the course of}} nicotine metabolism, four of which were identified as cotinine, myosmine, N?-formylnornicotine and N?-carboethoxynornicotine. While cotinine was formed from [13 C, 2 H 3 -methyl]nicotine without dilution of label, N?-formylnornicotine was labelled at only about 6 % of the level of nicotine and N?-carboethoxynornicotine was unlabelled. Feeding with [1 ?- 15 N]nornicotine resulted in incorporation without dilution of label into both N?-formylnornicotine and N?-carboethoxynornicotine. This pattern strongly indicates that, while <b>nornicotine</b> and cotinine are derived directly from nicotine, N?-formylnornicotine and N?-carboethoxynornicotine are metabolites of <b>nornicotine.</b> Thus, it is directly demonstrated that N?-formylnornicotine is not an intermediate in nicotine demethylation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated that neonicotinoid insecticides {{were able to}} act as agonists of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed at the synapse between the cercal nerve XI and the giant interneurons, in the sixth abdominal ganglion. In this work, we demonstrated that nicotinoids such as <b>nornicotine</b> acted as an agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed at cercal afferent/giant interneurons while cotinine was a poor agonist. Indeed, <b>nornicotine</b> induced a ganglionic depolarization which was blocked by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine. In addition, we found that pretreatment of the sixth abdominal ganglion with 1 and 10 muM <b>nornicotine</b> and cotinine had no significant effect on acetylcholine and nicotine-induced depolarization. But pretreatment with 1 and 10 muM acetamiprid and imidacloprid had a strong effect. 1 and 10 muM acetamiprid completely blocked acetylcholine-induced depolarization, whereas imidacloprid had a partial effect. The present work therefore suggests, in agreement with previous studies, that <b>nornicotine</b> and cotinine bind to distinct cockroach postsynaptic nAChRs, whereas acetamiprid and imidacloprid have competitive effects with acetylcholine and nicotine on ganglionic depolarization...|$|E
40|$|Herbivory in some Nicotiana {{species is}} known to induce {{alkaloid}} production. This study examined herbivore-induced defenses in the nornicotine-rich African tobacco N. africana, the only Nicotiana species indigenous to Africa. We tested the predictions that: 1) N. africana will have high constitutive levels of leaf, flower and nectar alkaloids; 2) leaf herbivory by the African bollworm Helicoverpa armigera will induce increased alkaloid levels in leaves, flowers and nectar; and 3) increased alkaloid concentrations in herbivore-damaged plants will negatively affect larval growth. We grew N. africana in large pots in a greenhouse and exposed flowering plants to densities of one, three and six fourth-instar larvae of H. armigera, for four days. Leaves, flowers and nectar were analyzed for nicotine, <b>nornicotine</b> and anabasine. The principal leaf alkaloid was <b>nornicotine</b> (mean: 28 µg/g dry mass) followed by anabasine (4. 9 µg/g) and nicotine (0. 6 µg/g). <b>Nornicotine</b> was found in low quantities in the flowers, but no nicotine or anabasine were recorded. The nectar contained none of the alkaloids measured. Larval growth was reduced when leaves of flowering plants were exposed to six larvae. As predicted by the optimal defense theory, herbivory had a localized effect and caused an increase in <b>nornicotine</b> concentrations in both undamaged top leaves of herbivore damaged plants and herbivore damaged leaves exposed to one and three larvae. The nicotine concentration increased in damaged compared to undamaged middle leaves. The <b>nornicotine</b> concentration was lower in damaged leaves of plants exposed to six compared to three larvae, suggesting that N. africana rather invests in new growth as opposed to protecting older leaves under severe attack. The {{results indicate that the}} nornicotine-rich N. africana will be unattractive to herbivores and more so when damaged, but that potential pollinators will be unaffected because the nectar remains alkaloid-free even after herbivory...|$|E
40|$|The great {{potential}} of pharmacologically active secondary plant metabolites is often limited by low yield and availability of the producing plant. Chemical synthesis of these complex compounds is often too expensive. Plant cell fermentation offers an alternative strategy to overcome these limitations. However, production in batch cell cultures remains often inefficient. One reason might be the fact that different cell types have to interact for metabolite maturation, which is poorly mimicked in suspension cell lines. Using alkaloid metabolism of tobacco, we explore an alternative strategy, where the metabolic interactions of different cell types in a plant tissue are technically mimicked based on different plant-cell based metabolic modules. In this study, we simulate the interaction found between the nicotine secreting cells of the root and the nicotine-converting cells of the senescent leaf, generating the target compound <b>nornicotine</b> in the model cell line tobacco BY- 2. When the nicotine demethylase NtomCYP 82 E 4 was overexpressed in tobacco BY- 2 cells, <b>nornicotine</b> synthesis was triggered, but only to a minor extent. However, we show here that we can improve the production of <b>nornicotine</b> in this cell line by feeding the precursor, nicotine. Engineering of another cell line overexpressing the key enzyme NtabMPO 1 allows to stimulate accumulation and secretion of this precursor. We show that the <b>nornicotine</b> production of NtomCYP 82 E 4 cells can be significantly stimulated by feeding conditioned medium from NtabMPO 1 overexpressors without any {{negative effect on the}} physiology of the cells. Co-cultivation of NtomCYP 82 E 4 with NtabMPO 1 stimulated <b>nornicotine</b> accumulation even further, demonstrating that the physical presence of cells was superior to just feeding the conditioned medium collected from the same cells. These results provide a proof of concept that combination of different metabolic modules can improve the productivity for target compounds in plant cell fermentation...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study is to examine the agonist action of <b>nornicotine</b> on insect nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors. Using patch-clamp techniques on cockroach dorsal unpaired median neurons, we demonstrated that <b>nornicotine</b> induced two distinct ionic currents named types 1 and 2. We found that alpha-bungarotoxin induced a rapid desensitization of type 1 currents whereas type 2 was completely blocked. Interestingly, types 1 and 2 currents were not blocked by the muscarinic antagonist, pirenzepine but by co-application of 1 muM pirenzepine and 0. 5 muM alpha-bungarotoxin, suggesting that muscarinic receptors modulated nornicotine-induced current amplitudes. In addition, type 1 current amplitudes were strongly reduced by 20 muM d-tubocurarine and 5 muM mecamylamine which blocked the previously identified alpha-bungarotoxin-insensitive nAChR 1 and nAChR 2 receptors. Co-application of alpha-bungarotoxin with d-tubocurarine or mecamylamine completely blocked all ionic currents. We propose that types 1 and 2 currents are associated to several nicotinic receptors subtypes, including nAChR 1 and nAChR 2 receptors. Finally, we conclude that <b>nornicotine</b> could be used as an agonist to identify distinct insect nicotinic receptors...|$|E
40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} {{formation}} of nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and of 4 -(methyl-nitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanone (NNK) from nicotine, and of NNN from <b>nornicotine</b> in the mainstream smoke of a burning cigarette. The cigarettes analyzed {{in the study were}} Kentucky reference cigarettes 1 R 4 F and 2 R 4 F, and five other cigarettes, three of them having tobaccos with low levels of tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). All cigarettes had ‘tar’ levels around 10 mg [where ‘tar’ is defined as the weight of total wet particulate matter (TPM) minus the weight of nicotine and water]. Cigarettes were smoked according to the U. S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) puffing regimen, using a 35 mL puff volume, 2 sec puff duration and 60 sec puff intervals. Three separate experiments were performed in this study to evaluate the proportion of TSNAs transferred from preexistent tobacco TSNAs and the proportion formed during smoking (pyrosynthesized). In one experiment, the results were obtained by GC/MS analysis of 13 C 3 -TSNAs formed in smoke when 13 C 3 -nicotine was intentionally added to cigarettes. Another experiment used GC analysis with chemiluminescence detection of TSNAs from smoke before and after an excess of <b>nornicotine</b> was intentionally added to cigarettes, and another experiment consisted of LC/MS/MS analysis of 2 H 4 -TSNAs formed in the smoke when 2 H 4 -nicotine and when 2 H 4 -nornicotine were intentionally added to cigarettes. The use of different analytical methods for the study of TSNA formation conveyed an additional level of confidence regarding the reliability of the results obtained. It was found that NNK was generated during smoking from nicotine with 3 × 10 - 5 % to 8 × 10 - 5 % conversion (0. 3 ppm to 0. 8 ppm conversion of the nicotine) while the result for NNN generation was not conclusive. One experiment demonstrated {{the formation of}} NNN from nicotine between 4 × 10 - 5 % and 1. 5 × 10 - 4 % (0. 4 ppm to 1. 5 ppm reported to nicotine), but another experiment did not provide proof of NNN formation, with a limit of quantitation LOQ for NNN corresponding to 5 × 10 - 5 % (or 0. 5 ppm). <b>Nornicotine</b> was proven to generate NNN, and the results for the 2 R 4 F cigarette showed 3. 3 × 10 - 3 % yield (33 ppm reported to <b>nornicotine)</b> in one experiment and 4. 6 × 10 - 3 % (46 ppm reported to <b>nornicotine)</b> in a different experiment, the agreement being very good. Using the results from this study, it was concluded that pyrosynthesis may account for about 5 % to 10 % of the NNK in mainstream smoke for a filter cigarette with the FTC ‘tar’ level around 10 mg. Pyrosynthesis may account for higher proportions of smoke TSNAs when the cigarette tobacco is low in TSNAs, since the mainstream smoke TSNAs yield from direct transfer from tobacco is small in this case. The contribution of pyrosynthesis may account for 5 % to 25 % of NNN in mainstream cigarette smoke, or potentially an even higher proportion when the tobacco blend is both low in TSNAs and high in <b>nornicotine.</b> Anabasine is typically present at low levels in tobacco and therefore the formation of nitrosoanabasine(NAB) is of less interest. Anatabine is present in different tobaccos in a range similar to that of <b>nornicotine</b> and being a secondary amine has the potential to act similarly to <b>nornicotine.</b> However, the pyrosynthesis of nitrosoanatabine (NAT) from anatabine was not evaluated in the present study. The study indicated that complete elimination of TSNAs from tobacco is unlikely to completely eliminate the TSNAs from cigarette smoke, and that high <b>nornicotine</b> tobaccos should be avoided in order to minimize the levels of NNN in cigarette smoke...|$|E
40|$|The chiral {{separation}} of minor alkaloids from tobacco {{is of interest}} because R and S isomers of these compounds have differences in their physiological activity.

The previously reported analytical techniques for the enantiomer {{separation of}} minor alkaloids have various shortcomings, such {{as the need for}} bidimensional chromatography or poor enantiomer separation. A new method for the analysis of <b>nornicotine,</b> anabasine and anatabine has been developed, based on an original derivatization and a simple gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis.

The primary aims of this study were to quantify the pyridine alkaloids and investigate nicotine to <b>nornicotine</b> conversion in laboratory-grown Australian Nicotiana spp. Nicotine, <b>nornicotine,</b> anatabine, anabasine, myosmine and cotinine were quantified in fresh leaves of 24 out of the 26 recognised Australian Nicotiana taxa. Conserved regions of CYP 82 E related genes were PCR amplified in all studied taxa. The conversion process in fresh leaves was compared with that in leaves that underwent a simulated curing process for species that we identified as being high converters (N. cavicola, N. goodspeedii, N. velutina) and low converters (N. benthamiana, N. excelsior, N. gossei). Agarose gel electrophoretic analysis of CYP 82 E related genes obtained from the PCR amplification of the cDNA in fresh versus leaves with simulated curing showed about a 3 -fold increase in transcript accumulation levels in cured leaves of the high converter species, while the transcript accumulation in N. gossei and N. excelsior maintained a steady basal level and increased by a small amount in N. benthamiana. This suggests the presence of functional loci that are triggered by curing in only high converter species and indicates a potential risk for chewers of high converter species.

Although smoking also can contribute to many of these diseases, the precise mechanism by which this occurs is not known. Previously, we have demonstrated that <b>nornicotine,</b> a constituent of tobacco and metabolite of nicotine, can catalyze aldol reactions under aqueous conditions. This finding has caused us to question whether this reaction has physiological consequences. We now report that <b>nornicotine</b> causes aberrant protein glycation and catalyzes the covalent modification of certain prescription drugs such as the commonly used steroid, prednisone. Furthermore, we show that the plasma of smokers as compared with nonsmokers contains higher concentrations of nornicotine-modified proteins, suggesting an unrecognized pathway {{for the development of the}} pathology of tobacco abuse...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of nicotine to <b>nornicotine</b> by Nicotiana plumbaginifolia Viv. cells was investigated by analysing the redistribution of label during feeding experiments with (R,S) -[[2]H-methyl]nicotine, (R,S) -[[13]C-methyl]nicotine and (R,S) -[[14]C-methyl]nicotine, {{and the results}} show that the N-methyl group of nicotine can be recycled into primary metabolism. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of ethanolic extracts of cells grown in the presence of (R,S) -[[13]C-methyl]nicotine, using [1]H-[13]C correlation spectroscopy (HMQC, HMBC), revealed the presence of [3 -[13]C]serine and [[13]C-methyl]methionine. Label was also identified in a cysteinyl derivative and in several methoxylated compounds, but no evidence was obtained with either NMR or ion-trap mass spectrometry for the presence of any intermediate between nicotine and <b>nornicotine.</b> However, experiments with (R,S) -[[14]C-methyl] nicotine indicated that 70 - 75 % of the metabolised label was released as carbon dioxide. These results are consistent with a pathway in which the oxidative hydrolysis of the nicotine methyl produces an unstable intermediate, N'-hydroxymethylnornicotine, that breaks down spontaneously to <b>nornicotine</b> and formaldehyde, with the formaldehyde being metabolised either directly to formate and carbon dioxide, or through the tetrahydrofolate-mediated pathways of one-carbon metabolism. However since the key intermediate, N-hydro xymethylnornicotine, could not be detected, the possibility of a direct methyl group transfer to tetrahydrofolate cannot be excluded...|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{reports the}} first known use of gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the quantitation of five minor tobacco alkaloids (<b>nornicotine,</b> myosmine, anabasine, anatabine, and isonicoteine) in various tobacco samples. A summary of the concentrations of these minor alkaloid levels in the filler from 50 popular cigarette brands {{were found to be}} 659 - 986 /g <b>nornicotine,</b> 8. 64 - 17. 3 /g myosmine, 127 - 185 /g anabasine, 927 - 1390 /g anatabine, and 23. 4 - 45. 5 /g isonicoteine. Levels of minor alkaloids found in reference cigarettes (1 R 5 F, 2 R 4 F, 3 R 4 F, CM 4, and CM 6) as well as burley, flue-cured, oriental, reconstituted, and Nicotiana rustica and Nicotiana glauca tobacco types are also reported. Quantitation of the minor tobacco alkaloids is important because the alkaloids {{have been shown to be}} precursors of carcinogenic tobacco specific N'-nitrosamines.

40|$|The current project {{examined}} {{the ability of}} nicotine to modulate dopamine transporter (DAT) function. Initial experiments determined the dose-response for nicotine to modulate dopamine (DA) clearance in rat striatum and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) using in vivo voltammetry and determined if this effect was mediated by nicotinic receptors (nAChRs). In both striatum and MPFC, nicotine increased DA clearance in a mecamylamine-sensitive manner, indicating nAChR-mediation. The effect of acute <b>nornicotine</b> on DAT function was also determined. In contrast to nicotine, <b>nornicotine</b> in a dose-related manner decreased striatal DA clearance in a mecamylamine-sensitive manner, indicating nAChR mediation. To determine if tolerance developed to the nicotine effect nicotine, separate groups of rats were injected once daily for 5 days with nicotine or saline. DA clearance in striatum and MPFC was determined 24 hrs after the last injection. Nicotine increased DA clearance only 10 - 15 % in the group repeatedly administered nicotine, demonstrating that tolerance developed. To determine if nicotine altered striatal DAT efficiency, following nicotine injection, DAT density and maximal velocity of [3 H]DA uptake was determined usin...|$|E
40|$|The minor tobacco {{alkaloids}} <b>nornicotine,</b> anabasine, and anatabine fromNicotiana tobacum {{are known}} to possess nicotinic receptor agonist activity, although they are relatively less potent than S-(−) -nicotine, the principal tobacco alkaloid. Previous pharmacological investigations and structure-activity studies have been limited owing {{to the lack of}} availability of the optically pure forms of these minor alkaloids. We now report a 2 -step synthetic procedure for the enantioselective synthesis of the optical isomers of <b>nornicotine</b> and anabasine, and a modified procedure for the synthesis of anatabine enantiomers. These procedures involve initial formation of the chiral ketimine resulting from the condensation of either 1 R, 2 R, 5 R-(+) - or 1 S, 2 S, 5 S-(−) - 2 -hydroxy- 3 -pinanonewith 3 -(aminomethyl) pyridine followed by enantioselective C-alkylation with an appropriate halogenoalkane or halogenoalkene species, N-deprotection, and base-catalyzed intramolecular ring closure, to form the appropriate, chirally pure minor tobacco alkaloid. Using this approach, theR-(+) -andS-(−) -enantiomers of the above minor tobacco alkaloids were obtained in good overall chemical yield and excellent enantomeric excess...|$|E
