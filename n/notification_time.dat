40|$|We {{consider}} scheduling distributable real-time threads with dependencies (e. g., due to synchroniza-tion) {{in mobile}} ad hoc networks, {{in the presence}} of node/link failures, message losses, and dynamic node joins and departures. We present a distributed real-time scheduling algorithm called RTG-DS. The algo-rithm uses a gossip-style protocol for discovering el-igible nodes, node/link failures, and message losses. In scheduling local thread sections, it exploits thread slacks to optimize the time available for gossiping. We prove that RTG-DS probabilistically bounds distributed blocking times and distributed deadlock detection and <b>notification</b> <b>times.</b> Thereby, it probabilistically satis-fies end-to-end thread time constraints. We also prove that RTG-DS probabilistically bounds failure-exception <b>notification</b> <b>times</b> for failed threads (so that their par-tially executed sections can be aborted). Our simula-tion results validate RTG-DS’s effectiveness. 1...|$|R

50|$|Russia {{developed}} the original system, and its success drove {{the desire to}} develop the improved 406 MHz system. The original system was a brilliant adaptation to the low quality beacons, originally designed to aid air searches. It used just a simple, lightweight transponder on the satellite, with no digital recorders or other complexities. Ground stations listened to each satellite {{as long as it}} was above the horizon. Doppler shift was used to locate the beacon(s). Multiple beacons were separated when a computer program analysed the signals with a fast fourier transform. Also, two satellite passes per beacon were used. This eliminated false alarms by using two measurements to verify the beacon's location from two different bearings. This prevented false alarms from VHF channels that affected a single satellite. Regrettably, the second satellite pass almost doubled the average time before notification of the rescuing authority. However, the <b>notification</b> <b>time</b> was much less than a day.|$|E
5000|$|Though fairly {{uncommon}} in democracies, dictatorial regimes often declare {{a state of}} emergency that is prolonged indefinitely {{for the life of the}} regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights. In some situations, martial law is also declared, allowing the military greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. Nicole Questiaux (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive United Nations Special Rapporteurs have recommended to the international community to adopt the following [...] "principles" [...] to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles of Legality, Proclamation, <b>Notification,</b> <b>Time</b> Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf.

30|$|From {{the results}} in Fig. 8 it is also {{possible}} to see that the <b>notification</b> <b>time</b> respects the physical distance between hosts. The process that is the closest to the monitor (running on the Brazilian host) presents a <b>notification</b> <b>time</b> of approximately 1.31 s. As the physical distance between hosts increases, the <b>notification</b> <b>time</b> also increases, reaching up to approximately 2.01 s for the monitored process that runs on the New Zealand host.

40|$|This report {{presents}} information {{relating to}} a vehicle technology {{commonly referred to as}} Automatic Collision (or Crash) Notification (ACN) as well as its relevance in South Australia. The purpose of this vehicle technology is to identify that a collision has occurred and automatically relay the crash notification and location to a third party to initiate a response by emergency medical services. The potential benefit of this system may come from reductions in emergency <b>notification</b> <b>times</b> and a reduction in any uncertainty that emergency services might otherwise have regarding the location of the crash. The analysis presented in this report conservatively estimated that if ACN was fully deployed in the vehicle fleet, road crash fatalities in South Australia in the period 2008 - 2009, may potentially have been reduced by 2. 2 % - 4. 4 %.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, warning <b>notification</b> <b>time</b> for the TSM {{protocol}} shown in Figure 12 decreases by 10 ms as m is increased from 1 to 3.

Since the TSM protocol uses separate multi-hop time slots for warning message dissemination, the decrease in medium busy percentage and safety message reception rate at lower value of m does not effect the warning transmissions. The result shows that the TSM protocol is more resilient against fading maintaining nearly constant warning <b>notification</b> <b>time</b> (less than 50 ms) as the channel conditions vary. This is an improvement of 28 to 82 ms over the SB and the DV-CAST protocols at m= 1.|$|E

40|$|This {{predictive}} {{study investigated}} the effectiveness of Automatic Crash Notification (ACN) systems in reducing road fatalities, due to enabling faster emergency medical services (EMS) notification times, and therefore, the earlier provision of treatment. The cost-effectiveness associated with fleet installation of ACN systems in Australia was also evaluated. A range of data sources were used to identify the range of road fatalities that ACN systems could potentially mitigate, with urban and rural crashes analyzed separately, due to the average EMS <b>notification</b> <b>time</b> being slower for rural areas. It was established that ACN would provide an average crash-to-EMS <b>notification</b> <b>time</b> of one minute, which represented a three minute reduction in the total crash-to-hospital time for urban areas, with the corresponding reduction for rural areas being six minutes. Calculations revealed that these reductions would save an estimated 104 fatalities on Australian roads per annum (41 urban and 63 rural), assuming all vehicles were fitted with ACN. This corresponds to almost 11 % of all passenger vehicle occupant fatalities. Despite the potential for ACN to significantly influence the Australian road toll, the benefit-cost-ratio analysis indicated that without government support, the systems {{are unlikely to be}} a cost-effective option for mandatory installation in all registered passenger vehicles. It was also recommended, however, that the benefits of ACN systems should be further investigated, in order to better establish their potential to increase road safety...|$|E
40|$|Vehicular {{networks}} {{make use}} of the Roadside Units (RSUs) to enhance the communication capabilities of the vehicles in order to forward control messages and/or to provide Internet access to vehicles, drivers and passengers. Unfortunately, within vehicular networks, the wireless signal propagation is mostly affected by buildings and other obstacles (e. g., urban fixtures), in particular when considering the IEEE 802. 11 p standard. Therefore, a crowded RSU deployment may be required to ensure vehicular communications within urban environments. Furthermore, some applications, notably those applications related to safety, require a fast and reliable warning data transmission to the emergency services and traffic authorities. However, communication is not always possible in vehicular environments {{due to the lack of}} connectivity even employing multiple hops. To overcome the signal propagation problem and delayed warning <b>notification</b> <b>time</b> issues, an effective, smart, cost-effective and all-purpose RSU deployment policy should be put into place. In this paper, we propose the genetic algorithm for roadside unit deployment (GARSUD) system, which uses a genetic algorithm that is capable of automatically providing an RSU deployment suitable for any given road map layout. Our simulation results show that GARSUD is able to reduce the warning <b>notification</b> <b>time</b> (the time required to inform emergency authorities in traffic danger situations) and to improve vehicular communication capabilities within different density scenarios and complexity layouts...|$|E
