5|$|The {{scientists}} at Columbia {{decided that they}} should try to detect the energy released in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> of uranium when bombarded by neutrons. On 25 January 1939, {{in the basement of}} Pupin Hall at Columbia, an experimental team including Fermi conducted the first <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> experiment in the United States. The other members of the team were Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.|$|E

A simple analytic formula allowing to calculate binding energies of the Nχ^- bound state for different nuclei is derived. If the binding energy is sufficiently large the particle χ^- is stable inside the nucleus. The probabilities of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fissions</b> for such states are calculated. It is shown that the bound states are more stable to a possible fission {{in comparison to the}} bare nucleus.

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies of <b>fission</b> <b>nuclear</b> power {{generation}} for space applications over the past decade. Mostly they focus on technical development required or perceived achievable. The EC FP 7 Disruptive Technologies for Power and Propulsion (DiPOP) Study is investigating the wider issues. Which applications might attract the investment to develop space <b>fission</b> <b>nuclear</b> power generation?

5|$|In 1972, the French {{physicist}} Francis Perrin discovered fifteen {{ancient and}} no longer active natural <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> reactors in three separate ore deposits at the Oklo mine in Gabon, West Africa, collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors. The ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old; then, uranium-235 constituted about 3% of the total uranium on Earth. This is high enough to permit a sustained <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> chain reaction to occur, provided other supporting conditions exist. The capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the U.S. federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is also {{produced}} in <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> reactors {{and can be}} extracted from spent nuclear fuel (see synthesis of precious metals), though this source for palladium is not used. None of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract palladium from the high-level radioactive waste.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, {{opened up the}} possibility of a controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be done. Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, explaining {{the possibility of a}}tomic bombs, and warning of the danger of a German nuclear weapon project. He convinced his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein to co-sign it, lending his fame to the proposal. This resulted in support by the U.S. government for research into <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission,</b> which became the Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> in uranium by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in December 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, {{opened up the}} possibility that neutrons produced by fission could create a controlled nuclear chain reaction. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be achieved. In August 1939, Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D.

5|$|Another {{canceled}} {{proposal to}} orbit Ganymede was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter. It {{was designed to}} use <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> for power, ion engine propulsion, and would have studied Ganymede in greater detail than previously. However, the mission was canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts. Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|But it was Bohr who {{electrified}} {{the audience}} with his news from Europe of the discovery by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission.</b> Physicists rushed to confirm the results. Creutz built an ionization chamber and a linear amplifier out of radio vacuum tubes, coffee cans and motorcycle batteries, and with this apparatus the physicists at Princeton were able to confirm the results.|$|E
50|$|The {{immediate}} <b>fission</b> {{products from}} <b>nuclear</b> weapon <b>fission</b> are {{essentially the same}} as those from any other fission source, depending slightly on the particular nuclide that is fissioning.

2500|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>fissions</b> in fissile fuels are {{the result}} of the nuclear {{excitation}} energy produced when a fissile nucleus captures a neutron. This energy, resulting from the neutron capture, {{is a result of the}} attractive nuclear force acting between the neutron and nucleus. It is enough to deform the nucleus into a double-lobed [...] "drop," [...] to the point that nuclear fragments exceed the distances at which the nuclear force can hold two groups of charged nucleons together and, when this happens, the two fragments complete their separation and then are driven further apart by their mutually repulsive charges, in a process which becomes irreversible with greater and greater distance. A similar process occurs in fissionable isotopes (such as uranium-238), but in order to fission, these isotopes require additional energy provided by fast neutrons (such as those produced by nuclear fusion in thermonuclear weapons).|$|R
5|$|Professors at McGill {{have won}} 26 Prix du Québec, 14 Prix de l'Association francophone pour le savoir and 21 Killam Prizes. Twelve Nobel Laureates have studied or taught at McGill, among them Otto Hahn, who {{was awarded the}} 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his {{discovery}} of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> of uranium and thorium.|$|E
5|$|Since that discovery, {{there have}} been many {{searches}} in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium. In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the Belgian Congo in extremely small quantities (about 0.2ng/kg); there it originates as a spontaneous fission product of uranium-238. The Oklo natural <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> reactor contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium-99 were produced and have since decayed into ruthenium-99.|$|E
5|$|Three {{californium}} isotopes {{with significant}} half-lives are produced, requiring {{a total of}} 15 neutron captures by uranium-238 without <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> or alpha decay occurring during the process. Californium-253 {{is at the end}} of a production chain that starts with uranium-238, includes several isotopes of plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).|$|E
25|$|While {{all modern}} <b>nuclear</b> weapons (<b>fission</b> and fusion alike) make some use of D-T fusion, {{in the public}} {{perception}} hydrogen bombs are multi-megaton devices a thousand times more powerful than Hiroshima's Little Boy. Such high-yield bombs are actually two-stage thermonuclears, scaled up to the desired yield, with uranium fission, as usual, providing most of their energy.|$|R
40|$|The {{general scheme}} of power {{installations}} based on <b>nuclear</b> reactions of <b>fission</b> and synthesis activated by external sources is analyzed. The external activation makes possible to support nuclear reactions at temperatures and pressures lower than needed for chain reactions, so simplifies considerably practical realization of power installations. The possibility of operation on subcritical masses allows making installations compact and safe at emergency situations. Installations {{are suitable for}} transmutation of radioactive nuclides, what solves the problem of utilization of nuclear waste products. It is proposed and considered schemes of power installations based on <b>nuclear</b> reactions of <b>fission</b> and fusion, activated by external sources, different from ADS systems. Variants of activation of <b>nuclear</b> reactions of <b>fission</b> (U- 235, 238, Pu- 239) and fusion (Li- 6, 7, B- 10, 11) are considered.

25|$|This {{tendency}} for fission product nuclei to beta-decay {{is the fundamental}} {{cause of the problem}} of radioactive high level waste from <b>nuclear</b> reactors. <b>Fission</b> products tend to be beta emitters, emitting fast-moving electrons to conserve electric charge, as excess neutrons convert to protons in the fission-product atoms. See Fission products (by element) for a description of fission products sorted by element.|$|R
5|$|Yttrium {{isotopes}} {{are among}} the most common products of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> of uranium in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In the context of nuclear waste management, the most important isotopes of yttrium are 91Y and 90Y, with half-lives of 58.51days and 64hours, respectively. Though 90Y has a short half-life, it exists in secular equilibrium with its long-lived parent isotope, strontium-90 (90Sr) with a half-life of 29years.|$|E
5|$|About 19 {{isotopes}} and 8 {{nuclear isomers}} {{are known for}} americium. There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, 241Am and 243Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer 242m1Am has a long half-life of 141years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64microseconds for 245m1Am to 50.8hours for 240Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission</b> and low critical mass.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by <b>nuclear</b> <b>fission.</b> In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} TINC as a NIMA-interacting protein {{by using}} the yeast two-hybrid system and have confirmed that TINC interacts with NIMA in Aspergillus nidulans. The TINC-NIMA interaction is stabilized {{in the absence of}} phosphatase inhibitors and in the presence of kinase-inactive NIMA, suggesting that the interaction is enhanced when NIMA is not fully activated. TINC is a cytoplasmic protein. TINC homologues and a TINC-like protein (A. nidulans HETC) are conserved in other filamentous fungi. Neither deletion of tinC nor deletion of both tinC and A. nidulans hetC is lethal, but deletion of tinC does produce cold sensitivity as well as osmotic sensitivity. Expression of an amino-terminal-truncated form of TINC (ΔN-TINC) inhibits colony growth in Aspergillus and localizes to membrane-like structures within the cell. Examination of cell cycle progression in these cells reveals that they progress through multiple defective mitoses. Many cells contain large polyploid single nuclei, while some appear to have separated masses of DNA. Examination of the nuclear envelopes of cells containing more than one DNA mass reveals that both DNA masses are contained within a single nuclear envelope, indicating that <b>nuclear</b> membrane <b>fission</b> is defective. The ability of these cells to separate DNA segregation from <b>nuclear</b> membrane <b>fission</b> suggests that this coordination is normally a regulated process in A. nidulans. Additional experiments demonstrate that expression of ΔN-TINC results in premature NIMA disappearance in mitotic samples. We propose that TINC's interaction with NIMA and the cell cycle defects produced by ΔN-TINC expression suggest possible roles for TINC and NIMA during <b>nuclear</b> membrane <b>fission...</b>|$|R
