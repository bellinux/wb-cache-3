5|$|A {{criticism}} of <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> often made by leftists {{is that its}} focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism. This perspective regards <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> {{as a manifestation of}} consumerism which promotes elitism and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> products and therapies.|$|E
5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in Western countries, {{those involved in}} the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.|$|E
5|$|Criticising {{mainstream}} Western {{education as}} counterproductive to {{the ethos of}} the movement, many <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> groups have established their own schools {{for the education of}} children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.|$|E

40|$|<b>New</b> <b>aging</b> {{theories}} {{have been developed}} to establish the safe life span of airborne critical structural components such as B- 52 B aircraft pylon hooks for carrying air-launch drop-test vehicles. The <b>new</b> <b>aging</b> theories use the equivalent-constant-amplitude loading spectrum to represent the actual random loading spectrum with the same damaging effect. The crack growth due to random loading cycling of the first flight is calculated using the half-cycle theory, and then extrapolated to all the crack growths of the subsequent flights. The predictions of the <b>new</b> <b>aging</b> theories (finite difference aging theory and closed-form aging theory) are compared with the classical flight-test life theory and the previously developed Ko first- and Ko second-order <b>aging</b> theories. The <b>new</b> <b>aging</b> theories predict the number of safe flights as considerably lower than that predicted by the classical aging theory, and slightly lower than those predicted by the Ko first- and Ko second-order aging theories due to the inclusion of all the higher order terms...|$|R

5|$|Mainstream Christianity has {{typically}} {{rejected the}} ideas of the <b>New</b> <b>Age.</b> Most published criticism of the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's fundamentalist wing. In the United States, the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> became a major concern of evangelical Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups. During that decade, evangelical writers such as Constance Cumbey, Dave Hunt, Gary North, and Douglas Groothuis published books criticising the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> from their Christian perspective; a number of them have been characterised as propagating conspiracy theories regarding the origin and purpose of the movement. The most successful such publication however was Frank E. Peretti's 1986 novel This Present Darkness, which sold over a million copies; it depicted the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> as being in league with feminism and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.|$|E
5|$|<b>New</b> <b>Age</b> {{literature}} often {{refers to}} benevolent non-human spirit-beings {{who are interested}} in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, guardian angels, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts. <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors. The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced human being.|$|E

5|$|As {{a form of}} Western esotericism, the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> has antecedents {{that stretch}} back to {{southern}} Europe in Late Antiquity. Following the Age of Enlightenment in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed {{in response to the}} development of scientific rationality. This new esoteric trend is termed occultism by scholars, and it was this occultism which would be a key factor {{in the development of the}} worldview from which the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> emerged.|$|E

5|$|Glastonbury {{has been}} {{described}} as a <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> community which attracts people with <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> and Neopagan beliefs, and is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury and stuck his staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence of a landscape zodiac around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.|$|E
5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> literature. Common <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E
5|$|<b>New</b> <b>Age</b> thought {{typically}} envisions {{the world}} as developing through cosmological cycles which can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> literature often claims that humanity once lived {{in an age of}} spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.|$|E
