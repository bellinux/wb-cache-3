50|$|In {{addition}} to these railbuses, BR ordered three for departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> service. The full list of passenger and departmental units is set out below.|$|R
5000|$|The tender was {{numbered}} N60 and {{was tested}} behind a manually-stoked Class 15F locomotive. The [...] "N" [...] number prefix indicates a <b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning</b> vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Dead mileage incurs {{costs for}} the {{operator}} in terms of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning</b> fuel use, wages, {{and a reduction in}} the utilisation of the driver's legal hours of driving.|$|R
5000|$|Before the TOPS Class 97 {{was issued}} to {{self-propelled}} locomotives in departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> use, British Rail had such locomotives numbered {{in a variety}} of series, together with locomotives that were no longer self-propelled. See Also: ...|$|R
50|$|MoHa 63638 is {{preserved}} at the SCMaglev and Railway Park in Nagoya. It {{was built in}} 1947 by Kawasaki Sharyo, and was later renumbered KuMoYa 90005 as a <b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning</b> car, before being stored at JR Central's Hamamatsu Works.|$|R
25|$|The letter 'Z' was {{initially}} intended for all miscellaneous classes, including departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning</b> types), {{no matter what}} their wheel arrangement. However, this application was abandoned in 1927 and the letter was used solely for 0-4-2 types from then onwards.|$|R
25|$|Other {{duplicate}} list locomotives were renumbered in {{the same}} manner as those in the capital list; i.e. with the prescribed multiple of thousands added, but retaining their prefix or suffix as appropriate. Departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> locomotives continued to be numbered in their own, locally-applied, series.|$|R
50|$|The {{last two}} 2-2-0 {{examples}} of the three locomotives remaining with LSWR were rebuilt in 1922 and 1923. The three survivors worked as dock shunters, or on departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> duties under the Southern Railway and British Railways and were withdrawn between 1957 and 1959.|$|R
50|$|Most {{departmental}} {{and internal}} user vehicles are converted from revenue-earning stock; {{only a small}} number are built for <b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning</b> use. Initially stock inherited from the 'Big Four' companies was given regional prefixes (e.g. DE, DM, DS and DW) indicating their origin, and adapting existing number series.|$|R
50|$|Numbers 100000 to 999999 {{were used}} for non-passenger rated stock (including wagons, vans and {{departmental}} (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> carriages), while internal user vehicles (stock used for internal purposes (e.g. stores) at specific locations and unlikely to move) took numbers in the 0xxxxx series. For more details see below.|$|R
50|$|All were {{scrapped}} following withdrawal, except two (79047 + 79053), {{which were}} taken into departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> service as 975018 + 975019. They were used at the Railway Technical Centre in Derby as Laboratory 21: Plasma Torch Research. When this extended life was complete, they too were scrapped, in 1981.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "D" [...] prefix {{in front}} of the {{regional}} prefix indicated departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> stock. Departmental stock (including locomotives) inherited from the Southern Railway carried numbers with an [...] "S" [...] suffix (indicating Service stock, an alternative term for departmental) which was deleted and replaced with the [...] "DS" [...] prefix.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the 4-LAV units were withdrawn from ordinary passenger service in 1968, with the final few going in April 1969, being replaced on their duties by new 4-VEP sets. Almost all the units were scrapped, {{but some of the}} 1940-built cars survived in departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> use for several more years. However, no 4-LAV stock exists today.|$|R
50|$|Many wagons also {{received}} Loadhaul livery, with revenue earning stock such as HEA domestic coal hoppers and BDA steel flats being repainted during refurbishment. MEA open box wagons received Loadhaul black livery upon completion by Doncaster works in 1996 but didn't feature any orange markings. <b>Non-revenue</b> <b>earning</b> stock (engineering wagons) such as YGH Seacows and a shark brake van were also re-liveried.|$|R
50|$|The Southern Railway {{numbered}} its departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> stock, both locomotives and carriages in {{a series}} commencing at 1S. The series was retained by the Southern Region of British Rail, but amended so that the numbers carried a 'DS' prefix instead of an 'S' suffix. This page lists the locomotives numbered in this series, including steam, diesel and electric locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, the Eastern Region of British Rail {{introduced}} its own series for departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> vehicles, including locomotives. Numbers were allocated from 1 to 1000, with blocks of 100 numbers allocated to {{specific types of}} vehicle. This page only lists the locomotives (steam, diesel and electric), which took the number 1 to 100. This block was split as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|Tenders {{were usually}} {{numbered}} for the engines they were delivered with. The ten Type XF1 tenders were built as spare tenders, {{suitable for use}} {{with a wide variety}} of serving engines, and were therefore not numbered for specific engines but in the tender number range from N37 to N46. The [...] "N" [...] number prefixes usually indicated <b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning</b> vehicles.|$|R
25|$|After {{displacement}} {{from their}} original workings out of London Bridge and London Victoria by more powerful locomotives from the D {{class and the}} early stages of the LB overhead electrification scheme, some representatives of the class were sold to other operators, while the majority of the remainder were put to work on branch lines in Sussex and on <b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning</b> work such as shunting.|$|R
50|$|Those {{purchased}} carried War Department numbers between 1264 and 1284, between 1952 and 1973 and 4326. Thirteen of the locomotives were re-numbered in {{a single}} sequence from 61-73 by SR but 4326 retained its War Department number instead of being renumbered 74. The locomotive used for spares was not numbered. After 1948 they were renumbered 30061-30074 by BR. Six examples were transferred to departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> use in 1962/3 and renumbered DS233-DS238.|$|R
50|$|Ironically, the {{situation}} reversed {{again in the}} 1980s, and the production power cars were then considered to be class 43, as this time round no power car or carriage was renumbered. By this time, the prototype cars had been transferred into departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> service and had taken numbers in the departmental carriage 975xxx series, so they {{were not involved in}} this redesignation, and they retained their departmental carriage numbers rather than being transferred to the departmental locomotive list.|$|R
50|$|However, {{carriages}} and wagons {{have rarely}} {{been referred to}} in general terms by their Diagram Number. Instead {{there have been a}} variety of other codes and designations, referring to generic designs rather than specific types. For instance, there were the BR (adapted from the LNER system) and LMS carriage codes, which indicated interior layout or usage. The GWR identified their non-passenger carriages and wagons through a series of animal designations, including sea life for departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> stock, followed by a letter for detail differences, e.g. Beetle A.|$|R
50|$|Soon after {{entering}} service in 1910, the CSAR Class 10-C light Pacific locomotives, acquired for suburban working, {{were found to}} be capable of handling mainline passenger trains. To better equip them for mainline working, an order for twelve new Type XM2 tenders for these engines was placed with Robert Stephenson and Company. Since their original smaller Type XC tenders were already numbered for their respective engines, these new tenders, with Robert Stephenson works numbers D1540/1 to D1540/12, were numbered in the <b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning</b> range from N1 to N12.|$|R
50|$|After {{the units}} were {{withdrawn}} from passenger service, {{they continued to}} be used by the Research department for further tests. For this purpose, the units and individual carriages were all renumbered into the departmental series. The two Class 446 power cars were teamed with a newly built pantograph trailer and became TOPS Class 920, number 920001. This was then used for the development of classes 313-315. The two Class 445 four car sets became TOPS Class 935, numbered 056 and 057 in the Southern Region departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> unit series. 056 saw little use, being stored at Wimbledon Park until June 1980, when it was transferred to the Railway Technical Centre at Derby, while 057 was used as a testbed for a number of new bogie designs between 1979 and 1983.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, a {{group of}} enthusiasts {{established}} the Cambrian Railways Society (CRS), which obtained a lease from BR over the former Oswestry goods yard and Oswestry South Signalbox. The CRS established a museum in the former CR goods shed, and acquired either directly or through members a number of steam and diesel engines, and associated rolling stock. In 1997, BR agreed to allow CRS to run trains under a Light Railway Order to Middleton Road, over a track of 300 m in length. The CRS then purchased the freehold of Weston Wharf goods yard and shed {{with the help of}} the Heritage Lottery Fund. After quarry trains finished in 1988, the CRS obtained further agreement from BR to run occasional works/inspection trains (i.e. non-passenger carrying, <b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> over the line to Blodwel.|$|R
2500|$|Twenty-three {{members of}} the class were {{withdrawn}} between 1898 and 1905 but the majority of these were sold in working order rather than scrapped. Purchasers of these locomotives included the Newhaven Harbour Company, the Isle of Wight Central Railway (four locomotives), Pauling & Co. (five locomotives), the Kent and East Sussex Railway (two locomotives), the London and South Western Railway (two locomotives), and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. Others were transferred from capital to departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> stock as pilots at Brighton locomotive works and Lancing carriage works. It is likely that the remainder of the class would have been withdrawn {{over the next few years}} if the railway had not adopted push-pull or 'motor-train' working on many lightly used branch line services. [...] The [...] "A1" [...] class (as the locomotives were designated after 1905) were found ideally suited to conversion to this form of working.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the first}} few years of the twentieth century the LB became {{concerned}} about losses on branch and short-distance passenger services, particularly in winter. The directors therefore asked the Chief Mechanical Engineer, Robert Billinton, to investigate the use of steam or petrol railcars on lightly used services. Billinton died before examples could be acquired, but in 1905 his successor Douglas Earle Marsh acquired two steam railcars from Beyer, Peacock and Company and two petrol railcars from Dick, Kerr & Co.. These were compared with small steam locomotives of the Stroudley A1 and D1 classes fitted for [...] "motor train" [...] or [...] "push-pull" [...] working. Neither type of railcar was successful, being inadequate to cope with traffic fluctuations between winter and summer, but the [...] "motor trains" [...] could be adapted by the addition or removal of extra coaches. As a result, the experiment provided a new lease of life for the Stroudley tank classes, which continued to be used on branch lines for many years after their withdrawal from suburban services. The steam railcars were sold after a few years, and the petrol railcars were used for departmental (<b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning)</b> purposes during the erection of the catenary for the overhead electrification of the London suburban lines.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{specialised}} wagons were reserved {{for the use of}} various railway departments. The Locomotive Department had a large fleet of coal wagons and many were constructed from iron. They were allocated diagrams in the N series alongside ordinary mineral wagons for revenue <b>earning</b> <b>traffic</b> but were identified by a large 'LOCO' painted on the sides. The more common designs carried either 10 tons (diagrams N6 and N7) or 20 tons (N2, N4 and N5) but there were some exceptionally large bogie wagons such as diagram N11 that carried 40 tons.|$|R
5000|$|The ex-GCR Main Line was severed in 1966. It was {{subsequently}} lifted north of Nottingham {{as far as}} Duckmanton North Junction. The line from there to Beighton Junction (1891) was retained as a long branch to serve Arkwright Colliery, west of Chesterfield. The detailed and eventful history of the lines serving Arkwright is given the Duckmanton Junction article; as far as Beighton Junction is concerned the Beighton-Arkwright branch was in turn severed in 1982, ending any possibility of revenue <b>earning</b> <b>traffic</b> from the remaining stump through Beighton Junction.

40|$|The National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act of 1992 {{was enacted}} in {{response}} to an urgent need to protect the rich biological diversity of the Philippine ecosystems, which is seriously threatened by human exploitation. One of the critical elements of the law is the creation and administration of a trust fund, known as the Integrated Protected Areas Fund (IPAF) intended to finance the projects of the system. All incomes earned by the protected areas are deposited to the National Treasury as a trust fund, with 75 % of the collection to be allocated to the protected areas that generated the revenue, and the balance, retained by the central IPAF to support <b>non-revenue</b> <b>earning</b> protected areas and the operation of the IPAF Governing Board. After NIPAS law's 12 years of implementation, this paper looked into the institutional and operational issues attendant to the establishment and operation of the IPAF, such as the multiple management structure, tedious bureaucratic procedures in accessing the fund, perceived increase in exploitative/development activities, and revenue sharing allocation will be explored and documented in details. To a certain extent, the study also explored how the presence of IPAF has affected the inflow of other funds into the protected areas and how come many protected areas are not generating its own revenue or not obtaining financial support from the central IPAF as intended. The study has established that 12 years after the NIPAS law, only 12 of the 68 protected areas that earned IPAF revenues have managed to secure the release of its IPAF fund and not one of the 140 non-earning protected areas has obtained financial support from the central IPAF.

5000|$|During {{the last}} two decades of the 19th century, London was {{expanding}} outwards as suburbs became more built up and were absorbed into the built-up area of London itself. Towns such as Croydon, Sutton and Norwood, which had previously been commuter towns separate from London, grew to form one large area of housing. Much of this was because {{of the success of the}} 'Terriers' themselves, as they had sped up suburban passenger services, encouraging people to move out of the centre of London. Trains became progressively heavier while the need for shorter journey times remained the same. As a result, the engines gradually became largely unsuited for their original purpose, and they were replaced by the larger D class tank engines. However the 'Terriers' were so reliable that they were put on other work, often finding use on branch line passenger and freight workings and as shunting engines.Twenty-three members of the class were withdrawn between 1898 and 1905 but the majority of these were sold in working order rather than scrapped. Purchasers of these locomotives included the Newhaven Harbour Company, the Isle of Wight Central Railway (four locomotives), Pauling & Co.
