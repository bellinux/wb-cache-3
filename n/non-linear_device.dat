50|$|In a {{great many}} circuit designs, the dc bias {{is fed to a}} {{non-linear}} component via a resistor (or possibly a network of resistors). Since resistors are linear components, it is particularly easy to determine the quiescent operating point of the <b>non-linear</b> <b>device</b> from a graph of its transfer function. The method is as follows: from linear network analysis the output transfer function (that is output voltage against output current) is calculated for the network of resistor(s) and the generator driving them. This will be a straight line (called the load line) and can readily be superimposed on the transfer function plot of the <b>non-linear</b> <b>device.</b> The point where the lines cross is the quiescent operating point.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the easiest}} {{practical}} {{method is to}} calculate the (linear) network open circuit voltage and short circuit current and plot these on the transfer function of the <b>non-linear</b> <b>device.</b> The straight line joining these two point is the transfer function of the network.|$|E

40|$|With the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors {{predicting}} below- 25 nm feature-size VLSIs, {{powered by}} DC power supplies {{of less than}} 1 V, protection against transients has become mandatory for modern electronic systems. Surge protection circuits are usually designed using <b>non-linear</b> <b>devices</b> such as metal oxide varistors and semiconductor devices and these devices are rated for short-term energy absorption, based on transient waveforms defined by standards such as IEEE C 62. 41. Despite their very low voltage DC ratings, supercapacitors are characterized by large time constants and significant continuous energy absorption ratings. This paper presents details of a patent-pending technique where multi-winding magnetic core with a supercapacitor based energy absorber stage can be combined with the commonly used <b>non-linear</b> <b>devices,</b> for enhanced protection.

50|$|In this method, the {{transfer}} function of the <b>non-linear</b> <b>device</b> is broken up into regions. Each of these regions is approximated by a straight line. Thus, {{the transfer}} function will be linear up to a particular point where {{there will be a}} discontinuity. Past this point {{the transfer function}} will again be linear but with a different slope.|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} {{a system with}} an input and an output, such as an audio amplifier, we start with an ideal system where the transfer function is linear and time-invariant. When a signal passes through a non-ideal, <b>non-linear</b> <b>device,</b> additional content is added at the harmonics of the original frequencies.

50|$|A {{critical}} {{issue in the}} analysis of power grids is the large size of the network (typically millions of nodes in a state-of-the-art microprocessor). Simulating all the <b>non-linear</b> <b>devices</b> in the chip together with the power grid is computationally infeasible. To make the size manageable, the simulation is done in two steps. First, the <b>non-linear</b> <b>devices</b> are simulated assuming perfect supply voltages and the currents drawn by the devices are measured. Next, these devices are modeled as independent time-varying current sources for simulating the power grid and the voltage drops at the transistors are measured. Since voltage drops are typically less than 10% of the power supply voltage, the error incurred by ignoring the interaction between the device currents and the supply voltage is small. By doing these two steps, the power grid analysis problem reduces to solving a linear network which is still quite large. To further reduce the network size, we can exploit the hierarchy in the power distribution models.|$|R

50|$|This method {{can be used}} {{where the}} {{deviation}} of the input and output signals in a network stay within a substantially linear portion of the non-linear devices transfer function, or else are so small that {{the curve of the}} transfer function can be considered linear. Under a set of these specific conditions, the <b>non-linear</b> <b>device</b> can be represented by an equivalent linear network. It must be remembered that this equivalent circuit is entirely notional and only valid for the small signal deviations. It is entirely inapplicable to the dc biasing of the device.|$|E
50|$|A {{load line}} {{is used in}} {{graphical}} analysis of nonlinear electronic circuits, representing the constraint {{other parts of the}} circuit place on a <b>non-linear</b> <b>device,</b> like a diode or transistor. It is usually drawn on a graph of the current vs the voltage in the nonlinear device, called the device's characteristic curve. A load line, usually a straight line, represents the response of the linear part of the circuit, connected to the nonlinear device in question. The points where the characteristic curve and the load line intersect are the possible operating point(s) (Q points) of the circuit; at these points the current and voltage parameters of both parts of the circuit match.|$|E
50|$|Many circuit {{elements}} that operate linearly at low signal levels will show nonlinearity at higher signal levels. An {{example of this}} can be seen in many audio systems by turning up the volume. At a high enough volume level, the transistors or other amplifying elements will begin to operate nonlinearly and distort the sound. Conversely, nonlinear elements can be made to operate linearly if the signal in them is limited to a low level. If the input of a <b>non-linear</b> <b>device</b> such as a transistor only varies in a small range around a fixed value, then the input/output relation is linearized around this fixed value (usually called the quiescent point, Q-point, or bias point). This is called a small signal model. Non-linear elements will not follow Ohm's law.|$|E

40|$|Harmonics {{are created}} by <b>non-linear</b> <b>devices</b> {{connected}} to the power system. Power system harmonics are multiples of the fundamental power system frequency and these harmonic frequencies can create distorted voltages and currents. Distortion of voltages and currents can affect the power system adversely causing power quality problems. Therefore, estimation of harmonics is of high importance for efficiency of the power system network. The problem of harmonic loss evaluation is of growing importance for renewable power system industry by impacting the operating costs and the useful life of the system components. <b>Non-linear</b> <b>devices</b> such as power electronics converters can inject harmonics alternating currents (AC) in the electrical power system. The number of sensitive loads that require ideal sinusoidal supply voltage for their proper operation has been increasing. To maintain the quality limits proposed by standards to protect the sensitive loads, {{it is necessary to}} include some form of filtering device to the power system.

5000|$|Linearity {{means that}} if you have two inputs and two {{corresponding}} outputs, if you take a linear combination of those two inputs you will get a linear combination of the outputs. An example of a linear system is a first order low-pass or high-pass filter. Linear systems are made out of analog devices that demonstrate linear properties. These devices don't have to be entirely linear, but must have a region of operation that is linear. An operational amplifier is a <b>non-linear</b> <b>device,</b> but has a region of operation that is linear, so it can be modeled as linear within that region of operation. Time-invariance means it doesn't matter when you start a system, the same output will result. For example, if you have a system and put an input into it today, you would get the same output if you started the system tomorrow instead. There aren't any real systems that are LTI, but many systems can be modeled as LTI for simplicity in determining what their output will be. All systems have some dependence on things like temperature, signal level or other factors that cause them to be non-linear or non-time-invariant, but most are stable enough to model as LTI. Linearity and time-invariance are important because they are the only types of systems that can be easily solved using conventional analog signal processing methods. Once a system becomes non-linear or non-time-invariant, it becomes a non-linear differential equations problem, and there are very few of those that can actually be solved.
