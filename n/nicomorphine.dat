50|$|<b>Nicomorphine</b> (Vilan, Subellan, Gevilan, MorZet) is the 3,6-dinicotinate ester of morphine.

It is possible that other manufacturers distribute 10 mg tablets and other concentrations of injectable <b>nicomorphine</b> in ampoules and multidose vials. It is used, particularly in the German-speaking countries and elsewhere in Central Europe and some other countries in Europe and the former USSR in particular, for post-operative, cancer, chronic non-malignant and other neuropathic pain.

50|$|Nalorphine dinicotinate (trade name Nimelan), {{also known}} as N-allylnormorphine dinicotinate, dinicotinoylnalorphine, or niconalorphine, is a semisynthetic, mixed opioid agonist-antagonist which is {{described}} as a narcotic antagonist.

50|$|Via the {{epidural}} route, a {{much slower}} release from epidural space occurs and <b>nicomorphine</b> remains detectable for 1.5 hours or so, {{and has a}} longer effect of 18.2 +/- 10.1 hours due to slower release of the active metabolites, morphine and 6-nicotinoylmorphine.

50|$|Heroin is one {{of several}} semi-synthetic opioids derived from the morphine. Although {{sometimes}} not considered opiates, as they are not directly derived from natural opium, they are commonly referred to as opiates. Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is a morphine prodrug; it is metabolized by the liver into morphine after administration. One of the major metabolites of heroin, 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), is also a morphine prodrug. <b>Nicomorphine</b> (morphine dinicotinate), dipropanoylmorphine (morphine dipropionate), desomorphine (di-hydro-desoxy-morphine), methyldesorphine, acetylpropionylmorphine, dibenzoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and several others are also derived from morphine.|$|E
5000|$|A {{subclass}} {{of morphine}} derivatives, namely the 3,6 esters of morphine, with similar effects and uses, includes the clinically used strong analgesics <b>nicomorphine</b> (Vilan), and dipropanoylmorphine; {{there is also}} the latter's dihydromorphine analogue, diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin). Two other 3,6 diesters of morphine invented in 1874-75 along with diamorphine, dibenzoylmorphine and acetylpropionylmorphine, were made as substitutes after it was outlawed in 1925 and, therefore, sold as the first [...] "designer drugs" [...] until they were outlawed by the League of Nations in 1930.|$|E
5000|$|Esters of {{morphine}} were first produced by boiling morphine in acids or acid anhydrides including acetic, formic, propanoic, benzoic, butyric, and others, forming numerous mono-, di-, and tetraesters. Some {{of these were}} later researched further by others and some were eventually marketed. [...] They included heroin, the first designer drugs which were produced in the late 1920's to replace heroin when it was outlawed by the League of Nations, medicinal drugs such as <b>nicomorphine</b> and others. Some of the corresponding esters of codeine, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, isocodeine were also developed, such as the cough suppressant nicocodeine.

50|$|Thebacon's {{analgesic}} and antitussive potency {{is slightly}} {{higher than that of}} its parent compound hydrocodone, which gives it approximately eight times the milligramme strength of codeine. The acetylation at position 3 and the conversion into a dihydromorphinone class semisynthetic (at position 14 on the morphine carbon skeleton) allows for the drug to more rapidly enter the central nervous system in greater quantity where it is de-acetylated into hydromorphone, and also converted by other processes into hydromorphinol, morphine and various other active and inactive substances; it therefore simultaneously takes advantage of two methods of increasing the effectiveness of morphine and its derivatives, those being catalytic hydrogenation (codeine into hydrocodone) and esterification (morphine into diamorphine, <b>nicomorphine</b> &c) in a manner not unlike to that of dihydrodiacetylmorphine.|$|E
5000|$|Nalorphine (INN) (brand names Lethidrone, Nalline), {{also known}} as N-allyl-normorphine, is a mixed opioid agonist-{{antagonist}} with opioid antagonist and analgesic properties. It was introduced in 1954 and {{was used as an}} antidote to reverse opioid overdose and in a challenge test to determine opioid dependence. It acts at two opioid receptors — the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) where it has antagonistic effects, and at the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) (Ki = 1.6 nM; EC50 = 483 nM; Emax = 95%) where it exerts high-efficacy partial agonist/near-full agonist characteristics. Nalorphine was the second opioid antagonist to be introduced, preceded by nalodeine (N-allylnorcodeine) in 1915 and followed by naloxone in 1960 and naltrexone in 1963. Due to potent activation of the KOR, nalorphine produces side effects such as dysphoria, anxiety, confusion, and hallucinations, and for this reason, is no longer used medically. [...] Nalorphine has a number of analogues including niconalorphine (the <b>nicomorphine</b> analogue) , diacetylnalorphine (heroin analogue) dihydronalorphine(dihydromorphine) and a number of others and a number of codeine-based ones as well.|$|E
5000|$|Under the Controlled Substances Act, {{dihydromorphine}} {{is listed}} as a Schedule I substance along with heroin. [...] In the United States, {{its role in the}} production of dihydrocodeine and other related drugs make it a Schedule I substance with one of the higher annual manufacturing quotas granted by the US Drug Enforcement Administration—3300 kilos in 2013; manufacturers, distributors, and importers with the correct DEA license and state permits related thereto are able to use Schedule I drugs in this fashion when they are transformed into something of a lower schedule. The DEA has assigned dihydromorphine and all of its salts, esters, &c the ACSCN of 9145. As with <b>nicomorphine,</b> MDMA, heroin (DEA 2013 production quota: 25 grammes) and the like, dihydromorphine is also used in research such as that mentioned above in properly licensed facilities; Form 225, the most common and least expensive individual researcher's license, does not include Schedule I so the lab must have a higher-level DEA registration [...] As with other licit opioids used for medical purposes in other countries, including even much weaker opioids like nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, and tilidine, the reason for dihydromorphine being in Schedule I is that it was not in medical use in the USA at time the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 was drawn up.|$|E
5000|$|Morphine is {{the gold}} {{standard}} to which all narcotics are compared. Semi-synthetic derivatives of morphine such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), <b>nicomorphine</b> (Vilan), hydromorphinol and others vary in such ways as duration of action, side effect profile and milligramme potency. Fentanyl has the benefit of less histamine release and thus fewer side effects. It can also be administered via transdermal patch which is convenient for chronic pain management. In addition to the intrathecal patch and injectable Sublimaze, the FDA has approved various immediate release fentanyl products for breakthrough cancer pain (Actiq/OTFC/Fentora/Onsolis/Subsys/Lazanda/Abstral). Oxycodone is used across the Americas and Europe for relief of serious chronic pain; its main slow-release formula is known as OxyContin, and short-acting tablets, capsules, syrups and ampules are available making it suitable for acute intractable pain or breakthrough pain. Diamorphine, methadone and buprenorphine are used less frequently. Pethidine, known in North America as meperidine, is not recommended [...] for pain management due to its low potency, short duration of action, and toxicity associated with repeated use. Pentazocine, dextromoramide and dipipanone are also not recommended in new patients except for acute pain where other analgesics are not tolerated or are inappropriate, for pharmacological and misuse-related reasons. In some countries potent synthetics such as piritramide and ketobemidone are used for severe pain, and tapentadol is a newer agent introduced in the last decade.|$|E

40|$|A {{sequential}} injection analysis procedure with dual-reagent chemiluminescence detection {{was applied to}} the screening of street drug seizure samples for the presence of heroin. The chemiluminescence reagents (acidic potassium permanganate and tris(2, 2 ′-bipyridine) ruthenium(III)) were aspirated from either side of a sample aliquot that was sufficiently large to prevent interdispersion of the reagent zones, and therefore two different chemical reactions could be performed simultaneously {{at either end of the}} sample zone. The presence of heroin in seizure samples was indicated by a strong response with the tris(2, 2 ′-bipyridine) ruthenium(III) reagent and confirmed by a significant increase in the response with the permanganate reagent when the sample was treated with sodium hydroxide to hydrolyse the heroin to morphine. <b>Nicomorphine</b> (a morphine-derived pharmaceutical) was synthesised and tested under the same conditions.

40|$|Abstract] Mortality from oral {{cancer has}} been rising appreciably in most European {{countries}} up to the late 1980 s, essentially for men. To update trends in oral cancer, death certification data from oral and pharyngeal cancer for 27 European countries were abstracted and analysed from the WHO mortality database over the period 1980 - 99. Oral cancer mortality in men has started to decline since the late 1980 s in most western countries, although some persisting upward trends were registered for Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Portugal, or Scotland. Persisting rises were observed for most central and eastern Europe up to the mid 1990 s, reaching exceedingly high rates in Hungary (20. 2 / 100000 at all ages, 51. 4 at age 35 - 64), Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Russian Federation. Some levelling of rates in some countries, such as Poland or the Czech Republic, was observed over more recent calendar years. Oral cancer was low, but moderately upwards in European women, mainly from central and eastern Europe. These trends should be essentially interpreted in terms of patterns and changes in exposure to alcohol and tobacco, and call for urgent control of these factors, {{as well as for}} improved diagnosis and management of oral cancer in central and eastern Europe.

R. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2002 - 09 Canadian Journal of Anaesthesia 497711 - 7 <![CDATA[PURPOSE: To compare the effect of combined intrathecal morphine and sufentanil with low-dose iv sufentanil during propofol anesthesia for fast-track cardiac surgery. METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive patients with normal cardiopulmonary function who were scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either a continuous iv infusion of sufentanil 0. 9 to 1. 8 microg x kg(- 1) x min(- 1) (13 patients), or a single lumbar intrathecal dose of sufentanil 50 micro g and morphine 500 micro g (11 patients). We prospectively studied perioperative analgesia, time to extubation and early postoperative maximal inspiratory capacity in the two groups. In the intensive care unit, the medical and nursing staff were blinded to the analgesic technique. RESULTS: Intrathecal sufentanil morphine allowed a shorter duration of intubation (104 +/- 56. 5 min vs 213 +/- 104 min; P = 0. 01), reduced the need for postoperative analgesia with <b>nicomorphine</b> (equipotent to morphine) (0. 7 +/- 0. 4 mg x hr(- 1) vs 1. 2 +/- 0. 4 mg x hr(- 1); P = 0. 008) and improved postoperative maximal inspiratory capacity (53. 4 +/- 16. 1 vs 38. 4 +/- 12. 5 % of the norm; P = 0. 05). CONCLUSION: In low-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft or valve surgery, combined intrathecal sufentanil and morphine with a target-controlled infusion of propofol satisfies the goals of fast-track cardiac surgery...|$|E
