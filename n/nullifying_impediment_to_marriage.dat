50|$|While the Council of Trent is {{best known}} as a Counter-Reformation Council, neither the Lutheran Church nor the Church of England broke with the Roman Catholic Church on the {{requirement}} of publication of banns (or the equivalent) before marriage. (An equivalent notice was not required in the Orthodox Christian Churches, which used another method to verify eligibility to marry.) The break between some Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church was over what would constitute an <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> (the Church of England, for example, recognised remarriage after divorce in some circumstances), rather than over the means by which <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> should be identified.|$|R
50|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{abolished}} the requirement in 1983, as greater mobility had limited its usefulness {{as a means}} of determining whether there were <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage.</b> However, many parishes still publish such notices in church bulletins.|$|R

5000|$|Her antecedents are unknown. She is {{sometimes}} {{alleged to be}} a daughter of Stefan Nemanja of Serbia, but this relationship is questionable and would have caused various canonical <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriages</b> between their descendants. Elena married Ivan Asen I in 1183 {{at the age of}} thirteen.|$|R
50|$|In the Roman Curia, the Apostolic Penitentiary has {{jurisdiction}} for {{matters of}} the internal forum, both sacramental and non-sacramental, but in some instances its decisions hold also in the external forum, as when, unless it states otherwise, a dispensation that it grants in the non-sacramental internal forum from an occult <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage,</b> is sufficient even if the occult impediment later becomes public.|$|R
5000|$|Raḍāʿ or riḍāʿa (Arabic: رضاع, رضاعة) is a {{technical}} term from Sunni Islamic jurisprudence meaning [...] "the suckling which produces the legal <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> of foster-kinship". [...] The term {{derives from the}} infinitive noun of the Arabic word radiʿa or radaʿa ("he sucked the breast of his mother"). Often it is translated as [...] "fosterage" [...] or [...] "milk-kinship".|$|R
50|$|In Catholic canon law, {{affinity}} is an <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> of {{a couple}} due to the relationship which either party has {{as a result of}} a kinship relationship created by another marriage or as a result of extramarital intercourse. The relationships that give rise <b>to</b> the <b>impediment</b> have varied over time. Marriages and sexual relations between people in an affinity relationship are regarded as incestuous.|$|R
50|$|In the Latin Church, {{only the}} Holy See can authentically declare when divine law prohibits or invalidates a marriage, {{and only the}} Holy See {{has the right to}} {{establish}} for those who are baptised other <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> (canon 1075). But individual Eastern Catholic Churches, after having fulfilled certain requirements that include consulting (but not necessarily obtaining approval from) the Holy See, may establish impediments.|$|R
50|$|If a Catholic marries a non-Catholic, the <b>marriage</b> {{is subject}} <b>to</b> Catholic canon law on <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage.</b> If no Catholic is involved, the only impediments that apply are those {{affecting}} {{the very definition}} of marriage (such as if consent, diversity of sex, ability <b>to</b> consummate the <b>marriage</b> are lacking, or in the presence of an already existing marriage bond) and those that are considered part of natural law (such as a father-daughter relationship).|$|R
50|$|Soraya Altorki (1980) {{published}} a pioneering article on Sunni Arab notions of kinship created through suckling breast milk (Arabic: rida’a orrada’). Altorki indicated that milk kinship had received little attention from anthropologists, despite its recognised significance in Muslim family {{law as a}} complex <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage.</b> Milk kinship has since attracted further fieldwork throughout Islamic Asia and North Africa, demonstrating its importance as a culturally distinctive institution of adoptive affiliation.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> a <b>marriage</b> is a {{defective}} consent {{by one or}} both parties, a simple renewal of consent removes the impediment and can effect validation.|$|R

50|$|In 1938 Gisela Jockisch (1905-1985), née Günther, {{followed}} {{him with her}} little daughter Melanie to Turkey. She was the wife of pedagogue Walter Jockisch (1907-1970). Jockisch and Zuckmayer had been colleagues at Schule am Meer on Juist Island. Gisela Jockisch and Eduard Zuckmayer lived together in Turkey but {{were not able to}} marry before 1947 because German authorities in 1938 neglected a certificate of no <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> (Ehefähigkeitszeugnis) due <b>to</b> racist Nuremberg Laws (Nürnberger Gesetze).|$|R
50|$|Public Honesty (Decency) is a diriment <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage,</b> a {{prohibition}} that prevents a marriage bond from being formed. It arises from a valid betrothal between the male {{party to the}} contract and the blood relatives {{of the woman in}} the first degree (mother, daughter, sister), and conversely between the woman and the blood relatives of the man in the same degree (father, son, brother). Once existing, the impediment always remains, even though the betrothal is lawfully broken.|$|R
5000|$|In the Decretal, [...] "Quod votum," [...] unic. De veto et voti redemptione (iii, 15) in 6°, Boniface VIII {{declared}} authoritatively {{that the}} vow of chastity, consecrated by {{the reception of}} major orders, or by religious profession in an approved institute, created a diriment <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage.</b> Some communities of tertiaries not belonging to an approved order {{were the first to}} introduce profession accompanied by simple vows, which is now the ordinary practice in the more recent congregations.|$|R
500|$|The {{exact nature}} of LeHand's {{relationship}} with FDR is debated by historians. It is generally accepted that their relationship contained a romantic element, though scholars remain divided on whether the pair had a sexual relationship. LeHand was romantically involved with William C. Bullitt Jr., U.S. ambassador to Russia and later France, from 1933 to 1940, but apparently never contemplated <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> him. Her devotion to the Roosevelt family and dedication to her career were the most likely <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage,</b> though she once asked a friend, [...] "How could anyone ever come up to FDR?" ...|$|R

25|$|He was {{a son of}} Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria and Elena (religious name Evgenija). Elena, {{who survived}} until after 1235, is {{sometimes}} alleged to be a daughter of Stefan Nemanja of Serbia, but this relationship is questionable and would have caused various canonical <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriages</b> between various descendants. Ivan Asen II's father {{was one of the}} two founders of the Asen dynasty and the Second Bulgarian Empire. Under Ivan Asen II's rule, the empire would become the dominant force in the Balkans for about a decade, 1230–1241.|$|R
50|$|Marriage {{licenses}} {{were introduced}} in the 14th century, to allow the usual notice period under banns to be waived, on payment of a fee and accompanied by a sworn declaration {{that there was no}} canonical <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> the <b>marriage.</b>|$|R
40|$|Legal {{provisions}} on interfaith marriages offer {{a privileged}} observation {{point on the}} interaction of different legal systems {{in a context of}} migrations, minorities, and law and religion. Even within the Muslim communities in Scotland, predominantly South Asian, multiple and fluid identities compete and seek different arrangements within a legal system that refuses to consider elements of Islamic law as law, or relevant <b>to</b> law. <b>Impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> by disparity of faith can be a good case in point, and open up the debate on the boundaries of competing definitions of law. This paper explores the adaptation and transmigration of Islamic regulations on interfaith marriages among the Muslim communities in Scotland. Islamic <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> by disparity of faith have somehow guaranteed the religious endogamic principle in Muslim-majority contexts; what happens when borders are crossed and South Asian communities find themselves in a Scottish context? In order to follow this adaptation and transmigration, we need to embark on a journey through time and space. I suggest to depart from the single rule on interfaith marriages produced by modernity (I), follow a leisurely meander along the modern/classical divide (II), tour the welcoming highlands of Scots law (III), and observe how our modern rule has taken root in quite a distinct environment (IV), before landing with some super-hybrid final considerations (V) ...|$|R
50|$|Canon law {{stipulates}} canonical <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage.</b> A diriment <b>impediment</b> prevents {{a marriage}} from being validly contracted {{at all and}} renders the union a putative marriage, while a prohibitory impediment renders a marriage valid but not licit. The union resulting is called a putative marriage. An invalid marriage may be subsequently convalidated, either by simple convalidation (renewal of consent that replaces invalid consent) or by sanatio in radice ("healing in the root", the retroactive dispensation from a diriment impediment). Some impediments may be dispensed from, while those de jure divino (of divine law) may not be dispensed.|$|R
5000|$|In Catholic canon law, the {{impediment}} of raptus specifically prohibits {{marriage between}} a woman abducted {{with the intent}} to force her to marry, and her abductor, as long as the woman remains in the abductor's power. According to the second provision of the law, should the woman decide to accept the abductor as a husband after she is safe, she will be allowed to marry him. The canon defines raptus as a [...] "violent" [...] abduction, accompanied by physical violence or threats, or fraud or deceit. The Council of Trent insisted that the abduction in raptus must be for the purpose of <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> count as an <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> the {{contracting}} {{of marriage}} are those circumstances expressly stipulated {{by the law}} whose existence incapacitates the contracting of marriage. The article present and analyzes the <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> according <b>to</b> articles 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 277 of the Civil Code. Thus, we will see that according to art. 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 276 of the Civil Code the <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> are: 1. {{the existence of a}} previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the prohibition of marriage between blood relatives; 3. the prohibition of marriage between relatives by adoption; 4. the prohibition of marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; 5. the prohibition of marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; 6. the prohibition of marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack of judgment; 7. the prohibition of same-sex marriage. However, the provisions in the Civil Code only bring under regulation as an impediment the prohibition of marriage between the persons who suffer from temporary lack of judgment. Art. 277 paragraph 3 in the Civil Code stipulates the prohibition of the civil partnerships between people of different or same sex. the Family Code, the new Civil Code, <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> the contracting of marriage, the existence of a previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the prohibition of marriage between blood relatives; the prohibition of marriage between relatives by adoption; the prohibition of marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; the prohibition of marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; the prohibition of marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack of judgment; the prohibition of same-sex marriage...|$|R
25|$|The 1971 act {{was later}} {{replaced}} by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, which also declared that a marriage is void if the parties are not respectively male and female. Prohibition of same-sex marriages was {{also included in the}} marriage legislation of Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Marriage Order (Northern Ireland) 2003 states there is a legal <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> if the parties are of the same sex. The Marriage Act (Scotland) 1977 had a similar legal impediment, but following the passage of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014, the act no longer prohibits marriages if both parties are of the same sex.|$|R
25|$|In {{the modern}} State of Israel, the law {{concerning}} matters of marriage, divorce, and personal status, is partially {{under the jurisdiction}} of religious courts. For example, there is no civil marriage in Israel. The Jewish religious regulations concerning mamzerim are thus also the national laws imposed on Jews living in Israel, including secular Jews. Because of the severe <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> which mamzer status accords in Jewish law, Israeli civil law has taken the position that the paternity of a child born within a marriage cannot legally be challenged in civil courts, in order to avoid creating a body of evidence that might be used to declare the child a mamzer, or create difficulties for a future marriage.|$|R
50|$|One {{particular}} theory {{mentioned by}} Peter Parkes is an Arab folk-analogy that breast milk {{is supposed to}} be “transformed male semen” that arises from Hertiers Somatic Scheme. There is no evidence that Arabs ever considered a mother's milk to be ‘transformed sperm’. Another suggested analogy is that breast milk was a refinement of uterine blood. It is also suggested since that milk is of the woman, her moods and dispositions are transferred through the breast milk. Parkes mentions that milk-kinship was “further endorsed as a canonical <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> by several eastern Christian churches”. This indicates that this procedure was widely practiced among numerous religious communities, not just Islamic communities, in the early modern Mediterranean.|$|R
5000|$|The Legitimation Act (1904) made {{provision}} for the registration {{of the birth}} of any child born out of wedlock where the parents had subsequently married. In cases such as these, the father of the child had to register the birth and make a declaration {{that at the time of}} the birth there was no legal <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> his <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> the mother.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} banns is to enable anyone to raise any {{canonical}} or civil legal <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> the <b>marriage,</b> so as <b>to</b> prevent <b>marriages</b> that are invalid. Impediments vary between legal jurisdictions, but would normally include a pre-existing marriage {{that has been}} neither dissolved nor annulled, a vow of celibacy, lack of consent, or the couple's being related within the prohibited degrees of kinship.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} marital allegations: {{marriage}} bonds and allegations exist for couples who applied to marry by licence. They {{do not exist}} for couples who married by banns. The marriage allegation was the document in which the couple alleged (or frequently just the groom alleged on behalf of both of them) {{that there were no}} <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> the <b>marriage.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} before, mother, that my choice was made, and I asked you then {{to give your}} consent; you have now {{had time to think}} about it, and {{therefore}} I have come to ask you again. I have reason to know {{that there will be no}} <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> my <b>marriage</b> if you will frankly hold out your hand to Lucy." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{although}} the decrees of the Second Council of the Lateran {{might still be}} interpreted in the older sense of prohibiting marriage only after ordination, they came {{to be understood as}} absolute prohibitions, and, while the fact of being married was formally made a canonical <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> ordination in the Latin Church only with the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the prohibition of marriage for all clerics in major orders began to be taken simply for granted. The Second Lateran Council is thus often cited as having for the first time introduced a general law of celibacy, requiring ordination only of unmarried men. Somewhat inaccurately, since several of the Eastern Catholic Churches allow married men to be ordained (though not to be consecrated as bishops), the New Catholic Encyclopedia states: [...] "The Second Lateran Council (1139) seems to have enacted the first written law making sacred orders a diriment <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> for the universal Church.".|$|R
50|$|In regard <b>to</b> their origin, <b>impediments</b> {{are either}} from divine law, {{and so can}}not be {{dispensed}}, or from ecclesiastical law, and so can be dispensed by the competent Church authority. Under the 1983 Code of Canon Law, ecclesiastical <b>impediments</b> only apply <b>to</b> <b>marriages</b> where {{one or both of}} the parties is Catholic. Under the prior 1917 Code, ecclesiastical <b>impediments</b> applied <b>to</b> the <b>marriages</b> of non-Catholic Christians as well, unless specifically exempted. Note that, as clarified by articles 2 and 4 of Dignitas Connubii, the Catholic Church now recognizes the diriment impediments of other (i.e., non-Catholic) Churches and ecclesial communities when their members are parties <b>to</b> a <b>marriage.</b>|$|R
60|$|The other matter {{concerned}} his matrimonial affairs. No sooner did he {{find himself}} King of France than he applied to Rome for {{the dissolution of}} his marriage with Jeanne de Valois, the daughter of Louis XI. The grounds he urged were threefold: Firstly, between himself and Jeanne there existed a relationship of the fourth degree and a spiritual affinity, resulting {{from the fact that}} her father, Louis XI, had held him at the baptismal font--which before the Council of Trent did constitute an <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage.</b> Secondly, he had not been a willing party to the union, but had entered into it as a consequence of intimidation from the terrible Louis XI, who had threatened his life and possessions if not obeyed in this. Thirdly, Jeanne laboured under physical difficulties which rendered her incapable of maternity.|$|R
