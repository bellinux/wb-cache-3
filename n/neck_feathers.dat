5|$|The adult's plumage is white, {{with black}} flight {{feathers}} in the wings. Wild birds usually appear soiled with a rusty or brown shade {{to the white}} plumage, derived from mud or iron-rich soil. Captive specimens without access to soil have clean white plumage. It has been suggested as a case of cosmetic colouration. The bill is slender and long, and {{the tip of the}} upper mandible is hooked. The nostril is an elongated horizontal slit. The <b>neck</b> <b>feathers</b> are long and form a hackle. The wings are pointed, with the third primary being the longest; the tail is wedge shaped. The legs are pink in adults and grey in juveniles. The claws are long and straight, and the third and fourth toes are slightly webbed at the base.|$|E
5|$|The ruff is a long-necked, pot-bellied bird. This species shows marked sexual dimorphism; {{the male}} {{is much larger}} than the female (the reeve), and has a {{breeding}} plumage that includes brightly coloured head tufts, bare orange facial skin, extensive black on the breast, and the large collar of ornamental feathers that inspired this bird's English name. The female and the non-breeding male have grey-brown upperparts and mainly white underparts. Three differently plumaged types of male, including a rare form that mimics the female, use a variety of strategies to obtain mating opportunities at a lek, and the colourful head and <b>neck</b> <b>feathers</b> are erected as part of the elaborate main courting display. The female has one brood per year and lays four eggs in a well-hidden ground nest, incubating the eggs and rearing the chicks, which are mobile soon after hatching, on her own. Predators of wader chicks and eggs include mammals such as foxes, feral cats and stoats, and birds such as large gulls, corvids and skuas.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper <b>neck</b> <b>feathers</b> sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E

Researchers applied a small red, yellow or black sticker to the throat of five Eurasian magpies, {{where they could be}} seen by the bird only by using a mirror. The birds were then given a mirror.

However, when the birds with {{coloured}} stickers caught a glimpse of themselves in the mirror, they scratched at their throats—a clear indication that they recognised the image in the mirror as their own.

500|$|The {{surviving}} specimen is [...] long, and {{has very}} dark, brownish plumage {{with a green}} gloss. The <b>neck</b> <b>feathers</b> are elongated, {{and most of the}} feathers on the upperparts and wings have a yellowish spot on their tips. It has a black bill with a yellow tip, {{and the end of the}} tail has a pale band. It has relatively short legs and long wings. It has been suggested it had a knob on its bill, but there is no evidence for this. Unlike the Nicobar pigeon, which is mainly terrestrial, the physical features of the spotted green pigeon suggest it was mainly arboreal, and fed on fruits. It may have been native to an island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean, and it has been suggested that a bird referred to in 1928 as titi by Tahitian islanders was this bird. The spotted green pigeon may have been close to extinction by the time Europeans arrived in its native area, and may have disappeared due to over-hunting and predation by introduced animals.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedFeather {{is known}} for its robust {{regenerative}} ability. Stem cells in the feather have recently been mapped. However different parts of the chicken body have different size feathers. How stem cells are managed differently in these different feathers has not been elucidated. Here we analyze the growth pattern of <b>feathers</b> from <b>neck</b> and saddle <b>feather.</b> We analyze the topological arrangement of stem cell, TA cell, differentiated cell during different regenerative feather cycling. We found the stem cell is in a ring configuration during growth phase but shifted down to smaller ring or to assume a Ushape flanking the dermal papilla. The number of stem cells remains rather constant during stem cell cycling but also changes around three folds. On the contrast the number of TA cells change up to twenty thirty fold differences. There also appear to have higher stem cell number and a larger dermal papilla in the saddle compared to the <b>neck</b> <b>feather.</b> We found N-CAM and Tenascin-C expressed in the niche next to the stem cells. We also found TGF-beta 2 enriched in the stem cells in the resting phase of the dermal papilla. This work suggests there is a dramatic shifting of stem cell topology during feather cycling, probably to accommodate the different homeotic relationship between stem, TA and differentiated cells. The dynamic changes of molecules also refract the dynamic changes of the microenvironment in the stem cell niche. Further investigation would be required to understand their molecular mechanism and regulation...|$|R
500|$|Condors {{begin to}} look for a mate when they reach sexual {{maturity}} at the age of six. To attract a prospective mate, the male condor performs a display, in which the male turns his head red and puffs out his <b>neck</b> <b>feathers.</b> He then spreads his wings and slowly approaches the female. If the female lowers her head to accept the male, the condors become mates for life. The pair makes a simple nest in caves or on cliff clefts, especially ones with nearby roosting trees and open spaces for landing. A mated female lays one bluish-white egg every other year. Eggs are laid as early as January to as late as April. The egg weighs about [...] and measures from [...] in length and about [...] in width. If the chick or egg is lost or removed, the parents [...] "double clutch", or lay another egg to take the lost one's place. Researchers and breeders take advantage of this behavior to double the reproductive rate by taking the first egg away for puppet-rearing; this induces the parents to lay a second egg, which the condors are sometimes allowed to raise.|$|E

60|$|For flies--chub {{will rise}} greedily at any large palmers, the larger and rougher the better. A red and a grizzled hackle will always take them; {{but the best}} fly of all is an {{imitation}} of the black beetle-- the 'undertaker' of the London shops. He, too, can hardly be too large, and should be made of a fat body of black wool, with the metallic black feather of a cock's tail wrapped loosely over it. A still better wing {{is one of the}} <b>neck</b> <b>feathers</b> of any metallic-plumed bird, e.g., Phlogophorus Impeyanus, the Menaul Pheasant, laid flat and whole on the back, to imitate the wing-shells of the beetle, the legs being represented by any loose black feathers--(not hackles, which are too fine.) Tied thus, it will kill not only every chub in a pool (if you give the survivors {{a quarter of an hour}} wherein to recover from their horror at their last friend's fate), but also, here and there, very large trout.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} the sun shone warm, and the canyon was delightful. I roamed around, sat on sunny stones, and lay {{in the shade of}} pines. Deer browsed in the glades. When they winded or saw me they would stand erect, shoot up their long cars, and then leisurely lope away. Coyotes trotted out of {{thickets}} and watched me suspiciously. I could have shot several, but deemed it wise to be saving of my ammunition. Once I heard a low drumming. I could not imagine what made it. Then a big blue grouse strutted out of a patch of bushes. He spread his wings and tail and <b>neck</b> <b>feathers,</b> after the fashion of a turkey-gobbler. It was a flap or shake of his wings that produced the drumming. I wondered if he intended, by his actions, to frighten me away from his mate's nest. So I went toward him, and got very close before he flew. I caught sight of his mate in the bushes, and, as I had supposed, she was on a nest. Though wanting to see her eggs or young ones, I resisted the temptation, for I was afraid if I went nearer she might abandon her nest, as some mother birds do.|$|E
60|$|It was Mourner the Dove whom Peter saw, an {{old friend}} of whom Peter is very fond. His body was a little bigger than that of Welcome Robin, but his long slender neck, and longer tail and wings made him appear {{considerably}} larger. In shape he reminded Peter at once of the Pigeons up at Farmer Brown's. His back was grayish-brown, varying to bluish-gray. The crown and upper parts of his head were bluish-gray. His breast was reddish-buff, shading down into a soft buff. His bill was black and his feet red. The two middle feathers of his tail were longest and of the color of his back. The other feathers were slaty-gray with little black bands and tipped with white. On his wings were a few scattered black spots. Just under each ear was a black spot. But it was the sides of his slender neck which were the most beautiful part of Mourner. When untouched by the Jolly Little Sunbeams the <b>neck</b> <b>feathers</b> appeared to be in color very like his breast, but the moment they were touched by the Jolly Little Sunbeams they seemed to be constantly changing, which, as you know, is called iridescence. Altogether Mourner was lovely in a quiet way.|$|E
60|$|In {{the deepest}} snows, the path which I used {{from the highway}} to my house, {{about half a mile}} long, might have been {{represented}} by a meandering dotted line, with wide intervals between the dots. For a week of even weather I took exactly the same number of steps, and of the same length, coming and going, stepping deliberately and with the precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracks--to such routine the winter reduces us--yet often they were filled with heaven's own blue. But no weather interfered fatally with my walks, or rather my going abroad, for I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech tree, or a yellow birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines; when the ice and snow causing their limbs to droop, and so sharpening their tops, had changed the pines into fir trees; wading to the tops of the highest hills when the show was nearly two feet deep on a level, and shaking down another snow-storm on my head at every step; or sometimes creeping and floundering thither on my hands and knees, when the hunters had gone into winter quarters. One afternoon I amused myself by watching a barred owl (Strix nebulosa) sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of a white pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I standing within a rod of him. He could hear me when I moved and cronched the snow with my feet, but could not plainly see me. When I made most noise he would stretch out his neck, and erect his <b>neck</b> <b>feathers,</b> and open his eyes wide; but their lids soon fell again, and he began to nod. I too felt a slumberous influence after watching him half an hour, as he sat thus with his eyes half open, like a cat, winged brother of the cat. There was only a narrow slit left between their lids, by which he preserved a peninsular relation to me; thus, with half-shut eyes, looking out from the land of dreams, and endeavoring to realize me, vague object or mote that interrupted his visions. At length, on some louder noise or my nearer approach, he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his perch, as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed; and when he launched himself off and flapped through the pines, spreading his wings to unexpected breadth, I could not hear the slightest sound from them. Thus, guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their neighborhood than by sight, feeling his twilight way, as it were, with his sensitive pinions, he found a new perch, where he might in peace await the dawning of his day.|$|E

40|$|Vertebrate skin is {{characterized}} by its patterned array of appendages, whether feathers, hairs, or scales. In avian skin the distribution of feathers occurs on two distinct spatial levels. Grouping of feathers within discrete tracts, with bare skin lying between the tracts, is termed the macropattern, while the smaller scale periodic spacing between individual feathers {{is referred to as}} the micropattern. The degree of integration between the patterning mechanisms that operate on these two scales during development and the mechanisms underlying the remarkable evolvability of skin macropatterns are unknown. A striking example of macropattern variation is the convergent loss of <b>neck</b> <b>feathering</b> in multiple species, a trait associated with heat tolerance in both wild and domestic birds. In chicken, a mutation called Naked neck {{is characterized}} by a reduction of body feathering and completely bare neck. Here we perform genetic fine mapping of the causative region and identify a large insertion associated with the Naked neck trait. A strong candidate gene in the critical interval, BMP 12 /GDF 7, displays markedly elevated expression in Naked neck embryonic skin due to a cis-regulatory effect of the causative mutation. BMP family members inhibit embryonic feather formation by acting in a reaction-diffusion mechanism, and we find that selective production of retinoic acid by neck skin potentiates BMP signaling, making neck skin more sensitive tha...|$|R
2500|$|The {{classification}} of the Asian crows {{has been in}} a state of confusion. This species was described as Corvus culminatus by Colonel W. H Sykes based on a specimen from Pune. Eugene Oates lumped this with Corvus macrorhynchos in [...] The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma (1889), based on what had been concluded by Allan Octavian Hume based on the inability to see consistent differences in the specimens. W. E. Brooks had pointed out that the voice of the Himalayan species differed significantly apart from having longer tail. The second edition of The Fauna of British India. (1922) by Stuart Baker considered macrorhynchos as a form restricted to Java and considered the Indian forms to be made up of three subspecies of the Australian raven Corvus coronoides. Ernst Hartert looked at the colour of the base of the <b>neck</b> <b>feather</b> and grouped those that had grey bases into one group (coronoides ravens) and those that had white bases into the crow (southern) group and the northern forms including the Indian ones into levaillantii with nine subspecies. Ernst Mayr reshuffled the group in 1940. Hugh Whistler and Norman Boyd Kinnear decided that the three Indian forms culminatus, intermedius and macrorhychos were subspecies of Corvus macrorhynchos. Charles Vaurie made another revision in 1954. Salim Ali and Dillon Ripley in the Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan used macrorhynchos under which they placed four forms culminatus, intermedius, levaillantii and tibetosinensis.|$|R

40|$|International audienceTrace metals are {{chemical}} pollutants {{of prime}} concern nowadays given their implication in several human diseases and their noxious effects on wildlife. Previous studies demonstrated their negative (e. g. lead, cadmium) or positive (e. g. zinc) effects on body condition, immunity and reproductive success in birds. Because of {{their effects on}} bird condition, trace metals are likely to influence the production of condition-dependent plumage colours, {{that may be used}} in mate choice. In the feral pigeon Columba livia, we investigated iridescent colouration in response to lead and zinc experimental (i. e. metal supplementation in standardized conditions) and natural exposure (i. e. metal concentrations in feathers of wild urban pigeons), and melanic feather colouration in response to experimental lead and zinc exposure. Both studies (i. e. experimental and correlative) consistently showed that lead exposure decreased iridescent <b>neck</b> <b>feather</b> brightness independently of colour morph. Moreover, lead, when provided alone, decreased melanic feather reflectance in the middle wavelengths while zinc supplementation increased melanic feather reflectance in the violet-wavelength. In conclusion, our study suggests that the colouration of iridescent and melanic feathers depends on the exposure to pollutants. Whether trace metal exposure affected the ability of birds to produce melanin pigments, to grow the microstructural feather elements required for maximum colour display, or to cope with bacteria that degrade feather microstuctures remains unclear. Future studies should investigate whether these metal-induced modifications of plumage colouration affect behaviours involved in sexual selection...|$|R
