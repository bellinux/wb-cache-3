40|$|A {{complete}} {{replication of}} the #Sesamia cretica$ Granulovirus (ScGV) was obtained in vitro by viral infection, {{as a first}} record, in two #Spodoptera$ cell lines. Sl 52 and Sf 9. ScGV was multiplied in the two cell lines cultivated and established at 27 °C after infection with concentrated purified virions used as inoculum. The presence of virus was detected by a DNA <b>nucleic</b> <b>probe,</b> confirming previous results detected by ELISA test. The observation of ultrathin sections of infected cells indicated that complete granules {{were present in the}} cell cytoplasm in a significant amount. Purified suspension of granules was obtained after ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradient. The biological characterization of ScGV was completed by in vitro replication.

The mice were orally given 109 CFU of Lcr 35 either once {{or three times}} at 24 -h intervals. A 16 S ribosomal <b>nucleic</b> <b>probe</b> used in hybridization assays detected Lcr 35 in the feces of mice for up to 3 days after the feeding, {{at a level of}} 108 to 109 CFU/g of feces. In the human assay, 12 healthy volunteers were enrolled in a randomized trial and ingested Lcr 35 at a dosage of 108 or 1010 or 1012 CFU every day for 7 days. Then, after a 3 -week posttreatment period, there was a second intake period similar to the first one. Analysis of fecal samples showed significant increases in the number of lactobacilli during the first intake period, whatever the dose given. The greatest increases were observed in subjects harboring the lowest indigenous population of Lcr 35 -like bacteria. During the 3 -week posttreatment period, the number of CFU slightly decreased over time, and an increase, although not a statistically significant one, was observed during the second test period. These findings suggest that Lcr 35 is able to survive within the gastrointestinal tract...|$|E

40|$|Microbial sub {{populations in}} field and {{laboratory}} {{studies have been}} shown to display high heterogeneity in morphological and physiological parameters. Determining the real time state of a microbial cell goes beyond live or dead categories, as microbes can exist in a dormant state, whereby cell division and metabolic activities are reduced. Given the need for detection and quantification of microbes, flow cytometry (FCM) with molecular probes provides a rapid and accurate method to help determine overall population viability. By using SYTOX Green and SYTOX Orange in the model cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa to detect membrane integrity, we develop a transferable method for rapid indication of single cell mortality. The molecular probes used within this journal will be referred to as green or orange <b>nucleic</b> acid <b>probes</b> respectively (although there are other products with similar excitation and emission wavelengths that have a comparable modes of action, we specifically refer to the fore mentioned probes). Protocols using molecular probes vary between species, differing principally in concentration and incubation times. Following this protocol set out on M. aeruginosa the green <b>nucleic</b> acid <b>probe</b> was optimized at concentrations of 0. 5 μM after 30 min of incubation and the orange <b>nucleic</b> acid <b>probe</b> at 1 μM after 10 min. In both probes concentrations less than the stated optimal led to an under reporting of cells with membrane damage. Conversely, 5 μM concentrations and higher in both probes exhibited a type of non-specific staining, whereby 'live' cells produced a target fluorescence, leading to an over representation of 'non-viable' cell numbers. The positive controls (heat killed) provided testable dead biomass, although the appropriateness of control generation remains subject to debate. By demonstrating a logical sequence of steps for optimizing the green and orange <b>nucleic</b> acid <b>probes</b> we demonstrate how to create a protocol {{that can be used to}} analyse cyanobacterial physiological state effectively...|$|R

40|$|Oligonucleotide-templated {{reactions}} are valuable tools for nucleic acid sensing both in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in using immunological and <b>nucleic</b> acid <b>probes</b> {{to detect the}} effects of environmental stress on phytoplankton growth rate and yield are reviewed here.

Retrenchment, or the observed down-regulation of metabolic processes under nutrient deficiency, is categorized as a general response that is of limited use in designing probes to stress induced by a specific nutrient.

Methods and approaches used to design immunological and <b>nucleic</b> acid <b>probes</b> for stress imposed by nutrient deficiency are reviewed.
