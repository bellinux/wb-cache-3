In March–April and April–May 1918, the First and the Second Transjordan attacks took place, while the front line across the Judean Hills to the Mediterranean Sea was defended. During this time, three-quarters of the British infantry and yeomanry cavalry regiments were redeployed to the Western Front to counter Ludendorff's Spring Offensive. They were replaced by British India Army infantry and cavalry which required a reorganisation. These <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> soldiers carried out a series of attacks on sections of the Ottoman front line in the Judean Hills during the summer months, as part of their training. These attacks including the Battle of Tell 'Asur and Action of Berukin in March and April, were aimed at pushing the front line to more advantageous positions in preparation for a major attack, and to acclimatise the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> infantry. This fighting continued during the summer months. By the middle of September the consolidated EEF was once again ready for large-scale offensive operations.|$|E

This shift in population has been accompanied by changing patterns of infection and illness in <b>newly</b> <b>arriving</b> refugees. Because of its potential virulence and dynamic epidemiology, including its high prevalence, malaria has emerged as a disease of particular concern in this population. Malaria was endemic in most of the continental United States and much of Europe into the 20 th century. Most of the continental United States has Anopheles mosquitoes (particularly An. quadramaculatus and An. freeborni) which are competent vectors under favorable conditions. Local U. S. vector-borne transmission has resulted in 156 known malaria cases in 63 U. S. outbreaks over the past 50 years. In addition, more than 1000 cases of malaria are reported annually in the U. S. with migration playing an important role in the importation of these cases. In endemic areas, malaria has historically plagued displaced populations, and this situation continues in many contemporary refugee camps. Refugees are often not included in the host country's national health programs, which may lead to higher rates of many diseases, including malaria and other parasitic infections.
