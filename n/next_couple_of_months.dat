5|$|After {{being away}} {{for nearly four}} months, Michaels would make a {{surprise}} return to the WWF as a guest commentator on the July 13 episode of Raw Is War. Michaels would continue to make non-wrestling appearances on WWF programming and on November 23 he replaced Sgt. Slaughter as the WWF Commissioner, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, eventually joining Vince McMahon's group of wrestlers called The Corporation as a villain. Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Michaels made regular television appearances on Raw, in which he scheduled matches, throwing around his authority, and sometimes even deciding the outcome of matches. On the January 4, 1999 episode of Raw Is War, Michaels re-joined DX as a fan favorite, but disappeared from WWF television {{for a few weeks}} to have back surgery {{and by the time he}} returned DX was on the way of dissolving within the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early 1918, {{after the}} {{capitulation}} of Tsarist Russia the Germans, having moved {{the bulk of}} their forces to the Western Front, launched the Spring Offensive, striking against the British forces in the Somme. The initial onslaught pushed the Allied forces back and the Australian divisions, which had been merged into the Australian Corps, were thrown into the line in an effort to stem the tide. In early March, the 11th Battalion moved to the Hollebeke sector, where they were subjected to gas attacks before being sent south to Amiens at the start of April, joining the rest of the 1st Division in defence of Hazebrouck {{in the middle of the}} month. For the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> the battalion rotated through the line in a defensive role as the German offensive was blunted. In June, as the Allies sought to regain some of the initiative, they undertook a series of Peaceful Penetration raids. On 2 June, the 11th Battalion attacked Mont de Merris, which resulted in the capture of a large amount of German equipment and over 200 prisoners for the loss of 16 men killed and 74 wounded. A lesser attack was launched on the German trenches opposite the battalion on 22 June. Around this time, a small group of US soldiers was attached to the 11th Battalion to gain experience. The following month, the battalion captured Gerbedoen Farm before supporting the 10th Battalion's successful attack on Merris.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} a {{generalization}} {{of the theory of}} quantales and prequantales provides a noncommutative and nonassociative abstract ideal theoretic setting for the theories of star operations, semistar operations, semiprime operations, ideal systems, and module systems, and conversely the latter theories motivate new results in the theory of quantales and prequantales. Applications include representation theorems for precoherent prequantales and multiplicative semilattices; characterizations of simple commutative quantales and simple multiplicative lattices; a construction of the largest finitary nucleus smaller than a given nucleus on a precoherent prequantale; a construction of the smallest semistar operation extending a given star operation on an integral domain; and two potentially useful definitions of tight closure for non-Noetherian commutative rings of prime characteristic.

On February 23, 1998, on Raw, the Legion of Doom seemed to have won the Tag Team titles back when they hit the Doomsday Device, but as Animal went for the pin, the referee was distracted by Hawk's celebration, allowing the Outlaws to take advantage and win the match. After the match, the Legion of Doom brawled with one another out of frustration and weren't seen on WWE television after that, indicating that the team was disbanded for good.|$|E
25|$|Progress on Le Griffon was {{fraught with}} problems. Suffering from cold and low on supplies, {{the men were}} close to mutiny. The uneasy truce with the Indians was tested by threats and {{attempts}} of sabotage and murder. Tonti learned {{of a plan to}} burn the ship before it could be launched, so he launched ahead of schedule and Le Griffon entered the waters in early May, 1679. Hennepin's first account says she was a vessel of about 45 tons; his second says 60 tons. Because his second account has numerous exaggerations and cases where he credits himself for things that La Salle had done, Hennepin's first account is considered more reliable. In any case, Le Griffon was larger than any other vessel on the lakes at the time, and as far as contemporary reports can confirm, the first named vessel. Her fitting out continued the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> and when La Salle arrived in July he was encouraged by her readiness.|$|E

Returning to Assisi, he traversed the city begging stones {{for the restoration of}} St. Damiano's. These he carried to the old chapel, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. Over the course of two years, he embraced the life of a penitent, during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them St. Peter's, some distance from the city; and the Porziuncola, the little chapel of St. Mary of the Angels in the plain just below the town. This later became his favorite abode. By degrees he took to nursing lepers, in the lazar houses near Assisi.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of war with Japan in December 1941, No. 11 Squadron began flying long range patrol missions across the South West Pacific area; these would continue throughout the war and would sometimes be up to 20 hours in duration. It suffered its first loss on 8 December when one of its aircraft crashed on take-off in Port Moresby; all six crew members were killed. On 12 January, the squadron launched {{an attack on the}} Japanese airbase at Truk, but it was cancelled due to bad weather. Further raids were undertaken throughout the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> around Rabaul and patrols were undertaken along the north coast of New Guinea during which the squadron lost one aircraft shot down and several others were damaged in attacks or in accidents. The squadron also flew evacuation missions, repatriating military personnel and civilians back to Australia as the Japanese attacks intensified. In May, following the Japanese air attacks on Port Moresby, the squadron was withdrawn to Australia, arriving in Bowen, Queensland, from where it flew reconnaissance sorties in support of Allied naval operations during the Battle of the Coral Sea. Throughout the remainder of the year, the squadron undertook anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols, and several bombing missions in New Guinea during which one Catalina was lost.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, {{many members of the}} battalion volunteered for service with the Second Australian Imperial Force and were allocated to the 2/3rd Battalion, with whom they served in North Africa, Syria, Greece, Crete and then later in New Guinea. In 1942, following the entry of Japan into the war, the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment) was mobilised and brought up to its full wartime establishment with national servicemen. In May 1942 the battalion was sent to Port Moresby, where it joined the rest of the 30th Brigade, to undertake garrison duties. In July the Japanese landed around Gona and as reinforcements were brought up from Australia, elements of the 30th Brigade began a number of delaying actions around Kokoda. In September 1942, the 3rd Battalion was sent up the Kokoda Trail, where it had the distinction of being one of only two militia units to fight alongside its associated AIF unit. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> it assisted in the recapturing of Kokoda, before participating in the fighting around Buna and Gona. In 1943, the battalion was withdrawn to Australia {{along with the rest of}} the 30th Brigade, where it was subsequently disbanded in July and its personnel absorbed into its associated AIF unit, the 2/3rd Battalion.|$|E

500|$|To {{increase}} {{the rate of}} discharge, the Tug and Lighter Company, a unit which {{had served in the}} Siege of Tobruk, was sent to Port Moresby.

Harbour craft arrived on Liberty ships over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months,</b> but no more than one tug and ten lighters were available at any time during 1942. The African-American 611th Port Company arrived in June, and an Australian docks operating company in mid-September. Major R. C.

Another move saw them transferred to Broodeseinde Ridge, where they conducted a raid on German positions around Celtic Wood on 6/7 October {{in concert with the}} 12th Battalion. The following day, the 11th Battalion moved to a position on [...] "Anzac Ridge", before later moving to Zonnebeke {{at the end of the}} month where they suffered heavy casualties from German artillery.
