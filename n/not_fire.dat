5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised that the blockhouse's guns could <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> downriver and by the 1830s it had been decided to focus investment on the New Tavern and Tilbury forts. The blockhouse itself fell out of use as a magazine in 1834, being briefly used as a government store, and the adjacent gun platforms were sold off in 1835. The blockhouse building was subsequently demolished in 1844.|$|E
5|$|Grayburn did <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> on the {{occasional}} German traffic still using the bridge, preferring not to advertise the Allied presence until {{the rest of}} the battalion had arrived. Upon his arrival, Frost began securing more buildings around the ramp, and a small section attack was made on the bridge. The German defenders quickly repulsed this however and Tatham-Warter organised a stronger attack, to be led by Grayburn.|$|E
5|$|In July 1922, Minas Geraes joined São Paulo {{in helping}} to quash {{the first of the}} Revolução Tenentista (English: Tenente revolts), in which the {{garrison}} of Rio de Janeiro's Fort Copacabana rebelled and began bombarding the city. São Paulo shelled the fort, and the rebels surrendered shortly thereafter; Minas Geraes did <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> its guns.|$|E
5000|$|Although JD was <b>not</b> <b>fired</b> {{because of}} his strong defence and being the least {{responsible}} for Titans' loss, Lord Sugar stated it was merely due to him being given the [...] "benefit of the doubt", as his lack of presence on the task was still questionable. While Karthik was also <b>not</b> <b>fired,</b> he was deemed a [...] "loose cannon" [...] by Sugar, who was unimpressed with the aggressive behaviour he displayed, and thus hoped he would remedy this in the future. While Alana was brought back, she was <b>not</b> <b>fired</b> as Sugar sympathised with her difficulty in the final boardroom, as she struggled during it and stopped twice when attempting to answer questions.|$|R

The ship did <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> her {{secondary}} 15cm or 8.8cm guns during the entire engagement. Of the four König-class ships, only Kronprinz escaped damage during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne {{carried a}} {{defensive}} armament of anti-aircraft guns and an air group comprising both attack and anti-submarine aircraft. As {{the ship was}} never directly involved in a conflict, her weapons and embarked aircraft did <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> a shot in anger.|$|E
5|$|Abdul Aziz's younger brother, Ghazi Abdul Rashid, {{had been}} {{negotiating}} {{with a government}} mediator. He claimed that the remaining students were willing to leave the mosque and lay down their arms, provided the government would grant them amnesty and <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> on them. Government officials were sceptical that Abdul Rashid would honour this agreement. In {{a telephone interview from}} a live transmission of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all the charges against him and reiterated his innocence. He further negotiated with the government for his safe passage and a guarantee that no harm would come to his followers inside the mosque. He also received a promise that his ailing mother would receive medical care.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player is {{presented}} with a range of options that determine the experience. The game offers nine selectable levels of difficulty, including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or nighttime, altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will be mounted on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and multipurpose missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, the plane is equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles.|$|E
5|$|Both Boadicea and Bellona {{began their}} careers with {{destroyer}} flotillas of the First Fleet, Boadicea as senior officers' ship for the 1st Destroyer Flotilla and Bellona with the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. The former {{was transferred to}} the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in mid-1912 and the sisters were transferred to the 2nd and the 1st Battle Squadrons, respectively, of the First Fleet in 1913. Both ships were assigned to positions at the rear of their squadrons and did <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> their guns during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916.|$|E
5|$|Early on 15 April, the {{northern}} column of the 14th Panzer Division closed on Doboj, and after overcoming resistance around that town, arrived in Sarajevo at 20:45. Before noon, Nedeljković received orders that a ceasefire had been agreed, {{and that all}} 4th Army troops were to remain in place and <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> on German personnel. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.|$|E

Yugoslavia was then occupied and dismembered by the Axis powers, with Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania all annexing parts of its territory.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, Pennsylvania {{provided}} shore bombardment during the Battles of Makin, Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Saipan, {{along with the}} Palau Islands Campaign. The ship also participated in the landings on Leyte and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. During this time, Pennsylvania {{was present at the}} last battle ever between battleships, the Battle of Surigao Strait. The ship did <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> any salvos because the Japanese vessels were turned away or sunk at long range, beyond Pennsylvanias outdated fire control but within range of other, radar-directed battleships.|$|E
5|$|German minesweepers and escorting light cruisers were {{attempting}} to clear British-laid minefields in the Heligoland Bight in late 1917. The Admiralty planned a large operation for 17 November to destroy the ships, and allocated two light cruiser squadrons and the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and, more distantly, the 1st Battle Squadron of battleships. New Zealand {{was attached to the}} 1st BCS for this operation, which became known as the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. New Zealand did <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> her guns during the battle. As in previous engagements, Captain Green wore the piupiu and tiki for luck.|$|E

5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|One {{man in the}} crowd, Leon Czolgosz, {{hoped to}} assassinate McKinley. He {{had managed to get}} close to the presidential podium, but did <b>not</b> <b>fire,</b> {{uncertain}} of hitting his target. Czolgosz, since hearing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland, had decided to do something he believed would advance the cause. After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief, and, when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Reşadiye and Sultan Osman-ı Evvel {{were then}} pressed into British service. Reşadiye was {{completed}} that month and commissioned as HMS Erin, with Sultan Osman-ı Evvel entering service as HMS Agincourt. In September, Erin joined the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, where she served {{for the duration}} of the conflict. She took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May & 1 June 1916. There, she was the fourth ship in the British line of battle, along with her three surviving King George V-class half-sisters. She did <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> her main battery during the battle, the only British capital ship not to do so during the engagement; her secondary battery fired only six shells.|$|E
