40|$|Introduction At the {{beginning}} of the space conquest the space-systems were composed of unique satellite. With the growth of the needs and the explosion of the technologies, the space-systems became more and more complex. Now they are composed of many <b>satellites</b> <b>working</b> together : we talk about constellation. The aim of the constellation design, is to optimize the satellite positions in order to obtain the best performances at the lowest cost. In fact, launching a satellite is expensive and the reduction of the constellation size is necessary. The field of satellite constellation optimization is complex because {{of the size of the}} exploration space, the presence of local optimum, and the time consuming criterion. For this reason, applying any optimization algorithm over the whole constellation using a black-box criterion leads to an impossible resolution. In order to bypass these obstacles and to simplify the search we decide to split the constellation and the exploration space. We al...|$|R

Consequently, both the aerospace {{companies and the}} research community have started directing their attention to missions involving many, small, inexpensive <b>satellites,</b> <b>working</b> in formation flying {{to achieve the same}} performance as a large, expensive, single satellite. There are many challenges to be resolved before the ambitious objectives of efficient communications within nanosatellite constellations can be achieved, including design of specific protocols that take into consideration the limited onboard resources, limited communications opportunities, limited bandwidth, high-speed node mobility, the types of errors founded in LEO nanosatellite environment, scalability, timing and synchronization issues. All these challenges require us to revise communication protocol design, network management, and to consider novel routing mechanisms to accomplish "more with less". Moreover, {{one of the most significant}} challenges of future nanosatellite network telecommunications will be provide some type of service guarantees for different types of traffic.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to explore those {{applications}} which can best utilize a network of orbiting <b>satellites</b> <b>working</b> as a distributed computing array. The satellites are presumed to be low-cost mini- or micro-satellites orbiting Earth or some other celestial body (i. e., an asteroid, moon, etc.), and should have a (near) constant communication link between the satellites, such that any given satellite can continuously send data to any other satellite in the network; however, as a low-cost and potentially remotely operated mission scenario, it is assumed that the downlink bandwidth via Earth-based ground stations will be very limited. As such, the goal of the networked array of satellites is to directly compute the data or science product in-space, as opposed to the traditional scheme of downloading all of the raw data and processing the results on the ground. Not all observations techniques will benefit from this space-based distributed computing approach, but case studies involving gravity field determination will be provided to highlight the potential of such systems.
