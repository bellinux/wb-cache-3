Colonel Harry Shoup was on duty on Christmas Eve 1955 and took many calls from children inquiring about Santa. He told his operators to give a current location for Santa Claus to any child who called in. Three years later, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was formed and the NORAD Tracks Santa service continued.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, is an {{efficient}} method for computing the {{greatest common divisor}} (GCD) of two numbers, the largest <b>number</b> <b>that</b> divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

5|$|In the First World War, {{horses were}} used in combat for cavalry charges, and they {{remained}} the best means for moving scouts, messengers, supply wagons, ambulances, and artillery quickly on the battlefield; the horse could refuel itself to some extent by grazing, and could cope with terrain which was beyond machines of the time. However, this war had a devastating effect on the British horse population. As thousands of animals were drafted for the war effort, some breeds were so reduced in <b>number</b> <b>that</b> they {{were in danger of}} disappearing. Many breeds were saved by the dedicated efforts of a few breeders who formed breed societies, tracking down remaining animals and registering them.|$|E

5|$|It has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n = 34, which is unusual for the genus Drosera {{and closer to the}} diploid {{chromosome number}} of the Venus flytrap (Dionaeamuscipula), another member of the Droseraceae. Variable chromosome counts for Dionaea from multiple studies include 2n = 30, 32, and 33. Of the Drosera species with known chromosome counts, most are a multiple of x = 10. Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base chromosome number for the genus could be 2n = 20, a <b>number</b> <b>that</b> many Drosera species share including the widespread D.rotundifolia. Exceptions to this base number include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.|$|E
5|$|NY73 was {{truncated}} to {{its current}} eastern terminus in Underwood , eliminating a lengthy overlap with US9, while its former routing from Schroon to Lake Champlain was renumbered to NY74, matching the other Vermont route <b>number</b> <b>that</b> ends in Larrabees Point. The already existing NY74 in Chautauqua County (in the Jamestown area) was renumbered to NY474 as a result. The opening of the Adirondack Northway in 1967 also resulted in a slight shift of the western terminus of NY74 from US9 to I-87. By 1981, NY74 was rerouted to follow its current alignment around the northeastern edge of Ticonderoga, on a concurrency with NY22. The highway has remained the same since that date.|$|E
