40|$|Abstract: Several <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> hybridization-based approaches, such as microarray, competi-tive genomic, and Southern or Northern blot hybridization, {{have become}} popular tools for specialists in {{biochemistry}} and in biomedicine, {{and are now}} in routine use. However, the potential of in-solution <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> hybridization-based experimen-tal techniques seems to be underestimated now. Examples are subtractive hybridiza-tion (SH), which allows one to efficiently find differences in genomic DNAs or in cDNA samples; coincidence cloning (CC), which, on the contrary, {{makes it possible to}} identify sequences that are present in all the samples under comparison; cDNA normalization, which is used for the smoothing of rare and frequent transcript con-tent in cDNA libraries; and TILLING approach, which has demonstrated its great potential for the reverse genetics studies. Finally, several techniques are aimed at the large-scale recovery of DNA polymorphisms, including single nucleotide polymor-phisms (SNPs). This book will focus on the above-mentioned and other recent developments in the area of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> <b>hybridization,</b> including attempts to improve its specificity. In this introductory chapter, I have tried to briefly character-ize {{the current state of the}} art in in-solution <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> <b>hybridization</b> techniques, and to define their major principles and applications. The advantages and short-comings of these techniques will be discussed here...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Being {{very useful}} and informative, many {{techniques}} based on <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> <b>hybridization</b> {{suffer from the}} cross-annealing of repetitive DNA, presenting in reassociating samples. This “wrong ” annealing causes “nonspecific ” hybridization of nonorthologous DNA fragments, thus producing chimeric sequences and at the final stage significantly hampering {{the analysis of the}} resulting cDNA or genomic libraries. Such chimeras may constitute up to 40 – 60 % of DNA libraries. Importantly, the number of chimerical clones positively correlates with the com-plexity of hybridizing genomic or cDNA mixtures. The hybridization specificity is a crucial factor determining both the fidelity the efficiency of all hybridization-based analytical techniques. In this chapter, I review the current attempts to increase the specificity of hybridization at both stages: during <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> reasso-ciation and at the stage of selection of proper hybrids. To this end, approaches based on chemical modifications, improving hybridization kinetics, and improving selection of perfectly matched duplexes, have been developed...|$|R

40|$|Comparative genomic {{hybridization}} (CGH) is {{a powerful}} tool for analyzing unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements in a variety of tissues. However, reproducibility of the technique is poor. We have developed an alternative protocol involving microwave denaturation of the metaphase chromosome preparations prior to the hybridization step.

Furthermore, it results in a consistently strong hybridization which is not dependent on the batch of lymphocytes used to obtain the metaphase chromosome spreads. This procedure has also proved to be applicable to <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>hybridizations</b> in general. The protocol, its application and the results of this method in CGH is discussed.

The two sets of data were consistent and have permitted alignment of the map of the SV 40 segments of the hybrid viruses with the H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae cleavage maps of SV 40.
