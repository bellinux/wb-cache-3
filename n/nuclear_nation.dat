His polemics, articulated over five decades, on India's development as a <b>nuclear</b> <b>nation,</b> with civilian and weapons capabilities, have proven both influential and contentious with supporters and detractors alike—of nuclear development and nuclear disarmament. His strong views and trenchant criticism of the inherent inequalities of the global Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty regimes are widely known and referenced, {{as well as being}} heavily commented on. He often used the term 'nuclear apartheid' to decry this situation and routinely lambasted the five established nuclear states for forcing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty on everyone else while refusing all proposals for nuclear disarmament, including one proposed by India in 1986. He also coined the phrase 'nuclear ayatollahs' to refer to the western non-proliferation lobby that routinely chided India for pursuing a nuclear programme; and later for finalising an accord on nuclear co-operation with the US in 2007.|$|E

50|$|However, {{over the}} years there have been media reports of Saudi Arabia's intent to {{purchase}} a nuclear weapon from an outside source. In 2003, a leaked strategy paper laid out three possible options for the Saudi government: to acquire a nuclear deterrent, to ally with and become protected by an existing <b>nuclear</b> <b>nation,</b> or {{to try to reach}} agreement on having a nuclear-free Middle East. UN officials and weapon specialists have suggested this review was prompted by a distancing of relations with the US, concerns over Iran's nuclear program, and the lack of international pressure on Israel to give up its nuclear weapons.|$|E

5000|$|In June 2016, the New York Times {{published}} an editorial opposing India's {{entry into the}} Nuclear Supplier's Group (NSG).

The paper said the membership was [...] "not merited" [...] and that India had [...] "fallen far short" [...] in assuming responsibilities of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>nation.</b> This view was criticized by several western and Indian experts on nuclear issues. Prof. Ramesh Thakur, Director of the Centre for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament at the Australian National University, said The New York Times is [...] "frequently chauvinistic" [...] and that the editorial [...] "reflects a deliberate bias". Dr. Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, rebutted the editorial, saying [...] "the small community of India-watchers in Washington read these words in disbelief" [...] and the paper [...] "should ground its arguments in an appraisal of the complete facts".|$|E
5000|$|Vanga {{incorrectly}} {{predicted that}} the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final would be played between [...] "two teams beginning with B". Some say that she foretold it that way because of the penalty that Bulgaria was not given. One finalist was Brazil, but Bulgaria was eliminated by Italy in the semifinals. Vanga predicted that a World War III would start in November 2010 and last until October 2014. [...] However, according to close friends, Vanga was not the type to voice predictions she saw if they were catastrophic because she knew that chaos would ensue around those she told. Witnesses and close friends also claim that she never made such prophecies, and in fact when asked claimed {{that there will be}} no World War III. Nevertheless, after North Korea — a <b>nuclear</b> <b>nation</b> — attacked South Korea on 23 November 2010, there was a spike in internet interest about Vanga concerning this alleged prophecy.|$|E

5000|$|Proponents of {{ballistic}} missile defense (BMD) argue that MAD is exceptionally dangerous in that it essentially offers a single course of action {{in the event of}} nuclear attack: full retaliatory response. The fact that nuclear proliferation has led to {{an increase in the number}} of nations in the [...] "nuclear club", including nations of questionable stability (e.g. Pakistan and North Korea), and that a <b>nuclear</b> <b>nation</b> might be hijacked by a despot or other person or persons who might use nuclear weapons without a sane regard for the consequences, presents a strong case for proponents of BMD who seek a policy which both protects against attack, but also does not require an escalation into what might become global nuclear war. Russia continues to have a strong public distaste for Western BMD initiatives, presumably because proprietary operative BMD systems could exceed their technical and financial resources and therefore degrade their larger military standing and sense of security in a post-MAD environment. Russian refusal to accept invitations to participate in NATO BMD may be indicative of the lack of an alternative to MAD in current Russian war fighting strategy due to dilapidation of conventional forces after the breakup of the Soviet Union.|$|E

40|$|A {{substantial}} literature {{examines the}} causes of nuclear proliferation, but few studies have addressed why states decide on a particular portfolio of weapon systems once they have acquired a basic nuclear capability. We advance a portfolio theory of nuclear force structure, positing that states seek a diverse set of capabilities for nuclear deterrence, but that they also face major resource and organizational constraints. A number of factors may help to explain the portfolio of nuclear forces that states ultimately field, including resource availability, experience as a nuclear power, bureaucratic politics, the conventional threat environment, the presence of nuclear rivals, {{and the maintenance of}} nuclear alliances. We test the influence of these factors on force structure using a new data set of nuclear weapon platforms fielded by nine <b>nuclear</b> <b>nations</b> between 1950 and 2000. Our findings represent an important step in understanding the drivers of nuclear behavior after states have joined the nuclear weapons club...|$|R
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the {{apparent}} decision of the United States to end development of the Yucca Flat, Nevada repository for permanent disposal of radioactive waste may inadvertently place it at variance with the disposal principles of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which caution <b>nuclear</b> <b>nations</b> that "The burden on future generations shall be minimized by safely disposing of high level radioactive wastes at an appropriate time, technical, social and economic factors being taken into account. " It is then shown that the IAEA's ten technical criteria for underground disposal can seemingly be met by storing vitrified waste a kilometer underground in the crystalline basement rock of a mid-continent shield, where: (a) it should be invulnerable to redistribution by incompetence, natural disaster, or terrorism and (b) there is no obvious pathway for leakage into the biosphere. Finally, a method is proposed by which the storage impasse may be broken. Disposal Intergenerational equity Radioactive waste...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrialized nations}} of the world have begun to plan for the storage and {{eventual}} disposal of their increasing volumes of nuclear wastes. In this paper the authors inventory the progress made by these nations in planning for nuclear waste disposal. A typology based on the adoption of spent-fuel reprocessing programs and of progress toward selection of permanent disposal sites is developed, and the world's <b>nuclear</b> <b>nations</b> are located within this typology. However, those countries which have been active in determining and constructing disposal sites have faced considerable internal and international political conflict. Conflict over nuclear waste disposal site-selection is both a geographical and a political problem. There is a review of various factors which contribute to the articulation and resolution of political conflict, including public participation in siting decisions, veto power of local governments, and prospects for international cooperation in siting decisions. It is concluded that decentralized democratic procedures, which emphasize public participation in siting decisions, have the strongest potential for conflict resolution. ...|$|R
