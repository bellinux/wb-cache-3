50|$|In {{a digital}} circuit, the <b>noise</b> <b>margin</b> {{is the amount}} by which the signal exceeds the {{threshold}} for a proper '0' or '1'. For example, a digital circuit might be designed to swing between 0.0 and 1.2 volts, with anything below 0.2 volts considered a '0', and anything above 1.0 volts considered a '1'. Then the <b>noise</b> <b>margin</b> for a '0' would be the amount that a signal is below 0.2 volts, and the <b>noise</b> <b>margin</b> for a '1' would be the amount by which a signal exceeds 1.0 volt. In this case noise margins are measured as an absolute voltage, not a ratio. Noise margins for CMOS chips are usually much greater than those for TTL because the VOH min {{is closer to the}} power supply voltage and VOL max is closer to zero.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic logic {{can provide}} {{significant}} performance and power benefit compared to implementations using static gates. Unfortunately dynamic gates have traditionally suffered from low <b>noise</b> <b>margins,</b> which limits their reliability. A new logic family, called complementary dynamic logic (CDL), is presented. CDL replaces the standard keeper logic with a dual dynamic keeper gate that is applicable to all dynamic gate structures. CDL provides dynamic gates with two novel characteristics: hysteresis and arbitrarily configurable <b>noise</b> <b>margins.</b> However, these two benefits {{come at the}} cost of reducing the gain and increasing the energy of the dynamic gate. This paper compares the noise, energy, performance, gain, and total transistor width tradeoffs of CDL and three other logic families applied to a 65 nm cell library consisting of 23 functions. The results show that the performance advantages of dynamic domino gates can be maintained while providing significantly enhanced <b>noise</b> <b>margins</b> using CDL structures. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Subthreshold {{circuit design}} is {{promising}} for future ultralow-energy sensor applications {{as well as}} highly parallel high-performance processing. Device scaling {{has the potential to}} increase speed in addition to decreasing both energy and cost in subthreshold circuits. However, no study has yet considered whether device scaling to 45 nm and beyond will be beneficial for subthreshold logic. We investigate the implications of device scal-ing on subthreshold logic and SRAM and find that the slow scaling of gate-oxide thickness leads to a 60 % reduction in Ion/Ioff between the 90 - and 32 -nm device generations. We highlight the effects of this device degradation on <b>noise</b> <b>margins,</b> delay, and en-ergy. We subsequently propose an alternative scaling strategy and demonstrate significant improvements in <b>noise</b> <b>margins,</b> delay, and energy in sub-Vth circuits. Using both optimized and unoptimized subthreshold device models, we explore the robustness of scaled subthreshold SRAM. We use a simple variability model and find that even small memories become unstable at advanced technology nodes. However, the simple device optimizations suggested in this paper can be used to improve nominal read <b>noise</b> <b>margins</b> by 64 % at the 32 -nm node.

50|$|In simple words, <b>Noise</b> <b>margin</b> (in circuits) is {{the amount}} of noise that a circuit can withstand.Noise margins are {{generally}} defined so that positive values ensure proper operation, and negative margins result in compromised operation, or perhaps outright failure.|$|E
50|$|However, it has {{not been}} {{possible}} to scale the supply voltage used to operate these ICs proportionately due to factors such as compatibility with previous generation circuits, <b>noise</b> <b>margin,</b> power and delay requirements, and non-scaling of threshold voltage, subthreshold slope, and parasitic capacitance.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of CMOS, the {{precharge}} transistor could be changed to be the complement of the logic transistor type, which allows the gate's output to charge quickly {{all the way up}} to the high level of the clock line, thus improving the speed, signal swing, power consumption, and <b>noise</b> <b>margin.</b> This technique is used in domino logic.|$|E

40|$|We present Output Prediction Logic (OPL), a {{technique}} {{that can be applied}} to conventional CMOS logic families to obtain considerable speedups. When applied to static CMOS, OPL retains the restoring character of the logic family, including its high <b>noise</b> <b>margins.</b> Speedups of 2 X to 3 X over (optimized) conventional static CMOS are demonstrated for a variet), of circuits, ranging from chains of gates, to datapath circuits, and to random logic benchmarks. Such speedups are obtained using identical netlists without remapping. When applied to pseudonMOS and dynamic families, in combination with remapping to wide-input NORs, OPL yields speedups of 4 X to 5 X over static CMOS. Since OPL applied to static CMOS is faster than conventional domino logic, and since it has higher <b>noise</b> <b>margins</b> than domino logic, we believe it will scale much better than domino with future processing technologies.

40|$|Verifying {{whether a}} digital standard-cell design is {{functional}} {{in the presence}} of interconnect coupling noise is an important concern to ASIC designers. Determining whether the coupling noise occuring on a node is excessive requires comparing this noise against the dynamic <b>noise</b> <b>margins</b> of the receiving gates. The noise stability requirement, introduced in the context of transistor-level static noise analysis, is a technique for quantifying these ac <b>noise</b> <b>margins.</b> In this paper, we describe a technique for modelling noise stability {{in the form of a}} four-parameter rule which can be used to characterize the cells of a digital standard-cell library. 1 Introduction Because of increasing interconnect densities, faster clock rates, more aggressive use of high-performance circuit familiies, and scaling threshold voltages, noise has become a metric in the design of digital integrated circuits of comparable importance to area, timing, and power[1].

5000|$|The TTL [...] "totem-pole" [...] output {{structure}} {{often has}} a momentary overlap when both {{the upper and}} lower transistors are conducting, resulting in a substantial pulse of current drawn from the power supply. These pulses can couple in unexpected ways between multiple integrated circuit packages, resulting in reduced <b>noise</b> <b>margin</b> and lower performance. TTL systems usually have a decoupling capacitor for every one or two IC packages, so that a current pulse from one TTL chip does not momentarily reduce the supply voltage to another.|$|E
50|$|The <b>noise</b> <b>margin</b> - {{the amount}} of noise {{required}} to cause the receiver to get an error - is given by {{the distance between the}} signal and the zero amplitude point at the sampling time; in other words, the further from zero at the sampling time the signal is the better. For the signal to be correctly interpreted, it must be sampled somewhere between the two points where the zero-to-one and one-to-zero transitions cross. Again, the further apart these points are the better, as this means the signal will be less sensitive to errors in the timing of the samples at the receiver.|$|E
5000|$|When {{high data}} rates are used, the {{application}} {{is limited to}} a shorter cables. It is possible to use longer cables when low data rates are used. The DC resistance of the cable limits the length of the cable for low data rate applications by increasing the <b>noise</b> <b>margin</b> as the voltage drop in the cable increases. The AC effects of the cable limit the quality of the signal and limit the cable length to short distances when high data rates are used. Examples of data rate and cable length combinations vary from 90 kbit/s at 1.2 km to 10 Mbit/s at 5m for RS-422.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{conventional}} flip-flop core is {{generalized to}} mul-tistability in full static CMOS without compromising the standard binary CMOS {{features such as}} ratioless device sizing, negligible static power consumption, and wide <b>noise</b> <b>margins.</b> The proposed multiple-level cell is built with eight devices for three-level opera-tion and necessitates four more devices for each additional level. It can be arranged with a proper address scheme {{to function as a}} RAM cell, D-latch, or synaptic memory. Experimental work veri-fies four-level operation with 3 -V supply. Simulations indicate the possibility of six-level storage in 5 -V operation. The cell retains <b>noise</b> <b>margins</b> one threshold voltage wide even at such high-level operation. This is made possible by exploiting the dynamic hys-teresis associated with the transfer characteristic of an inverter op-erating with very low rail-to-rail voltage.

50|$|ECL {{circuits}} {{available on}} the open market usually operated with logic levels incompatible with other families. This meant that interoperation between ECL and other logic families, such as the popular TTL family, required additional interface circuits. The fact that the high and low logic levels are relatively close meant that ECL suffers from small <b>noise</b> <b>margins,</b> which can be troublesome.|$|R
50|$|Because {{both ends}} of the RS-232 circuit depend on the ground pin being zero volts, {{problems}} will occur when connecting machinery and computers where the voltage between the ground pin on one end, and the ground pin on the other is not zero. This may also cause a hazardous ground loop. Use of a common ground limits RS-232 to applications with relatively short cables. If the two devices are far enough apart or on separate power systems, the local ground connections {{at either end of the}} cable will have differing voltages; this difference will reduce the <b>noise</b> <b>margin</b> of the signals. Balanced, differential serial connections such as RS-422, RS-485, and USB can tolerate larger ground voltage differences because of the differential signaling.|$|E
50|$|High {{bit rate}} digital {{subscriber}} line 2 (HDSL2) is a standard developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Committee T1E1.4 and published in 2000 as ANSI T1.418-2000. Like its predecessor HDSL, HDSL2 provides a symmetric data rate of 1,544 kbit/s in both the upstream and downstream directions at a <b>noise</b> <b>margin</b> of 5-6 dB. Its primary purpose was also to provision a T-1 line, only this technology relies on fewer wires - two instead of four - and therefore costs less to set up. The modulation technique used in HDSL2 is TC-PAM, which is also used in G.SHDSL, as opposed to 2B1Q in HDSL. Spectral shaping is applied to increase compatibility with ADSL and HDSL2 on the same bundle. HDSL4 provides the same bitrate as HDSL2, but uses four wires instead of two, to increase robustness. On a AWG26 local loop, the reach of HDSL2 is 9000 ft, while that of HDSL4 is 11000 ft.|$|E
50|$|Rendition was {{one step}} behind other {{competitors}} coming to market at a pivotal {{time in the}} 3D PC graphics engines battle. The NVIDIA RIVA 128 came to market in late 1997. The V2100 saw first silicon in early 1997, but was late to sample due to a digital cell library bug necessitating a respin. Rendition used the libraries developed by SiArch (licensed through Synopsys at that time) for their digital logic synthesis. A critical section of circuitry happened to synthesize into a 3 input nor-gate driving a scanned flip-flop. Apparently this combination was never spiced (an accurate circuit simulation engine) by SiArch. The scan-flop had three passive transmission gate muxes driven by the three n-type transistors in the NOR3, all in series. The result of this was excessive resistance with a weak bus-hold cell, which ate into the allowable <b>noise</b> <b>margin</b> and violated the static discipline in good digital logic design. This manifests itself as an intermittent bug that {{is seen in the}} lab but not in high level behavioral or even RTL or gate-level simulations. This root cause was only determined after months of investigation, simulations, and test case development in the lab, which narrowed the problem to a very confined space. At that point, the chip was run live under a scanning electron microscope using the oscilloscope probe mode to find the problem net between the NOR3 gate and the scan-flop. The combination was then spiced and confirmed to be the culprit. Two full quarters were lost due to this bug. Despite these delays, the V2x00 shipped with fully conformant OpenGL and D3D drivers.|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of <b>noise</b> <b>margins</b> {{and the related}} probability of failure in digital cells has growingly become essential, as nano-scale CMOS and FinFET technologies are confronting reliability issues caused by aging mechanisms, such as NBTI, and variability in process parameters. The influence of such phenomena is particularly associated to the Write <b>Noise</b> <b>Margins</b> (WNM) in memory elements, since a wrong stored logic value can result in an upset of the system state. In this work, we calculated and compared the effect of process variations and NBTI aging over the years on the actual WNM of various CMOS and FinFET based flip-flop cells. The massive transistor-level Monte Carlo simulations produced both nominal (i. e. mean) values and associated standard deviations of the WNM of the chosen flip-flops. This allowed calculating the consequent write failure probability {{as a function of}} an input voltage shift on the flip-flop cells, and assessing a comparison for robustness among different circuit topologies and technologies.
