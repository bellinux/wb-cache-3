5|$|The plot of {{the second}} film, , {{introduces}} a significant deviation from the book: Faramir does <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> let Frodo, Sam, and Gollum go, but decides to bring them and the Ring to Gondor. He takes them to Osgiliath and not until the Nazgûl attack the city and Frodo comes under the threat of capture does he release them.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{trade with}} the Roman Empire, {{confirmed}} by the Roman desire for silk, started in the 1st century BC. The Romans knew of wild silk harvested on Cos (coa vestis), but they did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> make the connection with the silk that was produced in the Pamir Sarikol kingdom. There were few direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each protecting their lucrative role as trade intermediaries.|$|E
5|$|George Frideric Handel {{was born}} on 23 February 1685 in the German city of Halle. It is unclear what initial musical {{education}} he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, {{by the age of}} ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was {{in the service of the}} Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.|$|E

Friley, {{the president of}} Iowa State College, even though the nature of the work could <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> be disclosed to him while security checks were being undertaken. Once these were completed, Friley brought in Harold V. Gaskill, the Dean of Science, as the Ames Project's administrator. The United States Army Corps of Engineers took control of the Manhattan Project in June 1942, and the Ames Project in late 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Persians were {{alerted to}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Greeks by a boat from Histiaea, but did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> believe it. They sent some ships to see if this was the case, and finding that it was, the whole fleet set sail for Artemisium in the morning. The Persians then sailed on to Histiaea and sacked the surrounding region.|$|E

Unexploded anti-aircraft shells have also been found to the south and east of the city.

Lawrence and the British used the information in forming alliances with the Arabs.|$|E
25|$|An early {{idea for}} {{temporary}} harbours was sketched by Winston Churchill in a 1917 memo to Lloyd George. This memo was for artificial harbours {{to be created}} off the German islands of Borkum and Sylt. No further investigation was made and the memo was filed away. In 1940 the civil engineer Guy Maunsell wrote to the War Office with a proposal for an artificial harbour, but the idea was <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> adopted.|$|E

25|$|Although Dirac did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> fully {{appreciate}} the importance of his results, the entailed explanation of spin {{as a consequence of}} the union of quantum mechanics and relativity—and the eventual discovery of the positron—represents one of the great triumphs of theoretical physics. This accomplishment has been described as fully on a par with the works of Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein before him. In the context of quantum field theory, the Dirac equation is reinterpreted to describe quantum fields corresponding to spin- particles.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, the Air Ministry stated a {{requirement}} for a two-seat high-performance light day-bomber, to be of all-metal construction and with a maximum speed of 160mph (258km/h).

Fairey, who had sold a squadron's worth of its wooden Fox bomber in 1925, was <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> invited to tender to the specification, and was sent {{a copy of the}} specification only after protesting to the Chief of the Air Staff, Hugh Trenchard.|$|E
