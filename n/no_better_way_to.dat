[...] Lezard noted that the non-Doctor Who music [...] "was received with baffled tolerance"; he said that the BBC Philharmonic played [...] "Montagues and Capulets" [...] "crisply and excitingly", but felt that [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] "tends to sound a little underpowered unless played by two orchestras at once". Lezard called Gold's work [...] "a little derivative" [...] but [...] "perfectly suited to the task"; however, he complained that Gold's orchestration of the Doctor Who theme [...] "drowned" [...] Delia Derbyshire's original arrangement. He wrote that [...] "the hundred-strong choir and soloist Melanie Pappenheim performed flawlessly," [...] and also praised the technical execution of the complex programme.|$|E
500|$|While Mr. Eko {{was created}} as a more passive character, the idea changed when the {{producers}} first saw Akinnuoye-Agbaje play the character. Akinnuoye-Agbaje explained: [...] "once they saw me on the screen without a shirt, all 6 foot 2 and using a stick beating three guys up, they knew this guy wasn't {{going to be just}} a passive priest". Eventually, Cuse and Lindelof decided to combine their original idea for the character with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's character on Oz. Originally, the character was named [...] "Emeka", and later [...] "Omecca", but after Akinnuoye-Agbaje was cast, the name was changed to [...] "Eko", in order to be consistent with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's own Nigerian tribal lineage. Eko refers to the City of Legos (Lagos) in Nigeria, coming from Eleko, Lord of Lagos. Adding [...] "Mr." [...] in front of the character's name was also a suggestion made by Akinnuoye-Agbaje. While at first Cuse and Lindelof thought this was [...] "the silliest thing in the world", they changed their minds after repeating the name a few times, realizing there [...] "was something really cool about it". The character first appeared in [...] "Adrift", where he was only shown briefly, knocking down three of the show's main characters with a stick. Akinnuoye-Agbaje was given the stick and told to [...] "knock those three guys out". Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make an entrance". The religious scripture on the stick was a suggestion of Akinnuoye-Agbaje.|$|E

However, its knowledge of each user 2 ̆ 7 s current location makes it susceptible to be a single-point-of-failure.

Especially in an environment where a group of colluded service providers collaborate with each other, a user 2 ̆ 7 s privacy can be compromised through identity inference attacks. We present a detailed analysis of such attacks on privacy and propose a novel and powerful privacy definition called s-proximity.

40|$|Introduction: The German {{healthcare}} system is facing ongoing radical change and development. The increasing tendency to urge hospitals and medical staff {{to work in}} a profit-oriented way constitute among other factors clear present and future challenges. Physicians and surgeons in particular increasingly complain of increasing stress attributed to measures aiming at cost reduction in hospitals. The highest priority must always be patient satisfaction and the delivery of good medical and human service. Problem description: The health care market in Germany has become an increasingly complex business with uncertain and unpredictable future events. Strategic planning has to enable hospitals to quickly and flexibly adapt strategies to changes in the environment that become essential to their success. The most important task is to develop a strategy that can be applied with success in all possible future scenarios. This is known as the core strategy. Discussion: The core strategy for hospitals in Germany is complementary education of the medical staff as well as top management. Accordingly, courses, workshops or even part-time graduate or postgraduate education in business and economics are recommended for the medical staff. As far as non-medical hospital executives are concerned, there is <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> than <b>to</b> host them in a hospital department for a period of 6 – 12 months. This paves the way for understanding and accepting each others’ opinion which increases hospital performance. Conclusion: Proper and complementary education of the medical staff as well as of non-medical top executives and managers of hospitals is recommended as the core strategy. This harmonizes both professional medical and managerial efforts with a synergy effect that allows soundly facing the increasingly challenging environment of the health care sector in general and in hospitals in particular...|$|R
60|$|I {{may as well}} add {{here that}} a Mr. Whitbread, to whom Clarkson {{mentioned}} this latter cause of distress, generously offered to repair the pecuniary losses of all who had suffered in this cause. One anecdote will be a specimen of the energy with which Clarkson pursued evidence. It had been very strenuously asserted and maintained that the subjects {{of the slave trade}} were only such unfortunates as had become prisoners of war, and who, if not carried out of the country in this manner, would be exposed to death or some more dreadful doom in their own country. This was one of those stories which nobody believed, and yet was particularly useful {{in the hands of the}} opposition, because it was difficult legally to disprove it. It was perfectly well known that in very many cases slave traders made direct incursions into the country, kidnapped and carried off the inhabitants of whole villages; but the question was, how to establish it. A gentleman whom Clarkson accidentally met on one of his journeys informed him that he had been in company, about a year before, with a sailor, a very respectable-looking young man, who had actually been engaged in one of these expeditions; he had spent half an hour with him at an inn; he described his person, but knew nothing of his name or the place of his abode; all he knew was, that he belonged to a ship of war in ordinary, but knew nothing of the port. Clarkson determined that this man should be produced as a witness, and knew <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> than <b>to</b> go personally to all the ships in ordinary, until the individual was found. He actually visited every seaport town, and boarded every ship, till in the very last port, and on the very last ship, which remained, the individual was found, and found to be possessed of just the facts and information which were necessary. By the labors of Clarkson and his contemporaries an incredible excitement was produced throughout all England. The pictures and models of slave ships, accounts of the cruelties practised in the trade, were circulated with an industry which left not a man, woman, or child in England uninstructed. In disseminating information, and in awakening feeling and conscience, the women of England were particularly earnest, and labored with that whole-hearted devotion which characterizes the sex.|$|R
