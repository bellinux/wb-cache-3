5|$|The {{next day}} Hastings called {{for both the}} Solicitor General, Sir Henry Slesser, and Jimmy Maxton, to ask their opinion on the prosecution. Maxton knew Campbell, and {{revealed}} {{that he was only}} the temporary editor and had not written the article – the article had actually been copied from another newspaper. Along with Guy Stevenson, the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, Hastings then visited Ramsay MacDonald to explain the facts of the case. MacDonald blamed the Director of Public Prosecutions for starting the case, although Hastings intervened and admitted to Macdonald that it was entirely his fault. The Prime Minister said that he felt they should go through with the case <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> started, but Hastings suggested that a member of the Treasury Counsel appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court and withdraw the prosecution. MacDonald agreed, and the next morning Travers Humphreys appeared for the Crown at the Magistrates Court and had Campbell discharged.|$|E
25|$|The Hark-1 Teams now {{operated}} in three zones. The southernmost of these sectors centered on Tchepone, but extended southward to Cambodia. The central section of Hark-1 Teams targeted the Mụ Giạ Pass area; during 1967, 15 teams operated there, with two rotating station within the pass itself. The third Hark-1 zone was Nape Pass. By contrast with American reconnaissance teams, the Lao often unobtrusively hiked long distances into their operational area {{instead of being}} inserted by helicopter. Nor were the Lao limited to team service; by <b>now,</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> begun to take over recruit training from the Thais.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the First Test at Brisbane by 70 runs to go 1–0 {{up in the}} series, but {{the real}} winners were England and Australian cricket. Before the match the press and public had been contemplating a one-sided contest in which a weak England team would be {{overwhelmed}} by Australia, <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a fighting series on their hands. Few Australians fail to credit a gutsy performance and the stock of the tourists rocketed. It was also apparent that Australia had a chink in their armour as their batting collapsed on a perfectly good wicket {{on the first day}} and had been badly shown up on the rain-affected wicket on the third, but their bowling remained strong and Jack Iverson (4/43) had justified the selector's confidence in him.|$|E

25|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, {{the wine}} {{industry}} of South Africa received very little attention on the worldwide stage. Its isolation was further deepened by boycotts of South African products in protest at the country's system of Apartheid. It wasn't until the late 1980s and 1990s when Apartheid was ended and the world's export market opened up that South African wines began to experience a renaissance. With a steep learning curve, many producers in South Africa quickly adopted new viticultural and winemaking technologies. The presence of flying winemakers from abroad brought international influences and focus on well known varieties such as Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. The reorganization of the powerful KWV co-operative into a private business further sparked innovation and improvement in quality. Vineyard owners had previously relied on KWV's price-fixing structure, that bought their excess grapes for distillation. <b>Now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to shift their focus to quality wine production in order to compete. In 1990, less than 30% of all the grapes harvested were used for wine aimed at the consumer market, with the remaining 70% being discarded, distilled into brandy or sold as table grapes and juice. By 2003 these proportions had reversed, with more than 70% of the grapes harvested that year reaching the consumer market as wine.|$|E
2500|$|The Patriots {{came out}} with the #2 seed in the AFC. The Patriots were given the bye week before they had to face the Houston Texans in a rematch of the {{previous}} Week 14 matchup. The Patriots were the highly favored team in that game, and ultimately won again, 41-28. [...] But <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to face the Baltimore Ravens in a rematch of last year's AFC Championship. Despite the Patriots leading 13-7 at halftime, the Ravens scored 21 unanswered points in the second half to win 28-13. The Ravens would go on to win Super Bowl XLVII against the 49ers.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, an {{exhibition}} which officially introduced [...] "Cubism" [...] {{to the public}} as an organized group movement, and extending through 1913, the fine arts had evolved well beyond the teachings of Cézanne. Where before, the foundational pillars of academicism had been shaken, <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been toppled. [...] "It was a total regeneration", writes Gleizes, [...] "indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realized that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it".|$|E

2500|$|In November 1966 Laverda {{exhibited}} {{the result of}} its thinking with the 650 prototype at Earls Court in London. While not an extreme sport bike in any sense, it exhibited all the virtues that Laverda had become synonymous with. [...] At the same time its appearance disrupted {{the concept of a}} big bore parallel twin being British built. [...] After this first appearance, Luciano Zen and Massimo Laverda retreated until April 1968, working hard in order to prepare the bike for production. [...] By <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> developed a 750 cc version too. [...] They were confident enough to enter four examples in the prestigious Giro d'Italia. [...] Two 650 and two 750 machines provided Laverda with victory for the 650 in her class, with three bikes finishing in the first 6 and all in the top 10! ...|$|E
2500|$|Of course, some of {{the best}} units in the north had yet seen little {{fighting}}. Had they been kept in reserve they could have been used for a decisive counter strike. But <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> lost much fighting power simply by moving to the north; hurrying south again would cost them even more. The most powerful allied division, the 1st DLM (Division Légère Mécanique, [...] "light" [...] in this case meaning [...] "mobile"), deployed near Dunkirk on the 10th, had moved its forward units 220 kilometres to the northeast, beyond the Dutch city of 's-Hertogenbosch, in 32 hours. Finding that the Dutch had already retreated to the north, it had withdrawn and was now moving to the south. When it would reach the Germans again, of its original 80 SOMUA S35 tanks only three would be operational, mostly as a result of break down.|$|E
2500|$|These forces {{enabled the}} PLO / Fatah (Fatah {{constituted}} 80% of {{the membership of}} the PLO and Fatah guerrillas controlled most of its institutions now) to transform the Western Part of Beirut into its stronghold. The PLO had taken over the heart of Sidon and Tyre in the early 1970s, it controlled great swathes of south Lebanon, in which the indigenous Shiite population had to suffer the humiliation of passing through PLO checkpoints and <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> worked their way by force into Beirut. The PLO did this with the assistance of so-called volunteers from Libya and Algeria shipped in through the ports it controlled, {{as well as a number}} of Sunni Lebanese groups who had been trained and armed by PLO/ Fatah and encouraged to declare themselves as separate militias. However, as Rex Brynen makes clear in his publication on the PLO, these militias were nothing more than [...] "shop-fronts" [...] or in Arabic [...] "Dakakin" [...] for Fatah, armed gangs with no ideological foundation and no organic reason for their existence save the fact their individual members were put on PLO/ Fatah payroll.|$|E

2500|$|Although PAVN {{had failed}} in {{its effort to}} {{eliminate}} the Royalist guerrilla army from Military Region 2, it had left the RLG irregulars in sad shape. Previous defeats had left them demoralized, and <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> almost been wiped out. The CIA's paramilitary training efforts had always had difficulty in forming and using units unless the recruits shared a common ethnicity. Hmong General Vang Pao's command of his irregular army depended on his shared ethnicity with them. The wake of Campaign 139 now found him trying to command large numbers of non-Hmong troops. Worse yet, some of the ad hoc units hastily formed for defending MR 2 consisted of mixed ethnicities, with inevitable inter-group tensions. Nor was Vang Pao's problem eased by weak, corrupt, and incompetent leadership by his subordinate battalion commanders. Their units were perpetually understrength. [...] "Ghost soldiers"—non-existent or departed soldiers whose salaries were pocketed by their commanders—might show on the unit's rolls, but obviously were not available for combat. They were still counted against unit strength, though. Under these conditions, Royalist combat refusals began to occur, not just in MR 2, but also among Special Guerrilla Units facing the Ho Chi Minh Trail, as the monarchists sometimes refused to take the offensive when ordered.|$|E
