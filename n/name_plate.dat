25|$|On May 24, the new <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> {{unveiled}} by Chen Shui-bian {{was taken}} {{down by the}} MOE. The ministry cited the costly efforts to have a constant police guard at the <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> as {{the primary reason for}} its removal. A veteran was seen spitting on the new <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> that prompted the 24-hour police presence.|$|E

All of them have <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> reading [...] "MORGAN AVE" [...] in black sans serif lettering on a white mosaic background. The mosaic <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> on the columns are unusual to the subway system, {{since most of the}} system's station-pillar <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> are merely plaques.|$|R

The SVR Kidderminster's <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> was recovered from another signal box that formerly stood on the up end of the down platform at Kidderminster station (Network Rail). The lever frame from the same signal box was reused at Arley, which has an LNWR signal box, originally from Yorton after the original was demolished. The replica <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> at Bridgnorth is made of fibre glass, {{although it is not}} known if it was moulded from the original or even if the original still exists.|$|E

Everyone else such as plainclothes police officers is issued an Identification Certificate.|$|E
25|$|Some officers, often {{belonging}} to intervention units (patrol units), only wear the rank plate {{and not the}} <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> on their uniform whilst on duty.

This {{is more common in}} urban areas than in rural (calmer) areas.|$|E

25|$|A brass <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> survives {{suggesting}} {{one of the}} Canadian outline locos {{was originally}} to have been called Black Devil. In the event this name was never used.

When offered up to the cab side of Doctor Syn the bolt holes on the rubbing matched those in the loco's cab side perfectly.|$|E

2500|$|Crashed Enemy Aircraft Reports (CEARs) were {{systematically}} {{compiled from}} April 1943. In February 1944, {{it was agreed}} that production data on enemy equipment was essential, and more extensive reports detailed the age and condition of captured equipment to give an indication of the general state of the Japanese war economy, paying particular attention to the <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> and markings which gave information on the manufacturers. Eventually a special unit known as [...] "JAPLATE" [...] was created to conduct this task, and 6,336 intact <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> or their details were collected.|$|R

25|$|Often mid-stream {{and well}} head gases require removal {{of many of}} the various {{hydrocarbon}} species contained within the natural gas. Some of these gases include heptane, pentane, propane and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above Methane (CH4) to produce a natural gas fuel which is used to operate the natural gas engines for further pressurized transmission. Typically, natural gas compressors require 950 to 1050BTU per cubic foot to operate at the natural gas engines rotational <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> specifications.|$|E

Designed by Surgeon Commander W. McLean RCNR, the badge's heraldic {{description}} is: Or, a bend wavy azure charged with a like bendlet argent. In front across the centre of a bow stringed fess-wise, and arrow point upwards in pale, both sable. The gold background of the badge indicates the wheat of the Prairies.
