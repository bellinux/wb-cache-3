500|$|Rob Salem of Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "fans {{who have been}} {{complaining}} about this season’s relative complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers." [...] Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was the most eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that [...] "every single major character gets their moment to shine"; [...] "Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television," [...] she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E
2500|$|After being {{spotted by}} Geoff Cook, Durham's coach, Onions made his second XI debut {{for the club}} {{at the age of}} 18. He was offered a {{contract}} with the club and opted to become a professional cricketer rather than take a sports science choice at university, which was his other option. Onions started in the team as the fourth bowler. Looking back on his early career, he felt that he tried too hard early on. On one occasion he recalled how [...] "I remember being thrown the ball at an important stage of a game at Scarborough, and Phil Jaques hit me for four successive fours. I was thinking 'I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do this.' But Dale Benkenstein was a huge influence as captain, and you have to learn from all those experiences. Otherwise I could not have done what I did in my first season of Test cricket. I often went for 15 to 20 runs in my first three overs, but always came back strongly." [...] In 2006, Onions regularly opened the bowling for Durham with Ottis Gibson.|$|E

60|$|It {{is to be}} considered, in any view of the {{comparative}} drunkenness of the great Anglo-Saxon race, which is the hope and example {{of the human race}} in so many things, that much if not most of our American drunkenness is alien, while English drunkenness is almost entirely native. If the inebriety of the spirited Celt, which {{in the early years of}} his adoption with us is sometimes conspicuous, were added to the sum of our home-born intoxication, there could be no doubt which was the greater. As it is, I am afraid that I cannot claim to have seen more drunken men in London than in New York; and when I think of the Family Entrance, indicated at the side-door of every one of our thousands of saloons, I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> plume myself on the superior sobriety of our drinking men's wives. As for poverty--if I am still partially on that subject--as for open misery, the misery that indecently obtrudes itself upon prosperity and begs of it, I am bound to say that I have met more of it in New York than ever I met during my sojourns in London. Such misery may be more rigidly policed in the English capital, more kept out of sight, more quelled from asking mercy, but I am sure that in Fifth Avenue, and to and fro in the millionaire blocks between that avenue and the last possible avenue eastward, more deserving or undeserving poverty has made itself seen and heard to my personal knowledge than in Piccadilly, or the streets of Mayfair or Park Lane, or the squares and places which are the London analogues of our best residential quarters.|$|E
50|$|We {{examined}} correspondence {{from the}} former Head of Border Force in June 2010 which showed that he had asked for work to be progressed to determine whether Secure ID {{should continue to be}} mandatory or altered to a discretionary check.

5000|$|Arden {{writes of}} the meaning of the play: [...] "I think that many of us must at some time have felt an overpowering urge to match some {{particularly}} outrageous piece of violence with an even greater and more outrageous retaliation. Musgrave tries to do this: {{and the fact that the}} sympathies of the play are clearly with him in his original horror, and then turn against him and his intended remedy, seems to have bewildered people... Again I would suggest that an unwillingness to dwell upon unpleasant situations that do not immediately concern us is a general human trait, and recognition of it need imply neither cynicism nor despair. Complete pacifism is a very hard doctrine: and if this play appears to advocate it with perhaps some timidity, it is probably because I am naturally a timid man -- and also because I know that if I am hit I very easily hit back: and I do not care to preach too confidently what I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> practise." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sports {{has also}} been a major {{division}} at WTAE-TV. In 1972, WTAE-TV sportscaster Myron Cope, thanks to {{a phone call from a}} local female fan, introduced the phrase [...] "The Immaculate Reception" [...] to describe Franco Harris' miraculous, running shoestring catch that gave the Pittsburgh Steelers a 13-7 playoff victory over the Oakland Raiders (Cope chuckled at the woman's call, and responded, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say that!" [...] Cope figured out an innocuous way to introduce the phrase on air, prefacing the remark by saying, [...] "It comes from a good Christian lady." [...] WTAE-TV and its channel 4 logo was immortalized in the 1979 basketball comedy film The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh, whose fictional sportscaster Murray Sports (played by Harry Shearer) was also patterned after Cope. The last sports director was Andrew Stockey, who left the position in 2006 to become a news anchor. However, in 2011, he returned to head the sports department. Along with Stockey, the sports department consists of Guy Junker, Ryan Recker, and Bill Hillgrove (Steeler Insider) as of 2013.|$|E
50|$|This episode {{marks the}} last {{appearance}} of recurring actor Jose Pablo Cantillo (Martinez), whom The Governor (David Morrissey) kills in the episode. On The Governor's reasoning for killing Martinez, Morrissey explains:I think Martinez makes {{the mistake of}} admitting weakness. He says to the Governor, “I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep this place safe.” Had he turned around to the Governor on that day where he was playing golf and said, “There is no way this camp {{is not going to}} be safe. I’m going to make it safe. I’m going to do everything I can to make it safe,” then the Governor is going to say, “Great, I’ll follow you.” But as soon as the man admits weakness, then the Governor is going to take control. And the Governor is killing him and screaming, “I don’t want it!” What he doesn’t want is the responsibility. He doesn’t want the responsibility he is forced to take because of this man’s weakness. That’s very important. He’s putting a crown on his head that he doesn’t want. But nobody else but him is worthy of wearing it.|$|E
