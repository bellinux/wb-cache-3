5|$|The Armand Bayou Nature Center in Pasadena is {{the largest}} urban {{wilderness}} preserve in the nation. It features a boardwalk through the marshes, numerous nature trails, and boat tours offering views of <b>natural</b> <b>habitats</b> for animals ranging from bison to seagulls to butterflies. The Baytown Nature Center, located on two peninsulas along the ship channel, and the Texas City Prairie Preserve, located along Moses Lake and the bay, are largely undeveloped nature preserves with views of wetlands and coastal wildlife {{in addition to a}} variety of park facilities. The Seabrook Trail System which includes Robinson and Pine Gully parks offers primitive access to <b>natural</b> <b>habitats</b> for numerous species. These sites {{are all part of the}} larger Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail.|$|E
5|$|The Himalayan Zoological Park {{exhibits}} the fauna of the Himalayas {{in their}} <b>natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> The zoo features the Himalayan black bear, red pandas, the barking deer, the snow leopard, the leopard cat, Tibetan wolf, {{masked palm civet}} and the spotted deer, amongst the others. Jawaharlal Nehru Botanical Gardens, near Rumtek, houses many species of orchid {{and as many as}} fifty different species of tree, including many oaks.|$|E
40|$|Ecologists {{and farmers}} often have {{contrasting}} perceptions {{about the value}} of <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> in agricultural production landscapes, which so far has been little acknowledged in ecology and conservation. Ecologists and conservationists often appreciate the contribution of <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> to biodiversity and potential ecosystem services such as biological pest control, whereas many farmers see habitat remnants as a waste of cropland or source of pests. While <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> has been shown to increase pest control in many systems, we here identify five hypotheses for when and why <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> can fail to support biological pest control, and illustrate each with case studies from the literature: (1) pest populations have no effective natural enemies in the region, (2) <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> is a greater source of pests than natural enemies, (3) crops provide more resources for natural enemies than does <b>natural</b> <b>habitat,</b> (4) <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> is insufficient in amount, proximity, composition, or configuration to provide large enough enemy populations needed for pest control, and (5) agricultural practices counteract enemy establishment and biocontrol provided by <b>natural</b> <b>habitat.</b> In conclusion, we show that the relative importance of <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> for biocontrol can vary dramatically depending on type of crop, pest, predator, land management, and landscape structure. This variation needs to be considered when designing measures aimed at enhancing biocontrol services through restoring or maintaining <b>natural</b> <b>habitat...</b>|$|R
50|$|Conservation may be {{classified}} as either in-situ conservation, which is protecting an endangered species in its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat,</b> or ex-situ conservation, which occurs outside the <b>natural</b> <b>habitat.</b> In-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat. Ex-situ conservation, on the other hand, involves protection outside of an organism's <b>natural</b> <b>habitat,</b> such as on reservations or in gene banks, in circumstances where viable populations may not {{be present in the}} <b>natural</b> <b>habitat.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} endemic to the United States. Its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> is rivers. It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss. The species <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> is in Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia (U.S. state).|$|R
5|$|The fern {{thrives in}} thin {{serpentine}} soils on sunny, disturbed habitats such as roadcuts and talus slopes, in dunite and other ultramafic rocks. Anthropogenic disturbance has removed thicker soils and increased sun exposure {{in many of}} these sites; for instance, many of the Quebec stations are in asbestos mines, both abandoned and active. In more <b>natural</b> <b>habitats,</b> frost weathering and erosion may promote rock fall and maintain suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their <b>natural</b> <b>habitats,</b> dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{adapt to}} various habitats. <b>Natural</b> <b>habitats</b> include {{various types of}} {{woodland}} such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands, ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth. The preferred habitats are riparian forests, brushy edges, swamps, overgrown farmlands, and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees, and parks. It has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man-made areas. Subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Japanese {{researchers}} {{took the}} first images of a live giant squid in its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat,</b> and in July 2012, a live adult was first filmed in its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> off Chichi-jima.|$|R
5000|$|The lyrebird {{has been}} {{featured}} {{as a symbol}} and emblem many times, especially in New South Wales and Victoria (where the superb lyrebird has its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat),</b> and in Queensland (where Albert's lyrebird has its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Frithia pulchra is {{a species}} of plant in the Aizoaceae family. It is endemic to Gauteng Province, South Africa. Its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> is {{temperate}} grassland. It is a summer-growing species, as its <b>natural</b> <b>habitat</b> lies in a summer-rainfall region.|$|R
5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous <b>natural</b> <b>habitats,</b> while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified as {{a threat to}} biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up <b>natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|In Europe golden jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} legal instruments. These include the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and <b>Natural</b> <b>Habitats,</b> the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of <b>Natural</b> <b>Habitats</b> and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the golden jackal is not native wildlife but an invading species. The Golden Jackal informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information on the golden jackal in Europe. The group also has an interest in the golden jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone that has an interest in golden jackals.|$|E

5|$|In South Africa and Australia, two of {{the three}} centers of species diversity, the <b>natural</b> <b>habitats</b> of these plants are {{undergoing}} a high degree of pressure from human activities. Expanding population centers (such as Queensland, Perth, and Cape Town) threaten many such habitats, as does the draining of moist areas for agriculture and forestry in rural areas. The droughts that have been sweeping Australia over the last 10 years also pose a threat to many species by drying up previously moist areas.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{smallest}} species have become extinct, requiring vigilance in the conservation of the wild species. Narcissi are increasingly under threat by over-collection and threats to their <b>natural</b> <b>habitats</b> by urban development and tourism. N. cyclamineus has been considered to be either extinct or exceedingly rare but is not currently considered endangered, and is protected. The IUCN Red List describes five species as 'Endangered' (Narcissus alcaracensis, Narcissus bujei, Narcissus longispathus, Narcissus nevadensis, Narcissus radinganorum). In 1999 three species were considered endangered, five as vulnerable and six as rare.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} tree support their own {{specialised}} invertebrates. In their <b>natural</b> <b>habitats,</b> 284 {{different species of}} insect have been found on the English oak (Quercus robur) and 306 species of invertebrate on the Tasmanian oak (Eucalyptus obliqua). Non-native tree species provide a less biodiverse community, for example in the United Kingdom the sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), which originates from southern Europe, has few associated invertebrate species, though its bark supports {{a wide range of}} lichens, bryophytes and other epiphytes.|$|E

5|$|Operating {{close to}} the power station is a fishing bait company, Seabait. Seabait uses some of the excess hot water that the plant generates to grow worms four {{times as fast as}} in the wild. The worms are used for several purposes, {{primarily}} for providing worms as bait while fishing. However, the worms are also frozen, packaged and exported to seafood farms. This is seen as environmentally beneficial as it reduces the need for bait digging in <b>natural</b> <b>habitats.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} park is quite diverse in its wildlife and vegetation, hosting approximately 804 distinct species of plants, 256 bird species, and an otherwise considerable variety of mammals, reptiles, and marine life. The entirety of the {{national park}}, including both Dilek Peninsula National Park and Büyük Menderes Delta National Park, is currently protected under the Ramsar Convention, the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and <b>Natural</b> <b>Habitats,</b> the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Barcelona Convention.|$|E
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} {{belongs to the}} family Emydidae. The {{specific}} name, insculpta, refers to the rough, sculptured surface of the carapace. This turtle species inhabits aquatic and terrestrial areas of North America, primarily the northeast of the United States and parts of Canada. Wood turtle populations are under high conservation concerns due to human interference of <b>natural</b> <b>habitats.</b> Habitat destruction and fragmentation can negatively impact the ability for wood turtles to search for suitable mates and build high quality nests.|$|E

5|$|Toxic {{peptides}} from Amanita {{species have}} been widely used in biological research as chemical agents to inhibit RNA polymerase II, an enzyme essential for protein synthesis. However, these toxic peptides can only be obtained from fruit bodies collected from <b>natural</b> <b>habitats,</b> and are consequently expensive. Some success has been reported in extracting peptide toxins directly from the mycelia of Amanita exitialis grown in liquid culture. Although the toxin concentration in the mycelium is only about 10% of that in fruiting bodies, the authors suggest that is possible to increase the amatoxin production by optimizing the growth conditions.|$|E
5|$|Afforestation {{projects}} have been undertaken to prevent groundwater pollution, secure drinking water, sequester CO2, increase biodiversity, create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand <b>natural</b> <b>habitats</b> include a rewilding effort in Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich <b>natural</b> <b>habitats</b> with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century.|$|E
