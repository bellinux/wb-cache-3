40|$|Cherry (Prunus cerasus var. Oblačinska) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{varieties}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region. Owing to the excellent sensory and physico-chemical characteristics and the very high concentration of biologically active ingredients, it is a very good potential for obtaining value added products or products with high content <b>of</b> <b>bioactive,</b> nutritionally and biologically valuable ingredients. The processing techniques of fresh fruit have a large influence on the content <b>of</b> <b>bioactive</b> components. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of processing technologies of sour cherries on the content <b>of</b> <b>bioactive</b> compounds (total phenols, total flavonoids and anthocyanins) and the antioxidant capacity. Products that were analysed were juice, concentrate, extra jam and lyophilisate. The content <b>of</b> <b>bioactive</b> components and antioxidant capacity of these products was compared with fresh cherries. The results showed that the greatest influence on the content <b>of</b> <b>bioactive</b> ingredients has process where vacuum concentration is applied.

40|$|Brazil is {{the third}} largest {{producer}} of fresh fruits in the world. Among fruits, berries such as strawberry, blueberry and blackberry can be highlighted for the benefits they provide to the body, owing to their presence <b>of</b> <b>bioactive</b> compound content. The phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins and ascorbic acid, are examples <b>of</b> <b>bioactive</b> compounds that mainly function in the body as antioxidants. However, the processing steps {{that lead to the}} generation of derivatives from these fruits, are damaging to these compounds, often leading to their loss. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} physically and chemically characterize fresh berries (strawberry, blueberry and blackberry) and their jams, and also to quantify and to evaluate the antioxidant activity <b>of</b> <b>bioactive</b> compounds in berries and their jams. The following parameters were analyzed: moisture, ash, pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, and color.

Although human {{intervention}} studies are mandatory to assess the health effects <b>of</b> <b>bioactives,</b> the in vitro approach {{is often used to}} select the most promising molecules to be studied in vivo. To avoid misleading results, concentration and chemical form, exposure time, and potential cytotoxicity <b>of</b> the tested <b>bioactives</b> should be carefully set prior to any other experiments. Methods: In this study the possible cytotoxicity <b>of</b> different <b>bioactives</b> (docosahexaenoic acid, propionate, cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside, protocatechuic acid), was investigated in HepG 2 cells using different methods. Bioactives were supplemented to cells at different concentrations within the physiological range in human blood, alone or in combination, considering two different exposure times. Results: Reported data clearly evidence that in vitro cytotoxicity is tightly related to the exposure time, and it varies among bioactives, which could exert a cytotoxic effect even at a concentration within the in vivo physiological blood concentration range. Furthermore, co-supplementation <b>of</b> different <b>bioactives</b> can increase the cytotoxic effect.
