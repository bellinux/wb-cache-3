6000|$|As Cooper's {{hopes for}} The Spy faded, his {{confidence}} in {{the viability of the}} type of imitative writing he had attempted in Precaution appears to have revived. Precaution was reviewed in a most laudatory manner in the Repository for January 1821, and the comment accompanying the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> in the Repository was: [...] "We only regret that the scene of this novel was not laid in America." [...] Whether Cooper persuaded himself or allowed himself to be persuaded by Wiley, Gardner, and other friends, he seems to have decided that his mistake in Precaution was not so much the choice of models as the choice of setting. Why not employ an American setting and continue his imitation of the British women? During 1820 Wiley, Goodrich, and William B. Gilley had jointly published a collection of Mrs. Opie's stories called Tales of the Heart; apparently they found it profitable. Accordingly, Cooper planned a series of stories which Wiley noticed as in press in the Repository for May 1822 and which he described as [...] "American Tales, by a Lady, viz. Imagination--Heart--Matter--Manner--Matter and Manner. 2 vols. 18 mo. Wiley and Halsted, New York." [...] A briefer announcement had appeared earlier, in the October 1821 issue of the Repository, although The Spy, which was certainly in press, was not noticed. In his letter of 7 January 1822 congratulating Cooper on the great success of The Spy, Wiley observed: [...] "You speak of being engaged about 'the Pioneer.'--Have you forgotten 'the American Tales,' which were commenced by a certain lady a long time ago?" ...|$|E

40|$|About 25 years ago, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} demonstrated {{that there is no}} such thing as the “hot hand” in professional basketball. When a player hits 5 or 7 shots in a row (or misses 10 in a row), what's at work is random variation, nothing more. However, random causes do not stop players, coaches, fans, and media from talking about and acting on “hot hands,” telling stories and making choices that ultimately are based on randomness. The same phenomenon is true in medicine. Some clinical trials with small numbers of events yielded positive findings, which in turn led clinicians, academics, and government officials to talk, telling stories and sometimes making choices that were later shown to be based on randomness. I provide some cardiovascular examples, such as the use of angiotensin receptor blockers for chronic heart failure, nesiritide for acute heart failure, and cytochrome P- 450 (CYP) 2 C 19 genotyping for the acute coronary syndromes. I also review the more general “decline effect,” by which drugs appear to yield a lower effect size over time.

40|$|Probating {{the estate}} {{of a person who}} has died in a traffic {{accident}} {{raises the question of whether}} to give other persons involved in the accident <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the probate proceedings when it appears that the decedent may have been at fault. One practice is to file the estate for probate quickly, giving notice only by publication and hoping that the potential claimants fail to file by claim day, generally about six months later. Then not only are their claims forever barred but their counterclaims may be barred in a wrongful death suit brought by the executor. Nebraska and other states have supported this practice in the past by holding that a tort claimant who is given only <b>notice</b> by <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> the pendency of the probate proceedings is forever precluded from presenting his claim if it was not filed in time. When the names and addresses of persons who were injured or who suffered damage in the accident are listed in the police accident report, or are otherwise easily ascertainable, it seems unjust to bar their claims after only six months without at least <b>notice</b> by mail <b>of</b> the probate proceedings. Indeed, examination of current cases in the United States Supreme Court produces the almost inescapable conclusion that known potential claimants are entitled by due process <b>of</b> law to <b>notice</b> by mail. Although no state court has as yet discussed the due process question in detail, several courts have recently allowed the holders of unliquidated tort claims to sue for recovery, at least against the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s insurance, even when the claim was barred by the nonclaim statute. The purpose of this comment is to explore the law in this area in depth. The main issues to be treated are: (1) the underlying public policies; (2) current Nebraska case law and statutory requirements (especially section 25 - 520. 01), the legislative intent behind this section, and its relationship to the due process clause; (3) limitations placed by the due process clause upon the use <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> by <b>publication</b> as a means for notifying persons of proceedings which may affect their rights in general; (4) the character of unliquidated tort claims as 2 ̆ 2 property 2 ̆ 2 within the meaning of the due process clause; (5) the kind <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> required to be given to the holders of unliquidated tort claims when their claims are (a) known, (b) not known but discoverable, or (c) not reasonably discoverable; and (6) the possibility of reaching the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s insurance whether or not claims against the estate itself are barred...|$|R
