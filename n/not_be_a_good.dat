5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo's khalasar {{arrives at}} the city of Vaes Dothrak. Viserys Targaryen impatiently waits for the army Drogo agreed to lend him, the bride price offered for his sister Daenerys, to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. When Viserys misinterprets Daenerys's {{invitation}} to dinner as an order, he becomes angry and strikes her. For the first time, Daenerys fights back, hitting her astounded brother and promising that if he raises a hand against her again, his hands will be cut off. Later, the banished knight Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> leader for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, {{the people of the}} Seven Kingdoms do not care who rules them {{as long as they are}} ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms even if Khal Drogo gave him an entire army.|$|E
25|$|Born in Lagos, Lagos State, Adebola {{was brought}} up in Liverpool after {{arriving}} in England as a baby with his family; as a schoolboy, he played in the same representative sides as Robbie Fowler. When offered a YTS place by Liverpool, the team he supported, he believed that trying to progress as a fellow left-footed striker at the club {{at the same time as}} Fowler would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea. Consequently, he accepted a similar offer from Crewe Alexandra.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{navigation}} was privately funded, {{there is no}} record of the actual cost, but Jackson, speaking in 1812 and by then named Sir George Duckett, stated that it had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> business proposition. The Lee Navigation paid the proprietors £105 in 1774, for improvements made to the junction between the two rivers. Trade increased gradually, rising from around 18,000 or 19,000 tons in 1791 to 40,000 tons in 1811.|$|R

25|$|The {{ultimately}} failed crusading efforts did {{not preclude}} Thomas from seeking expansion. The {{death of the}} heirless Ulrich of Celje reopened the possibility of seizeing Talovac lands, but his father-in-law moved more quickly, leading to a new brief cooling in their relations. In January 1458, however, a new opportunity rose on Bosnia's eastern border. The turmoil that followed the death of Lazar Branković enabled Thomas to retake the formerly Bosnian part of {{the valley of the}} Drina, conquered by Lazar's father in the preceding decade, as well as to expand into the river's right bank. Thomas captured a total of 11 towns, keeping Srebrenica, Zvornik and Teočak for himself and distributing the rest among the local nobility that swore fealty to him. He then turned his attention back to Croatia. He suggested to Venice that, since the Hungarians had not yet appointed a new ban of Croatia, he and the Republic should split the banate among themselves. In June, he warned Venice that the new Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Hunyadi's son, would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> neighbour to either Bosnia or Venice if he took hold of Croatia.|$|E
25|$|Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Sonny Crockett, but since it was not lucrative for film stars to venture into television at the time, other candidates {{were considered}}. Mickey Rourke was also {{considered for the}} role, but he turned down the offer. Larry Wilcox, of CHiPs, was also a candidate for the role of Crockett, but the producers felt that going from one police officer role to another would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fit. After dozens of candidates and a twice-delayed pilot shooting, Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas were chosen as the vice cops. For Johnson, who was by then 34 years old, NBC had particular doubts about the several earlier unsuccessful pilots in which he had starred. After two seasons, Johnson threatened to walk from the series as part of a highly publicized contract dispute. The network was ready to replace him with Mark Harmon, who had recently departed St. Elsewhere, but the network and Johnson were able to resolve their differences and he continued with the series until its end. Actor Jimmy Smits played Eddie Rivera, Crockett's partner who is killed early in the pilot episode.|$|E

According to Lawrence Wright, [...] "the entire base became paralyzed with anxiety about being thrown into the Hole. People were desperately trying to police their thoughts, but it was difficult to keep secrets when staff members were constantly being security-checked with E-Meters." [...] Wright reports that David Miscavige's statements were transcribed for the executives in the Hole, who would then have to repeatedly read them out loud to each other.|$|E
500|$|Burton and August {{also worked}} {{together}} in creating Wilbur Wonka, Willy's domineering dentist father. Burton thought the paternal character would help explain Willy Wonka himself and that otherwise {{he would be}} [...] "just a weird guy". The element of an estranged father-son relationship had previously appeared in Big Fish, similarly directed by Burton and written by August. Warner Bros. and the director held differences over the characterizations of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to entirely delete Mr. Bucket and make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure Charlie had longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> father, finding the character similar to a recluse. Burton said, [...] "In some ways, he's more screwed up than the kids." [...] Warner Bros. also wanted Charlie to be a , but Burton resisted the characterization. He wanted Charlie to be an average child who {{would be in the}} background and not get in trouble.|$|E
500|$|Portraying {{the head}} guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown {{was given the}} {{opportunity}} to speak with former guards by the production's liaison officer, but declined believing it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers. William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the Tales from the Crypt television series where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. Morgan's son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in mug shot photos, and as a prisoner shouting [...] "fresh fish" [...] as Andy arrives at Shawshank. Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the Reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility. The [...] novella's original title attracted several people to audition for the non-existent role of Rita Hayworth, including a man in drag clothing.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> commercial, it <b>is</b> radically {{different from what we}} as viewers are accustomed to seeing, there's no one in the show to root for." [...] The show's Thursday night time slot had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one for soap operas, as both Dynasty and its short-lived spin-off The Colbys did poorly. Twin Peaks was also up against the hugely successful sitcom Cheers.|$|R
2500|$|Verdi's {{experience}} in Naples for Luisa Miller had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one and {{he returned home}} to Busseto to consider the subject for his next opera. The idea for Stiffelio came from his librettist and, entering into a contract with his publisher, Ricordi, he agreed to proceed, leaving the decision as {{to the location of}} the premiere to Ricordi. This became the Teatro Grande (now the Teatro Comunale Giuseppe Verdi) in [...] Trieste and, in spite of difficulties with the censors which resulted in cuts and changes, the opera [...] - Verdi's 16th - was first performed on 16 November 1850.|$|R

She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner."

500|$|The Quintanilla family {{appointed}} Yolanda Saldívar {{as manager}} of Selena's boutiques in early 1994. Eight months later, Selena signed Saldívar as her registered agent in San Antonio, Texas. After the agreement, Saldívar moved from San Antonio to Corpus Christi {{to be closer to}} Selena. In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer after the number of staff for both stores had decreased. According to staff members, Saldívar often dismissed employees she personally disliked. Employees at the stores regularly complained about Saldívar's behavior to Selena, who dismissed the claims, believing Saldívar would not negatively impose erratic decisions on Selena's fashion venture. According to Quintanilla, Jr., the staff later turned their attention to him and began informing him about Saldívar's behavior. Quintanilla, Jr. took the claims seriously; he told Selena to [...] "be careful" [...] and said Saldívar may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> influence. Selena dismissed her father's inquiries because he had often distrusted people in the past. By January 1995, Selena's fashion designer Martin Gomez, her cousin Debra Ramirez, and clients expressed their concerns over Saldívar's behavior and management skills. During an interview with Saldívar in 1995, reporters from The Dallas Morning News said her devotion to Selena bordered on obsession.|$|E

2500|$|A recent UN {{report on}} biofuel also raises issues {{regarding}} food security and biofuel production. [...] Jean Ziegler, then UN Special Rapporteur on food, concluded {{that while the}} argument for biofuels in terms of energy efficiency and climate change are legitimate, the effects for the world's hungry of transforming wheat and maize crops into biofuel are [...] "absolutely catastrophic", and terms such use of arable land a [...] "crime against humanity". [...] Ziegler also calls for a 5-year moratorium on biofuel production. [...] Ziegler's proposal for a five-year ban {{was rejected by the}} U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon, who called for a comprehensive review of the policies on biofuels, and said that [...] "just criticising biofuel may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> solution".|$|E
2500|$|Just a {{week before}} this new wave of {{international}} controversy began, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had commented that several U.N. agencies were conducting {{a comprehensive review of}} the policy on biofuels, as the world food price crisis might trigger global instability. He said [...] "We need {{to be concerned about the}} possibility of taking land or replacing arable land because of these biofuels", then he added [...] "While I am very much conscious and aware of these problems, at the same time you need to constantly look at having creative sources of energy, including biofuels. Therefore, at this time, just criticising biofuel may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> solution. I would urge we need to address these issues in a comprehensive manner." [...] Regarding Jean Ziegler's proposal for a five-year ban, the U.N. Secretary rejected that proposal.|$|E
2500|$|Justin Fashanu, {{the first}} black £1 million footballer, was the first footballer to be openly gay. In his autobiography, Brian Clough recounts a {{dressing}} down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was going}} to gay bars. [...] "'Where do you go if you want a loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you go if you want a leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So why do you keep going to that bloody poofs' club?"' Fashanu committed suicide in 1998 after he was questioned by police when a seventeen-year-old boy accused him of sexual assault, and it has been suggested that the tragedy and hostility that struck his life after publicly coming out persuaded other gay footballers that coming out would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea. The coroner said the prejudices he experienced, plus the sexual assault charge he was facing at the time of his death, probably overwhelmed him.|$|E
