30|$|The {{thermal barrier}} {{prevents}} the environmental heat from entering into the body. This layer consists of flame resistant fibres and their blends, {{which can be}} of nonwoven, spun-laced, quilted-batting, laminated woven, lining fabric or knitted fabric. The commercial thermal barriers used in the fire-fighter’s clothing include GoreTex® (a <b>non-textile</b> <b>material</b> developed by WL Gore Company), Airlock® (a combination of moisture barrier and thermal protection) and Spacers (made of foamed silicone on the GoreTex® moisture barrier to create the insulating air buffer in the material. The inner liner protects the direct contact of fire-fighter with the thermal barrier. The fabric is prepared from fine yarn of Nomex and other fibres (93 % Nomex/ 5 % Kevlar/ 2 % antistatic carbon fibre). The use of finer yarns improves the softness and tactile comfort of the fire-fighter and they feel slight slick, which makes donning and doffing easier. This fabric may contain a wick finish, which assists in wicking moisture away from the body.|$|E

Consulting, training, general duties (standardisation, collaboration in technical and environmental regulations, technical basic support for installation of laws) are taken over {{in the interest of the}} associated businesses.|$|R
5000|$|The Simplicity Pattern Company is a {{manufacturer}} of sewing pattern guides, under the [...] "Simplicity Pattern," [...] "It's So Easy" [...] and [...] "New Look" [...] brands. The company, now owned by Wrights, began in 1927 in New York City. During the Great Depression, Simplicity allowed home seamstresses to create fashionable clothing in a reliable manner. The patterns have been manufactured in Niles, Michigan, since 1931, but the products are distributed and sold in Canada, England, and Australia. In some markets, the patterns are sold by Burda, and they are sold by third party distributors in Mexico and South Africa. The company licenses {{its name to the}} manufacture of <b>non-textile</b> <b>materials</b> such as sewing machines, doll house kits, and sewing supplies.|$|R
5000|$|Quipus are now {{preserved}} using {{techniques that}} will minimise their future degradation. Museums, archives and special collections have adopted preservation guidelines from textile practices. Quipus {{are made of}} fibers, either spun and plied thread such as wool or hair from alpaca, llama, guanaco or vicuña, though are also commonly made of cellulose like cotton. The knotted strings of quipus were often made with an [...] "elaborate system of knotted cords, dyed in various colors, the significance of which was known to the magistrates". Fading of color, natural or dyed, cannot be reversed, and may indicate further damage to the fibers. Colors can darken if attacked by dust or by certain dyes and mordants. Quipus have been found with adornments, such as animal shells, attached to the cords, and these <b>non-textile</b> <b>materials</b> may require additional preservation measures.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research details an investigation into processes employing laser technology to create design-led three-dimensional textiles. An analysis of historical and contemporary methods for making three-dimensional textiles categorises these as processes that construct a three-dimensional textile, processes that apply or remove material from an existing textile to generate three-dimensionality or processes that form an existing textile into a three-dimensional shape. Techniques used in these processes are a combination of joining, cutting, forming or embellishment. Laser processing is embedded in textile manufacturing for cutting and marking. This research develops three novel processes: 	laser-assisted template pleating which offers full design freedom and may be applied to both textile and <b>non-textile</b> <b>materials.</b> The language of origami is used to describe designs and inspire new design. 	laser pre-processing of cashmere cloth which facilitates surface patterning through laser interventions in the manufacturing cycle. 	laser sintering on textile substrates which applies additive manufacturing techniques to textiles for the generation of three-dimensional surface patterning and structures. A method is developed for determining optimum parameters for laser processing materials. It may be used by designers for parameter selection for processing new materials or parameter modification when working across systems...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} interest in natural materials, connecting with so-called comeback {{of man to}} nature, couses an increasing consumption of raw-materials for their production. One {{of the most important}} resorts producing these source is agriculture. The growing of so-called alternative plants on arable soil for following processing in non-food industry, firstly provides renewable sources for processing industry and secondly it also solves a problem of agricultural overproduction in Western Europe. Flax surely belongs to a group of alternative plants. The traditional technology of growing, harvesting and processing consist in the long flax fibre production for production of natural, flax fabrics. New non-traditional technologies produce short fibre for production of mixed yarn (cotton-flax), but also for <b>non-textile</b> processing (building <b>materials,</b> plastic materials, biodegradable products and packing). The aim of this work was to do practical field testing of parameters of newly imported machinery for two-phase harvesting technology, and also test possibilities of using of non-traditional harvesting technologies and following processing. The field testing of imported machinery showed that this machinery operates with high quality of work, especially precise putting straws on the line. The measured figures in the field testing of the quality of desseding is not always satisfactory. The main reason of the high losses (20, 69 %) I assume, is incorrect adjustment of the machinery. Calculated efficiencies of measured machinery in the field testing failed to reach maximum values given by manufacturer of machinery. For the judging of non-traditional technology we choosed technique, which did not need any additional investment costs. This technique used machinery for harvesting stemmed materials. We compared two variants: one with moving and second with pulling. For deseeding we used combine harvester with picking adapter. Straws were during retting two times turned and on the end pressed to the gig square bales. The gained wirr-straw was processed on the tow processing line. The better variant was the mowing. The retted straw yield was lower (4, 11 %) and the seed yield was higher (25, 52 %) in compare with the variant of the puling. The harvest costs of the mowing variant are also more profitable (4 995 Ck per ha) while the costs of the pulling method were higher (5 941 Ck per ha) and the average costs of the traditional harvest technology were 6809 Ck per ha. In my opinion the non-traditional harvesting technology should be used in case of flax being of lower quality or damaged. In these cases not even the use of the new and powerful machinery can ensure production of first-rate-flax, which attracts costumers. On the other hand a little decline of retted straw quality means huge depreciation the price. The saved costs in non-traditional harvesting technology can compensate lower trade price. Because the Czech Republic wants to enter EU it is necessary to continue in subvention of growing flax, the subsidy in EU is 815 ECU per hectareAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
