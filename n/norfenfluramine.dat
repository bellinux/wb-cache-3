50|$|<b>Norfenfluramine,</b> or 3-trifluoromethyl{{amphetamine}}, is a never-marketed drug of the amphetamine family which behaves as a serotonin and norepinephrine {{releasing agent}} and potent 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C agonist. The action of <b>norfenfluramine</b> on 5-HT2B receptors on heart valves {{leads to a}} characteristic pattern of heart failure following proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts on the tricuspid valve, known as cardiac fibrosis. This side effect led to the withdrawal of fenfluramine as an anorectic agent worldwide, and to the withdrawal of benfluorex in Europe, as both fenfluramine and benfluorex form <b>norfenfluramine</b> as an active metabolite. It is a human TAAR1 agonist.|$|E

50|$|The {{distinctive}} valvular abnormality {{seen with}} fenfluramine is a thickening of the leaflet and chordae tendineae. One mechanism {{used to explain}} this phenomenon involves heart valve serotonin receptors, which are thought to help regulate growth. Since fenfluramine and its active metabolite <b>norfenfluramine</b> stimulate serotonin receptors, this {{may have led to}} the valvular abnormalities found in patients using fenfluramine. In particular <b>norfenfluramine</b> is a potent inhibitor of the re-uptake of 5-HT into nerve terminals. 5-HT2B receptors. Fenfluramine and its active metabolite <b>norfenfluramine</b> affect the 5-HT2B receptors which are plentiful in human cardiac valves. The suggested mechanism by which fenfluramine causes damage is through over or inappropriate stimulation of these receptors leading to inappropriate valve cell division. Supporting this idea is the fact that this valve abnormality has also occurred in patients using other drugs that act on 5-HT2B receptors.|$|E
50|$|Fenfluramine, {{a related}} drug, had been {{withdrawn}} from the market in 1997 after reports of heart valve disease, pulmonary hypertension, and development of cardiac fibrosis. This side effect is mediated by the metabolite <b>norfenfluramine</b> on 5HT2B receptors of heart valves (Rothman et al., Circulation 2000), leading to a characteristic pattern of heart failure following proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts on the tricuspid valve. Both fenfluramine and benfluorex form <b>norfenfluramine</b> as a metabolite. This side effect led to the withdrawal of fenfluramine as an anorectic drug worldwide, and later to the withdrawal of benfluorex in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|... 5-Trifluoromethyl-2-aminoindane (TAI) is a {{psychoactive drug}} and {{research}} chemical with putative entactogenic effects. It {{functions as a}} selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA). TAI is the aminoindane analogue of <b>norfenfluramine</b> and is approximately 50% as neurotoxic in comparison.|$|E
50|$|Levonorfenfluramine, {{an active}} {{metabolite}} of levofenfluramine, {{is also a}} fairly potent serotonin releasing agent (with a potency of approximately 1/2 that of <b>norfenfluramine</b> and 1/6th that of dexfenfluramine) and, similarly to dexnorfenfluramine, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor agonist, {{as well as a}} somewhat less potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (about 1/2 that of its efficacy as a serotonin releaser). As such, likely contributes significantly to the biological activity—though not necessarily appetite suppressant effects—of not only levofenfluramine but of racemic fenfluramine as well. In contrast to levonorfenfluramine, levofenfluramine is virtually inactive as a reuptake inhibitor or releaser of norepinephrine, and neither compound has any effect on dopamine reuptake or release.|$|E
50|$|PRX-08066 {{is a drug}} {{discovered}} and developed by Predix (later Epix) Pharmaceuticals S. Dhanoa et al. Patent US 7,030,240 B2, which acts as a potent and selective antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, with a 5-HT2B binding affinity (Ki) of 3.4nM, and high selectivity over the closely related 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and other receptor targets. PRX-08066 and other selective 5-HT2B antagonists are being researched {{for the treatment of}} pulmonary arterial hypertension, following the discovery that the potent 5-HT2B agonist <b>norfenfluramine</b> produces pulmonary arterial hypertension and subsequent heart valve damage. In animal studies, PRX-08066 has been found to reduce several key indicators of pulmonary arterial hypertension and improved cardiac output, with similar efficacy to established drugs for this condition such as bosentan, sildenafil, beraprost and iloprost. It is also being researched for potential anti-cancer applications, due to its ability to inhibit fibroblast activation.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} reports associating {{fenfluramine}} with depression, psychosis, exacerbation of pre-existing psychosis (schizophrenia), and sleep disturbances. These effects may be mediated by serotonergic neurotoxicity/depletion of serotonin with chronic administration and/or activation 5-HT2A receptors. In overdose, fenfluramine can result in serotonin syndrome and death. Unlike various other amphetamine derivatives, fenfluramine {{is reported to be}} dysphoric, [...] "unpleasantly lethargic", and non-addictive. However, it has been reported to be used recreationally at high doses ranging between 80 and 400 mg, which have been described as producing euphoria, amphetamine-like effects, sedation, and hallucinogenic effects, along with anxiety, nausea, diarrhea, and sometimes panic attacks, as well as depressive symptoms once the drug had worn off. At high doses (e.g., 240 mg, or between 200-600 mg), fenfluramine induces a psychedelic state resembling that produced by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). While fenfluramine binds only very weakly to the 5-HT2 receptors, its active metabolite <b>norfenfluramine</b> binds to and activates the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors with high affinity and the 5-HT2A receptor with moderate affinity; as such, indirect (via induction of serotonin release) and/or direct activation of the 5-HT2A receptor would be expected to be responsible for the psychedelic effects of the drug at sufficient doses.|$|E
40|$|An assay {{procedure}} utilizing electron-capture {{gas chromatography}} {{was developed for}} simultaneous analysis of fenfluramine and <b>norfenfluramine.</b> This method was applied to brain and liver samples from rats which had been injected with fenfluramine with or without pretreatment with iprindole. The tissues from rats treated with fenfluramine showed extensive formation of <b>norfenfluramine,</b> consistent with findings reported previously in the literature. Pretreatment with iprindole led {{to an increase in}} brain and liver levels of fenfluramine, and, unexpectedly, to a marked decrease in levels of <b>norfenfluramine</b> in these tissues. These findings suggest that iprindole blocks N-deethylation and that it may be a useful tool with which to study the effects of fenfluramine in the absence of <b>norfenfluramine.</b> The results also emphasize the importance of considering drug-drug interactions in future research on fenfluramine...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} glycerolipid {{synthesis}} {{of a series}} of compounds including many drugs were investigated in cell-free preparations and slices of rat liver. p-Chlorobenzoate, p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate, halofenate, D-amphetamine, adrenaline, procaine and N-[2 -(4 -chloro- 3 -sulphamoylbenzoyloxy) ethyl]norfenfluramine had little inhibitory effect on any of the systems investigated. Two amphiphilic anions, clofenapate and 2 -(p-chlorophenyl) - 2 -(m-trifluoromethylphenoxy) acetate, both inhibited glycerol phosphate acyltransferase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase at approx. 1. 6 and 0. 7 mm respectively. Clofenapate (1 mm) also inhibited the incorporation of glycerol into lipids by rat liver slices without altering the relative proportions of the different lipids synthesized. The amphilic amines, mepyramine, fenfluramine, <b>norfenfluramine,</b> hydroxyethylnorfenfluramine, N-(2 -benzoyloxyethyl) <b>norfenfluramine,</b> cinchocaine, chlorpromazine and demethylimipramine inhibited phosphatidate phosphohydrolase by 50 % at concentrations between 0. 2 and 0. 9 mm. The last four compounds inhibited glycerol phosphate acyltransferase by 50 % at concentrations between 1 and 2. 6 mm. None of the amines examined appeared to be an effective inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase. <b>Norfenfluramine,</b> hydroxyethylnorfenfluramine and N-(2 -benzoyloxyethyl) <b>norfenfluramine</b> produced less inhibition of glycerol incorporation into total lipids than was observed with equimolar clofenapate. The major effect of these amines in liver slices was to inhibit triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine synthesis and to produce a marked accumulation of phosphatidate. The results are discussed in terms of the control of glycerolipid synthesis. They partly explain the observed effects of the various drugs on lipid metabolism. The possible use of these compounds as biochemical tools with which to investigate the reactions of glycerolipid synthesis is considered...|$|E
40|$|Fifty {{women with}} {{refractory}} obesity received fenfluramine for 20 weeks. Every two weeks details of weight change, drug dose, degree of anorexia, and any side effects were recorded and plasma was obtained for fenfluramine and <b>norfenfluramine</b> measurements. Of the 41 patients available for final analysis 26 achieved a maximum plateau dose of 160 mg/day. Plasma fenfluramine concentrations did not correlate with {{the degree of}} anorexia or with the incidence of side effects other than the severity of dream disturbance. There was a highly significant relation between weight loss and plasma fenfluramine and <b>norfenfluramine</b> concentrations and also between weight loss {{and the presence of}} sustained anorexia. Women who achieved mean plateau concentrations over 200 ng/ml lost a mean 8. 8 kg while those with concentrations less than 100 ng/ml lost a mean of only 2. 1 kg. When fenfluramine is prescribed in refractory obesity the dose should be increased stepwise until either satisfactory weight loss is achieved or troublesome side effects appear...|$|E

40|$|This body of {{research}} explored mitral valve remodeling due {{to changes in the}} mechanical and chemical environments of the tissue in order to better predict patient response to medical device and drug therapies. This work was novel both in its characterization of the mitral valve and in the consideration of the impacts of the biological environment on the multilayered valve structure. Left ventricular dilation due to congestive heart failure (CHF) changes the mechanical forces experienced by the mitral valve. Collagen, cellular, glycosaminoglycan, and proteoglycan compositions of valve tissues were therefore compared between CHF patients treated with and without the left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Mechanical properties of these tissues were also tested to assess effects of matrix changes on valve function. Since mechanical stimulation was determined to be required to maintain valve structure and function, a novel splashing bioreactor was then designed to maintain the valve mechanical environment in vitro in preparation for studies altering the chemical environment of the tissue. Alter validation, this bioreactor was used to study initial changes to valve structure alter two weeks of organ culture with media containing the serotonin receptor agonists serotonin and <b>norfenfluramine</b> (fen-phen) as well as a receptor antagonist. In the mechanical stimulation study, CHF valve tissue exhibited fibrotic remodeling compared to normal tissue, impeding normal mitral valve function. LVAD treatment, while it tended to restore functionality of the mitral valve chordae, encouraged compensatory remodeling that did not improve leaflet structure or mechanical behavior. Conversely, the gentle stretching provided by bioreactor was deemed sufficient to maintain matrix composition after two weeks of culture. Serotonin and <b>norfenfluramine</b> exposure appeared to upregulate different proteoglycans within the mitral valve structure, and exposure to a serotonin receptor antagonist had varying levels in success in blocking these drug effects. The results from these studies showed that changes to the mechanical (CHF and LVAD) and chemical (serotonin and <b>norfenfluramine)</b> environments altered mitral valve tissue structure and function. These effects of device use and drug therapies should be considered when assessing treatment for pathologies, such as CHF and obesity, which may not appear to directly impact the mitral valve...|$|E
40|$|<b>Norfenfluramine,</b> {{the major}} {{metabolite}} of fenfluramine, causes vasoconstriction {{dependence on the}} 5 -hydroxytrypta-mine (5 -HT) 2 A receptor in rat. () -Norfenfluramine was reported as a 5 -hydroxytryptamine transporter (5 -HTT) substrate and 5 -HT releaser. Because the arterial 5 -HTT exists and is func-tional in the rat, we hypothesized that () -norfenfluramine causes vasoconstriction by releasing 5 -HT from vascular smooth muscle via 5 -HTT. The released 5 -HT, in turn, activates the 5 -HT 2 A receptor. Isometric contractility experiments showed that () -norfenfluramine-induced mouse aortic con-traction was reduced by the 5 -HTT inhibitor fluoxetine (1 M) but not by fluvoxamine (1 M).

40|$|Dexfenfluramine was {{approved}} in the United States for long-term {{use as an}} appetite suppressant until it {{was reported to be}} associated with valvular heart disease. The valvular changes (myofibroblast proliferation) are histopathologically indistin-guishable from those observed in carcinoid disease or after long-term exposure to 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 2 -preferring ergot drugs (ergotamine, methysergide). 5 -HT 2 receptor stim-ulation is known to cause fibroblast mitogenesis, which could contribute to this lesion. To elucidate the mechanism of “fen-phen”-associated valvular lesions, we examined the interaction of fenfluramine and its metabolite <b>norfenfluramine</b> with 5 -HT 2 receptor subtypes and examined the expression of these re-ceptors in human and porcine heart valves.

40|$|International audienceSince 1976, {{benfluorex}} {{has been}} approved in Europe as a hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic drug, and is commonly used {{in the treatment of}} the metabolic syndrome. As a derivative of fenfluramine with an appetite suppressant action, benfluorex is preferentially used in overweight patients. In contrast to fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, to date, benfluorex has not been reported to be associated with frequent cardiovascular side-effects. The present study reports five cases of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and one case of valvular heart disease occurring in patients exposed to benfluorex. These individuals were middle age, diabetic females with a body mass index ranging 24. 2 - 49 kg x m(- 2). No definite causal effect for cardiovascular disease with benfluorex can be drawn from such case reports. However, as benfluorex, like dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine, is metabolised into active metabolite <b>norfenfluramine,</b> further extensive assessment of drug exposure in newly diagnosed pulmonary arterial hypertension or valvular heart disease patients is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Although 5 HT 2 A receptors mediate contractions {{of normal}} arteries to {{serotonin}} (5 HT), in some cardiovascular diseases, other receptor subtypes {{contribute to the}} marked increase in serotonin contractions. We hypothesized that enhanced contractions of arteries from diabetics to 5 HT are mediated by an increased contribution from multiple 5 HT receptor subtypes. We compared responses to selective 5 HT receptor agonists and expression of 5 HT receptor isoforms (5 HT 1 B, 5 HT 2 A, and 5 HT 2 B) in aorta from nondiabetic (ND) compared to type 2 diabetic mice (DB, BKS. Cg-Dock 7 m+/+Leprdb/J). 5 HT, 5 HT 2 A (TCB 2 and BRL 54443), and 5 HT 2 B (<b>norfenfluramine</b> and BW 723 C 86) receptor agonists produced concentration-dependent contractions of ND arteries that were markedly increased in DB arteries. Neither ND nor DB arteries contracted to a 5 HT 1 B receptor agonist. MDL 11939, a 5 HT 2 A receptor antagonist, and LY 272015, a 5 HT 2 B receptor antagonist, reduced contractions of arteries from DB to 5 HT more than ND. Expression of 5 HT 1 B, 5 HT 2 A, and 5 HT 2 B receptor subtypes was similar in ND and DB. Inhibition of rho kinase decreased contractions to 5 HT and 5 HT 2 A and 5 HT 2 B receptor agonists in ND and DB. We conclude that in contrast to other cardiovascular diseases, enhanced contraction of arteries from diabetics to 5 HT is not due {{to a change in}} expression of multiple 5 HT receptor subtypes...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} profiles for fenfluramine (Fen) and its metabolite <b>norfenfluramine</b> (Norf) {{into black}} hair and white hair of Zucker rats and into white hair of Wistar rats after intraperitoneal (i. p.) administration of Fen or N-nitrosofenfluramine (N-Fen) were studied in great detail. The target compounds were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection using 4 -(4, 5 -diphenyl- 1 H-imidazol- 2 -yl) benzoyl chloride as a derivatization reagent. After repeated i. p. administration of Fen (5 mg/kg) for 4 days to Zucker rats, shaft and root samples {{of black and white}} hair were obtained 1 week after the first administration. It was surprising that Fen and Norf levels in root samples of white hair were much higher than those in shaft or root samples of black hair, strongly suggesting that unknown mechanisms other than the action of melanin take place in the white hair root. Time course profiles for Fen and Norf after administration of a single i. p. dose of Fen or N-Fen were constructed for Zucker and Wistar rats. The percent level of Fen or Norf in white hair was 15 - 50 % of that in black hair at any interval within 600 min after a single administration of Fen in Zucker rats. Even with Wistar rats having only white hair, we could demonstrate the time courses for incorporation of Fen and Norf into white hair. Finally, time course profiles for Fen and Norf were also followed after a single i. p. administration of N-Fen; this experiment showed that the levels of Norf were much higher than those of Fen for both black and white hair samples of Zucker rats at any interval tested...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, obesity has been {{identified}} as an important driver of morbidity and mortality in the western countries. As a result, pharmacological approaches have been developed to fight obesity, including amphetamine-like drugs acting through a central appetite-suppressant effect. These compounds knew a significant marketing and sales success as early as the years 1960. Very soon after market access, caution has been raised on a potential risk for the cardiovascular system with the use of aminorex, leading to a first outbreak of "primary pulmonary hypertension" (PPH) in the European countries were it was available. A decade later, convincing epidemiological evidence accumulated supporting that both fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were definite risk factor for the development of PPH, now called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In addition, these drugs appeared to be responsible for severe mitral and aortic regurgitations similar to carcinoid syndrome leading to surgery or death. Similar to aminorex, the cases of anorectic-drug induced complications abated after market withdrawal. Despite these serious warnings, the story repeated itself recently when a chemically similar compound called benfluorex, licensed to treat resistant diabetes and dyslipidemia, has been suspected to be responsible for almost identical cardiovascular complications. This is explained in a large part by the effect of <b>norfenfluramine,</b> the active metabolite of benfluorex, through it's high affinity for the serotonin receptor 5 -HT 2 B responsible for the fenfluramine-induced valvular heart diseases. Curiously, benfluorex has only been withdrawn from the French market after more than 20 years of access and six years after the first publication of suspected cases. A good decision? Very likely. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the epidemiological and physiopathological evidence linking fenfluramine-derived drugs to cardiovascular complications, and to discuss the currently available data on benfluorex.
