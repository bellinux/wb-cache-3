40|$|In the IEEE 802. 11 MAC layer protocol, {{the basic}} access method is the Distributed Coordination Function {{which is based}} on the CSMA/CA. In this paper, we {{investigate}} the performance of IEEE 802. 11 DCF in the non-saturation condition. We assume that there is a fixed number n of competing stations and packet arrival process to a station is a poisson process. We model IEEE 802. 11 DCF in <b>non-saturation</b> <b>mode</b> by 3 -dimensional Markov chain and derive the stationary distribution of the Markov chain by applying matrix analytic method. We obtain the probability generating function of packet service time and access delay, and throughput...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple unified {{analytical}} model {{to analyze the}} IEEE 802. 11 DCF infrastructure BSS performance in terms of MAC delay, PLR, and throughput efficiency under non-homogeneous and non-saturation conditions. Our model accounts for: (i) asymmetric traffic load between an AP and its associated STAs of an infrastructure BSS; (ii) transition from the <b>non-saturation</b> to saturation <b>mode</b> (and vice-versa) from an AP perspective; (iii) heterogeneous traffic flows between STAs; and (iv) heterogeneous wireless channel conditions between BSSs of a multi-AP hotspot scenario, all in a single unifying framework. More specifically, we integrate a Markov chain model {{in conjunction with a}} finite queueing model to analyze the QoS performance of DCF infrastructure BSS, which will be useful for capacity analysis and the design of network control mechanisms. Extensive analyses and simulations have unveiled that the improper modeling or ignorant of backoff freezing for an infrastructure BSS will result in overly conservative bounds which will lead to low network utilization when deployed as admission control, particularly, in heavy load scenarios...|$|R
