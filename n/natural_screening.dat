50|$|On May 11 the Kasson Planning and Zoning Commission in a 6-1 vote {{recommended}} that the city council approve a conditional use permit (CUP) for the school property to allow multifamily housing on the site. The commission also {{recommended that}} the city council approve a variance to allow less than 50 percent green space on the property. The general consensus was that the project, which would remove some paved areas, increased permeability over the existing condition. The room was packed with people. Tom Anderson from Cohen-Esrey made a presentation. Before voting, the commission debated how {{to strike a balance}} with the citizens and neighbors of the building who opposed the project and those supporting the school's reuse. Neighbors who opposed the project stated the density of 24 multi-family units was too large for the single family residential neighborhood. Concerns about additional traffic and other issues were also discussed. However, Minnesota law states that a CUP cannot be denied based on citizen input if the CUP application meets the requirements listed in the city code. In the end the Commission decided that the CUP application met the approval requirements listed in the cities' code and the variance was approved allowing the installation of impermeable surface over 60% of the property. The Planning Commission put the following conditions on the CUP:1. The Developer must install a combination fence and <b>natural</b> <b>screening</b> border acceptable to t the Zoning Administrator prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy2. The Developer must provide at least one outdoor, on-site smoking area acceptable to the Zoning Administrator prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.3.

To derive new {{starter culture}} strains with weak post-acidification capacity, Lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus LY were {{screened}} by <b>natural</b> <b>screening</b> and inducing screening treated with ultraviolet and diethyl sulfate.

The <b>natural</b> <b>screening,</b> diethyl sulfate and ultraviolet treated mutants showed 5. 1 %, 5. 9 % and 11. 9 % lower post-acidification capacity than original strain at 25 ℃, respectively.

40|$|For years, many {{efforts have}} been made to {{discover}} new drugs using plants as <b>natural</b> <b>screening</b> libraries. In this study, extracts of 43 Tanzanian medicinal plants were screened for their potential inhibitory effect on P-gp, using the secretory transport of Cyclosporin A (CsA) in the Caco- 2 system as a measure of the functionality of P-gp efflux. Two out of these 43 plant extracts (extracts of Annickia kummeriae and Acacia nilotica) appeared to have a modulatory effect on P-gp related efflux carriers. In presence of the extract of Annickia kummeriae, a concentration dependent decrease on the polarity in transport of CsA was observed; the inhibitory effect of this extract on P-gp was comparable to that of valspodar, a known P-gp inhibiting agent. The exact nature of the active components of these botanicals remains to be identified. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Microalgae {{constitute}} {{a large and}} diverse group of unicellular phototrophic and heterotrophic organisms, which comprise {{the base of the}} food chain and are evolutionarily distinct from other species. They have emerged as a promising group in the production of bioproducts and biofuel, {{as well as for the}} remediation of effluents. Indigenous populations have used microalgae for centuries and the commercial application of microalgae has been extensively reviewed [1 – 4]. The efficiency of the microalgal production process depends on higher biomass, yield, productivity, and process robustness. These parameters highly depend on the host microorganism. <b>Natural</b> <b>screening,</b> mutagenesis, selection, bioprocess development, genetic engineering, and metabolic engineering strategies have been adopted to increase the metabolic capabilities of the host microorganisms [5]. Nevertheless, problems such as the accumulation of toxic intermediates or metabolic stress resulting in a decreased cellular fitness need to be solved. The lack of knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms of key enzymes and the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype are still barriers to the development of efficient cell factories. The overexpression, deletion, or introduction of heterologous genes in specific metabolic pathways does not always result in the desired phenotype. Recent remarkable innovations in platforms for omics-based research and application development have provided crucial solutions to these problems. A combinatorial approach using multiple omics platforms and the integration of their outcomes is now an effective strategy for clarifying the molecular systems that are integral to improving algal productivity...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} a novel ab-initio {{technique}} to study transport in atomic scale devices {{based on a}} self-consistent solution of the Kohn-Sham equations for open systems {{in and out of}} equilibrium. Starting from the central motivating theorems of density functional theory, we introduce the basis of the ab-initio technique as currently practiced in condensed matter physics. The Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian is solved numerically by employing a Fireball atomic orbital basis set to transform the problem into matrix form. In order to study open systems, a <b>natural</b> <b>screening</b> approximation is introduced and it is demonstrated that, for the systems studied in this work, the Kohn-Sham potential is effectively screened and the screening approximation is appropriate for the study of atomic scale devices. The method developed in this thesis is contrasted with previous studies of transport in atomic scale devices and it is argued that it presents a significant advance and makes it possible to solve problems which could not previously be studied. A few representative studies were undertaken in order to illustrate the advantage of using a self-consistent ab-initio method to study quantum transport in open systems. Several short carbon chains were coupled to Al electrodes and it was found that charge transfer plays a role in aligning the Fermi level with standing wave resonance peaks inside the atomic chain. Our study of a C 60 molecular junction predicts a substantial equilibrium conductance due to charge transfer doping of three extra electrons inside the C 60. Furthermore, these extra electrons may be depleted by an external gate voltage, reducing the conductance and thus producing a field-effect molecular switch. Transport and charge transfer were studied in a number of nanotube devices. Preliminary results are in agreement with recent experimental and theoretical results...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly {{identify}} active compounds {{in a complex}} mixture (e. g., natural products extract) {{is still one of}} the major problems in <b>natural</b> products <b>screening</b> programs. An elegant way to overcome this problem is to separate the complex mix-ture by gradient liquid chromatography followed by online biochemical detection parallel with chemical characterization, re-ferred to as high-resolution screening (HRS). To find and identify phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors in natural products ex-tracts using the HRS technology, the authors developed a continuous-flow PDE enzymatic assay. The suitability of the continuous-flow PDE enzymatic assay for <b>natural</b> products <b>screening</b> was demonstrated. After optimization of the continuous-flow PDE assay, the limit of detection for 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methyl-xanthine (IBMX) was 1 µM, with a dynamic range from 1 to 100 µMIBMX. The applicability of the HRS technology for the detection of PDE inhibitors in natural products extracts was demonstrated by the analysis of a plant extract spiked with 2 naturally occurring PDE inhibitors. The plant extract was ana-lyzedwith 2 assay lines in parallel, enabling background fluorescence correction of the sample. The simultaneous quantifica-tion of the active compounds using evaporative light-scattering detection allowed the estimation of the IC 50 value of the active compounds directly in the crude extract.
