The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the antioxidant activity of astaxanthin present in two <b>natural</b> <b>extracts</b> from Haematococcus pluvialis, a microalgae strain, with that of synthetic astaxanthin. <b>Natural</b> <b>extracts</b> were obtained either by solvent or supercritical extraction methods. UV, HPLC-DAD and (HPLC-(atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) +) /ion trap-MS) characterizations of both <b>natural</b> <b>extracts</b> showed similar compositions of carotenoids, but different percentages in free astaxanthin and its ester derivatives. The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay showed that <b>natural</b> <b>extracts</b> containing esters displayed stronger antioxidant activities than free astaxanthin. Their antioxidant capacities to inhibit intracellular oxidative stress were then evaluated on HUVEC cells. The intracellular antioxidant activity in <b>natural</b> <b>extracts</b> was approximately 90 -times higher than synthetic astaxanthin (5 µM). No modification, neither in the morphology nor in the viability, of vascular human cells was observed by in vitro biocompatibility study up to 10 µM astaxanthin concentrations. Therefore, these results revealed the therapeutic potential of the <b>natural</b> <b>extracts</b> in vascular human cell protection against oxidative stress without toxicity, which could be exploited in prevention and/or treatment of cardiovascular diseases...|$|R

50|$|Ordinary or warm soluble {{quebracho}} (also {{known as}} insoluble quebracho) is the <b>natural</b> <b>extract</b> obtained {{directly from the}} quebracho wood. This type of extract is rich in condensed tannins of natural high molecular weight (phlobaphenes), which are not easily soluble. Its use is therefore limited to small additions during sole leather tannage carried out in hot liquors (temperature above 35 °C) to improve the yield and the water-proofness of the leather. The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a sulfiting process which transforms the phlobaphenes into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble quebracho extracts are the most universally known and used types. The main properties of these extracts are: a very rapid penetration, a high tannin content and a relatively low percentage of non-tannins. The rather low acid and medium salt content characterise them as mild tanning extracts (low astringency).|$|E
50|$|Like {{all other}} stingless bees, Trigona spinipes is highly social. When foraging, the workers utilize {{polarized}} odor-trail communication to relay {{the locations of}} food sources to each other. Unlike classic pheromone trails which extend from the food source to the nest, these polarized pheromone signals are short and do not reach the nest. They likely evolved to be short so as to not lead eavesdropping predators back to their nest. What makes these trails polarized {{is that they are}} strongest at the food source and taper off moving away from it. This allows other bees following the signal to arrive at the food in large numbers without wasting time looking for food along the trail. Octyl octanoate is the most significant component of the trail pheromone. It is emitted from the cephalic labial glands of Trigona spinipes and makes up approximately 74% of the secretion. Studies found synthetically produced octyl octanoate to be equally attractive to <b>natural</b> <b>extract</b> derived from the labial glands of foragers.|$|E

Logs are inserted into planers to produce chips {{that are used to}} produce the quebracho extract by boiling them in vats. It is used for fine leather tanning and imparts a red-brown color. Ordinary or warm soluble quebracho (also known as insoluble Quebracho) is the <b>natural</b> <b>extract</b> obtained directly from the quebracho wood. This type of extract is rich in condensed tannins of natural high molecular weight (phlobaphenes), which are not easily soluble. Its use is therefore limited to addition of small amounts during the process of tanning leather intended for shoe soles in hot liquids (temperature above 35 °C) to improve the yield and the water-proofness of the leather. The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a sulphiting process which transforms the phlobaphenes into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble quebracho extracts are the most universally known and used types. The chemical structure of these extracts can be described as polymers of epicatechin. The main properties of these extracts are: a very rapid penetration, a high tannin content and a relatively low percentage of non-tannins. The rather low acid and medium salt content characterise them as mild tanning extracts (low astringency). Quebracho tannins give an important added value to the quality of leathers, such as vacchetta, belts and garments, making them more compact and tear resistant with a pleasant touch. The sulphited quebracho extract may be carcinogenous in mice. Other recent studies show that quebracho tannins present a strong anti-mutagenic activity. The heartwood contains from 20 to 30 percent tannin and 3 or 4 percent water-soluble nontannin. It is said to not ferment.|$|E

The effects of Stop Fitan and the purified <b>natural</b> <b>extract</b> of chestnut wood were assessed in vitro using guinea pig ileum and proximal colon tissues. In order to explain their effects on intestinal smooth muscle contraction, a series of pathways implicated in intestinal motility have been investigated.

A control group received a basal diet without any supplementation, {{and the other three}} experimental groups received a <b>natural</b> <b>extract</b> of Lippia citriodora, titrated in verbascoside, in the following amounts: 1 g, 1. 5 g and 2 g of natural extract/kg feed in the low (LNE), medium (MNE), and high <b>natural</b> <b>extract</b> (HNE) groups, respectively. <b>Natural</b> <b>extract</b> enhanced the quality of the meat: there was a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in saturated fatty acids and a significant increase (P< 0. 05) in mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids. The oxidative stability of the meat improved, thus highlighting a possible link between the decrease (P< 0. 05) in TBARS values and an increase (P< 0. 05) in lipid vitamin content. The cholesterol content of the meat decreased markedly (P< 0. 01) after the dietary verbascoside treatment, thus improving the health benefits of the meat. These results clearly show the important role of Lippia citriodora extract, titrated in verbascoside, in improving the quality of the meat of intensively-reared hares.

40|$|Due to {{consumer}} demand, {{in recent years}} considerable attention {{has been focused on}} the use of natural compounds in animal feed. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of dietary <b>natural</b> <b>extract</b> from Lippia citriodora (commonly named "limoncina"), titrated in verbascoside, on quality, measured as oxidative stability, fatty acid composition, alpha-tocopherol and retinol content and sensory traits of rabbit meat. Forty-five New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to three age- and body-weight-balanced feeding groups of 15 animals each in which a conventional pelleted diet (CON) was supplemented with 1 or 2 kg t − 1 (low natural-extract (LNE) and high natural-extract (HNE) groups, respectively) of Lippia citriodora extract for 55 days. No influence on carcass characteristics and the chemical composition of meat was observed. A trend for a positive effect on alpha-tocopherol tissue content (P = 0. 07) and on thiobarbituric reactive substance (TBARS) values was observed (P = 0. 063) in Longissimus Lumborum muscle from the HNE group. The fatty acid profile of the meat was affected by dietary treatment with a significant decrease (P = 0. 001) in saturated fatty acids and an increase (P = 0. 01) in polyunsaturated fatty acids in both treated groups compared to the CON group. The supplementation with <b>natural</b> <b>extract</b> at the highest dosage improved the tenderness and juiciness of meat, highlighting a better consistency than CON and LNE groups.

30|$|The {{results of}} the {{antimicrobial}} activity of <b>natural</b> <b>extracts</b> against both Gram+ and Gram− microorganisms {{of this study are}} in agreement with the research work of Tajkarimi et al. [44]. Gram+ bacteria tend to be more sensitive to the antimicrobial properties of <b>natural</b> <b>extracts</b> [45, 46], while Gram− are less susceptible to the antibacterial action of natural substances since they possess an outer membrane surrounding the cell wall, which restricts diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through their lipopolysaccharide covering. In addition, Gram− microorganisms generally present higher MICs than the Gram+ ones. Numerous researchers investigating the same topic agree that these compounds are, in most cases, slightly more active against Gram+ than Gram− bacteria. However, Wilkinson et al. [47] remarked that some exceptions may occur, since Aeromonas hydrophila (Gram−) appears {{to be one of the}} most sensitive species to the action of essential oils obtained from different natural essences (thyme, cinnamon, bay, clove, almond, etc.). Moreover, the authors have postulated that individual components of <b>natural</b> <b>extracts</b> exhibit different degrees of activity due to their chemical composition, which can vary according to the geographical origin and harvesting period.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Natural</b> <b>extracts</b> {{have played}} an {{important}} role in the prevention and treatment of diseases and are important sources for drug discovery. However, to be effectively used in these processes, <b>natural</b> <b>extracts</b> must be characterized through the identification of their active compounds and their modes of action. Methodology/Principal Findings: From an initial set of 29, 779 natural products that are annotated with their natural source and using a previously developed virtual screening procedure (carefully validated experimentally), we have predicted as potential peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPARc) partial agonists 12 molecules from 11 extracts known to have antidiabetic activity. Six of these molecules are similar to molecules with described antidiabetic activity but whose mechanism of action is unknown. Therefore, it is plausible that these 12 molecules could be the bioactive molecules responsible, at least in part, for the antidiabetic activity of the extracts containing them. In addition, we have also identified as potential PPARc partial agonists 10 molecules from 16 plants with undescribed antidiabetic activity but that are related (i. e., they are from the same genus) to plants with known antidiabetic properties. None of the 22 molecules that we predict as PPARc partial agonists show chemical similarity with a group of 211 known PPARc partial agonists obtained from the literature.
