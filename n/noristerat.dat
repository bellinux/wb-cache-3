These have focused {{in part on}} improving access to contraception through national campaigns. This study assessed teenage pregnancy and abortion rate trends since 1998 and possible associations with usage of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). Methods: Teenage conception rates and age-specific abortion rates {{were obtained from the}} Office for National Statistics and the Department of Health. LARC usage data was obtained for Depo-Provera, Implanon/Nexplanon, intrauterine devices, Mirena, and <b>Noristerat</b> from the IMS British Pharmaceutical Index, IMS Hospital Pharmacy Audit, IMS Disease Analyzer, and KT- 31 reports. Through linear regression methods, changes in conception and abortion-related outcomes during 1998 – 2011 and the associations with LARC usage were assessed. Results: Conception rates for girls younger than 18 years of age decreased significantly between 1998 – 2011, from 46. 6 to 30. 7 per 1, 000 girls. A statistically significant association was observed between this decrease and increased LARC usage (P= 0. 0024) in this population. Abortion rates among females aged < 18 years or aged 18 – 19 years decreased between 1998 – 2011, and their associations with increased LARC usage were statistically significant (P= 0. 0029 and P= 0. 0479, respectively). The pattern in older women was complex; abortion rates in women aged 20 – 24 years or 25 – 34 years increased slightly from 1998 to 2011, with stabilization during 2007 – 2011. Conclusion: Increased LARC usage in England was significantly associated with decreased teenage pregnancy rates and abortion rates in females aged, 20 years. Government strategies appears to {{have a positive impact on}} these outcomes; however, abortion rates among women over 20 years of age remain an issue.
