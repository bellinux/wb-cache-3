5|$|At first sight, Terahnee {{seems like}} a Utopia. Everyone lives in sumptuous palaces, and nobody goes hungry; in reality, the society is run by slave labor. After writing new Ages, the Terahnee people capture the {{inhabitants}} to use as slaves, considering themselves gods over their Ages. The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only the servants interact with the lower orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a <b>new</b> <b>society</b> before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E
5|$|The Ickenham and District Society of Model Engineers {{was formed}} in September 1948 and {{originally}} met in the old ARP huts, before moving to Ickenham Hall. On 14 May 1949, the society held their first exhibition of miniature locomotives in a field off Swakeleys Road. A <b>new</b> <b>society</b> clubhouse opened on 18 June 1955 on a site near the Coach & Horses public house where it remains. The miniature railway {{is open to the}} public on the first Saturday of each month.|$|E
5|$|Whites in Omaha have {{followed}} the white flight pattern, suburbanizing to West Omaha over time. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, gang violence and incidents between the Omaha Police and black residents undermined relations between groups in North and South Omaha. More recent Hispanic immigrants, concentrated in South Omaha, have struggled to earn living wages in meatpacking, adapt to a <b>new</b> <b>society,</b> and deal with discrimination.|$|E

5|$|Le Père Goriot {{begins in}} June 1819, {{following}} Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, after the House of Bourbon had been {{restored to the}} throne of France. Tension was mounting between the aristocracy, which had returned with King Louis XVIII, and the bourgeoisie produced by the Industrial Revolution. During this era, France saw a tightening of social structures, with a lower class steeped in overwhelming poverty. By one estimate, almost three-quarters of Parisians {{did not make the}} 500–600 francs a year required for a minimal standard of living. At the same time, this upheaval made possible a social mobility unthinkable during the Ancien Régime of previous centuries. Individuals willing to adapt themselves to the rules of this <b>new</b> <b>society</b> could sometimes ascend into its upper echelons from modest backgrounds, much to the distaste of the established wealthy class.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{was offered}} a tuition grant to attend Harvard University, but Harold's {{continued}} illness {{and the need for}} their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store. He remained in his hometown and attended Whittier College, his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather. Nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football but lacked the size to play. He remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm. Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies. Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins; many members of the Franklins were from prominent families, but Nixon was not. He responded by helping to found a <b>new</b> <b>society,</b> the Orthogonian Society. In addition to the society, schoolwork, and work at the store, Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities, becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker. In 1933, he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief. The two broke up in 1935.|$|E
5|$|While Bahá'u'lláh did not himself {{directly}} {{claim to}} be either the Hindu or Buddhist messiah, he did so in principle through his writings. Later, `Abdu'l-Bahá stated that Bahá'u'lláh was the Kalki avatar, who in the classical Hindu Vaishnavas tradition is the tenth and final Avatar (great incarnation) of Vishnu who will come to end The Age of Darkness and Destruction. Bahá'ís also believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the fulfilment of the prophecy of appearance of the Maitreya Buddha, who is a future Buddha who will eventually appear on earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure Dharma. Bahá'ís believe that the prophecy that Maitreya will usher in a <b>new</b> <b>society</b> of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on world peace. Bahá'u'lláh {{is believed to be}} a descendant of a long line of kings in Persia through Yazdgerd III, the last monarch of the Sasanian Dynasty; he also asserted to be a descendant of Abraham through his third wife Keturah.|$|E
40|$|The {{migration}} and resettlement of people into <b>new</b> <b>societies</b> {{have created a}} host of problems for immigrants in host societies. The {{migration and}} settlement experiences are more complicated and challenging for the immigrant youth who arrive in the <b>new</b> <b>societies</b> in their teenage years. This group, now {{referred to as the}} one-and-a-half generation group in the Diaspora, straddle various worlds: those of the old home they migrated from, and those of the new Diasporic settings, but not fully belonging to any. For these teenage youth growing up in Diasporic settings, the issue of identity becomes more paramount. How they come to define themselves, as well as how others define them, have important implications for their successful integration or the lack thereof in <b>new</b> <b>societies.</b> This study, undertaken with a number of youth from Africa, who have migrated, mostly with their families, into North America, unearthed some pertinent issues surrounding identity deconstruction and reconstruction in <b>new</b> <b>societies</b> for migrant youth...|$|R

5|$|With Hitler's approval, Himmler {{intended}} {{that the}} <b>new</b> <b>society</b> of the Nazi regime should destigmatise illegitimate births, particularly of children fathered {{by members of}} the SS, who were vetted for racial purity. His hope was that each SS family would have between four and six children. The Lebensborn (Fountain of Life) association, founded by Himmler in 1935, created a series of maternity homes where single mothers could be accommodated during their pregnancies. Both parents were examined for racial suitability before acceptance. The resulting children were often adopted into SS families. The homes were also made available to the wives of SS and NSDAP members, who quickly filled over half the available spots.|$|E

In 1979 the Nananksar Gurdwara, established by followers of Baba Mihan Singh, was being established, sapping membership from the <b>New</b> Westminster <b>Society.</b> As of 1989, the group controlling the KDS also controlled the <b>New</b> Westminster <b>Society.</b> Since 1984 the Nanaksar Gurdwara attracted Sikhs who were uninterested in politics.|$|R

5000|$|McDowell {{had founded}} the <b>New</b> Jersey <b>Society</b> of the Sons of the Revolution (SR) in 1889, but he resented the <b>New</b> York <b>Society's</b> insistence {{at the time}} that other state {{societies}} be [...] "auxiliaries" [...] to the <b>New</b> York <b>Society.</b> In addition, the <b>New</b> York <b>Society</b> intended the SR to be an elite social organization. McDowell wanted the heritage organization to become a mass movement with broad and generous membership requirements, to recognize descendants of patriots who had a variety of roles in supporting the Revolution - not necessarily in military service.|$|R
