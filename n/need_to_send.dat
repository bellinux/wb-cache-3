This avoids the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a large data packet to a device that the host suspects to be unwilling to accept it. The device responds with ACK, NAK, or STALL, as appropriate.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{prestige}} {{encouraged the}} almost immediate formation {{of more than}} a dozen companies of infantry in and around Boston. The pressing <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> troops to the front required Wilson to abandon his original intention of raising multiple regiments of infantry and he instead selected the 10 companies closest to readiness, thus creating the 22nd Massachusetts Regiment. To this regiment were attached the 3rd Massachusetts Light Artillery and the 2nd Company Massachusetts Sharpshooters. Thus, the 22nd Massachusetts became one of the few infantry units in the Civil War with attached artillery and sharpshooters.|$|E

25|$|Prior to World War II, in May 1924, an Air Raid Precautions Committee {{was set up}} in the United Kingdom. For years, little {{progress}} was made with shelters because of the apparently irreconcilable conflict between the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> the public underground for shelter and the need to keep them above ground for protection against gas attacks. In February 1936 the Home Secretary appointed a technical Committee on Structural Precautions against Air Attack.|$|E

25|$|Several meta-analyses find {{extensive}} {{evidence of}} ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring in the American labor market. A 2016 meta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests—tests where identical CVs for stereotypically black and white names were sent to employers—in 43 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015 finds that there is extensive racial discrimination in hiring decisions in Europe and North-America. These correspondence tests showed that equivalent minority candidates <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> around 50% more applications to be invited for an interview than majority candidates. A study that examine the job applications of actual people provided with identical résumés and similar interview training showed that African-American applicants with no criminal record were offered jobs at a rate as low as white applicants who had criminal records.|$|E

25|$|A pre-war {{politician}} {{who was known}} to have pro-Axis leanings, Nedić was selected because the Germans believed his fierce anti-Communism and military experience {{could be used to}} quell an armed uprising in the Serbian region of Šumadija. Unable to bring reinforcements due to the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> soldiers to the Eastern Front, the Germans responded to the revolt by declaring that one-hundred Serbs would be executed for every German soldier killed and that fifty would be executed for every German soldier wounded. By October 1941, this policy had resulted in the deaths of 25,000 Serbs. The Germans also targeted Jews, who were subjected to forced labour, punitive taxing, and restrictive decrees. Jews were also registered with German authorities and forced to wear identifying armbands while Jewish property was confiscated. They, and to a lesser degree Romanis, were targeted on racial grounds, although most were not killed outright. Following the start of the anti-German uprising, German propaganda began associating Jews with Communism and anti-German ideology. Executions and arrests of Serbian Jews followed.|$|E
25|$|As Lord Protector, Cromwell {{was aware}} of the Jewish community's {{involvement}} in the economics of the Netherlands, now England's leading commercial rival. It was this—allied to Cromwell's tolerance of the right to private worship of those who fell outside evangelical Puritanism—that led to his encouraging Jews to return to England in 1657, over 350 years after their banishment by Edward I, in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars. There was a longer-term motive for Cromwell's decision to allow the Jews to return to England, and that was the hope that they would convert to Christianity and therefore hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, ultimately based on Matthew 23:37–39 and Romans 11. At the Whitehall conference of December 1655 he quoted from St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans 10:12–15 on the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> Christian preachers to the Jews. Cromwell's long-term religious motive for readmitting the Jews to England should not be doubted; after all, he was serious enough to ban Christmas as a pagan festival. William Prynne the Presbyterian, in contrast to Cromwell the Congregationalist, was strongly opposed to the latter's pro-Jewish policy.|$|E

500|$|Smythe {{was accused}} of acting solely for {{political}} gain. The publisher of the Globe and Mail {{at the time was}} prominent Conservative George McCullagh, and Smythe was friends with Ontario Conservative Premier George Drew. McCullagh and Drew may have used Smythe for their political ends to defeat King. The issue of lack of reinforcements was well-known within the Army and Smythe did not make any complaints to senior officers while in active service. Despite being criticized, Smythe kept up his public criticism in the newspapers. After James Ralston, Canada's defence minister, traveled to Italy, he saw for himself the shortage of skilled reinforcements. Ralston, who King did not trust, was replaced with Andrew McNaughton, who was against conscription. However, even King saw the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> troops for the Canadian Army and he ordered 17,500 reserve troops to Europe in November 1944, which started to arrive in January 1945 ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Amondson was {{approached}} by Thompson Township, Pennsylvania tax assessor James Hedges, the Prohibition Party's only elected official. He convinced Amondson to seek the nomination of his faction of the Prohibition Party, which split over perennial presidential nominee Earl Dodge's leadership of the party. Hedges' faction felt Dodge was more concerned with his campaign button business than advancing the party's goals. Dodge had run as the party's nominee in every election since 1984, but received only 208 votes in the 2000 election, down approximately 1,000 from the 1996 election. Amondson commenced his first presidential campaign with the nomination of Hedges' faction. Dodge received the other faction's nomination. According to Dodge, Amondson had previously contacted him about the vice presidential nomination, but {{it had already been}} filled. Dodge reasoned Amondson was [...] "probably a very nice man... he may not have known exactly what he was getting into." [...] Conversely, Amondson referred to Dodge as a [...] "good man" [...] with whom he shared the same message, but argued, [...] "Dodge is just not getting the job done. He's too old.
