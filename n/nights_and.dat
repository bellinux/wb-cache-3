5|$|Within {{his first}} three films, Hard Eight, Boogie <b>Nights</b> <b>and</b> Magnolia, Anderson {{explored}} themes of dysfunctional families, alienation and loneliness. Boogie <b>Nights</b> <b>and</b> Magnolia were noted for their large ensemble casts, which Anderson returned to in Inherent Vice. In Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson explored similar themes but expressed a different visual style, shedding the influences and references of his earlier films, being more surreal and having {{a heightened sense of}} reality. It was also short, compared to his previous two films, at 90 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Droseraregia {{is often}} {{described}} as being a difficult species to cultivate, though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions have led to success for some. For optimal growth, D.regia appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool <b>nights</b> <b>and</b> warm days have been reported to induce vigorous growth. Asexual propagation is frequently achieved through small root cuttings instead of leaf cuttings, which tend to rot before roots can form. Seed germination occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster than many other Drosera species. Germination is phanerocotylar (non-glandular cotyledons exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being alternate in arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Having {{personal}} experience with worker safety concerns, Lynch found himself with aspirations beyond his trade. When a 1979 blizzard forced his project in Wisconsin to shut down, he spent the extra time taking courses at the University of Wisconsin. Shortly thereafter, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and so Lynch returned to Boston. In the early 1980s Lynch {{was elected to the}} executive board of the Iron Workers Local 7 union. At age 30 he was elected president of the board, the youngest in the local's history. During this time he spent his <b>nights</b> <b>and</b> weekends attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology, from which he graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in construction management in 1988.|$|E

The Experience {{outperformed}} Jefferson Airplane during the first two <b>nights,</b> <b>and</b> replaced them {{at the top of the}} bill on the fifth. Following their successful West Coast introduction, which included a free open-air concert at Golden Gate Park and a concert at the Whisky a Go Go, the Experience were booked as the opening act for the first American tour of the Monkees. They requested Hendrix as a supporting act because they were fans, but their young audience disliked the Experience, who left the tour after six shows. Chandler later admitted that he engineered the tour in an effort to gain publicity for Hendrix.|$|E

After Lad is given a 24-hour parole, the Master asks the judge to accompany him to the neighbor's house that night, where they discover that the farmhand was actually stealing the sheep, then killing one from each batch to put the blame on Lad.|$|E

5|$|Mondays through Saturdays, BART trains run on five routes; {{four are}} transbay routes {{connecting}} San Francisco to Oakland and various destinations in the East Bay, while the fifth, the Richmond–Warm Springs line, runs {{exclusively in the}} East Bay. Two of the five routes do not run on <b>nights</b> <b>and</b> weekends, and one is truncated on Saturdays, but all stations remain accessible by transfers via other routes. In September 1972 BART's first route opened: Fremont to MacArthur, extended to Richmond in January 1973. Concord to MacArthur started in May 1973 and Montgomery Street to Daly City began in November 1973. The original system was completed in September 1974 when trains first carried passengers through the underwater Transbay Tube. BART's three routes then were Concord–Daly City, Fremont-Daly City and Richmond–Fremont.|$|E
