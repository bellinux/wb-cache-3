5|$|This {{station is}} unusual in that its {{mezzanine}} is split in two halves. This is because at this location, Union Turnpike and the Jackie Robinson Parkway cross under Queens Boulevard but over the Queens Boulevard Line tracks; the mezzanine is {{at the level of}} Union Turnpike, one half on either side, with <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the two outside of fare control.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{legislation for}} the coin on March 31, 1936, authorizing 15,000 pieces {{to be struck}} at the three mints then in operation. Melish had hired sculptor Constance Ortmayer to design the coin, but the Commission of Fine Arts refused to recommend the designs. Members objected to the depiction of Stephen Foster on the obverse, finding <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> Foster, who died in 1864, and the supposed anniversary. Nevertheless, the designs were approved by the Bureau of the Mint, and 5,000 sets from the three mints were issued and sold to Melish's group, the only authorized purchaser.|$|E
5|$|In {{a bowling}} alley, ex-convict Carl Nearman (J. R. Bourne) watches another man eat his meal before {{following}} him outside, where he approaches and kills him. Elsewhere, Annie Tisman (Donna White) receives a human tongue in a package. The Millennium Group sends offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and pathologist Cheryl Andrews (C. C. H. Pounder) to investigate, as several people have received body {{parts in the}} post {{over the past few}} years. <b>No</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the recipients has been found, nor have the bodies the parts have been culled from.|$|E

5|$|Siward {{is perhaps}} most famous for his {{expedition}} in 1054 against Macbeth, King of Scotland, an expedition that cost Siward his eldest son, Osbjorn. The origin of Siward's conflict with the Scots is unclear. According to the Libellus de Exordio, in 1039 or 1040, the Scottish king Donnchad mac Crínáin attacked northern Northumbria and besieged Durham. Within a year, Mac Bethad had deposed and killed Donnchad. The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh, and though <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the two events is clear {{it is likely that}} they were linked.|$|E
5|$|The route intersects several long-distance highways, {{including}} NY13 in Dryden, U.S. Route20 (US20) and NY5 in Auburn, and NY31 in Port Byron. It {{passes over}} the New York State Thruway (Interstate90 or I-90) north of Port Byron; however, there is <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the two. NY38 has two suffixed routes. The first, NY38A is an alternate route of NY38 between Moravia and Auburn, while the other, NY38B, {{is a simple}} east–west connector in the Southern Tier. While NY38 runs along the western shore of Owasco Lake, NY38A travels to Auburn along a routing east of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Tracks 1 and 3 are {{connected}} {{to each other and}} to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's southbound local track south of Grand Central station. Track 4 connects to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line's northbound local track north of Times Square station. There is <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the two tracks that connect to the Lexington Avenue Line, Tracks 1 and 3, and the track that connects to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, Track 4; therefore, it is now physically impossible for a train to go from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line through to the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks. At the Times Square station, to provide a connection between the platform for Track 4 and the rest of the station complex, there is a pedestrian bridge over Track 4. The pedestrian bridge is temporary removed to allow the train on Track 4 to leave for maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The station sits just {{southeast}} {{from the}} Darby Transportation Center, a SEPTA bus and trolley terminal {{that is the}} terminus of Routes 11 and 13 of the SEPTA Subway-Surface Trolley Lines. There are <b>no</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> the two stations.|$|R

25|$|Tapeworms at the {{junction}} of the cecum have been implicated in causing colic. The most common species of tapeworm in the equine is Anoplocephala perfoliata. However, a 2008 study in Canada indicated that there is <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> tapeworms and colic, contradicting studies performed in the UK.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, Bava's son, Lamberto Bava, made a quasi-remake of the film. While the new Black Sunday has a {{very similar}} mask torture {{sequence}} to the original, it features a completely different storyline.

25|$|<b>No</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the 15th Arkansas Infantry Regiment (1st Arkansas State Troops) and the 1st Infantry, Arkansas State Guard, {{from which}} the 153rd Infantry Regiment was created, is {{formally}} recognized by the United States Army Center of Military History. Arkansas militia units were very active during the Reconstruction era, but interest in the militia waned {{in the years after}} Reconstruction ended and very little activity occurred above the local level for many years.|$|E
25|$|It served {{throughout}} {{the war in the}} western theater, seeing action in the Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia campaigns. Following its depletion in numbers the regiment was consolidated several times with other Arkansas regiments, finally merging in 1865 into the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment. Another Arkansas unit also had the designation 5th Arkansas, the 5th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops which participated in the Battle of Wilson's Creek, but was never transferred to Confederate Service. There is <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the two units.|$|E

25|$|A Royal Commission (Royal Commission into an Attempt to Bribe a Member of the House of Assembly) {{was held}} in 1991, which {{attempted}} to determine the involvement of Robin Gray in the affair. Gray was cleared {{of involvement in the}} bribe attempt, as <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> him and Rouse was established, although he had met with Rouse shortly before the bribe was offered and discussed a possible Labor defector. Gray's conduct was criticised by the Commission, however, and his political career and reputation were tarnished.|$|E
25|$|Following {{approval}} of the vaccine, its entry in clinical practice was slow {{for a variety of}} reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some patient advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline, alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints.|$|E
25|$|The 4th Arkansas Infantry (August 17, 1861 – April 26, 1865) was a Confederate Army {{infantry}} regiment {{from the}} state of Arkansas during the American Civil War. The 4th Arkansas served throughout the war in the western theater, seeing action in the Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia campaigns. Following its depletion in numbers the regiment was consolidated several times with other Arkansas regiments, finally merging in 1865 into the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Mounted Rifles. Another Arkansas unit also had the designation 4th Arkansas, the 4th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops which participated in the Battle of Wilson's Creek, but was never transferred to Confederate Service.

25|$|With {{help from}} QualPro, Boise Cascade {{discovered}} there was <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> {{the quality of}} wood they purchased as raw material {{and the quality of}} wood pulp it produced for paper and packaging products. QualPro worked with Elo TouchSystems to find out why 25 percent of the touch-screens they manufactured had bubbles between the screen and coating. Statisticians identified three causes, which reduced the defects to less than 1 percent: the type of polyester, the coversheet shaping process and the type of adhesives used. A Unifi yarn plant worked with QualPro to identify ways {{to reduce the number of}} broken yarns. Out of the 25 quality improvement ideas Unifi had, testing found that five were effective.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} 20 mutations in CACNA1H associated with CAE. These mutations are likely not wholly causative and should instead {{be thought of}} as giving susceptibility. This is particularly true since some groups have found <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> CAE and CACNA1H mutations. Many of the CACNA1H mutations have a measurable effect on channel kinetics, including activation time constant and voltage dependence, deactivation time constant, and inactivation time constant and voltage dependence (summarized in Table 1). Many of these mutations should lead to neuronal excitability, though others may lead to hypoexcitability. These predictions are due to mathematical modeling and may differ from what will occur in real neurons where other proteins, some of which may interact with CACNA1H, are present.|$|E
25|$|The Malay {{language}} {{came into}} widespread use as the lingua franca of the Malacca Sultanate (1402–1511). During this period, the Malay language developed rapidly {{under the influence}} of Islamic literature. The development changed the nature of the language with massive infusion of Arabic, Tamil and Sanskrit vocabularies, called Classical Malay. Under the Sultanate of Malacca the language evolved into a form recognisable to speakers of modern Malay. When the court moved to establish the Johor Sultanate, it continued using the classical language; it has become so associated with Dutch Riau and British Johor that it is often assumed that the Malay of Riau is close to the classical language. However, there is <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> Malaccan Malay as used on Riau and the Riau vernacular.|$|E
