40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the ‘importance’ and ‘awareness’ {{of a set}} {{of established}} ‘external communication’ determinants of technological innovation {{in the context of a}} newly industrialised country. The researcher interviewed 105 Greek manufacturing companies, measuring their innovation rate as well as 23 potential ‘external communication’ determinants. Using correlation and regression analyses, the initial group of 23 factors was reduced to a subset of 10 ‘major importance’ determinants of innovation. The results supported two hypotheses related with <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries,</b> namely: 1. searching for product-specific information is more important for innovation than scanning more general market and technological information; and 2. the co-operation with partnering organisations is more important for innovation than the co-operation with assisting organisations. The ‘objective’ results were then compared with the ‘perceptions’ of the managers on the important factors determining innovation (also measured during the interviews). Overall, the perceptual analysis confirmed the significance of the subset of statistically important variables. Therefore, the hypothesis that in <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries</b> the managers are generally unaware of the important determinants of innovation was rejected. Generally, the study provided supporting evidence to the ‘contingency’ school of thought, suggesting that there are no universally applicable recipes for successful innovation management...|$|E

Certain types of architecture can be hegemonic in a class sense, serving specifi c class interests alongside their recognised aesthetic qualities.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{theoretical}} {{explanation for the}} determination of exchange rates under specific conditions which can/could be found in some OECD and <b>newly</b> <b>industrialised</b> <b>countries.</b> In an Obstfeld (1994) framework extended to incorporate government expropriation reneging on a fixed exchange rate promise unambiguously produces short term benefits, but long term losses. The choice of exchange rate regime depends on the combined effect of greediness (expropriation) and impatience (political instability), though not straightforwardly. In particular, similarly stable countries may choose different exchange rate regimes due to different levels of rent-seeking, for instance Mexico and Chile in the 1980 s. exchange rate regime, monetary policy, fiscal policy, expropriation, political instability, political economy...|$|E
