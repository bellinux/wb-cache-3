5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil <b>nationalism</b> <b>is</b> the {{conviction}} of the Sri Lankan Tamil people, a minority ethnic group in the South Asian island country of Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon), {{that they have the}} right to constitute an independent or autonomous political community. This idea has not always existed. Sri Lankan Tamil national awareness began during the era of British rule during the nineteenth century, as Tamil Hindu revivalists tried to counter Protestant missionary activity. The revivalists, led by Arumuga Navalar, used literacy as a tool to spread Hinduism and its principles.|$|E
25|$|Indian <b>nationalism</b> <b>is</b> as much {{a diverse}} blend of nationalistic sentiments as its people are ethnically and religiously diverse. Thus the most {{influential}} undercurrents {{are more than just}} Indian in nature. The most controversial and emotionally charged fibre in the fabric of Indian <b>nationalism</b> <b>is</b> religion. Religion forms a major, and in many cases, the central element of Indian life. Ethnic communities are diverse in terms of linguistics, social traditions and history across India.|$|E

5000|$|Ukrainian bourgeois <b>nationalism</b> <b>was</b> a cliché of Soviet phraseology such as [...] "Proletarian internationalism", [...] "Fraternity of peoples", [...] "Agitprop", [...] "Stakhanovite movement", [...] "Enemy of the people" [...] and {{numerous}} others. According to Soviet ideology Ukrainian bourgeois <b>nationalism</b> <b>was</b> a specific form of bourgeois nationalism recognizing {{the superiority of}} national interests over class interests (see Class in Marxist theory). The idea of bourgeois <b>nationalism</b> <b>was</b> required to keep consistency with the Bolshevik's Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia which set a wave of secession movements across the former Russian Empire. This concept of <b>nationalism</b> <b>was</b> also used to identify everyone who did not share the national policy principles of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks), proletarian internationalism, and did not fit under the definition of bourgeois cosmopolitanism. In Soviet ideology, bourgeois cosmopolitanism was a negative phenomenon and opposite to the proclaimed fraternity of peoples.|$|R

25|$|Understanding {{contemporary}} Quebec <b>nationalism</b> <b>is</b> difficult {{considering the}} ongoing debates {{on the political}} status of the province and its complex public opinion.

25|$|<b>Nationalism</b> <b>is</b> {{the main}} {{foundation}} of fascism. The fascist {{view of a}} nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people. Fascism seeks to solve economic, political and social problems by achieving a millenarian national rebirth, exalting the nation or race above all else and promoting cults of unity, strength and purity. European fascist movements typically espouse a racist conception of non-Europeans being inferior to Europeans. Beyond this, fascists in Europe have not held a unified set of racial views. Historically, most fascists promoted imperialism, {{although there have been}} several fascist movements that were uninterested in the pursuit of new imperial ambitions.|$|E
