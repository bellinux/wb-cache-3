40|$|The work in {{this paper}} {{presents}} the effect of material and blank dimension on the dimensions <b>of</b> external rolled <b>threads.</b> This paper will be helpful for the auto industry, {{one of the largest}} fasteners markets, that typically consumes between 2800 to 3100 fasteners in the assembly of an average family vehicle. Externally threaded fasteners comprise the bulk of fasteners used in these applications with over 90 % of being produced by thread rolling. The thread rolling process is now widely acknowledged as the fastest and most efficient method of producing accurate external threads, with surface finish and mechanical properties. The typical production rates are around one piece per second. In order to ensure a perfect thread rolling process, it is important for blank of work piece to be properly pre-machined. The size of the blank is dependent on material, surface finish, type <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> etc. This paper describes the effect of blank material and dimensions on <b>nominal</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> external rolled <b>threads.</b> The work has been carried out at M/s Gayatri Auto Industries on Master Reciprocating Dies Thread Rolling Machine using HSS die. Mild Steel (C 15), EN- 8 (C 40), and EN- 47 (Spring Steel) materials have been taken as blank material for the analysis to produce M 8 x 1. 25 6 g threads. The result indicates that the variation on surface roughness, carbon percentage and dimension of blank affects significantly the <b>nominal</b> <b>diameter</b> and PCD <b>of</b> <b>threads.</b> This paper is helpful for the professionals to determine the accurate dimension <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> rolling blank for desired threads to minimize rejections. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{performed}} a dosimetric comparison of spot-scanning proton therapy (SSPT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) {{to investigate the}} impact of tumor size on the risk of radiation induced liver disease (RILD). Methods: A number of alternative plans were generated for 10 patients with HCC. The gross tumor volumes (GTV) varied from 20. 1 to 2194. 5 cm(3). Assuming all GTVs were spherical, the <b>nominal</b> <b>diameter</b> was calculated and ranged from 3. 4 to 16. 1 cm. The prescription dose was 60 Gy for IMRT or 60 cobalt Gy-equivalents for SSPT with 95 % planning target volume (PTV) coverage. Using IMRT and SSPT techniques, extensive comparative planning was conducted. All plans were evaluated by the risk of RILD estimated using the Lyman-normal-tissue complication probability model. Results: For IMRT the risk of RILD increased drastically between 6. 3 - 7. 8 cm <b>nominal</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> GTV. When the <b>nominal</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> GTV was more than 6. 3 cm, the average risk of RILD was 94. 5 % for IMRT and 6. 2 % for SSPT.

It is important to investigate the sealing performance of pipe connections under long term severe thermal exposure swings to ensure operational safety. In this study, the effects of cyclic thermal conditions on the sealing performance and mechanical characteristics in larger and smaller <b>nominal</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> pipe flange connection are examined using FEM calculations. Helium gas leakage is predicted using the contact gasket stress obtained from the FEM results. On other hand, the leakage tests using the smaller <b>nominal</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> pipe flange connection were conducted to measure the amount of helium gas leakage and to compare with the predicted amount of gas leakage. As the results, the contact gasket stress distributions were changed dramatically under cyclic thermal condition and elevated internal pressure.
