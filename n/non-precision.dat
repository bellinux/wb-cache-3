25|$|Approaching , the {{navigator}} {{began calling}} out the radar altimeter's reading. This is not standard practice for a <b>non-precision</b> approach, as the radar altimeter {{does not take}} into account the contour of the terrain around the airport. Standard practice would entail calling out the readings on the pressure altimeter, which is set according to atmospheric pressure and thereby references the elevation of the actual airport. The terrain on approach to Smolensk airport is uneven and locally much lower than the runway level.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among these}} {{differences}} was {{a conclusion that}} the pilots were not placed under pressure forcing them to land at Smolensk, and furthermore the crew {{did not want to}} land and after reaching 100m altitude (measured by radio altimeter) and had decided to go around using the autopilot. However, it was impossible for the autopilot installed in the aircraft to conduct an automatic go-around from a <b>non-precision</b> approach. The Polish investigation concluded this caused a delay in executing the go-around which contributed to the crash.|$|E

On 8 November 1963, the aircraft serving the flight crashed in poor visibility while attempting to land on a <b>non-precision</b> approach at Mariehamn Airport in the municipality of Jomala. Resulting {{in the death of}} 22 people out of 25 on board, the crash remains the second most deadly aviation accident in Finland.|$|E

2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the captain’s failure to adequately brief and execute the <b>non-precision</b> approach and the first officer’s and flight engineer’s failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captain’s execution of the approach. [...] Contributing to these failures were the captain’s fatigue and Korean Air’s inadequate flight crew training.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} crashed {{at about}} 04:47local time (CDT, 09:47UTC) while making a localizer <b>non-precision</b> approach to runway 18 at Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport.

The DME was sited at the NIMITZ VOR some 3.3nm from the airport and such a configuration had not been part of Korean Air's simulator training, the crew's training for such <b>non-precision</b> approaches having been carried out in scenarios where the DME was located at the airport. Nevertheless the correct DME distances were shown on the approach chart.|$|E
2500|$|The {{preliminary}} investigation report {{stated that the}} crew breached air safety regulations on all three approaches by descending below the decision height of [...] before initiating a missed approach. On 6 May, the Civil Aviation Authority in the United Kingdom issued a Safety Notice advising all operators within the United Kingdom that the second amendment to the EU-OPS 1 operating standard would come into force on 16 July 2011. The amendment, originally published in September 2008, introduced a new method for calculating Aerodrome Operating Minimums and stipulated that <b>Non-Precision</b> Approaches should follow a continuous descent profile, unless otherwise approved by the CAA.|$|E
2500|$|On January 23, 1982, World Airways Flight 30 from Newark to Boston made a <b>non-precision</b> {{instrument}} approach to runway 15R and touched down [...] past the displaced threshold on an icy runway. When the crew sensed that the DC-10-30-CF couldn't be {{stopped on the}} remaining runway, they steered the DC-10 {{off the side of}} the runway to avoid the approach light pier, and slid into the shallow water of Boston Harbor. The nose section separated as the DC-10 came to rest [...] past the runway end, [...] left of the extended centerline. Two passengers (a father and son) were never found and are presumed to have been swept out to sea.|$|E
2500|$|The WAAS was jointly {{developed}} by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{as part of the}} [...] (DOT-VNTSC-RSPA-95-1/DOD-4650.5), beginning in 1994, to provide performance comparable to category 1 instrument landing system (ILS) for all aircraft possessing the appropriately certified equipment. Without WAAS, ionospheric disturbances, clock drift, and satellite orbit errors create too much error and uncertainty in the GPS signal to meet the requirements for a precision approach (see GPS sources of error). A precision approach includes altitude information and provides course guidance, distance from the runway, and elevation information at all points along the approach, usually down to lower altitudes and weather minimums than <b>non-precision</b> approaches.|$|E
2500|$|Smolensk North Airport is {{a former}} {{military}} airbase, presently in mixed military-civilian use. At {{the time of the}} crash, the airport was not equipped with an ICAO-compliant instrument landing system (ILS), the standard system used in western countries. The airport did have previously a Russian landing system installed, but that was decommissioned after civilian operations started. The Polish Tu-154 was modified to use western-style ILS. A non-directional beacon (NDB) was installed at the airport, but such device is essentially a navigational aid, and can be used only for <b>non-precision</b> approaches, where it can guide the pilot to align with the runway, but offers no vertical guidance on how to descend towards the runway.

2500|$|The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigation}} report stated that {{a contributing factor}} was that the ATC Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) system at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport had been deliberately modified so as to limit spurious alarms and could not detect an approaching aircraft that was below minimum safe altitude. [...] The probable cause of the accident was the captain's poor execution of the <b>non-precision</b> approach, the captain's fatigue, poor communication between the flight crew, and Korean Air's lack of flight crew training.

The based aircraft obtain their fuel from Chevron Corporation, which is located on site and serves as an aviation dealer. This site is home to a self-service automated fuel pump system by the company which serves 100LL avgas, just outside the terminal, and credit card purchasing system.

50|$|If {{a runway}} has both {{precision}} and <b>non-precision</b> approaches defined, the MDA of the <b>non-precision</b> approach {{is almost always}} greater than the DH/DA of the precision approach, {{because of the lack}} of vertical guidance on the <b>non-precision</b> approach: the actual difference depends on the accuracy of the navaid upon which the approach is based, with ADF approaches and SRAs tending to have the highest MDAs.|$|E
