40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the social integration amongst <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students in the two different school systems Sweden welcomes them into. The first school system takes in <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students into preparation classes whilst the other integrates the students directly into ordinary classrooms. The examination is based on qualitative observations in the classroom, canteen, and playground, and interviews with teachers and a select few students from each school system. The result of the study showed that <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students in ordinary classes are socially integrated more into the school than the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students that are welcomed into a preparation class. <b>Newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students are offered a larger chance of being integrated into the school environment if they are introduced directly into an ordinary class. In preparation classes, social integration is narrowed down to between the classmates. Instead, preparation classes were deemed academically better for <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students. The conclusion drawn from my results and previous research is that the different school systems result in different outcomes. From a social perspective, being introduced directly into an ordinary class is more advantageous for <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a case studie of a <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> student placed in a regular class in a P- 9 school in a suburb south of Stockholm. The {{purpose of this study}} is to {{investigate}} how the class teacher for the regular class and the Swedish as a second language teacher are working with this student. The research questions are: What are the basic ideas behind the placement of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students in regular classes with no previous language skills? How is the language development for the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> student according to the teacher of the selected class? What methods and materials are used by the teacher in her teaching to benefit the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> student’s language development? The purpose of my study has been to investigate the teachers and the headmaster’s perspective on how the integration of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students into the regular class can be done and the decisions context for the placement of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students into the regular class. The study is based on interviews with two teachers and the school headmaster. Results of the study show that the principal of the selected school has a vision for the integration of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students into the regular class, which means that this particular school has a different way of working than other schools in the area where the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> are placed into a preparation class before being integrated into the ordinary class. The class teacher believes that the headmaster’s vision of direct placement into ordinary classes is good for integration. In this vision the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> student receives knowledge related to the context and task during class. The teacher in “Swedish as a second language” does not believe that the headmasters vision is good for the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students, she believes that it is better if they get separate schooling in Swedish before being integrated into ordinary classes. The overall conclusion after having collected my results and studied previous research is that the work with <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students at the school looks different from what the School Board calls for. The selected school for my study has no clear guidelines on how the work with the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students in regular classes should be attended. This is sought by the class teacher and that there is a need for such guidelines to give these students an equivalent schoolin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{highlights}} <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils’ {{experiences of}} the Swedish school system. From a socio-cultural and intercultural perspective, the pupils’ school experiences have been interpreted and analyzed {{in accordance with the}} study’s purpose of looking into the importance of collective processes and an intercultural approach for <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils' learning. The study should be interpreted {{in the light of the}} Swedish school challenges where, in a short period of time large groups of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils have started their studies at the secondary school’s introduction program. The study's qualitative materials were obtained through qualitative field interviews with six <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students. The results of these interviews are explained and analyzed based on the theoretical perspectives of the thesis. The result shows that collective processes and the socio-cultural perspective focus on social interaction, language development and cognitive challenges, also fits well with the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils’ perceptions of their learning. The study also argues that there tend to be few intercultural elements in education in the Introduction Language program, even though the Swedish National Agency for Education and the curriculum asks for its presence in the education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils. A third conclusion set out in the study is that <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils want more intercultural elements in their education, to seek understanding and increased knowledge on issues relating on cultures and identities...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to see how four {{teachers}} at a school look at the reception and approaching of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils. How do the interviewed teachers describe the school´s reception of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils? How do teachers in preparatory and regular class see at the selected school's reception and treatment of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils?To get answers to my purpose, I have done an ethnographic study called field study and I am using qualitative interviews, and one passive observation. To arrive at a result of my study, I have processed collected data from interviews and observations and coupled the collected material to the theories and previous research. I have in my study used both pedagogical and sociological theories. The results of my study show that {{it would be difficult for}} <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students to be placed directly into the ordinary class, the results also show that <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students receive a safe and stimulating start to their school and class preparation. However, there are shortcomings and resistance of the trajectories leading to entry of the preparatory class of ordinary class, but when <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students have started in an ordinary class, students receive a stimulating teaching. However, no resources in the form of mother tongue teachers, the mother tongue teachers are great support for all teachers at the school.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our thesis is to {{understand}} the opportunities and obstacles that administrators in the municipalities and work intermediaries in Halland experience in their work {{with the introduction of}} <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> refugees in the labor market. In this study we have done 8 qualitative interviews with employees in the municipality and the employment in work intermediation in Halland to illuminate the underlying factors of why the report "A lost year" of the Swedish Integration Board shows that few <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> refugees get a job in the first year after they have been received a residence permit. The study showed that <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> refugees have it more difficult to be introduced in the labor market in Sweden. The underlying causes of the situation are many, according to those interviewed. Knowledge in the Swedish language is most important for the introduction of the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> refugees'. Other factors that affect the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> refugees’ opportunity to be introduced in the labor market are the discrimination that exists in society. There are also individual and cultural differences between the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> refugees that affect their chance of getting a job in Sweden...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to examine the {{political}} debate on the education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> immigrant pupils at secondary school age. The following issues are under scrutiny: What are the goals, expressed by politicians during the examined periods, for the education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils? What ideas about education and what educational ideals can be observed in the political debate on the education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils? Has there been any change, during the examined period, in the policy debate on the education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils? The research material consists of reports and statements of the Education Committee, {{as well as a number}} of parliamentary protocols. Two five-year periods, 1971 - 1975 and 2006 - 2010, are studied and compared. All in all, the material consists of 23 documents issued during these periods. Drawing on theories about formation, power mechanisms and the political development in general, a so-called dimensional map is generated so as to prepare for an analysis of the ideas central to Swedish governmental policies of immigration and education. Toward the backdrop of this dimensional map, the paper presents a descriptive analysis of the key ideas in the policy debate. In previous research, there is no study of this kind. The types of schools available for <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils during the two time periods lack the guidance of systematic plans or official curricula. The study shows that there is little policy debate about education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils and that there is no developed concept of formation used in the debates. The political silence surrounding the education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils may be interpreted as a way of excluding this issue from the agenda. Views upon the education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils have gone through subtle changes between the two examined five year periods. In the 1970 s, the school situation of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils was treated as a call for political and structural solutions. In the 2000 s, however, the political solutions tend to be imposed upon the individuals. The main objective of the education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils is to provide them with an opportunity to learn the Swedish language and hence to improve their chances at entering higher education or getting employed...|$|R
40|$|Sweden has {{in recent}} years seen a great {{increase}} of immigrants, {{which has led to}} more schools than ever having <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students. In lower secondary schools, <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students, who may not have studied English before, study English together with native-born Swedes who have studied English for some years already. This great mix of English proficiency levels makes it difficult for English teachers to adapt their teaching to every student’s needs, even though the Swedish curriculum for compulsory school states that “teaching should be adapted to each pupil’s circumstances and needs” (Skolverket, 2011 a, p. 10). In this degree project essay, I present what the National Agency for Education has published about teaching English to <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students in lower secondary school, and I also answer the research question: How can English teachers create a good environment for learning English for <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students in lower secondary school? The findings from three interviews with lower secondary school teachers are that the situation is challenging, and their best advice is to let the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students study English at their individual level through the help of computers and digital resources. The essay concludes with encouraging English teachers to have realistic ambitions regarding <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students. Teachers must be able to accept that not all students will achieve a grade in English in year 9, but through the Language Introduction Programme, <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students still have a genuine chance of fully completing their compulsory school education...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{education}} of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> 16 - 20 year old immigrants and how their education in the towns of Södertälje and Malmö matches up with national inquiry into the subject. The research questions in this thesis are as follow: What type of documents shape the work with <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students? What's the preferred development surrounding {{the education of the}} <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students nationally? What does the latest study, which is a proposed reform of the Gymnasium system, say about the education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students? How does the local work connect with proposals of national investigations? Do the cities take responsibility for evaluating the education of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students? From arriving to graduating, what does the road to graduation look like for a <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> student? What is the curriculum of a <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> student? The methods used here are studies of investigations made primarily by Skolverket (The National Agency for Education) and Myndigheten för skolutveckling (The Agency for Development of Education), studies of local documents such as annual reports of quality and promotional material for programs at local Gymnasiums (High Schools), and interviews with local persons in charge of shaping the work with <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> immigrants. This thesis has not used theory as a foundation for structuring the analysis, but postmodern theory and the use of three dimensional power inspired the thesis. The conclusions made focuses {{on the future of the}} education for these teenagers at large and makes connections between the national investigations and the local work with immigration education. In order for these teenagers to be allowed to join the Swedish national Gymnasium, they need to learn Swedish, and integration seems to be an important part of learning Swedish quickly. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{empirical}} findings {{provide a}} rather complicated picture as both common but also diverging trends were identified. A general reorientation towards active citizenship targeting not only citizens but also <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> immigrants was identified. The numerous reforms targeting <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> immigrants {{resulted in an}} ‘active turn’ and a closer link between income maintenance and employment-promoting services. Conditionality was thereby strengthened remarkably in all three countries. Hence, the introduction programmes targeting <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> immigrants have been the particular object of reform since the early 1990 s and have consequently become more similar during the 2000 s.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how {{primary school}} {{teachers}} {{work with the}} introduction of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils in a municipality with a high percentage of immigrants. The paper also looks at how the teachers’ work has changed over time, between 1980 and 2008. The investigation {{is in the form of}} a survey and is based on three qualitative interviews with two teachers and one coordinator for introduction of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> children in a Swedish municipality. Both teachers have worked at least twenty years in the primary schools where sixty percent of the pupils have foreign background. The result of the survey shows that the conditions have changed, to the better, for both of the teachers. When they started to work as teachers, all responsibility for the introduction of the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils rested on the teachers. Processes also varied within the municipality. Since 2005, when a coordinator for the introduction of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> children was employed in the municipality, all the introduction of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> children (0 - 18 years) carried out according to the same plan. Today, <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils go to a preparation class for approximately two years before they begin in their “home class”. The transitional period between the preparation class and the home class is critical. Successful work with <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils requires that consideration is taken to the background and former experiences of the pupil, that the pupil is taught Swedish as well as his/her mother tongue and that extra support is provided in the mother tongue. A well developed cooperation between class teachers, parents, mother tongue teachers, pupils’ wellfare staff and local authorities makes a good result...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to explore the information literacy of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> people and to obtain knowledge about how {{they are looking for}} important information. The research questions are as follows: How do <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> people access information in the new society? What strategies do they use to overcome the difficulties/obstacles?How do <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> people learn about being information literate? Previous research has examined the importance of information literacy of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> people and discussed how they are looking for important information. In this work, in order to gain an empirical insight, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven women from Syria. The timeframe for the collection of this empirical data was more than two months. The results conveyed that the ‘newly arrived people’ are looking for important information by friends, relatives and social network. Said individuals have a tendancy to spend copious amounts of time to gain reliable and relevant information. Likewise, <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> people are in need of more support which would require further facilitation when entering into the labour market and integrating into society. The analysis also provided traits of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> people needing more support and help learning about information literacy. What can be concluded, is that the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> people did not have enough knowledge about library instructions when offering services. Among other issues, the results showed a great interest in culture, as well as an ambition to learn language and more about society, especially the new arrivals whom are looking for jobs {{despite the fact that they}} have been in the country for a short period...|$|R

40|$|In a preparatory {{class are}} <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> {{students}} who have no or very little knowledge of the Swedish language. Some of the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils may have arrived in Sweden very recently {{and some of them}} have no or very limited understanding and experience of how the school system works in their country of origin. The {{purpose of this study is}} to find out how education in a selected preparatory class works seen from two SVA-teachers and students perspective.   Questions related to my purpose reads as follows: In which way can two of the SVA-teachers respond in a selected preparatory class to their group of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students? What methods can be used by the two SVA-teachers in a selected preparatory class to their group of <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students' language learning? How does the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> student in a selected preparatory class experience their education and friendship? The study was conducted through a qualitative approach in a selected preparatory class in a multicultural school in a suburb in southern Stockholm. Through observations on six separate occasions as well as interviews with two of the SVA- teachers in the selected preparatory class, and with three of the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils during a period of three weeks. The results of this study show that in the selected preparatory class, one is actively working to learn the Swedish language and to create a structural learning environment based on trust and friendship. The results also show how easily the structure may fall apart when some teachers lack training in Swedish as a second language, also because of insufficient resources and inadequate guidelines in the selected preparatory class, for the reception of the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> students in school activities for the chosen study area...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} how teachers in the preparatory class and regular class, in the meeting with <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils, plan and carry out their teaching. This in order to facilitate social interaction and learning in the classroom, from an intercultural perspective. The examination was conducted through interviews with four teachers from the schools that I selected. The teachers gave their perspective on their approach to <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils, through interviews. The result shows that the teachers have ambitions to start from the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils' own ideas and from their prior knowledge. They use these aspects as a starting point in the child's continued learning. You can see the tendencies of the intercultural approach in education that involves respectful responses that relate to the pupils' background, life and knowledge. The intercultural approach that largely pervades the teaching of the researched school allows the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils to have access to a school that accepts and respects them. The conclusion is that when these teachers educate, they use various teaching methods and they also offer each pupil the opportunity to gain knowledge and feel socially included. Teaching strategies that benefit the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils and that includes the pupil both educationally and socially in the classroom, has been described by every teacher. And the result shows that each pupil has individual abilities and needs for learning. The <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils are included in the regular classroom with the other pupils, but yet they are excluded from the regular lessons because of teacher's teaching strategies that can be seen as flawed from an intercultural perspective. This result shows that the <b>newly</b> <b>arrived</b> pupils are prevented from participating in the didactic and the social inclusion in the regular classroom with the other pupils, which also can result in them falling outside and pointed out as different...|$|R
