40|$|Demand for coke is on {{the rise}} and is {{predicted}} to go up further in the years to come. As on today, among the various commercially established coke making technologies, non-recovery/heat recovery ovens are established to be the sustainable ones. It has been investigated that the north eastern region (NER) of India has a number of coke ovens which are <b>non</b> <b>recovery</b> types and without heat recovery systems. Huge volume of coke oven gases released from these ovens which have high calorific values and contribute to major environmental degradation. In this paper, an attempt has been made for maximum utilization of these coke oven gases (COG) for heat recovery. The modern heat recovery ovens which are environmentally sustainable and have ease in operation have minimized the stringent environmental issues. This non-recovery/heat recovery coke making technology developed for high sulphur, high volatile coals of NER India for caking coals will be a promising technology for future, particularly in developing countries that are facing power and coke shortages...|$|E
40|$|This journal issue entitled: Special Issue: Abstracts of the XX International Congress on Schizophrenia ResearchPatient’s {{perception}} of recovery from first-episode psychosis {{is a less}} well covered area in existing assessment and research. The Psychosis Recovery Inventory (PRI) is a self-administered questionnaire developed to address key issues in the recovery stage. This study applied the PRI to survey perceived extent of recovery {{and the risk of}} relapse in a sample of patients recovering from first episode psychosis. The PRI was administrated to 51 patients in the recovery period following a first psychotic episode. The PRI required patients to rate their perceived levels of recovery and risk of relapse with a visual analog scale. In addition, respondents indicated their attitudes towards 32 items covering different aspects of recovery with a 6 -point Likert scale. We explored howthese attitudes are related to the perceptions of recovery and relapse. More than 33. 3 % of patients perceived a low risk of relapse (10 % or lower), but only 7. 9 % of them recognized a high relapse risk (90 % or higher). 11. 8 % of the patients considered they had a full recovery, while on the other hand, 21. 6 % of the patients perceive they had recovered less than 50 %. Perception of <b>non</b> <b>recovery</b> is related to the presence of cognitive problems and impairment in occupational functioning. In addition, the need to continue on medication is rating as an important recovery for the {{perception of}} non-recovery. We successfully applied a tailor-made questionnaire to explore attitudes and perceptions of relapse and recovery in a sample of patients recovering from a first psychotic episode. Despite comprehensive psychoeducation, patients still tended to underestimate their risks of relapse. The need for continuing medication is a major contributor to the sense of non-recovery in first episode patient. These issues have potential therapeutic implications...|$|E

40|$|Reading Recovery {{is part of}} the Every Child a Reader {{strategy}} to enable children to make a good start in reading. Reading Recovery is well known to have impressive effects in the shorter term but less is known about its long term effectiveness. The present study followed {{up at the end of}} Year 6 : 127 comparison children, 77 children who had received Reading Recovery five years earlier and 50 children in Reading Recovery schools who had not receive Reading Recovery. The children who had received Reading Recovery had made significantly greater progress in English than the comparison children by the end of Year 6, achieving on average a National Curriculum Level of 4 b compared with a borderline between Level 3 and 4 in the comparison group. Comparison children in the Reading Recovery schools were also significantly out-performing the comparison in <b>non</b> Reading <b>Recovery</b> schools on the reading test. 78 % of Reading Recovery children achieved Level 4 in English compared with 62 % in the comparison group in <b>non</b> Reading <b>Recovery</b> schools and 64 % for the comparison children in Reading Recovery schools. There was a tendency for Reading Recovery children to be receiving less SEN provision than children in the other two groups, but this only reached statistical significance for those on School Action Plus or a Statement. This suggests that the substantial gains which result from receiving Reading Recovery in Year 1 continue to deliver a significant advantage for those children at the end of the primary phase, providing a surer footing for transition to secondary school...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Patients {{who survive}} acute kidney injury (AKI), {{especially}} those with partial renal recovery, present a higher long-term mortality risk. However, {{there is no consensus}} on the best time to assess renal function after an episode of acute kidney injury or agreement on the definition of renal recovery. In addition, only limited data regarding predictors of recovery are available. Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements: From 1984 to 2009, 84 adult survivors of acute kidney injury were followed by the same nephrologist (RCRMA) for a median time of 4. 1 years. Patients were seen at least once each year after discharge until end stage renal disease (ESRD) or death. In each consultation serum creatinine was measured and glomerular filtration rate estimated. Renal recovery was defined as a glomerular filtration rate value >= 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2. A multiple logistic regression was performed to evaluate factors independently associated with renal recovery. Results: The median length of follow-up was 50 months (30 - 90 months). All patients had stabilized their glomerular filtration rates by 18 months and 83 % of them stabilized earlier: up to 12 months. Renal recovery occurred in 16 patients (19 %) at discharge and in 54 (64 %) by 18 months. Six patients died and four patients progressed to ESRD during the follow up period. Age (OR 1. 09, p < 0. 0001) and serum creatinine at hospital discharge (OR 2. 48, p = 0. 007) were independent factors associated with <b>non</b> renal <b>recovery.</b> The acute kidney injury severity, evaluated by peak serum creatinine and need for dialysis, was not associated with <b>non</b> renal <b>recovery.</b> Conclusions: Renal recovery must be evaluated no earlier than one year after an acute kidney injury episode. Nephrology referral should be considered mainly for older patients and those with elevated serum creatinine at hospital discharge...|$|R
40|$|Cortical {{networks}} are hypothesized {{to rely on}} transient network activity to support short term memory (STM). In this paper we study the capacity of randomly connected recurrent linear networks for performing STM when the input signals are approximately sparse in some basis. We leverage results from compressed sensing to provide rigorous <b>non</b> asymptotic <b>recovery</b> guarantees, quantifying {{the impact of the}} input sparsity level, the input sparsity basis, and the network characteristics on the system capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that network memory capacities can scale superlinearly with the number of nodes, and in some situations can achieve STM capacities that are much larger than the network size. We provide perfect recovery guarantees for finite sequences and recovery bounds for infinite sequences. The latter analysis predicts that network STM systems may have an optimal recovery length that balances errors due to omission and recall mistakes. Furthermore, we show that the conditions yielding optimal STM capacity can be embodied in several network topologies, including networks with sparse or dense connectivities.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{address the problem}} of {{recovering}} sparse solutions to non linear inverse problems. We look at two variants of the basic problem, the synthesis prior problem when the solution is sparse and the analysis prior problem where the solution is cosparse in some linear basis. For the first problem, we propose non linear variants of the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and CoSamp algorithms; for the second problem we propose a non linear variant of the Greedy Analysis Pursuit (GAP) algorithm. We empirically test the success rates of our algorithms on exponential and logarithmic functions.

The study examined the effectiveness of a middle school alternative program, titled academic recovery, in improving student scores on the state assessment and student outlook on education. The quantitative component of this study analyzed the growth of the test scores of the students in this program on the state assessment for one year in communication arts and mathematics. Additionally, the student's growth on the state assessment was compared to the growth of a similar group of students who qualified for the program but were not enrolled in the program. The qualitative component of the study examined student perceptions of their experiences in the academic recovery program. Students in the academic recovery program were found not to have statistically improved on the state assessment in communication arts and mathematics, and they did not statistically improve more on the state assessment in communication arts and mathematics than a similar group of their peers. Through the qualitative analysis it was found students had developed a positive connection with their teacher, had formed friendships at school, and had developed some interests at school. Nevertheless, the students were still struggling academically at school, angry at their <b>non</b> academic <b>recovery</b> teacher, uncertain of their future plans, and sometimes felt they were bullied by peers...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Contemporary cancer {{diagnostics}} {{are becoming}} increasing reliant upon sophisticated new molecular methods for analyzing genetic information. Limiting {{the scope of}} these new technologies {{is the lack of}} adequate solid tumor tissue samples. Patients may present with tumors that are not accessible to biopsy or adequate for longitudinal monitoring. One attractive alternate source is cancer cells in the peripheral blood. These rare circulating tumor cells (CTC) require enrichment and isolation before molecular analysis can be performed. Current CTC platforms lack either the throughput or reliability to use in a clinical setting or they provide CTC samples at purities that restrict molecular access by limiting the molecular tools available. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Recent advances in magetophoresis and microfluidics have been employed to produce an automated platform called LiquidBiopsy®. This platform uses high throughput sheath flow microfluidics for the positive selection of CTC populations. Furthermore the platform quantitatively isolates cells useful for molecular methods such as detection of mutations. CTC recovery was characterized and validated with an accuracy (< 20 % error) and a precision (CV< 25 %) down to at least 9 CTC/ml. Using anti-EpCAM antibodies as the capture agent, the platform recovers 78 % of MCF 7 cells within the linear range. <b>Non</b> specific <b>recovery</b> of background cells is independent of target cell density and averages 55 cells/mL. 10 % purity can be achieved with as low as 6 CTCs/mL and better than 1 % purity can be achieved with 1 CTC/mL. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The LiquidBiopsy platform is an automated validated platform that provides high throughput molecular access to the CTC population. It can be validated and integrated into the lab flow enabling CTC enumeration as well as recovery of consistently high purity samples for molecular analysis such as quantitative PCR and Next Generation Sequencing. This tool opens the way for clinically relevant genetic profiling of CTCs...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} extraction and derivatization protocol for GC–MS analysis of amino/non-amino acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast cells were extracted with chloroform: aqueous-methanol (1 : 1, v/v) {{and the resulting}} non-polar and polar extracts combined and dried for derivatization. Polar and non-polar metabolites were derivatized using tert-butyldimethylsilyl (t-BDMS) dissolved in acetonitrile. Using microwave treatment of the samples, the derivatization process could be completed within 2  h (from > 20  h of the conventional method), providing fully derivatized metabolites that contain multiple derivatizable organic functional groups. This results in a single derivative from one metabolite, leading to increased accuracy and precision for identification and quantification of the method. Analysis of combined fractions allowed the method to expand the coverage of detected metabolites from polar metabolites i. e. amino acids, organic acids and non-polar metabolites i. e. fatty alcohols and long-chain fatty acids which are normally <b>non</b> detectable. The <b>recoveries</b> of the extraction method was found at 88  ±  4 %, RSD, N =  3 using anthranilic acid as an internal standard.

I bred some rabbits by established protein-deficient foods for about one month and made them markedly hypoproteinemia. 2. After 2 weeks of bleeding 10 cc of blood per Kg. of weight using a normal rabbit, I found the recovery of the serumprotein and the formation of blood. 3. When given the protein-deficient foods {{at the time of the}} bleeding, the serumprotein, hemoglobin and hematocrit did not recover, and A/G was lower than in step number one above. 4. Giving the injection of physiological salt solution to hypoproteinemic rabbit, caused hydremia temporarily but it soon recovered. 5. To the hypoproteinernic rabbit, I gave the injection of aminoacid solution (5 % Politamin), but proteins were almost the same as before. Adding the glucosesolution into that, they increased a little. 6. Giving the same quantity of blood by transfusion to a hypoproteinemic rabbit for three days, it did not show so much change in the concentration of serumprotein, but hemoglobin and hematocrit increased remarkably. 7. When the normal rabbit underwent nephrectomy, it became hypoproteinemic and anemic just after the operation temporarily, but afterward, it recovered. 8. Injecting of Politamin and glucose solution at the time of nephrectomy, the recovery was quicker. 9.

40|$|The {{conducting}} {{element of}} the nerve fi bre, the axon, responds to focal injury {{in a number of}} ways. There are two essential lesions. In the fi rst, the axon is intact but conduction at the level of lesion is blocked. This is conduction block (CB). There is no Wallerian degeneration; this is the <b>non</b> degenerative lesion. <b>Recovery</b> will be complete if the cause is removed. In the second, the axon is transected. Wallerian degeneration ensues; this is the degenerative lesion. There are two types of degen-erative lesion. In the fi rst, the basal lamina of the Schwann cell envelope is intact and the axon can regenerate in an orderly fashion into the distal Schwann cell tube. In the second type the basal lamina has been interrupted and spontaneous regeneration will be imperfect, disorderly and may not occur at all. Seddon [32] introduced the terms neurapraxia for CB, axonotmesis for the degenerative lesion of favourable prognosis because of the intact basal lamina, and neurotmesis for the degenerative lesion of unfavourable prognosis because the basal lamina has been interrupted. In clinical practice neurotmesis usually represents severance not only of the axon and its Schwann cell envelope but also of the perineurium and the epineurium. The difference between CB and the unfavourable degenerative lesion, neurot-mesis, is exempli fi ed by two clinical situations which are common enough. Case report: Pure CB: A fi t 23 year old woman fell deeply asleep lying on her left side for about 2 h and awoke with a complete left sided radial palsy.

40|$|Advantages and {{disadvantages}} of administration of resuscitation fluids in burns patients have been discussed at length. However, the effect of resuscitation fluids on tissue physiological endpoints and tissue antibiotic distribution is scarcely reported, yet clinically crucial. The preliminary studies of this thesis involved evaluation of the literature {{and the development of}} a <b>non</b> - <b>recovery</b> anaesthetized rat model of burn injury suitable for the study of plasma and tissue physiological changes and antibiotic pharmacokinetics (PK). Therefore, the first series of the studies for this thesis was designed to examine the relative effects of a range of crystalloid and colloid-containing resuscitation fluids on tissue pH following burn injury in a rat model. The secondary aims were to examine the effects of these fluids on tissue blood flow, plasma protein extravasation (PPE) and evaporative water loss (EWL). In these studies we confirmed that the burn injury and fluid resuscitation were accompanied by a tissue acidosis. Administration of Lactated Ringers’ Albumin (LRA) and Lactated Ringers’ Dextran (LRD) effectively attenuated the degree of tissue acidosis in the thermally injured and non injured sites for 180 minutes post burn and the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) on the non injured sites during the first 60 minutes of the acute phase of burn injury. The second phase of the work was designed to assess the changes in antibiotic distribution with the administration of these different fluids in plasma as well as in interstitial tissues in the burn and the non burn sites. This study showed that for cephalothin (4 g/kg body weight, administered intravenously (IV)), Lactated Ringers solution (LR) and Hypertonic Saline (HS) showed similar plasma PK with Time > Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (> 180 minutes) in plasma. However, the antibiotic tissue distribution was more skewed towards lower levels for HS when compared with LR. For piperacillin (18 g/kg body weight, administered IV), Time > MIC was considerably low comparatively, being only 55 min for both LR and HS. Antibiotic concentrations did not reach the MIC with LRA resuscitation. When considering the interstitial tissues, Time > MIC for cephalothin was lower than HS with LR on both the burn and the non burn sites. T > MIC for piperacillin was zero for all fluids in both burn and non burn sites. The major finding of this study was that with LRA resuscitation, antibiotic distribution was significantly lower than seen with LR and HS for both antibiotics studied in the interstitial tissue fluid space in both the burn and non burn sites. The final phase of the work was designed to study the apparent permeability co efficient of Keratinocytes (KC) to antibiotics in the presence of simulated pH changes observed in burn tissue in thermal injury using colloids and crystalloids. This study found that there was no significant difference between the basolateral and apical concentrations of antibiotics observed neither with the different pH values nor with time. However, there was definitely a significant difference in the apparent permeability of the cells with LR vs LRA and that the permeability was higher with LR than LRA. This study confirmed that the presence of LR allows greater permeation of the antibiotic into the KC, and also that with LRA resuscitation, the antibiotic tends to stay at higher concentrations in the interstitial compartment. These studies demonstrate that choice of resuscitation fluid following burn injury can affect both changes in tissue physiology and antibiotic distribution, warranting further study in both animal models and patient populations...|$|R
