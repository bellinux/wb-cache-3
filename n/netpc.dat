The Nova <b>NetPC</b> involved users subscribing to a computing service, and the computer had no hard drive disks.|$|E

50|$|Because many NCs {{did not use}} Intel CPUs or Microsoft software, Microsoft and Intel {{developed}} a competing standard called <b>NetPC.</b> Other alternatives to the NCRef were WeBRef (Motorola and HDS Network Systems) and Odin (National Semiconductor). The HDS @workStation was stated to ship {{by the end of}} June 1996.|$|E
40|$|The {{total cost}} of {{ownership}} of a PC in a corporate setting ranges from $ 3000 to $ 9000 per year, depending on what survey one consults and the environment where it resides. Thin client-server computing presents an approach to lower the {{total cost of}} ownership by replacing the PC’s with thin clients, i. e. low-end desktops and fast servers. All application and data processing is done on the server and the client is used to display information and process I/O to the server. This paper presents an overview of the current technology in regards to thin client hardware and software. The main concentration is on Windows Based Terminals, Network Computers and <b>NetPCs.</b> We examine two software products that support this technology: Citrix Winframe and MS Windows Terminal Server. An experiment was done to show how thin client-server technology is implemented using Citrix software and thin clients with the goal of improving the PC laboratory environment at the University. The results from the experiment can be used as guidelines for capacity planning. 1 What is Thin Client-Server Computing? Thin client technology does user processing on powerful central servers, and the desktop just provides a graphical display and a means of user input. The aim is to strip away th...|$|R
5000|$|Microsoft and Intel in {{response}} to this challenge put forward a standard for a competing model called the <b>NetPC,</b> a diskless PC that would be primarily adapted to web browser use and would run a simplified version of Windows 95, codenamed Pegasus. Later down the road, this idea evolved into to the Netbook. Microsoft publicly criticized the idea of an Internet OS, and instead argued that the traditional desktop OS should be Internet-enabled, the beginning of the idea for Active Platform, an Internet strategy that culminated later in the release of Windows 98. This strategy, which involved tightly bundling Internet Explorer in Windows, became the center of a United States anti-trust suit against Microsoft. All of the Gang of Five [...] - [...] Netscape, Sun, IBM, Oracle, and Novell [...] - [...] were involved in lobbying for anti-trust action against Microsoft.|$|E
40|$|Summary: The Microsoft ® Windows ® {{operating}} system platform is smart card–enabled {{and is the}} best and most cost-effective computing platform for developing and deploying smart-card solutions. Smart-card requirements have been incorporated into the PC 98 and <b>NetPC</b> design specifications and into future releases of the Microsoft Windows {{operating system}}. Microsoft has released its implementation of the PC/SC 1. 0 specifications for the Windows NT ® 4. 0, Windows 95, and Windows 98 operating system platforms. Future releases of the Windows platform will also contain smart-card support as part of the base platform. (8 printed pages...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a two-year research project {{to develop a}} Personal Information Processing System (PIPS) solution for the roving industrial field operator. Our PIPS system is comprised of 1) an RF network to deliver wireless, digital information, 2) a wearable computer for delivering web-based information (the hardware is a two-piece system comprised of a belt-worn <b>NetPC,</b> attached via a curly cable to a hand held unit with a mouse/display device combination), and 3) software applications that provide added value in the field. Unique challenges in designing such a system for this environment include: 1) having good RF coverage in an environment with so many metal structures, 2) having an intrinsically safe hardware system that provides a lightweight, low cost solution, and 3) having software that {{is compatible with the}} wearable system and supports collaboration in the field...|$|E
40|$|Some {{would argue}} that the time for NCs or NetPCs has either not yet come or has long passed. Flinders has been {{watching}} and waiting for some time now. We had planned to try out this “new” approach in a small, controlled way in 1998, perhaps with a small server and up to 10 NetPCs. However, when university funding became available to provide 100 library workstations for student Web access to flexible delivery initiatives being developed in 1998, the Library was faced with a decision. Should we purchase 100 PC workstations with no additional staff to support this significant increase in public equipment, or should we test the theory that significant savings in application and desktop support costs can be realised with a <b>NetPC</b> type solution? Are they really as fast as normal PCs and are they in fact, easier to manage and support? This paper reports the reasons why the Flinders University Library chose the thin client NC solution in preference to standard fat client PCs, why we thought it particularly appropriate for student applications, how we implemented the new system, what problems we encountered and how close to reality we found the promised benefits, to both end users and system managers...|$|E
