He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament.

He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.|$|E

Fearing to lose their label's highest seller, and the best-selling artist of the decade, Sony chose to release the song.
