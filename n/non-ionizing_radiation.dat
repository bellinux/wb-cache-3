25|$|In {{order to}} protect the {{population}} living around base stations and users of mobile handsets, governments and regulatory bodies adopt safety standards, which translate to limits on exposure levels below a certain value. There are many proposed national and international standards, but that of the International Commission on <b>Non-Ionizing</b> <b>Radiation</b> Protection (ICNIRP) is the most respected one, and has been adopted so far by more than 80 countries. For radio stations, ICNIRP proposes two safety levels: one for occupational exposure, another one for the general population.

25|$|Whether or not <b>non-ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> causes leukemia {{has been}} studied for several decades. The International Agency for Research on Cancer expert working group {{undertook}} a detailed review of all data on static and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy, which occurs naturally and {{in association with the}} generation, transmission, and use of electrical power. They concluded that there is limited evidence that high levels of ELF magnetic (but not electric) fields might cause some cases of childhood leukemia. No evidence for a relationship to leukemia or another form of malignancy in adults has been demonstrated. Since exposure to such levels of ELFs is relatively uncommon, the World Health Organization concludes that ELF exposure, if later proven to be causative, would account for just 100 to 2400 cases worldwide each year, representing 0.2 to 4.9% of the total incidence of childhood leukemia for that year (about 0.03 to 0.9% of all leukemias).|$|E
25|$|The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has {{established}} a TLV for UV-C exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254nm UV, this TLV is 6 mJ/cm² over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV {{is supported by the}} International Commission on <b>Non-Ionizing</b> <b>Radiation</b> Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When TUSS was planned, and until quite recently, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0 mJ/cm² dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2 μW/cm². Thus, 0.2 μW/cm² was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The next ESA spatial mission {{planned to}} study the Sun, Solar Orbiter (SO), necessitates very {{innovative}} EUV detectors. The commonly used silicon detectors suffer important limitations mainly in terms of UV robustness and dark current level. An alternative comes from diamond or III-nitride materials. In these materials, the radiation hardness, solar blindness and dark current are improved due to their wide bandgap. This paper presents the new developments on wide bandgap materials at the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB). We present also the LYRA instrument, the BOLD project, and the EUI instrument suite. 1 Why Wide Bandgap Materials? Silicon detectors suffer from important limitations that can be overcome using a wide bandgap material. Wide bandgap materials are more resistant to the degradation arising from: <b>non-ionizing</b> <b>radiations,</b> ionizing radiations, {{as well as from}} the UV signal.

50|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of {{particles}} of <b>non-ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> {{is too small}} to produce charged ions when passing through matter. For non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation (see types below), the associated particles (photons) have only sufficient energy to change the rotational, vibrational or electronic valence configurations of molecules and atoms. The effect of non-ionizing forms of radiation on living tissue has only recently been studied. Nevertheless, different biological effects are observed for different types of <b>non-ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Different {{biological}} {{effects are}} observed for {{different types of}} <b>non-ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> A difficulty {{is that there is}} no controversy that the upper frequencies of <b>non-ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> near these energies (much of the spectrum of UV light and some visible light) is capable of non-thermal biological damage, similar to ionizing radiation. Health debate therefore centers on the non-thermal effects of radiation of much lower frequencies (microwave, millimeter and radiowave radiation). The International Agency for Research on Cancer recently stated that there could be some risk from <b>non-ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> to humans. But a subsequent study reported that the basis of the IARC evaluation was not consistent with observed incidence trends. This and other reports suggest that there is virtually no way that results on which the IARC based its conclusions are correct.|$|E

Materials and methods: A selected part of the right back of five-week old female hairless rats was exposed or sham exposed (n= 8) for 2 h per day, 5 days a week, for 12 weeks to GSM- 900 or - 1800 signals using a loop-antenna. At the end of the experiment, skin biopsies were taken. Results: Analyses of skin sections using hematoxylin eosin saffron (HES) coloration showed no significant difference in skin thickness among the groups. Immunohistochemical analysis of basal lamella cells in radiofrequency radiation (RFR) - exposed epidermis showed that the ratio of the antigen Ki- 67 (cellular proliferation marker) positive cells to total lamella cells remained within the range of the normal proliferation ratio. No significant differences in the level of filaggrin, collagen, and elastin were observed among the different groups.

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} in populations used by plant breeders is essential if improvement {{is to be}} made by any selection procedure. Since variability can be induced by mutagenic agents, investigations were introduced in 1953 at the University of Nebraska to study the effect of radiation on genetic {{variation in}} quantitative traits in maize (Zea mays). A large number of sub-lines were developed from long-time inbred lines by use of ionizing and <b>non-ionizing</b> <b>radiations.</b> Some of these sub-lines were observed to be distinctly different from the parent lines from which they were developed. This study involves three of those mutant genotypes which resulted from the irradiation of two inbred lines. Although it is not expected that any of these mutants may be useful as lines in a maize breeding program, the methods used and the conclusions drawn from this investigation may be extended to further irradiation studies in which improved phenotypes and genotypes may be desired. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine whether the observed phenotypic changes resulted from genetic changes, and if so, to determine the genetic mechanisms involved, including the number of loci affected, degree of dominance, and existence of epistasis.

The following types of treatments were performed with electron beams (EB) and microwaves (MW) : separate EB irradiation, separate MW irradiation, successive irradiation (EB irradiation followed by MW heating) named (EB+MW), successive irradiation (MW heating followed by EB irradiation) named MW+EB and simultaneous irradiation with EB and MW named S(EB+MW). The first interesting experimental {{result is that the}} microorganism’s survival fraction diminishes exponentially with EB dose for the separate EB irradiation while for the separate MW irradiation the microorganism’s survival fraction exhibits an oscillatory decrease versus MW dose: periods of microorganism inhibition are followed by periods of microorganism stimulation. The second important result is that all combined irradiation procedures such as S(EB+MW), followed by MW+EB and then by EB+MW, cause greater reduction of NTG and mould survival fractions than separate EB irradiation or separate MW irradiation. The S(EB+MW) treatment type produces the maximum reduction of NTG and moulds. The third important result is that the EB dose level could be reduced by a factor in the range of 1. 5 - 2. 5 by combined EB and MW irradiation...|$|R
