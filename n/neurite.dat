Reciprocally, EFS activates SRC signaling through c-CRK and RAP1. Further, SRC directly phosphorylates residues Y576 and Y577 tyrosine sites on the EFS, enhancing targeting FAK, and eventually the solubility and/or stability of the complex. Through SRC, EFS may also negatively regulate expression of E-cadherin at adherens junctions, a function that has been reported for other CAS proteins (NEDD9 and BCAR1); however, this point has not been directly established for EFS.|$|E

40|$|Senile plaques are polymorphous {{beta-amyloid protein}} {{deposits}} {{found in the}} brain in Alzheimer disease and normal aging. This beta-amyloid protein is derived from a larger precursor molecule of which neurons are the principal producers in brain. We found that amyloid precursor protein (APP) -immunoreactive <b>neurites</b> were involved in senile plaques and that only a subset of these <b>neurites</b> showed markers for the abnormal filaments characteristic of neurofibrillary pathology. In the neocortex of nondemented individuals with senile plaques but spared of neurofibrillary pathology, dystrophic <b>neurites</b> in senile plaques showed only APP accumulation. In contrast, in the brains of Alzheimer patients, virtually all APP-immunoreactive <b>neurites</b> also showed immunoreactivity with ubiquitin, tau, and phosphorylated neurofilaments. The presence of tau and neurofilament epitopes in dystrophic <b>neurites</b> in senile plaques was correlated with the extent of neurofibrillary pathology in the surrounding brain tissue. Accumulation of APP {{and the formation of}} neurofibrillary pathology in senile plaque <b>neurites</b> are therefore distinct phenomena. Our findings suggest that APP accumulation in senile plaque <b>neurites</b> occurs prior to tau accumulation and is therefore more closely related to appearance of neuritic dystrophy...|$|R

25|$|The Reissner's fiber is also {{important}} on the morphogenetic neuronal processes, being involved on neuronal survival, aggregation and <b>neurite</b> extension. In vitro studies demonstrated {{that the presence of}} RF, in conjunction with glial cells, is essential to the survival of neuronal cells. The studies seem to point that the RF might bind some of the growth factors produced by glial cells and transport them to the neurons. On the process of neuronal aggregation, RF seems to serve as a control factor in direct cell-to-cell communication, favoring neuronal aggregation when the density of neurons is low and preventing this aggregation when the density gets higher. Although the mechanism behind this is not well understood, it is known to be linked to the different domains in SCO-spondin that are related to coagulation factors and TSRs, as referred above.

25|$|Following {{injury to}} the central nervous system, NG2 expressing {{oligodendrocyte}} precursor cells are seen around the site of injury within 48 hours of the initial injury. The number of NG2 expressing cells continues to increase {{for the next three}} to five days and high levels of NG2 are seen within seven–ten days of the injury. In vitro studies have been done to demonstrate the effect that NG2 levels play on <b>neurite</b> growth inhibition. Notably, neurons would not adhere to substrates made solely of NG2, which hints at its inhibitory effects on nerve regeneration. When grown on substrates containing both NG2 and adhesive molecules, <b>neurite</b> extension was shown to be reduced by 40-45% when compared to <b>neurite</b> extension on substrates only containing the adhesive molecules. Furthermore, cultures were created with striped surfaces that alternated NG2 lanes with lanes only containing adhesive molecules. Neurons and axons placed on these striped regions consistently stayed in the lanes without NG2. It is clear, then, that the accumulation of NG2 expressing cells at the site of injury creates an extracellular barrier that inhibits axon regrowth into the glial scar area.|$|E
25|$|Glial scar {{formation}} is induced following {{damage to the}} nervous system. In the central nervous system, this glial scar formation significantly inhibits nerve regeneration, {{which leads to a}} loss of function. Several families of molecules are released that promote and drive glial scar formation.

The accumulation of reactive astrocytes at the site of injury and the up regulation of molecules that are inhibitory for <b>neurite</b> outgrowth contribute to the failure of neuroregeneration. The up-regulated molecules alter the composition of the extracellular matrix in a way that has been shown to inhibit <b>neurite</b> outgrowth extension. This scar formation involves several cell types and families of molecules.|$|E

40|$|Abnormal (dystrophic) <b>neurites</b> are {{widespread}} in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subsets of these <b>neurites</b> cluster in intimate association with amyloid deposits, constituting classic senile plaques. Two major markers expressed by many plaque-associated <b>neurites</b> are the microtubule associated protein tau and chromogranin A, a soluble protein of large dense core synaptic vesicles. The authors show {{a new type of}} lesion, tangle-associated neuritic clusters (TANCs), in which abnormal <b>neurites</b> form dense aggregates, each centered by an extracellular (ghost) neurofibrillary tangle, rather than an amyloid deposit. <b>Neurites</b> in TANCs are similar to plaque <b>neurites</b> in shape and expression of tau and chromogranin A, and different from a second, nonaggregating subset of dystrophic <b>neurites</b> in AD, neuropil threads. TANCs are abundant in the hippocampus of all patients with AD; a few are found in some aged nondemented people, and in the nucleus basalis of Meynert and occasionally the neocortex of AD patients. Ultrastructurally, the core of a TANC is made up of extracellular bundles of straight filaments. This core is not recognized by antibodies to native or synthetic beta A 4 peptide, the major protein of plaque amyloid, thus showing that not all neuritic clusters in AD are associated with this peptide...|$|R
25|$|Another thermo-responsive gel is {{one that}} is formed by {{combining}} chitosan with glycerophosphate (GP) salt. This solution experiences gelation at temperatures above 37°C. Gelation of chitosan/GP is rather slow, taking half an hour to initially set and 9 more hours to completely stabilize. Gel strength varies from 67 to 1572 Pa depending on the concentration of chitosan; the lower end of this range approaches the stiffness of brain tissue. Chitosan/GP has shown success in vitro, but the addition of polylysine is needed to enhance nerve cell attachment. Polylysine was covalently bonded to chitosan in order to prevent it from diffusing away. Polylysine was selected because of its positive nature and high hydrophilicity, which promotes <b>neurite</b> growth. Neuron survival was doubled, though <b>neurite</b> outgrowth did not change with the added polylysine.|$|E
25|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that interactions between neurotrophic factors could alter the optimal concentrations of each factor. While cell survival and phenotype maintenance are important, the emphasis of evaluation was on <b>neurite</b> extension. A combination of NGF, glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was presented to Dorsal root ganglion cultures in vitro. One factor from each neurotrophic family was used. It was determined {{that there is not}} a difference in individual optimal concentration and combinatorial optimal concentration; however, around day 5 or 6 the neurites ceased extension and began to degrade. This {{was hypothesized}} to be due to lack of a critical nutrient or of proper gradients; previous studies have shown that growth factors are able to optimize <b>neurite</b> extension best when presented in gradients. Future studies on neurotrophic factor combinations will need to include gradients.|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{studies show}} that Notch can {{influence}} <b>neurite</b> development.

40|$|Paclitaxel (Pac) is an {{antitumor}} {{agent that}} {{is widely used}} for treatment of solid cancers. While being effective as a chemotherapeutic agent, Pac in high doses is neurotoxic, specifically targeting sensory innervations. In view of these toxic effects associated with conventional chemotherapy, decreasing the dose of Pac has been recently suggested as an alternative approach, which might limit neurotoxicity and immunosuppression. However, it remains unclear if low doses of Pac retain its neurotoxic properties or might exhibit unusual effects on neuronal cells. The goal {{of this study was}} to analyze the concentration-dependent effect of Pac on isolated and cultured DRG neuronal cells from wild-type and TLR 4 knockout mice. Three different morphological parameters were analyzed: the number of neurons which developed <b>neurites,</b> the number of <b>neurites</b> per cell and the total length of <b>neurites</b> per cell. Our data demonstrate that low concentrations of Pac (0. 1 nM and 0. 5 nM) do not influence the neuronal growth in cultures in both wild type and TLR 4 knockout mice. Higher concentrations of Pac (1 - 100 nM) had a significant effect on DRG neurons from wild type mice, affecting the number of neurons which developed <b>neurites,</b> number of <b>neurites</b> per cell, and the length of <b>neurites.</b> In DRG from TLR 4 knockout mice high concentrations of Pac showed a similar effect on the number of neurons which developed <b>neurites</b> and the length of <b>neurites.</b> At the same time, the number of <b>neurites</b> per cell, indicating the process of growth cone initiation, was not affected by high concentrations of Pac. Thus, our data showed that Pac in high concentrations has a significant damaging effect on axonal growth and that this effect is partially mediated through TLR 4 pathways. Low doses of Pac are devoid of neuronal toxicity and thus can be safely used in a chemomodulation mode. © 2013 Ustinova et al...|$|R

Here, we report that microtubules and microfilaments, components of the cytoskeleton that are involved in the formation of <b>neurites,</b> are present in MK-STYX-induced outgrowths. In addition, in response to nerve growth factor (NGF), MK-STYX-expressing cells produced more growth cones than non-MK-STYX-expressing cells, further supporting a model in which MK-STYX has a role in actin signaling. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis demonstrates that MK-STYX modulates actin expression. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that MK-STYX-induced <b>neurites</b> form synapses. To determine whether these MK-STYX-induced <b>neurites</b> have pre-synaptic or post-synaptic properties, we used classical markers for axons and dendrites, Tau- 1 and MAP 2 (microtubule associated protein 2), respectively. MK-STYX induced <b>neurites</b> were dopaminergic and expression of both Tau- 1 and MAP 2 suggests that they have both axonal and dendritic properties. Further studies in rat hippocampal primary neurons demonstrated that MK-STYX altered their morphology. A significant number of primary neurons in the presence of MK-STYX had more than the normal number of primary <b>neurites.</b> Our data illustrate the novel findings that MK-STYX induces outgrowths in PC- 12 cells that fit the criteria for <b>neurites,</b> have a greater number of growth cones, form synapses, and have pre-synaptic and post-synaptic properties.

40|$|After {{spinal cord}} injury {{neuronal}} connections are not easily re-established.

Oriented scaffolds in biodegradable polymers could be an excellent way to support both the orientation of <b>neurites</b> within the injury site as well as aiding their crossing out of the lesion. To establish the validity of using grooved micro-topography in polycaprolactone in combination with glia we have studied the long-term (3 weeks) orientation of neuronal cells on monolayers of astrocytes on the top of grooved topographies of various dimensions. We find that <b>neurites</b> are significantly aligned by groove/ridge type topographies which are “buried” under a monolayer of astrocytes for up to 3 weeks. This alignment is significantly lower than that of <b>neurites</b> growing directly on the topography, but these neurons do not survive on the poly-l-lysine coated polymer for more than a week. The alignment of <b>neurites</b> on the astrocyte layer to the underlying topography decreases over time, and with groove width. Topographies with 12. 5 or 25 μm lateral dimension appear optimal for the long-term alignment and can support myelination.

40|$|Regenerative {{strategies}} that facilitate the regrowth and reconnection of neurons {{are some of}} the most promising methods in spinal cord injury research. An essential part of these strategies is an increased understanding of the mechanisms by which growing <b>neurites</b> seek out and synapse with viable targets. In this paper, we use computational and theoretical tools to examine the targeting efficiency of growing <b>neurites</b> subject to limited resources, such as maximum total neural tree length. We find that in order to efficiently reach a particular target, growing <b>neurites</b> must achieve balance between pruning and branching: rapidly growing <b>neurites</b> that do not prune will exhaust their resources, and frequently pruning <b>neurites</b> will fail to explore space effectively. We also find that the optimal branching/pruning balance must shift as the target distance changes: different strategies are called for to reach nearby vs. distant targets. This suggests the existence of a currently unidentified higher-level regulatory factor to control arborization dynamics. We propose that these findings may be useful in future therapies seeking to improve targeting rates through manipulation of arborization behaviors...|$|R

These structures {{are composed of}} extracellular accumulations of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and other plaque-associated proteins, surrounded by large, swollen axons and dendrites (dystrophic <b>neurites)</b> and activated glia. Dystrophic <b>neurites</b> are thought to disrupt neuronal function, but whether this damage is static, dynamic, or reversible is unknown. To address this, we monitored neuritic plaques in the brains of living PDAPP;Thy- 1 :YFP transgenic mice, a model that develops AD-like pathology and also stably expresses yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in a subset of neurons in the brain. Using multiphoton microscopy, we observed and monitored amyloid through cranial windows in PDAPP;Thy- 1 :YFP double-transgenic mice using the in vivo amyloid-imaging fluorophore methoxy-X 04, and individual YFP-labeled dystrophic <b>neurites</b> by their inherent fluorescence. In vivo studies using this system suggest that amyloid-associated dystrophic <b>neurites</b> are relatively stable structures in PDAPP;Thy- 1 :YFP transgenic mice over several days. However, a significant reduction in the number and size of dystrophic <b>neurites</b> was seen 3 days after Aβ deposits were cleared by anti-Aβ antibody treatment.

25|$|Arsenic is a neurotoxin {{commonly}} found concentrated in areas exposed to agricultural runoff, mining, and smelting sites (Martinez-Finley 2011). One {{of the effects}} of arsenic ingestion during the development of the nervous system is the inhibition of <b>neurite</b> growth which can occur both in PNS and the CNS. This <b>neurite</b> growth inhibition can often lead to defects in neural migration, and significant morphological changes of neurons during development,) often leading to neural tube defects in neonates. As a metabolite of arsenic, arsenite is formed after ingestion of arsenic and has shown significant toxicity to neurons within about 24 hours of exposure. The mechanism of this cytotoxicity functions through arsenite-induced increases in intracellular calcium ion levels within neurons, which may subsequently reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential which activates caspases, triggering cell death. Another known function of arsenite is its destructive nature towards the cytoskeleton through inhibition of neurofilament transport. This is particularly destructive as neurofilaments are used in basic cell structure and support. Lithium administration has shown promise, however, in restoring some of the lost neurofilament motility. Additionally, similar to other neurotoxin treatments, the administration of certain antioxidants has shown some promise in reducing neurotoxicity of ingested arsenic.|$|E

40|$|A central {{unresolved}} {{issue in}} Alzheimer's disease is {{the origin of}} the extracellular amyloid beta protein (A beta P) found in senile plaques and its relationship to the dystrophic <b>neurites</b> that intimately surround it. Here the presence and distribution within senile plaques of various epitopes of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) are compared with the distribution of A beta P itself and markers for plaque <b>neurites.</b> Several principal findings emerge: 1) antibodies to regions of APP outside of A beta P ('APP antibodies') recognize only a subgroup of senile plaques; 2) within these plaques, APP antibodies label discrete globular and granular structures morphologically resembling neurites; 3) virtually all of the plaques labeled by APP antibodies also contain <b>neurites</b> reactive with antibodies to tau; 4) double labeling with anti-tau and an APP antibody shows that the neuritelike profiles stained by the APP antibody are always closely associated with tau-positive <b>neurites</b> within the same plaque and that a minority of profiles appear to be labeled by both antibodies; and 5) antibodies to different regions throughout APP label the same profiles within plaques, suggesting the presence of the full-length precursor. The authors conclude that only a subgroup of senile plaques contain APP epitopes and that the immunostained structures are <b>neurites.</b> Because many A beta P-containing plaques in neocortex, cerebellum, and striatum were found to be devoid of any APP labeling, as were vascular A beta P deposits, {{it is unlikely that the}} extracellular A beta P is principally derived from the APP found within dystrophic <b>neurites.</b> The immunodetection of apparently full-length APP, an axonally transported protein, in selected plaque <b>neurites</b> provides yet another protein marker of neuritic dystrophy, possibly indicative of an aberrant regenerative response...|$|R

Alternatively, neurocan production is up regulated in astrocytes in glial scar when compared to uninjured cortex and astrocytes in primary cell culture conditions.
