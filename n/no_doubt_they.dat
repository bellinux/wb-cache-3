500|$|According to Baley, at {{approximately}} 2 p.m. on August 30, 1858, the emigrants camped near the Colorado River heard Alpha Brown's step-daughter, Sallie Fox, screaming. She {{had been playing}} in a wagon when she noticed several Mohave nearby. Having lost the element of surprise, three hundred warriors then let out war whoops as they shot arrows into the camp, mortally wounding Rose's foreman, Alpha Brown. Udell described the attack as [...] "like a shower" [...] of arrows. According to Rose, [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>they</b> expected to massacre us. But we were well armed and the men that were in camp ready to receive them." [...] As the men mounted a defense, the women ran with {{their children to the}} covered wagons. Both Udell and Rose stated that the fighting lasted for approximately two hours. Baley explains that when a Mohave chief who appeared to be leading the attack stepped out in front of his warriors and taunted the emigrants, Gillum Baley, a veteran of the Black Hawk War and a noted marksman, took him down with a single rifle shot. The Mohave warriors then retrieved the chief's body and retreated from the battle.|$|E
500|$|The Clash's {{involvement}} with Jamaican musical and production styles has inspired similar cross-cultural efforts by bands such as Bad Brains, Massive Attack, 311, Sublime and <b>No</b> <b>Doubt.</b> <b>They</b> are credited with {{laying the groundwork}} for LCD Soundsystem's [...] "punk-funk". Jakob Dylan of the Wallflowers lists London Calling as the record that [...] "changed his life". Bands identified with the garage rock revival of the late 1990s and 2000s such as Sweden's the Hives, Australia's the Vines, Britain's the Libertines, and America's the White Stripes and the Strokes evince the Clash's influence. Among the many latter-day British acts identified as having been inspired by the Clash are Babyshambles, the Futureheads, the Charlatans and Arctic Monkeys. Before M.I.A. had an international hit in 2008 with [...] "Paper Planes", which is built around a sample from [...] "Straight to Hell", she referenced [...] "London Calling" [...] on 2003's [...] "Galang". A cover of [...] "The Guns of Brixton" [...] by German punk band Die Toten Hosen was released as a single in 2006. A version by reggae legend Jimmy Cliff with Tim Armstrong from Rancid was scheduled for release in November 2011. American-Irish punk band Dropkick Murphys released a cover of the song on Anti Heroes vs Dropkick Murphys in 1997.|$|E

2500|$|From 1825 to 1828, {{the number}} of native attacks more than doubled each year, raising panic among settlers.

2500|$|Upon its release, Wolfmother {{received}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. It was named 15th greatest album of 2006 by Rolling Stone magazine. The album's sound {{was compared to}} such 1960s and 1970s hard rock and heavy metal bands as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, {{as well as more}} modern bands including Queens of the Stone Age and The White Stripes, though this led some reviewers to go as far as accusing the trio of [...] "ripping off" [...] such bands. Q were somewhat less critical, describing the music as [...] "Far from rocket science, but immense fun nonetheless". Total Guitar gave the album 9/10, describing it as [...] "ruddy marvellous", adding that it [...] "can't fail to bowl you over". The Record Review also praised the band and its debut, remarking that if they [...] "continue to produce such epic songs and memorable riffs, there’s <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>they</b> will be at the forefront of rock and roll for years to come." ...|$|E

The social problems that confront us are many and formidable. Let the Government labour to its utmost, let the Legislature labour days and nights in your service; but, after the very best has been attained and achieved, the question whether the English father is to be the father of a happy family and the centre of a united home is a question which must depend mainly upon himself.
