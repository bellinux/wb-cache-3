5|$|The 1980 {{introduction}} of a veal-based sandwich raised the ire of animal rights groups. By 1982, several groups were alleging that the veal being sourced to Burger King was most likely kept in battery cages, unable to move, and fed a low iron diet designed to produce the lightly toned meat associated with veal. As {{a result of this}} protest, these groups lead a three-country boycott of Burger King in April 1982. Critics of the boycott claimed that the type of veal that was being used was more-likely to be free range veal due to cost issues, claiming that there is simply <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> $2.00 sandwich would use the higher quality $15.00/lb veal. The rights groups refused to back down despite the cost claims because Burger King would only release the name of the meat processor, not its veal suppliers. The chain eventually announced that it intended to pull the sandwich from the market, stating that it was not because of the boycotts but because {{there was a lack of}} consumer demand. In fact, the chain said the sandwich sold best in the markets where the majority of the protests were occurring.|$|E

25|$|Although Parma {{had taken}} the city, his Protestant opponents took some comfort {{in the fact that}} the city had been {{destroyed}} in the process and was of no use as a garrison. Yet this was in <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> Pyrrhic victory; Parma had lost fewer than 500 of his own force, and the Protestant rebels had lost a significant geographical and militarily strategic point, and one of their more intrepid young commanders in Cloedt. Parma had nearly unfettered access to the Electorate's northern regions, called the Niederstift, from which he could mount an attack on the rebellious provinces of the Netherlands. Gebhard renounced of the Electorate in 1588. Despite Ernst of Bavaria's unchallenged possession, Parma continued to acquire and fortify towns throughout the region.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{investigations}} {{during the}} 1970s and 1980s charged Cohn three times with professional misconduct, including perjury and witness tampering. He was accused in New York of financial improprieties related to city contracts and private investments. He {{was acquitted of}} all charges. In 1986, a five-judge panel of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court disbarred Cohn for unethical and unprofessional conduct, including misappropriation of clients' funds, lying on a bar application, and pressuring a client to amend his will. In this case in 1975, Cohn entered the hospital room of a dying and comatose Lewis Rosenstiel, the multi-millionaire founder of Schenley Industries, forced a pen to his hand and lifted it to the will {{in an attempt to}} make himself and Cathy Frank—Rosenstiel's granddaughter—beneficiaries.

The Hamidiye corps or Hamidiye Light Cavalry Regiments were well-armed, irregular, majority Kurdish cavalry (minor amounts of other nationalities, such as Turcoman) formations that operated in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire. They were intended to be modeled after the Caucasian Cossack Regiments (example Persian Cossack Brigade) and were firstly tasked to patrol the Russo-Ottoman frontier and secondly, to reduce the potential of Kurdish-Armenian cooperation. The Hamidiye Cavalry was in <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> cross-tribal force, despite their military appearance, organization, and potential. Hamidiye quickly {{find out that they}} could only be tried through a military court martial They became immune to civil administration. Realizing their immunity, they turned their tribes into “legalized robber brigades” as they steal grain, reap fields not of their possession, drive off herds, and openly steal from shopkeepers.|$|E

If an excommunication was pronounced against the bishops of China, who separated themselves from Rome and put themselves under the Chinese government, one very easily understands why Pope Pius XII excommunicated them. There is no question of us separating ourselves from Rome, nor of putting ourselves under a foreign government, nor of establishing a sort of parallel church as the Bishops of Palmar de Troya have done in Spain.

500|$|Initial {{reactions}} to the novel were varied. The New Yorker declared Lee [...] "a skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenuous writer", and The Atlantic Monthlys reviewer rated the book [...] "pleasant, undemanding reading", but found the narrative voice—"a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult"—to be implausible. Time magazine's 1960 review of the book states that it [...] "teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life" [...] and calls Scout Finch [...] "the most appealing child since Carson McCullers' Frankie got left behind at the wedding". The Chicago Sunday Tribune noted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novel's events, writing: [...] "This is in <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> sociological novel. It underlines no cause... To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel of strong contemporary national significance." ...|$|E

Leigh travelled to Los Angeles, however, to be with Olivier and to try to convince David Selznick that she was the person for the part. Myron Selznick also represented Olivier and when he met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities that his brother was searching for. According to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the Atlanta Depot scene was being filmed and stage-managed an encounter, where he introduced Leigh, derisively addressing his younger brother, [...] "Hey, genius, meet your Scarlett O'Hara." [...] The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organized a screen test with director George Cukor and wrote to his wife, [...] "She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone's ear but your own: it's narrowed down to Paulette Goddard, Jean Arthur, Joan Bennett and Vivien Leigh". The director, George Cukor, concurred and praised Leigh's [...] "incredible wildness". She secured the role of Scarlett soon after.|$|E
500|$|Another of Uzanne's {{interests}} was female fashion, {{about which}} he wrote {{a number of books}} and articles that were later translated into English. Specifically, he was focused on the image of the Parisienne, the women of Paris. Uzanne is perceived by some to have had a desire to revive French national pride; he shared the nationalistic feelings of other members of the generation who had experienced the defeat by Prussia in 1870. This was reflected in their efforts to promote a renewal of the decorative arts. Silverman mentions that Uzanne believed that married bourgeois women should not only decorate the walls of their homes, but also [...] "cultivate luxury and art in an ornament ignored by their aristocratic predecessors: their undergarments". Uzanne felt that the eroticism of the theatrical atmosphere was no longer what it had been and had become [...] "more moral, more bourgeois". His first and perhaps most famous book on fashion was L'Éventail (1882, translated as The Fan in 1884), a [...] "delightful" [...] illustrated story about the hand fans. He admitted that his book [...] "in <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> work of powerful wisdom and erudition", but simply the first in a projected series of [...] "little books for the boudoir".|$|E

McCartney's [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] made prominent use of a string octet; Gould describes it as [...] "a true hybrid, conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song". Harrison was developing as a songwriter, and three of his compositions earned {{a place on the}} record. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Revolver as the third greatest album of all time. During the US tour that followed its release, however, the band performed none of its songs. As Chris Ingham writes, they were very much [...] "studio creations... and there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams. 'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts." [...] The band's final concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August was their last commercial concert. It marked the end of a four-year period dominated by almost nonstop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally.|$|E

[...] Contessa Gayles of The Boombox wrote that [...] "Beyoncé rocks the racy shoot in satin hot pants, garters and a slinky wrap dress", further describing her look and the set as [...] "sexy". Matt Donnelly of Los Angeles Times described the video as [...] "sultry" [...] and further found [...] "a Jessica Rabbit vibe". Donnelly also wrote, [...] "The video carries the standard Bey DNA—wind machines, plunging necklines and lots of hair. Not that we're complaining." [...] Derek Johnson of Long Island Press commented that the video is [...] "heating up the Internet and we're pretty sure we know why", referring to Beyoncé's figure. He further commended Beyoncé for taking viewers {{back to the days}} of black and white television and [...] "into the office of a lonely detective on a rainy day. We've all seen that show before, but not like this." [...] Natalie Finn of E! Online compared the video with the one for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008), adding that it [...] "sticks with the power of black and white", and describing the set as [...] "naughty".

2500|$|Also, the [...] "kuge" [...] that Iwate served {{was a word}} used {{starting}} {{from the age of}} buke, but the Jinki era when the Heian capital has not even been built, so there's also the contradiction that in the era in which Iwate served the aristocratic family, her place of service, Kyō no Miyako, did not even exist. Also, the name [...] "Iwate" [...] was a made-up name from a play titled Iwate, so there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> person named that could have really existed.
