5|$|Braithwaite {{was taken}} to Enfield Police Station and interviewed by Det Sgt Dermot McDermott and Detective Constable Colin Biggar. He was held {{for three days and}} was at first denied access to a lawyer, on the {{instruction}} of Det Ch Supt Melvin. He was interviewed eight times over the first two days, and with a lawyer present four times on the third. During the first 30 hours of his detention he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and said in court – as did several other suspects – that the heat in the cells was oppressive, making it difficult to breathe.|$|E
25|$|Except in {{the most}} severe cases, ischemic colitis is treated with {{supportive}} care. IV fluids are given to treat dehydration, and the patient is placed on bowel rest (meaning <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or drink) until the symptoms resolve. If possible, cardiac function and oxygenation should be optimized to improve oxygen delivery to the ischemic bowel. A nasogastric tube may be inserted if an ileus is present.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Sitting Bull went to Fort Qu'Appelle {{to procure}} a Canadian reserve. Sitting Bull’s {{attempts}} failed once again. At the time, Walsh was in Chicago. He spoke to General Hammond of the U.S. Army, who told Walsh that Sitting Bull {{would not have}} to “fear reprisals.” Walsh quickly sent word of the news to Wood Mountain. When Sitting Bull returned from Fort Qu'Appelle he told Légaré that he was ready to leave. “There is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> here, nothing but turnips,” he said.|$|E

"And here, you Mister Doctor Archibald Sitgreaves," [...] echoed Betty, {{showing her}} {{blooming}} countenance {{from a broken}} window of the kitchen, [...] "you are ever a-coming too late; here is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>ate</b> but the skin of Jenny, and the body ye're mentioning." ...|$|R

25|$|The caliph Al-Musta'sim was {{captured}} {{and forced to}} watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols rolled the caliph up in a rug, and rode their horses over him, as {{they believed that the}} earth would be offended if it were touched by royal blood. But the Venetian traveller Marco Polo claimed that Al-Musta'sim was locked in a tower with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> but gold and “died like a dog”.|$|E
25|$|Ranchers gave {{little thought}} about where their cattle roamed, and often did not grow hay for the winter. Légaré {{was among those}} who {{rejected}} the use of hay. In 1903–04, a severe winter, recounted by Reverend Claude J. Passaplan as the worst in recorded history at the time, followed prairie fires and an early frost, leaving cattle with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> The Métis around Willow Bunch lost all of their cattle as a result. An even worse winter in 1906–07 caused a loss of an estimated 60 to 70 per cent of all cattle in southwestern Saskatchewan.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the start}} of World War I, Moon soon enlisted in the Royal Naval Air Service with the rank of Flight Sub-Lieutenant. His {{military}} service took him to East Africa, based on HMS Hyacinth, from where on 6 January 1917 {{he was on a}} reconnaissance flight with Cdr. Richard Bridgeman as observer. They were forced to land with engine trouble and came down in a creek of the Rufiji River delta where they destroyed the seaplane to avoid the possibility of its being captured by the enemy. They then spent three days wandering in the delta trying to avoid capture and to rejoin their ship. During this time they had little or <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and were continually obliged to swim across the creeks, the bush on the banks being impenetrable.|$|E

25|$|Music scholar Martha Hume wrote:When you shake all the {{stardust}} {{off this}} tale, {{what you must}} begin with is an uneducated child {{from one of the}} most isolated cultures in the United States who was given in marriage to a man some six years her senior, a man who was a violent and sometimes brutal alcoholic, who was similarly uneducated and without any job skills to speak of. Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where the child had no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that there were times when the family had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> but dandelion greens, and you have a situation that might well have led to murder. But what actually happened was so improbable, so unimaginable, that the lives of Loretta and Mooney Lynn became one of the great legends of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|Franklin's party reached Fort Enterprise on 12 October 1821, {{two days}} after Back. They found it deserted and unstocked. The promised {{supplies}} of dried meat had not appeared, and there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> except bones from the previous winter, a few rotting skins which had been used as bedding, and a little tripe de roche. A note from Back explained {{that he had found}} the fort in this state, and that he was heading towards Fort Providence to look for Akaitcho and his first nation members. The party despaired. Two voyageurs, Augustus and Benoit, set off upriver in the hope of meeting some first nation people. The rest of the group remained, too weak to go any further. Two of the voyageurs lay down crying and waited to die, and even the normally optimistic Franklin wrote of how quickly his strength was evaporating. None of them had eaten meat for four weeks.|$|E
500|$|On 20 April 1770, Smart {{was arrested}} for debt. On 11 January 1771, he was tried by Lord Mansfield, the gentleman who {{originally}} introduced Smart to Alexander Pope, and he was soon recommended to the King's Bench Prison. Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the [...] "Rules" [...] (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: [...] "Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> I beg you to send me two or three shillings which (God willing) I will return, with many thanks, {{in two or three}} days." [...] On 20 May 1771, Smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work, Hymns, for the Amusement of Children.|$|E

500|$|Admiral Howe sent a noisy {{demonstration}} of Royal Navy ships up the Hudson River {{early on the}} morning of September 15, but Washington and his aides determined that it was a diversion and maintained their forces {{at the north end of}} the island. Five hundred Connecticut militia under the command of Colonel William Douglas had erected a crude breastwork on the American line at Kip's Bay, but many of these farmers and shopkeepers were inexperienced and had no muskets. They carried instead homemade pikes constructed of scythe blades attached to poles. After having been awake all night, and having had little or <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in the previous twenty-four hours, at dawn they looked over their meager redoubt to see five British warships in the East River near their position. As the militia at Kip's Bay lay in their ditches, the British ships, anchored [...] offshore, also lay quiet. The day was oppressively hot. At about 10 am, General Sir Henry Clinton, to whom Howe had given the task of making the landing, ordered the crossing to begin. [...] A first wave of more than eighty flatboats carried 4,000 British and Hessian soldiers, standing shoulder to shoulder, left Newtown Cove and entered the waters of the East River, heading towards Kip's Bay.|$|E
500|$|The Ottoman army {{managed to}} advance as Vlad Ţepeş instituted {{a policy of}} {{scorched}} earth, poisoned the waters, and also created marshes by diverting the waters of small rivers. Traps were created by the digging of pits, and then covered with timber and leaves. The population and animals were evacuated to the mountains and as Mehmed advanced for seven days, his army suffered from fatigue as [...] "he found no man, nor any significant animal, and <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or drink." [...] Vlad adopted guerrilla tactics as his cavalry made several hit-and-run attacks. He would also send ill people suffering from lethal diseases, such as leprosy, tuberculosis, syphilis — and in more significant numbers – those who suffered from the bubonic plague, to intermix with the Turks and infect them. The bubonic plague managed to spread in the Ottoman army. The Ottoman fleet launched a few minor attacks on Brăila and Chilia, but {{without being able to}} do much damage, as Vlad Ţepeş had destroyed most of the ports in Bulgaria. Chalkokondyles writes that the Sultan managed to capture a Wallachian soldier and at first tried to bribe him for information; when that didn't work, he threatened him with torture, to no avail. Mehmed was said to have commended the soldier by saying, [...] "if your master had many soldiers like yourself, in a short time he could conquer the world!" ...|$|E

60|$|By {{now we were}} in a poor way, for we had {{practically}} <b>nothing</b> left <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> {{which did}} not tend to raise the spirits of the party. Also that lime outcrop proved to be an uninteresting spot overlooking a wide valley which seemed to suggest that there were other valleys of a similar sort beyond it, and nothing more.|$|R
60|$|While {{waiting for}} his father to come to again, Matt {{could not help but}} gaze at the surroundings. The garret room was small and bare of furniture, {{containing}} nothing but the mattress, a broken-down stove, and a few cracked dishes. There was half a loaf of stale bread beside the dishes, and <b>nothing</b> else <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> was in sight.|$|R
25|$|Only 23 men {{returned}} to duty; they, {{along with the}} 18 British sailors, were used to form a temporary ship's company for Arbutus, allowing her to depart for the Cook Islands that afternoon. In their haste to separate the loyalists from further mutinous influences, the ship was not properly provisioned before departure, with <b>nothing</b> aboard <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> but canned pilchards.|$|R
2500|$|After {{completing}} {{the first part}} of his baccalaureate a year early he spent the academic year of 1940–41 at the Pensionnat St. Louis, a boarding school in nearby St. Etienne. The following year he took courses in advanced mathematics at the University of Lyon which his father hoped would prepare him for a career in engineering. He was in Lyon when the Vichy government fell and the Germans took over. The city became a centre of the resistance and Boulez later recalled the terrible reprisals: [...] "when there was a bomb in a café where the military had been drinking next day there was a poster saying hostages had been shot. It was not a gentle time, and <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and terribly cold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{landed at}} the port of Glenora in British Columbia on May 20, the main force marched {{overland}} to Telegraph Creek, where the [...] long Teslin Trail began. The force was broken down into 35-man teams for the march, with an advance party of 50 men sent on ahead to improve the trail and advance quickly using a steamer onto Fort Selkirk to begin rebuilding it. The journey over the rugged terrain was arduous, and Thomas Evans noted the suffering caused by the heat, swamps and mosquitos, observing that his men had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> but [...] "hard biscuits, rancid strong bacon and black tea". They each carried heavy packs, as the local contractors had failed to supply them with sufficient mules to carry their supplies.|$|E
2500|$|The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment with {{attached}} infantry {{company and}} the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery arrived at Beirut on 8 October. The city was occupied without opposition when 600 prisoners were captured. The remainder of the infantry division and artillery followed when the road enabled the movement of wheeled vehicles. Private Norman F. Rothon, a mule driver with the 13th Mountain Howitzer Battery, 8th Brigade RGA, 7th (Meerut) Division, arrived at Beirut {{on the evening of}} 9 October. He and his unit had marched [...] since 19 September; [...] of that total were marched between 8 and 9 October. Rothon wrote in his diary, [...] "if I was asked how I felt when we arrived I should say like a cripple and fairly doubled up and I hope I shall never experience another march like it the men tramping along with hollow cheeks and staring eyes, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> but the awful Bouilli & Biscuits and lots of the men go without as their stomachs cannot stand the awful repetition (we have had 3 weeks of it). My inside yearns for some ordinary food & vegetables." ...|$|E

2500|$|Duterte's {{constant}} cursing had {{local officials}} {{worried that the}} Philippines would lose foreign aid from the United States and European Union. [...] He responded that “If {{you think it is}} high time for you guys to withdraw your assistance, go ahead. [...] We will not beg for it. We have a problem here trying to preserve our society" [...] he said. [...] The President continued that he would “be the first to go hungry. I will {{be the first one to}} die of hunger". [...] Local actress Agot Isidro responded in Tagalog [...] "First of all, no one's trying to fight you. As a matter of fact, you're the one who's picking a fight. Secondly, the country where you are elected as President by 16 million out of 100+ million is Third World. You talk as if the Philippines is a superpower. Excuse me, we don't want to go hungry. If you want, you do it yourself. Leave us out of it. So many people have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and yet you'll starve us even further". Her sentiments were echoed by Senator Panfilo Lacson adding that [...] "if the economy worsen, the entire Filipino people will be affected, they will go hungry as well".|$|E
2500|$|McCarthy {{records that}} the Japanese forces {{in front of}} Sanananda {{numbered}} about 5,500 including the hospitalised. No date is given but in context of text, this might be mid-December. The Center of Military History publication states, [...] "enemy strength in the Sanananda area was therefore between four and five thousand". No date is given but the context suggests this is at or after mid-December. Bullard reports a resupply from the Mambare River to supply approximately 5,000 men. No date is given but the context suggests {{this is about the}} time that Buna fell but before 8 January. It may likely have occurred {{at about the same time}} as the reinforcement that arrived just before the new year. Milner records, [...] "General Yamagata had some 5,000 troops at the beachhead (including the sick and wounded), but the men had almost <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and every Japanese in the area faced death by starvation." [...] Bullard gives the strength immediately prior to the fall as 4,000. This gives a detailed breakdown of the fate of the defenders. However, Bullard gives the standing strength of the garrison at about the same time and on the same page as 5,000. McCarthy reports that the Sanananda-Giruwa garrison was strengthened by 200–300 who escaped from Buna.|$|E

A traveler is lost on a Western prairie. He has wandered all day, far from home and with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Night comes on. The wolves begin to howl in the darkness. At last he reaches a log cabin, almost in ruins. No matter, it will afford him shelter for the night. Scarcely has he entered and composed himself to rest when a violent storm arises. Thunders roar. Lightnings flash. The snow heaps against the door. It grows bitterly cold. What shall he do? He can't stay there and freeze to death. Let me illustrate. Two darkies, walking down Broadway, saw a quarter of a dollar on the sidewalk. One of the colored gentlemen said to his companion, 'Sambo, don't you freeze to dat quarter. I seed it first.' That is just the idea. He can't stay there and freeze. His soul—but {{what do we know about}} the soul? Is it homogeneous or heterogeneous? Who can tell? Who except me, Daniel Pratt, the Great American Traveler, and soon to be President of the United States? Why not? Was not imperial Rome once saved by the cackling of a goose?" ...|$|E
