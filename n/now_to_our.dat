C summarized: [...] "The Corvette {{was a big}} hit–we expected and thoroughly enjoyed that–but we were surprised at how well it withstood the ordeal...once we recovered from the trip we conceded that we'd developed new respect for a car we'd long regarded {{as something of a}} put on. In every sense of the word, our Yukon Corvette proved to be tough and we'd have to say that even the production versions impressed us as coming closer to being real touring cars than we might ever have thought. There's a lot more sincere ring <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> stock answer to the question, Why a Corvette?" ...|$|E

60|$|II. I come <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> second question, namely: What is {{the nature}} of the {{evidence}} that causal laws have held hitherto, at least in the observed portions of the past?
