50|$|The <b>nacunda</b> <b>nighthawk</b> is {{not only}} the largest of the highly aerial {{nightjar}}s known as nighthawks and the largest species of nightjar in the neotropics, {{it is one of the}} largest species in the world. Its length, at 27.5 to 32 cm, is somewhat less than the great eared-nightjar, which is typically considered the largest species in the family, but the nacunda may actually weigh a bit more on average. Six specimens of <b>nacunda</b> <b>nighthawk</b> were found to average 159 g in body mass, with range of 130 to 188 g. Its very large size, large head, and pale body with highly contrasting black primaries make the <b>nacunda</b> <b>nighthawk</b> easy to identify.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{noteworthy}} for its partially diurnal habits. Though a capable aerial forager, the <b>nacunda</b> <b>nighthawk</b> spends {{a considerable amount}} of time on the ground; it has notably long tarsi for a nightjar, and is more likely than other species to be seen standing on the ground, rather than resting on the surface.|$|E
50|$|The <b>nacunda</b> <b>nighthawk</b> (Chordeiles nacunda) is {{a species}} of {{nightjar}} in the family Caprimulgidae. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are dry savanna, subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
50|$|The great eared {{nightjar}} (Lyncornis macrotis) is {{a species}} of nightjar in the family Caprimulgidae. It is the largest species in the family in terms of length, which can range from 31 to 41 cm. Males weigh an average of 131 g and females weigh an average of 151 g so it the second heaviest species in the family after the <b>nacunda</b> <b>nighthawk.</b>|$|E
50|$|Temperatures {{range from}} 18 to 32 C {{with an average}} of 26 C.Average annual {{rainfall}} is 2250 mm.There are three dominant vegetation types including at least 285 tree species in 55 botanical families.Most of the area is covered by open rainforest, with smaller areas of dense rainforest and savannah, the last of which have little commercial value.Migratory birds include black-tailed tityra (Tityra cayana), <b>nacunda</b> <b>nighthawk</b> (Chordeiles nacunda), band-rumped swift (Chaetura spinicaudus), fork-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus savana), solitary sandpiper (Tringa solitaria), vermilion flycatcher (Pyrocephalus rubinus) and purple martin (Progne subis).|$|E
