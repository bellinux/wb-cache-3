50|$|The {{white-tailed deer}} {{is the only}} animal managed as game in this {{protected}} area. Mammals protected in the reserve include: the cougar, the jaguar, the <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua,</b> the Guayaquil squirrel, the Sechuran fox, etc.|$|E
50|$|The two anteaters of {{the genus}} Tamandua, the {{southern}} (Tamandua tetradactyla) and the <b>northern</b> <b>tamanduas</b> (Tamandua mexicana), are {{much smaller than the}} giant anteater, and differ essentially from it in their habits, being mainly arboreal. They inhabit the dense primeval forests of South and Central America. The usual colour is yellowish-white, with a broad black lateral band, covering nearly the whole of the side of the body.|$|R
50|$|With no defined {{breeding}} season for <b>northern</b> <b>tamanduas,</b> females {{appear to be}} able to enter oestrus at any time of year. Males locate fertile females by scent, and court them with repeated sniffing and swatting with their claws. Eventually, they use their strong fore limbs and tails to secure the females while they mate. Gestation lasts from 130 to 190 days, and results in the birth of a single offspring. The young anteater initially shelters in a nest in a hollow tree, but later moves about by clinging to its mother's back. Young leave the mother at about a year of age, and <b>northern</b> <b>tamanduas</b> have been reported to live up to 9.5 years in captivity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>tamanduas</b> {{are mainly}} nocturnal, {{but are also}} often active during the day, and spend only around 40% {{of their time in}} the trees. They are active for about eight hours each day, {{spending}} {{the rest of the time}} sheltering in hollow trees. They are solitary animals, occupying home ranges of between 25 and 70 ha (62 and 170 ac). Known predators include jaguars and harpy eagles.|$|R
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> (Tamandua mexicana) is {{a species}} of tamandua, an {{anteater}} in the family Myrmecophagidae. They live in tropical and subtropical forests from southern Mexico, through Central America, and {{to the edge of}} the northern Andes.|$|E
50|$|Anteaters {{are common}} in lowland and middle {{elevation}} throughout Costa Rica. The most commonly seen of Costa Rica's three anteaters species is the <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua.</b> The giant anteater is huge and endangered. The other anteater is the silky anteater.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> {{ranges from}} southeastern Mexico south {{throughout}} Central America, and in South America {{west of the}} Andes from northern Venezuela to northern Peru. Southern tamanduas are found from Venezuela and Trinidad to northern Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay.|$|E
5000|$|Their fur is thick, bristly, yellowish-white to fawn in color, {{often with}} a broad black lateral band, {{covering}} nearly {{the whole of the}} side of their bodies. <b>Northern</b> <b>tamanduas</b> are marked with a black V on their backs and a [...] "vest" [...] over their torso, while southern tamanduas in the lowest part of their range are considerably lighter in color and may have only the V.|$|R
5000|$|The 600-acre (242-ha) reef {{is known}} to have at least 35 species of coral, 140 species of molluscs, 44 species of crustaceans, and 123 species of fish. The outer reef is about 4 km long. [...] On land there are many types of animal as well {{including}} <b>northern</b> <b>tamanduas,</b> pacas, white-nosed coatis, raccoons, sloths, agoutis, mantled howlers and white-headed capuchins.It has a variety of birds as well including the green ibis, green-and-rufous kingfisher and keel-billed toucan.|$|R
50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>tamanduas</b> subsist {{almost entirely}} on diets of ants and termites, {{although}} they have also been observed to eat small quantities of fruit. They prefer relatively large insects, over 4 mm in length, including Camponotus, Azteca, Crematogaster, and Nasutitermes, among others. They may eat up to 9,000 insects per day, from 50 to 80 different nests, which they locate by scent and then dig into with their powerful claws. They extract the ants with their long, narrow, sticky tongues, but seem to do little permanent damage to the nests, perhaps {{because they do not}} spend long at each one before being driven away by the insects' natural defences.|$|R
50|$|Like other anteaters, the <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> {{is highly}} adapted to its unusual diet. The tongue is long, extensible, {{and covered in}} sticky saliva {{able to pick up}} ants and termites. It has unusually well {{developed}} muscles, attached to a large hyoid bone and rooted {{to the top of the}} sternum. The entire oral cavity is modified to accommodate this tongue, and is so elongated that the back of the soft palate is level with the fifth cervical vertebra near the base of the neck, rather than at the top of the pharynx as in most other mammals. The jaw muscles and mandible are reduced, and the latter is particularly fragile. Like other anteaters, the <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> has no teeth.|$|E
50|$|Extant {{species are}} the giant {{anteater}} Myrmecophaga tridactyla, about 1.8 m long including the tail; the silky anteater Cyclopes didactylus, about 35 cm long; the southern tamandua or collared anteater Tamandua tetradactyla, about 1.2 m long; and the <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> Tamandua mexicana of similar dimensions.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> inhabits forests from {{southern}} Mexico, through Central America to western Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador, and the northwestern corner of Peru. It {{has been reported}} from various types of forest within this region, including evergreen, deciduous, mangrove swamps, cloud forests, and secondary forest. Four subspecies of T. mexicana are currently recognised: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of suitable rest sites {{is considered to}} be a key determinant of spatial patterns in animal activity. However, it is not immediately evident which landscape features satisfy rest site requirements or how these sites are configured within the home range. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) /accelerometer telemetry to investigate rest site selection at the home-range scale for <b>northern</b> <b>tamanduas</b> Tamandua mexicana on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We developed models specifying each tamandua as the individual experimental unit and averaged coefficients to produce population-level estimates. Tamanduas had on average 17. 8 (+/- 8. 1) rest sites within their home range and used 1. 36 (+/- 0. 51) on any given day. These rest sites tended to be located in the core of tamandua home ranges, with active locations associated with the periphery of the home range. Rest sites were positively associated with (1) a high density of Attalea butyracea palm trees; (2) elevation; (3) tall vegetation. There was a slight negative relationship between the {{distribution of}} rest sites and slope, and no apparent relationship between rest site selection and relative distance to forest canopy gaps. From focal animal observations, we identified that tamandua rest sites were typically located in trees (90 %), with 25 % (12 of 49) occurring in palms. We contend that <b>northern</b> <b>tamanduas</b> on BCI selected vegetated arboreal rest sites because of reduced likelihood of detection from terrestrial predators in these sites. Our models identified considerable individual variation in rest site selection, which suggests that the practice of pooling individuals and fitting models at an aggregate level may be inappropriate for certain types of habitat selection research...|$|R
5000|$|The giant {{anteater}} got its binomial name from Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its generic name, Myrmecophaga, and specific name, tridactyla, are both Greek, meaning [...] "anteater" [...] and [...] "three fingers", respectively. Myrmecophaga jubata {{was used as}} a synonym. Three subspecies have been tentatively proposed: M. t. tridactyla (ranging from Venezuela and the Guianas to northern Argentina), M. t. centralis (native to Central America, northwestern Colombia, and northern Ecuador), and M. t. artata (native to northeastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela). The {{giant anteater}} is grouped with the semiarboreal <b>northern</b> and southern <b>tamanduas</b> in the family Myrmecophagidae. Together with the family Cyclopedidae, whose only extant member is the arboreal silky anteater, the two families comprise the suborder Vermilingua.Anteaters and sloths belong to order Pilosa and share superorder Xenarthra with the Cingulata (whose only extant members are armadillos). The two orders of Xenarthra split 66 million years ago (Mya) during the Late Cretaceous epoch. Anteaters and sloths diverged around 55 Mya, between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs. The Cyclopes lineage emerged around 30 Mya in the Oligocene epoch, while the Myrmecophaga and Tamandua lineages split 10 Mya in the Late Miocene subepoch. During most of the Cenozoic era, anteaters were confined to South America, which was formerly an island continent. Following the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 3 Mya, anteaters of all three extant genera invaded Central America as part of the Great American Interchange.|$|R
50|$|At {{least eight}} {{families}} of howler monkeys have been identified. Other mammals identified {{on the island}} include the <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> anteater, the nine-banded armadillo, white-nosed coati, crab-eating raccoon, agouti, woolly opossum, and the Mexican hairy dwarf porcupine, in addition to various kinds rabbits, squirrels and mice. While researchers have not yet spotted a margay, evidence exists in trees and pawprints.|$|E
50|$|Tamandua is a genus of anteaters {{with two}} species: the {{southern}} tamandua (T. tetradactyla) and the <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> (T. mexicana). They live in forests and grasslands, are semiarboreal, and possess partially prehensile tails. They mainly eat ants and termites, but they occasionally eat bees, beetles, and insect larvae. In captivity, they will eat fruits and meat. They have no teeth and {{depend on their}} powerful gizzards to break down their food.|$|E
50|$|Nicaragua is home {{to several}} species of New World monkeys, {{including}} the Geoffroy's spider monkey, which is currently listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as an endangered species. The jaguar is the largest felid that is indigenous to Nicaragua. Other species include the cougar, jaguarundi, margay, and ocelot. There {{are a number of}} unusual mammals found in Nicaragua, including the three-toed sloth, <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> (lesser anteater), and two species of armadillo.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its diet, and unlike the giant anteater, the <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> is also adapted to an arboreal lifestyle. The muscles of the toes {{and the presence of}} a tough pad on the palms makes the forefeet prehensile, enabling them to grip onto projections as it climbs. The middle toe of the forefeet also bears an unusually large claw, and the toe has enough muscle and leverage to allow it to rip open wood to get at the ants within.|$|E
50|$|The woody {{stems of}} the {{mangroves}} provide habitats and food for marine fauna such as shellfish and fish.The mangroves serve as nurseries for fish, shrimps, crabs and invertebrates.Mammals {{that live in}} the trees include crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), mantled howler (Alouatta palliata), <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> (Tamandua mexicana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) and white-headed capuchin (Cebus capucinus).white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are found in Avicennia bicolor and Laguncularia racemosa mangrove forests.Reptiles include black spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor) and green iguana (Iguana iguana).|$|E
50|$|Silky anteaters and {{northern}} tamanduas extend their ranges {{as far north}} as southeastern Mexico, while giant anteaters can be found {{as far north as}} Central America. Southern tamanduas range south to Uruguay (giant anteaters did also until their recent extirpation there) and the ranges of all species except the <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> overlap in eastern Brazil. Anteaters were confined to South America, which was formerly an island continent, during most of the Cenozoic Era. Once the Isthmus of Panama formed about three million years ago, however, anteaters invaded Central America as part of the Great American Interchange.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> is a {{medium-sized}} anteater with a prehensile tail, small eyes and ears, {{and a long}} snout. The fur is pale yellow {{over most of the}} body, with a distinctive patch of black fur over the flanks, back, and shoulders, that somewhat resembles a vest in shape. The presence of this colouration pattern makes it possible to distinguish these species from its southern relative, which has a more uniform colour. The tail has fur on its upper surface for about a third of its length, but is otherwise hairless. The hind feet have five toes, while the fore feet have only four.|$|E
5000|$|Austrian {{researchers}} {{studying the}} mammals of Piedras Blancas NP in 2003 and 2004 {{compiled a list}} of 96 species sighted or caught in camera traps. The 14 species of carnivores include raccoons, coati, kinkajou, olingo, skunks, grison, tayra and five species of cats (jaguar, ocelot, margay, jaguarundi and puma). It is, however, highly unlikely that tourists will encounter a wildcat as they are elusive and nocturnal. Two-toed sloths are rare in the Esquinas forest but {{can be found in the}} coastal areas around Golfito. Around 20 years ago, the giant anteater was seen for the last time by local hunters, but it is extinct today. The <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> has been sighted near Esquinas Lodge and the silky anteater was recorded in the mangroves near Golfito.|$|E
50|$|Corcovado {{is home to}} {{a sizable}} {{population}} of the endangered Baird's tapir and even a small population of the very rare harpy eagle. The park's rivers and lagoons are home to populations of both the American crocodile and spectacled caiman, along with bull sharks. Corcovado {{is also one of the}} final strongholds of the jaguar within Central America and several other felines are also present, including ocelot, margay, jaguarundi, and puma. All four Costa Rican monkey species can be seen within the park, including the endangered Central American squirrel monkey, white-faced capuchin, mantled howler, and Geoffroy's spider monkey. Other mammals present include two-toed and three-toed sloth, collared peccary, <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> and silky anteater. Poison dart frogs and several species of snake (including the venomous fer-de-lance and bushmaster) are also common within the park.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} tamandua is {{a medium-sized}} anteater, though can vary considerably in size based on environmental conditions. It has a head and body length ranging from 34 to 88 cm, and a prehensile tail 37 to 67 cm long. Adults weigh from 1.5 to 8.4 kg, with {{no significant difference}} in size between males and females. Like their close relative, the northern tamanduas, they have four clawed digits on the fore feet and five on the hind feet, and walk on the outer surfaces of their fore feet, to avoid puncturing their palms with their sharp claws. The underside and the tip of the tail are hairless. The snout is long and decurved with an opening only as wide as the diameter of a stick, from which the tongue is protruded. Although some differences {{in the shape of the}} skull are seen, they can most easily be distinguished from the <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> by their slightly longer ears, which average around 5 cm, instead of 4 cm as in the northern species.|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} fauna of Nicaragua includes seven {{species in}} the order Xenarthra, including the brown-throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) in the family Bradypodidae, Hoffmann 2 ̆ 7 s two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) in the family Megalonychidae, the northern naked-tailed armadillo (Cabassous centralis) and nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) in the family Dasypodidae, and the silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) and <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> (Tamandua mexicana) in the family Myrmecophagidae. Additionally, the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in the family Myrmecophagidae is (or was) certainly part of the fauna of Nicaragua but {{has yet to be}} documented there. Based on 133 xenarthran specimens available in museums and our observations, we herein review and provide new information on distributions, systematics, morphometrics, and natural history of these species in Nicaragua. Replacement of the milk dentition in Dasypus novemcinctus is described and illustrated, documenting the most common adult dental formula of i 0 / 0, c 0 / 0, p 7 / 7, m 1 / 1 = 32...|$|E
40|$|Raphia taedigera is a wetland palm {{species that}} occurs in monospecific stands in Central and South America, Africa, and Madagascar. Use of this {{ecosystem}} by wildlife is largely unknown. We surveyed R. taedigera stands at the Osa Biological Corridor in Costa Rica using 26 camera traps to identify which large (> 1 kg) mammal species use this habitat and the distance each species will travel into it from the surrounding habitats. We conclude that R. taedigera provides habitat and a connectivity function in the Osa region for coati (Nasua narica), raccoon (Procyon sp.), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), whitefaced capuchin (Cebus capucinus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> (Tamandua mexicana), and paca (Cuniculus paca). Other species were detected only {{on the edges of}} stands or not at all. On the basis of literature review, interviews with farmers, frequent detections of collared peccary, and detection in adjacent habitat, the jaguar (Panthera onca) is also expected to traverse R. taedigera stands. Raphia taedigera stands can be considered an important habitat for maintaining connectivity across the Osa Biological Corridor and potentially provide a similar function in other Neotropical landscapes...|$|E
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería Forestal) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Ingeniería Forestal, 2013. A study {{based on}} an {{ecological}} monitoring conspicuous species of birds and mammals at the Sirena Biological Station, Corcovado National Park. Two types of coverage were selected: primary forest (BP) and secondary forest (BS) for each type, there were 9 nine days of work and two periods of the day (morning and afternoon). Wildlife sampling was executed simultaneously using two methods: path traces and point count sightings with infinite radius. There were 8 species of mammals and 3 species of birds found. The puma and white-lipped peccary were observed outside the sampling period. An inventory of tree species {{for each type of}} coverage also took place, using circular plot radius 5 m. 20 species were recorded for BP and 14 species for BS. The technique of linear and mixed models indicated that for the variables "number of individuals", "distance" and "height" there were found no significant differences in the interactions coverage * day period and in each of these main effects. By multivariate analysis techniques based on principal coordinates (CP), conglomerates and discriminant analysis identified four groups of species of wildlife. Outstanding variable for group 1 (red brocked deer (Mazama americana), agouti (Dasyprocta punctata), squirrel (Sciurus granatensis), great tinamou (Tinamus major), great curassow (Crax rubra) and bare throated tiger heron (Tigrisoma Mexicana)) was "transit", for group 2 (collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) and tapir (Tapirus bairdii)) "fingerprint", for group 3 (coati (Nasua narica) and <b>northern</b> <b>tamandua</b> (Tamandua Mexicana)) "type of coverage" and for group 4 (primates) "number of individuals", "distance" and "height". This study could serve as a simple guide for the implementation of ecological monitoring in Sirena Biological Station, integrating volunteers of Protected Areas (ASP), as well as professionals in the field of biological sciences.
