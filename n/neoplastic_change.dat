40|$|Inflammation in the {{intestine}} is {{a well-known}} risk factor for <b>neoplastic</b> <b>changes</b> in the mucosa. In fact, {{it has been shown}} that long-standing ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease have a significantly increased risk for developing colorectal cancer, although the estimates vary widely between studies. Conventional colonoscopy is effective in detecting polypoid changes in the mucosa. However, it is now generally accepted that <b>neoplastic</b> <b>changes</b> in colitis are frequently flat and depressed, which are easily missed by use of routine colonoscopy. The introduction of chromoendoscopy, especially in combination with magnifying endoscopy, has greatly advanced our means to detect and differentiate neoplastic lesions in the colorectum. Accumulating evidence-based data indicate that implementation of chromoendoscopy into colon cancer surveillance protocols for patients with inflammatory bowel disease is effective. However, the introduction of chromoendoscopy into surveillance programs requires meticulous training and further studies to compare the value of chromoendoscopy to newer endoscopic devices and techniques, such as narrow band imaging...|$|R
50|$|Diseases of the {{endocrine}} system are common, including {{conditions such as}} diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, and obesity.Endocrine disease is characterized by irregulated hormone release (a productive pituitary adenoma), inappropriate response to signaling (hypothyroidism), lack of a gland (diabetes mellitus type 1, diminished erythropoiesis in chronic renal failure), or structural enlargement in a critical site such as the thyroid (toxic multinodular goitre). Hypofunction of endocrine glands can occur {{as a result of}} loss of reserve, hyposecretion, agenesis, atrophy, or active destruction.

50|$|Cancer: The most dreadful {{impact of}} NUMT {{insertion}} {{happens when the}} mtDNA is inserted into the regulatory region or nuclear structural genes and disrupts or alters the vital cell processes. For instance, in primary low-grade brain neoplasms, fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis helped with the recognition of mtDNA localized in the nucleus in correlation with an overall increase in mtDNA content in the cell. This ontogenically early event {{is important in the}} etiology of these tumors. Similarly, in hepatoma cells mtDNA sequences are present in the nuclear genome at a higher copy number in contrast with the normal tissues. Another example would be HeLa nDNA that contains sequences which hybridize with mtDNA fragments of approximately 5 kb. An analysis showed that nDNA of malignant cells contains sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I, ND4 , ND4L , and 12S rRNA genes. Based on these findings, mtDNA fragments were assumed to act as a mobile genetic element in the initiation of carcinogenesis. Southern blotting is the method used to determine the frequency of mitochondrial insertion in nDNA of the normal and the tumor cells of mice and rats, which proved that the mtDNA sequences are far more numerous and abundant in nDNA of rodent tumor cells in comparison with normal cells. Using FISH probes, PCR and data sequencing, mapping and comparison, Ju and his teammate found that the mitochondrial-nuclear genome fusions occur at a similar rate per base pair of DNA as interchromosomal nuclear rearrangements, indicating the presence of a high frequency of contact between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA in some somatic cells. Also, Ju and his teammates investigated the timing of somatic mtDNA integration into the nuclear genome by assessing cases in which a metastatic sample had been sequenced in addition to the primary tumor. In some cases, mtDNA transfers into the nucleus in somatic cells are very frequent and can occur after neoplastic formation and during the course of subclonal evolution of cancer which suggest that this event occurs in the common ancestral cancer clones or in normal somatic cells prior to the <b>neoplastic</b> <b>change.</b> These findings demonstrated that the presence of direct correlation between NUMT and cancer in different body organs. Understanding the relation, the timing of the NUMT insertion, location of the insertion, and disrupted genes would help with producing more powerful and effective medicine.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Confocal laser endomicroscopy {{is a novel}} {{endoscopic}} {{technique that}} may allow imaging of living cells in lung tissue in vivo. We assessed the potential of this technique {{for the detection of}} histology during screening bronchoscopy for lung cancer. 32 patients with suspected malignancies underwent bronchoscopy with endomicroscopy using acriflavine hydrochloride. Standardised areas and localised lesions were analysed by in vivo confocal imaging during bronchoscopy and biopsies were taken. Confocal images were graded and correlated prospectively with conventional histology from biopsies. Acriflavine hydrochloride yielded high-quality confocal images and strongly labelled airway epithelial cells. No side-effects were noted. 75 522 confocal images from 56 different locations were compared prospectively with histological data from biopsy specimens. Endomicroscopy allowed subsurface imaging with detailed analysis of cellular and subcellular structures. <b>Neoplastic</b> <b>changes</b> could be predicted with high accuracy (sensitivity 96. 0 %, specificity 87. 1 %, accuracy 91. 0 %). Confocal laser endomicroscopy with acriflavine is a novel diagnostic tool for the analysis of living cells during bronchoscopy and permits virtual histology of <b>neoplastic</b> <b>changes</b> in the airways with high accuracy.

We exploit the depth resolution of a/LCI to exclusively examine the basal layer of the epithelium, approximately 50 to 100 μm beneath the tissue surface, {{without the need for}} exogenous contrast agents, tissue sectioning, or fixation. The results of two studies are presented that compare the performance of two a/LCI modalities. Overall, the combined studies show 91 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity for detecting dysplasia, using histopathology as the standard.

40|$|The growths which tarring first calls {{forth on}} rabbit skin are nearly all benign and, though often {{becoming}} huge, are possessed of so little innate vigor {{as to be}} wholly dependent for success upon favoring local conditions. Nevertheless they are genuine neoplasms as experimental inquiry has shown (1). Tarring provides them with the conditions needed for growth, but after it is discontinued the tumors all more or less gradually disappear unless some other aid is forthcoming (1) or they become cancerous, as only occasionally happens. Plainly the carcinogen acts in two ways: it changes normal cells into neoplastic cells and encourages the multiplication of these latter.

Recently, the expression of laminin- 5 γ 2 chain has been reported to be a marker of invasiveness of epithelial malignant tumors. We investigated the expression of laminin- 5 γ 2 chain and MMP- 2 in the <b>neoplastic</b> <b>changes</b> of uterine cervical squamous epithelium. Tissue samples of normal uterine cervix, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia- 1,- 3 (CIN- 1,- 3) and squamous cell carcinoma keratinizing (SCC-K) and non-keratinizing (SCC-NK) were analyzed for expression of the laminin- 5 γ 2 chain and MMP- 2 by immunohistochemistry. In normal uterine cervix and CIN- 1, laminin- 5 γ 2 chain was immunolocalized only in the basal membrane. In CIN- 3, expression of laminin- 5 γ 2 chain and MMP- 2 became apparent at the epithelial-stromal interface of epithelial cells. In SCC-K and SCC-NK, laminin- 5 γ 2 chain and MMP- 2 expression were abundant at the epithelial-stromal interface of tumor clusters.

40|$|AbstractDevelopment of {{epithelial}} precancer {{and cancer}} leads to well-documented molecular and structural {{changes in the}} epithelium. Recently, it has been recognized that stromal biology is also altered significantly with preinvasive disease. We used the finite-difference time-domain method, a popular technique in computational electromagnetics, to model light scattering from heterogeneous collagen fiber networks and to analyze how <b>neoplastic</b> <b>changes</b> alter stromal scattering properties. Three-dimensional optical images from the stroma of fresh normal and neoplastic oral-cavity biopsies were acquired using fluorescence confocal microscopy. These optical sections were then processed to create realistic three-dimensional collagen networks as model input. Image analysis revealed that the volume fraction of collagen fibers in the stroma decreases with precancer and cancer progression, and fibers tend to be shorter and more disconnected in neoplastic stroma. The finite-difference time-domain modeling results showed that neoplastic fiber networks have smaller scattering cross sections compared to normal networks. Computed scattering-phase functions indicate that high-angle scattering probabilities tend to be higher for neoplastic networks. These results provide valuable insight into the micro-optical properties of normal and neoplastic stroma. Characterization of optical signals obtained from epithelial tissues can aid in development of optical spectroscopic and imaging techniques for noninvasive monitoring of early <b>neoplastic</b> <b>changes...</b>|$|R
