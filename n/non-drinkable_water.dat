50|$|HSBC's {{environmental}} principles {{mean that}} the building has been designed from the start to include the best available technology to reduce the consumption of water and electricity, including low consumption bathroom furniture, waterless urinals, rain collection, water treatment plant and efficient use of <b>non-drinkable</b> <b>water.</b> HSBC claim that the building will consume 55% less water and 40% less energy than comparable structures.|$|E
40|$|The Centralized Renewable Energy System (CRES) at Nebraska Innovation Campus (NIC) is a heat-exchanger {{system that}} {{utilizes}} reclaimed, <b>non-drinkable</b> <b>water</b> {{from the nearby}} water treatment plant to heat and cool a projected 1. 675 {{million square feet of}} office and lab space. A greenhouse gas emissions inventory was estimated for the CRES operating at full build-out of the campus in 2035, compared to conventional office space, being a control system with standard chiller and boiler configuration. The control system is estimated to emit 30, 787 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year (Mg CO 2 e yr- 1), whereas heating and cooling Nebraska Innovation Campus supplemented by CRES is estimated to emit only 15, 637 Mg CO 2 e yr- 1 from electricity use for chillers and pumps, roughly 49 % less greenhouse gas emissions compared to the control system, at a savings of roughly 9 kilograms of CO 2 e per year per square foot...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Industrial {{processes}} commonly involve different sub-systems, {{each one}} of them with an associated controller. Moreover, although these sub-systems might be independent, the energy that the controllers use can be obtained from a limited common source. Furthermore, the total energy used in a control process might be limited because of economical reasons. A proper management of the energy resource would be achieved by having a central decision maker for this task using information of all the control signals. However, this centralized scheme would require an expensive communication network. As an alternative, the total available energy can be divided into the controllers within the process ensuring an upper bound of energy consumption. This work shows that dividing the resource throughout the controllers is not efficient regarding the control performance. Then, a distributed strategy is proposed to manage the available energy resource by using evolutionary game theory. Finally, the proposed strategy is implemented on a wastewater treatment system that considers a first stage given by an urban drainage system (UDS), and a final stage given by a <b>non-drinkable</b> <b>water</b> network (NDWN), i. e., water for streets cleaning, plants watering, etc. Simulation results show an improvement of the performance with the proposed methodology in comparison with an off-line resource management of energy.

50|$|Water is the world's most {{consumed}} drink however, 97% {{of water}} on Earth is <b>non-drinkable</b> salt <b>water.</b> Fresh water is found in rivers, lakes, wetlands, groundwater, and frozen glaciers. Less than 1% of the Earth's fresh water supplies are accessible through surface water and underground sources which are cost effective to retrieve.|$|R
50|$|The park remains green {{throughout}} the summer because of a <b>non-drinkable</b> underground <b>water</b> source, known as the Wellesbourne, which runs below Preston Park, London Road and The Level. The source dates back many centuries and {{is often referred to}} as Brighton's lost river. In 2000, after torrential rain, it rose and caused considerable damage.|$|R
40|$|Water is {{the most}} {{important}} substance in our daily life. Without it, life would not have been possible. Safe drinking water is essential to humans and other life forms, as water is important to the mechanics of biological metabolisms in the body. Drinking water should be pure and free of contaminants to ensure proper health and wellness. Drinking water from different water resources such as wells and tankers should be free from contamination with waterborne pathogens including bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites. Treatment of water using many ways is generally done in order to purify it. However, some water treatment techniques may not properly handled. In addition, water transferring techniques may contaminate the drinking water. Therefore, this study was aim to investigate drinking water in wells and tankers to observe any microbial pathogen presence as a source of health hazard. One hundred and eight water samples from different sources were examined for microbial pathogens using filtration method on solid and liquid selective media. Four sources include sea desalinated water (SDW) from governmental water desalination factories, drinkable wells <b>water</b> (DWW), <b>non-drinkable</b> wells <b>water</b> (NDWW) and commercial desalinated water (CDW) from small commercial water desalination factories. Seven DWW samples (58. 3 %) and five NDWW samples (41. 7 %) were contaminated with E. coli. Eleven DWW samples (91. 7 %) and all NDWW samples (100 %) were contaminated with P. aeruginosa. One DWW sample (8. 3 %) and two NDWW samples (16. 7 %) were contaminated with E. faecalis. Four DWW samples (33. 3 %) and one NDWW sample (8. 3 %) were found contaminated with aspergillus spp. Four SDW samples (100 %) and four CDW samples (50 %) were contaminated with Penicillium spp. Conclusion: CDW was found to be the more suitable than other sources for drinking if a biological hazard is the main target. However, contamination at transferring process should be addressed. Yet, water tanker which is a common transferring technique in many areas in Saudi Arabia and should be tested for safety level from point of contamination hazard during the transferring process...|$|R
