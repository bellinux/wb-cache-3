5|$|Type {{safety is}} {{variable}} in COBOL. <b>Numeric</b> data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and alphanumeric {{data can be}} placed in any data item that can be stored as a string, including <b>numeric</b> and group data. In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may be restricted to a certain type.|$|E
5|$|ISO 3166-1 <b>numeric</b> – three-digit {{country codes}} which are {{identical}} to those developed and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, with the advantage of script (writing system) independence, and hence useful for people or systems using non-Latin scripts.|$|E
5|$|ROT5 is a {{practice}} similar to ROT13 {{that applies to}} <b>numeric</b> digits (0 to 9). ROT13 and ROT5 can be used {{together in the same}} message (ROT13.5).|$|E
5|$|The A666 dual {{carriageway}} (sometimes {{referred to as}} the Devil's Highway because of its <b>numeric</b> designation), is a spur from the M61/M60 motorway interchange through the town centre to Astley Bridge, Egerton, Darwen and Blackburn. The M61 has three dedicated junctions serving the borough.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} sections, wherever <b>numeric</b> equalities {{are shown in}} 'concise form'—such as —the two digits between the parentheses denote the uncertainty at 1σ standard deviation (68% confidence level) in the two least significant digits of the significand. A final X in a proposed definition denotes digits yet to be agreed on.|$|E
5|$|In this {{idealized}} and linearized model, {{there are}} many geometric parameters (wheelbase, head angle, mass of each body, wheel radius, etc.), but only four significant variables: lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate. These equations have been verified by comparison with multiple <b>numeric</b> models derived completely independently.|$|E
5|$|Perl 5.8 {{was first}} {{released}} on July 18, 2002, and had nearly yearly updates since then. Perl 5.8 improved Unicode support, {{added a new}} I/O implementation, added a new thread implementation, improved <b>numeric</b> accuracy, and added several new modules. As of 2013 this version still remains the most popular version of Perl and is used by Red Hat 5, Suse 10, Solaris 10, HP-UX 11.31 and AIX 5.|$|E
5|$|The ISO 3166/MA updates ISO 3166-1 when necessary. A {{country is}} usually {{assigned}} new ISO 3166-1 codes if it changes its name or its territorial boundaries. In general, new alphabetic codes are assigned if a country changes {{a significant part}} of its name, while a new <b>numeric</b> code is assigned if a country changes its territorial boundaries. Codes for formerly used country names that were deleted from ISO 3166-1 are published in ISO 3166-3.|$|E
5|$|The {{alphabetic}} {{country codes}} were first included in ISO 3166 in 1974, and the <b>numeric</b> country codes were first included in 1981. The country codes {{have been published}} as ISO 3166-1 since 1997, when ISO 3166 was expanded into three parts, with ISO 3166-2 defining codes for subdivisions and ISO 3166-3 defining codes for former countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} are {{a sample of}} the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation. Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in <b>numeric</b> order.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and <b>numeric</b> value of letters. Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by <b>numeric</b> keys, {{each of which is}} an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E
5|$|In formal competition, {{each player}} {{is obliged to}} record each move as it is played in a chess {{notation}} in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. Algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as ICCF <b>numeric</b> notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation. The current rule is that a move must {{be made on the}} board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{airports}} {{are required to}} obtain stormwater discharge permits and ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated. Large new airports {{may be required to}} collect 60 percent of aircraft deicing fluid after deicing. Airports that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet <b>numeric</b> discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.I-3).|$|E
5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to construct and identify the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. Counting symmetry is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). Solution symmetry for preserving solutions {{can be applied to}} either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, counting symmetry is more restrictive than simple <b>numeric</b> completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same counting symmetry equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E
5|$|While the MacBook Pro largely {{followed}} the industrial design standard {{set by the}} PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – the glossy display, the sunken keyboard design and the non-mechanical magnetic latch. With the late 2007 revision, the keyboard received several changes to closely mirror the one which shipped with the iMac, by adding the same keyboard short-cut to control multimedia, and removing the embedded <b>numeric</b> keypad and the Apple logo from the command keys.|$|E
5|$|Admission to Baltimore City College is {{selective}} but {{is open to}} residents of Baltimore City and the surrounding counties in the metropolitan area, though non-Baltimore City residents must pay tuition. Applicants must meet all requirements for promotion to ninth grade, {{as determined by the}} Maryland State Department of Education. Additionally, applicants must earn a minimum composite score of 610, calculated by Baltimore City Public Schools. Generally, candidates for admissiom must have a 3.0 overall <b>numeric</b> grade average (B letter grade; 80 or better percentage grade), have at least a 3.0 average in both Mathematics and English, rank in the 65th percentile or better among all Maryland students in Math and English on the Maryland School Assessment (MSA), and have 90% or better attendance rate. Due to the highly competitive nature of the City College admissions process, successful applicants typically exceed the aforementioned minimums. J.D. Merrill, BCC '09, is the school's current Director of Admissions and Institutional Advancement.|$|E
5|$|Satoru Iwata {{was born}} on December6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo, Japan, where his father served as a prefectural official. Throughout middle and high school, Iwata {{displayed}} leadership skills through service as class president, student council president, and club president at various times. His first experience with computers was in middle school with a demo computer that used telephone lines. Iwata would frequent the Sapporo subway and play a simple <b>numeric</b> game, called Game 31, until he mastered it. With money saved up from a dish-washing job and some additional allowance from his father, Iwata purchased an HP-65, the first programmable calculator, in 1974. After entering Hokkaido Sapporo South High School in April1975, he began developing his own games during his junior year. The several simple number games Iwata produced, such as Volleyball and Missile Attack, made use of an electronic calculator he shared with his schoolmates.|$|E
5|$|State {{highways}} {{were first}} formally {{defined by the}} state legislature in 1909 and given <b>numeric</b> designations, although these initial designations were not publicly signed. Portions of modern Route22 were defined as part of legislative routes1 and 22. Legislative route1 went from the New York City line north along the White Plains Post Road to White Plains, then detoured to Harrison (via Westchester Avenue), before proceeding north to Armonk (via modern NY120). Legislative route1 continued north along modern NY22 to Austerlitz, where it then turned northwest to Valatie (via modern NY203 and NY980B), then followed US9 to Albany. Legislative route22 had two segments. The southern segment began in Troy, following NY7 to Hoosick, then went north along modern NY22 up to Putnam Station (south of Ticonderoga).|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. <b>Numeric</b> row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Amy {{can be traced}} back to a {{low-pressure}} area first detected over Kwajalein at 0500UTC on November29. Tracking westward, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam began to monitor vorticity for potential development, assigning the <b>numeric</b> designation 11122 to the tropical system. Late on December2, a routine weather reconnaissance flight unexpectedly intercepted the disturbance and detected unusually strong westerly winds, a characteristic typically indicative of a tropical cyclone. As such, the flight, named Vulture George, was rerouted to investigate the area. After finding conclusive evidence of a closed low-pressure area, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam classified the disturbance as a tropical storm with winds of 100km/h (60mph). At the time, Amy had two separate centers of circulation, resulting in an asymmetrical wind field.|$|E
5|$|A {{notoriously}} violent man, Yamashita {{was known}} for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast <b>numeric</b> advantage, added to {{the fact that some of}} them wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, purposely breaking the arms of three of them in the process. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for excessive use of violence. When confronted by Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed the same way he liked to harm people.|$|E
25|$|<b>Numeric</b> {{keyboards}} contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, {{and several}} function keys. They {{are often used}} to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboards {{that do not have}} a <b>numeric</b> keypad, commonly those of laptop computers. These keys are collectively known as a <b>numeric</b> pad, <b>numeric</b> keys, or a <b>numeric</b> keypad, and it can consist of the following types of keys: Arithmetic operators, numbers, arrow keys, Navigation keys, Num Lock and Enter key.|$|E
25|$|ICCF <b>numeric</b> notation. In {{international}} correspondence chess {{the use of}} {{algebraic notation}} may cause confusion, since different languages have different names for the pieces. The standard for transmitting moves in this form of chess is ICCF <b>numeric</b> notation.|$|E
25|$|In some {{countries}} (such as in continental Europe, where a <b>numeric</b> postcode format {{of four or}} five digits is commonly used) the <b>numeric</b> postal code is sometimes prefixed with a country code when sending international mail to that country.|$|E
25|$|The Google Directory PageRank was an 8-unit measurement. Unlike the Google Toolbar, {{which shows}} a <b>numeric</b> PageRank value upon {{mouseover}} {{of the green}} bar, the Google Directory only displayed the bar, never the <b>numeric</b> values. Google Directory was closed on July 20, 2011.|$|E
25|$|With some 95,000 men {{committed}} to battle, the Austrians had held a 3/1 <b>numeric</b> advantage {{at the end}} of the first day of battle and a 3/2 <b>numeric</b> superiority throughout the second day. The Austrians also deployed 200 cannon to the French 90 cannon.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} digits of {{the serial}} number keep their <b>numeric</b> value.|$|E
25|$|Alphabetical, <b>numeric,</b> and {{punctuation}} {{keys are}} used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The <b>numeric</b> characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, <b>numeric,</b> and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed {{at the same time as}} some modifier keys.|$|E
25|$|NTG (Northern Territory Government) 800-000 to 899-000 and Cycles 80-000 to 85-999, has the NTG {{embossed}} at {{the left}} hand side of a standard plate, while NTG was embossed on top of motorcycle plates. It continues to be issued as a standalone <b>numeric</b> allocation after 2011 when the general series moved to alpha <b>numeric.</b>|$|E
25|$|Non-stormwater permits {{typically}} include <b>numeric</b> effluent {{limitations for}} specific pollutants. A <b>numeric</b> limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration {{allowed in the}} discharge, e.g., 30mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand. Exceeding a <b>numeric</b> limitation constitutes {{a violation of the}} permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify <b>numeric</b> effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements. Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment.|$|E
25|$|Most typefaces, {{especially}} modern designs, {{include a}} complementary set of <b>numeric</b> digits. This {{was not always}} so: in the metal type era, when fonts were often set to highly standardised metrics, fonts might not include <b>numeric</b> digits, or a font of such digits in an unusual style might be sold without a matching set of letters.|$|E
25|$|In C++, since C++14, apostrophes {{are also}} used as digit {{separators}} in <b>numeric</b> literals.|$|E
25|$|In papyrus {{texts from}} the Ptolemaic period onwards, <b>numeric</b> sampi occurs with some regularity.|$|E
25|$|The tire {{diameter}} {{is given}} for High Flotation tires and omitted from <b>Numeric</b> tires.|$|E
25|$|Lock keys lock {{part of a}} keyboard, {{depending}} on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the <b>numeric</b> pad. The lock keys include Scroll lock, Num lock (which allows {{the use of the}} <b>numeric</b> keypad), and Caps lock.|$|E
