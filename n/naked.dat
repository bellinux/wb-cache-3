5|$|The {{process by}} which an {{organisation}} achieves sufficient prominence that {{it is able to}} exercise <b>naked</b> power can be described as the rule of three phases (Russell 1938:63). According to this rule, what begins as fanaticism {{on the part of some}} crowd eventually produces conquest by means of <b>naked</b> power. Eventually, the acquiescence of the outlying population transforms <b>naked</b> power into traditional power. Finally, once a traditional power has taken hold, it engages in the suppression of dissent by the use of <b>naked</b> power.|$|E
5|$|As {{seen from}} Earth, Kepler-4 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 12.7. It is, as a result, not visible with the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of 613 parsecs, Kepler-11d has an apparent magnitude of 14.2. It is, thus, not visible with the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} {{what appears to}} have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the <b>naked</b> eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the <b>naked</b> eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.95. It cannot {{be seen with}} the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.89. It cannot {{be seen from}} Earth with the <b>naked</b> eye {{because it is so}} dim.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light years) away from Earth. It has an {{apparent}} magnitude (V) of 8.22, making the star too dim {{to see from}} Earth with the <b>naked</b> eye. The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived with the <b>naked</b> eye, which has an apparent magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest. The star's actual brightness is measured with an absolute magnitude of 4.12, {{similar to that of}} the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to accusations that speculators were worsening the problem, some markets banned <b>naked</b> short selling {{for a few}} months.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 14.2, and thus cannot {{be seen with}} the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 14.2. It is too dim {{to see from}} Earth with the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|Lighting room — Given the {{inflammable}} {{nature of}} the store, no <b>naked</b> flames were allowed in any rooms {{with the exception of}} this room.|$|E
5|$|<b>Naked</b> eye {{observations}} of Venus during daylight hours exist in several anecdotes and records. Astronomer Edmund Halley calculated its maximum <b>naked</b> eye brightness in 1716, when many Londoners were alarmed by its {{appearance in the}} daytime. French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once witnessed a daytime apparition of the planet while at a reception in Luxembourg. Another historical daytime observation of the planet {{took place during the}} inauguration of the American president Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., on 4 March 1865. Although <b>naked</b> eye visibility of Venus phases is disputed, records exist of {{observations of}} its crescent.|$|E

5|$|Russell {{argues that}} <b>naked</b> power arises within a {{government}} under certain social conditions: when {{two or more}} fanatical creeds are contending for governance, and when all traditional beliefs have decayed. A period of <b>naked</b> power may end by foreign conquest, the creation of stability, and/or {{the rise of a}} new religion (Russell 1938:74).|$|E
5|$|The {{events were}} {{quite close to}} the sun {{and would not have}} been visible to the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|The <b>naked</b> body symbolizes Eros, {{the most}} {{important}} god of the ancient Thespians, a god of creation, beauty and life.|$|E
5|$|The other Spaniards {{thought that}} perhaps the Indians only wanted their clothes, and {{stripped}} <b>naked</b> before going on.|$|E
5|$|The {{star has}} an {{apparent}} magnitude of 12.9. It cannot {{be seen from}} Earth with the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|The star's {{apparent}} magnitude, or how bright {{it appears}} from Earth's perspective, is 4.09. Therefore, Upsilon Andromedae {{can be seen}} with the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 13.7, {{it is too}} faint {{to be seen with}} the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 14.2, Kepler-11 cannot {{be seen from}} Earth with the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the <b>naked</b> eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of {{the stars in the}} Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the <b>naked</b> eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Alderton {{had been}} asphyxiated {{and was found}} <b>naked,</b> and was posed in the {{cruciform}} position. Her pregnancy was also revealed by the autopsy and her family were first informed of it by police officers.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's <b>naked</b> body. Candaules lies <b>naked</b> in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's <b>naked</b> wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{back home}} {{to the sound of}} the Icelanders singing, Agent Cooper is {{suspicious}} of someone in his dark room. He points his gun and says to turn on the light. Audrey Horne is <b>naked</b> in his bed, and she begs him to let her stay.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds may be etched by laser with marks {{invisible}} to the <b>naked</b> eye. Lazare Kaplan, a US-based company, developed this method. However, whatever is marked on a diamond can readily be removed.|$|E
5|$|Female rodents play {{an active}} role in {{choosing}} their mates. Factors that contribute to female preference may include the size, dominance and spatial ability of the male. In the eusocial <b>naked</b> mole rats, a single female monopolizes mating from at least three males.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals {{he faced}} {{teammate}} Brad Tavares {{to earn a}} spot in the live finale. After a fairly even first two rounds, McGee dropped Tavares late in the third round with a left hook and locked in a fight-ending rear <b>naked</b> choke.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.2, {{which means that}} the star is invisible to the <b>naked</b> eye from the perspective of an observer on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 13.9; in other words, {{as seen from}} Earth, Kepler-8 is an extremely dim star. It cannot be seen with the <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|Kramer {{is almost}} {{immediately}} out, {{due to the}} presence of a beautiful exhibitionist woman in the apartment across the street who walks around in her apartment <b>naked</b> with the curtains open. The others are distracted by various temptations: George is distracted in the hospital his mother is staying at by an attractive nurse giving an even more attractive woman a daily sponge bath; Elaine visits a fitness club which is also patronized by John F. Kennedy, Jr.; Jerry is tempted by the <b>naked</b> woman across the street and frustrated because the woman he's dating won't have sex with him since she wants to remain a virgin. One method he uses to distract himself is by watching wholesome shows like Tiny Toons on Nickelodeon.|$|E
5|$|Marking {{the heart}} of the serpent is the constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Serpentis. Traditionally called Unukalhai, is a red giant of spectral type K2III located approximately 23 parsecs distant with a visual magnitude of 2.630 ± 0.009, meaning it can easily be seen with the <b>naked</b> eye even in areas with substantial light pollution. A faint companion is in orbit around the red giant star, although it is not visible to the <b>naked</b> eye. Situated near Alpha is Lambda Serpentis, a magnitude 4.42 ± 0.05 star rather similar to the Sun positioned only 12 parsecs away. Another solar analog in Serpens is the primary of Psi Serpentis, a binary star located slightly further away at approximately 14 parsecs.|$|E
5|$|Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Manning, a 2016 Supreme Court case {{involving}} <b>naked</b> short selling claims against UBS and Merrill Lynch, and others.|$|E
5|$|On March 2, she {{was told}} that her request for removal of POI status—which entailed among other things {{sleeping}} wearing only boxer shorts—had been denied. Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that, {{if she wanted to}} harm herself, she could do so with her underwear or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip <b>naked</b> in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood <b>naked</b> for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} extreme {{examples}} of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial <b>naked</b> mole rat and Damaraland mole rat. The <b>naked</b> mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, {{while the rest of}} the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies. The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own.|$|E
5|$|Russ becomes {{angry with}} Jacqui {{for trying to}} stop him from seeing Max. Russ later runs off with Max abroad. Carmel confesses to Jacqui that she let Russ walk away with Max. Jacqui is angry and goes to see Tony, who agrees to pay for a private {{investigator}} to help find Max. Jacqui leaves for France in order to find Max, but is unsuccessful. She starts a relationship with Des Townsend (Kris Deedigan) but confesses her love to Tony days before his wedding, Tony rejects her. A photographer publishes <b>naked</b> pictures of her after a drunken photoshoot. Jacqui and Des' relationship is strained by Jacqui's <b>naked</b> pictures leaking, her lies and stealing from the school canteen.|$|E
