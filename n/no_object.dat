5|$|In the Sikh {{religious}} text the Guru Granth Sahib, religious {{language is}} used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that the experiences they have while meditating are ineffable, incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous– {{this means that}} there is <b>no</b> <b>object</b> of their experience that can be conceptualised. To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.|$|E
5|$|Using global geometry, some spacetimes can {{be shown}} to contain {{boundaries}} called horizons, which demarcate one region {{from the rest of}} spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since <b>no</b> <b>object</b> can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's horizon, is not a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of objects, one uses a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it {{is the number of}} objects in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and <b>no</b> <b>object</b> is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E
50|$|Metaphysical {{nihilism}} is {{the philosophical}} theory {{that there might}} have been <b>no</b> <b>objects</b> at all—that is, that there is a possible world in which there are <b>no</b> <b>objects</b> at all; or at least that {{there might have been}} <b>no</b> concrete <b>objects</b> at all, so that even if every possible world contains some objects, {{there is at least one}} that contains only abstract objects.|$|R

25|$|The {{basic problem}} is that the {{constructor}} is a peculiar function; when it starts off, there is <b>no</b> <b>object,</b> only raw memory. And by the time it finishes, you have a fully initialized object. Therefore, i) The constructor cannot be called on an object ii) However, it needs to access (and initialize) non-static members. This makes calling the constructor directly an error. The solution is the placement form of operator new.|$|E

50|$|Causality in the Chittamatrin buddhist school approach, Asanga's (c. 400 CE) mind-only Buddhist school, {{asserts that}} objects cause {{consciousness}} in the mind's image. Because causes precede effects, {{which must be}} different entities, then subject and object are different. For this school, there are <b>no</b> <b>objects</b> which are entities external to a perceiving consciousness. The Chittamatrin and the Yogachara Svatantrika schools accept that there are <b>no</b> <b>objects</b> external to the observer's causality. This largely follows the Nikayas approach.|$|R

25|$|Araki allows two verb {{roots to}} appear in one single verb phrase, thus forming a sort of complex verb {V1, V2}; usually {{no more than two}} verbs can appear at a time. This series of two verbs share one mood-subject clitic and the same aspect markers. This does not imply that they semantically have the same subject. <b>No</b> <b>object</b> or other {{complement}} can insert between these two verbs. The transitivity suffix -i, as well as the object suffix, appear on the right of the second verb, provided this is authorized by the morphology of V2 and by the syntactic context.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no other}} 17th-century artist who {{employed}} the exorbitantly expensive pigment lapis lazuli (natural ultramarine) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours umber and ochre should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed. This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer’s understanding of Leonardo’s observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object. This means that <b>no</b> <b>object</b> is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} principle states that <b>no</b> <b>object</b> can ever have precise values of position and velocity simultaneously. The total {{energy of a}} quantum mechanical object (potential and kinetic) is described by its Hamiltonian which also describes {{the system as a}} harmonic oscillator, or wave function, that fluctuates between various energy states (see wave-particle duality). All quantum mechanical systems undergo fluctuations even in their ground state, a consequence of their wave-like nature. The {{uncertainty principle}} requires every quantum mechanical system to have a fluctuating zero-point energy greater than the minimum of its classical potential well. This results in motion even at absolute zero. For example, liquid helium does not freeze under atmospheric pressure regardless of temperature due to its zero-point energy.|$|E

25|$|As {{everything}} {{depended on}} the final game, the Imperial Cricket Conference agreed to a request that the match be played to a finish with time <b>no</b> <b>object.</b> The England selectors, conscious that the team had not beaten Australia in a series for 14 years, and had won just once in 19 Tests since 1920, made several changes. Carr was replaced as captain by Percy Chapman, a decision which proved enormously controversial in the press but of which Hobbs approved; Rhodes was also recalled to the team, aged 48. Amid huge public interest and excitement, the deciding match began; Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 53 on the first day, but after both sides had batted once, the match was evenly balanced {{at the end of}} the second day. Overnight rain seriously damaged the pitch before the third morning; batting became extremely difficult, and few critics—including members of the England team—expected England to score many runs. Instead, Hobbs and Sutcliffe, who had scored 49 on the second evening, began to bat confidently before the effects of a hot sun drying a damp pitch made batting even more hazardous. Concentrating on careful defence, but scoring where possible, the pair added 172 in total. Arthur Richardson, a spin bowler, was expected to be the main threat, but while it often looked like Hobbs would be dismissed, he faced most of Richardson's bowling and survived. Some critics believed that, through his batting, Hobbs had deliberately exaggerated the difficulties of facing Richardson to prevent the Australian captain putting on a more difficult bowler. Commentators praised the skilful defence of both batsmen, Hobbs in particular. Immediately after reaching 100, Hobbs was out and received a prolonged ovation from the crowd. Many critics believed that, given the conditions, match situation and pressure, this was the greatest innings of Hobbs' career. England continued batting to build up a large lead and bowled Australia out to win the Ashes.|$|E
500|$|After a {{hiatus of}} one film—On Her Majesty's Secret Service, in which George Lazenby played Bond—Connery {{returned}} to the role for Diamonds Are Forever after David Picker, the head of United Artists, {{made it clear that}} Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was <b>no</b> <b>object.</b> When approached about resuming the role of Bond, Connery demanded—and received—a fee of £1.25 million (£ million in [...] pounds), 12.5% of the gross profits and, as a further enticement, United Artists offered to back two films of his choice. His performance received mixed reviews, with Raymond Benson considering that Connery [...] "looks weary and bored... he is overweight, slow-moving, and doesn't seem to be trying to create a credible character". Despite that, Benson considers that Connery [...] "still radiates more screen presence than Roger Moore or George Lazenby". On the other hand, Pauline Kael said [...] "Connery's James Bond is less lecherous than before and less foppish—and he's better this way".|$|E
500|$|Lord Grenville, the Prime Minister, was {{determined}} to introduce an Abolition Bill in the House of Lords, {{rather than in the}} House of Commons, taking it through its greatest challenge first. When a final vote was taken, the bill was passed in the House of Lords by a large margin. Sensing a breakthrough that had been long anticipated, Charles Grey moved for a second reading in the Commons on 23 February 1807. As tributes were made to Wilberforce, whose face streamed with tears, the bill was carried by 283 votes to 16. Excited supporters suggested taking advantage of the large majority to seek the abolition of slavery itself, but Wilberforce made it clear that total emancipation was not the immediate goal: [...] "They had for the present <b>no</b> <b>object</b> immediately before them, but that of putting stop directly to the carrying of men in British ships to be sold as slaves." [...] The Slave Trade Act received royal assent on 25 March 1807.|$|E

500|$|A native Oregonian, Davenport {{developed}} {{interests in}} both art and horses {{as a young}} boy. [...] He tried a variety of jobs before gaining employment as a cartoonist, initially working at several newspapers on the West Coast, including The San Francisco Examiner, purchased by William Randolph Hearst. His talent for drawing and interest in Arabian horses dovetailed in 1893 at the Chicago Daily Herald when he studied and drew the Arabian horses exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition. [...] When Hearst obtained the New York Morning Journal in 1895, money was <b>no</b> <b>object</b> {{in his attempt to}} establish the Journal as a leading New York newspaper, and Hearst moved Davenport east in 1885 to be part of what is {{regarded as one of the}} greatest newspaper staffs ever assembled. [...] Working with columnist Alfred Henry Lewis, Davenport created many cartoons in opposition to the 1896 Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley, and Hanna, his campaign manager. McKinley was elected and Hanna elevated to the Senate; Davenport continued to draw his sharp cartoons during the 1900 presidential race, though McKinley was again victorious.|$|E
500|$|George Lazenby was {{originally}} offered {{a contract for}} seven Bond films, but declined and left after just one, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, {{on the advice of}} his agent. Producers contemplated replacing him with John Gavin (though Batman star Adam West and Burt Reynolds had also been considered); Reynolds and West had stated that Bond should be not be played by an American actor. Michael Gambon rejected an offer, telling Broccoli that he was [...] "in terrible shape." [...] United Artists' chief David Picker was unhappy with this decision and made it clear that Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was <b>no</b> <b>object.</b> When approached about resuming the role of Bond, Connery demanded the fee of £1.25 million. To entice the actor to play Bond once more, United Artists offered to back two films of his choice. After both sides agreed to the deal, Connery used the fee to establish the Scottish International Education Trust, where Scottish artists could apply for funding without having to leave their country to pursue their careers. Since John Gavin was no longer in the running for the role, his contract was paid in full by United Artists. The first film made under Connery's deal was The Offence, directed by his friend Sidney Lumet. The second was to be an adaptation of Macbeth by William Shakespeare, using only Scottish actors and in which Connery himself would play the title role. This project was abandoned because Roman Polanski's version of Macbeth was already in production.|$|E
