5|$|Loggers felled {{massive amounts}} of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. Reforestation efforts began in the 1940s because <b>natural</b> <b>regeneration</b> could not {{keep pace with the}} rate of logging. In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, old-growth forest covers only about five percent of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the <b>natural</b> <b>regeneration</b> of forests across many regions of the country.|$|E
5|$|In total, 415 {{types of}} plants and 86 species of {{mushroom}} are recorded in the area. A number of local flower types are considered endemic to the Balkans, such as Dianthus deltoides and Allium breviradum. On the other hand, many endemic plants of central and northern Greece grow also in the park, like the Centaurea vlachorum. Moreover, rare species of the forests of Pindus mountains, typical of the lower geological layers, are Minuartia baldaci, Bornmuellera tymphaea, Campanula hawkinsiana, Viola dukadjinica and Silene pindicola. The most important places for the gathering of rare plants are the northern slopes of the peaks of Aftia, Flegga and Kapetan Kleidi. All the above places are very steep and difficult for grazing animals and therefore <b>natural</b> <b>regeneration</b> of the forest {{in this area is}} progressing normally and many rare plants are conserved. The serpentine soil, which is dominant {{in the area of the}} Pindus National Park also favors the growing of rare endemic plant species.|$|E
30|$|Since {{exclosure}} is a {{new management}} option and a rapidly evolving complex ecosystem, it demands more investigations {{in the areas of}} its potential in maintaining vegetation diversity and thereby improves soil conditions. Thus, the study area was designated as “closed area” in 1967 with the aim of rehabilitation of highly degraded lands, and totally closed from interference of livestock and human being since 1998. Since then, gullies have become stabilized and their expansions have been blocked due to the improvements in vegetation cover through <b>natural</b> <b>regenerations</b> and enrichment plantations.|$|R

5|$|The role of {{wildfire}} is {{an important}} one for plant and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and <b>natural</b> <b>regeneration</b> of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with {{a better understanding of the}} role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.|$|E

500|$|In his {{analysis}} of the four cases of fallen civilizations, he notes that two (Easter Island and Sumer) failed due to depletion of natural resources—"their ecologies were unable to regenerate."

He asks the question: [...] "Why, if civilizations so often destroy themselves, has the overall experiment of civilization done so well." [...] For the answer, he says, we must look to <b>natural</b> <b>regeneration</b> and human migration (Wright, 102). [...] While some ancient civilizations were depleting their ecologies and failing, others were rising. Large expanses of the planet were unsettled.

40|$|By {{increasing}} resource availability, canopy opening enhances tree recruitment {{as well as}} {{the development}} of neighbouring vegetation. The proliferation of early successional and highly competitive vegetation may have dramatic consequences on seedling establishment. However, differences in competitive abilities have been shown among the plant growth forms commonly encountered in forests. We may thus expect that vegetation management leading to control of different plant growth forms would have different consequences on tree seedling growth and development. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the effects of an intensity gradient of four vegetation control treatments (untreated, coppice control, coppice and non-tree plant control, and coppice, non-tree and pioneer (tree) plant control) on plant species richness and <b>natural</b> tree <b>regeneration</b> in three post-storm sites. Higher plant species richness and a better <b>natural</b> tree <b>regeneration</b> were observed in the more intensive treatments that significantly improved the balance of the relative abundance of tree species.

Desire to restore the function of riparian forest ecosystems has become a primary objective of many land management agencies in the United States. In the eastern U. S., much emphasis has been placed on planting native hardwood tree species in former bottomland agricultural fields. These afforestation practices most often consist of planting bare-root tree seedlings of a select number of hardmast species and managing vegetation with a number of pre- and postemergent herbicides, or planting a perennial cover-crop to control competing vegetation. However, recent efforts have often resulted in poor success. In addition, there is also interest in restoring native herbaceous plant communities and understanding the extent to which <b>natural</b> tree <b>regeneration</b> occurs. Overall, there is very little information providing successful restoration techniques in old-field riparian ecosystems. Objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of two herbicide and three cover-crop vegetation management treatments on the 1) artificial regeneration of 13 native bottomland tree species, 2) composition of <b>natural</b> tree <b>regeneration,</b> and 3) composition, structure, and diversity of the resulting ground flora at three riparian sites in the Missouri Ozarks. Choice of tree species was the most important factor for determining afforestation success. Herbicide-only treatments had significantly greater <b>natural</b> tree <b>regeneration</b> than cover-crop treatments, and distance from the nearest intact forest edge was an important source of this variation. Composition and diversity of ground flora was strongly dependent on site characteristics. In general, the herbicide-only treatments promoted greater ground flora diversity and richness, and promoted more native bottomland species than covercrop treatments. However, successful establishment of some cover-crops can significantly reduce the amount of exotic plant cover...|$|R
