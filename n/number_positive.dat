50|$|Charge number (z) {{refers to}} a {{quantized}} value of electric charge, with the quantum of electric charge being the elementary charge, so that the charge number equals the electric charge (q) in coulombs divided by the elementary-charge constant (e), or z = q/e. The charge numbers for ions (and also subatomic particles) are written in superscript, e.g. Na+ is a sodium ion with charge <b>number</b> <b>positive</b> one (an electric charge of one elementary charge). Atomic numbers (Z) are a special case of charge numbers, referring to the charge number of an atomic nucleus, {{as opposed to the}} net charge of an atom or ion. All particles of ordinary matter have integer-value charge numbers, with the exception of quarks, which cannot exist in isolation under ordinary circumstances (the strong force keeps them bound into hadrons of integer charge numbers).|$|E

40|$|Numbers of copia {{transcripts}} in testes {{of files}} from five Drosophila melanogaster lines were compared {{by means of}} Northern blot hybridization.

Therefore, transcription rate of copia retrotransposon in tests is largely controlled by the level of its transcription, which, in turn, is regulated by the number of retrotransposon copies in the genome.

We propose to minimize the loss function of Pos@Top over a training set to learn the filters of CNN and the classifier parameter. The classifier parameter vector is solved by the Lagrange multiplier method, and the filters are updated by the gradient descent method alternately in an iterative algorithm. Experiments over benchmark data sets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art Pos@Top maximization methods...|$|E
