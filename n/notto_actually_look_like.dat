5000|$|There {{will need}} to be many {{decisions}} on what the symbols <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> and a failproof way of reading and writing symbols indefinitely.|$|R
50|$|As in {{the case}} of Novospassky Bridge, rebuilt Borodinsky Bridge was dressed up with fake skirts to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an arched bridge. These skirts are larger than Novospasskys and <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> arches.|$|R

50|$|In 1923, McCandless {{discovered}} the 1779 Dutch sketches of the Serapis flag in {{the records of}} the Chicago Historical Society, removing any doubt as to what the flags <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b>|$|R
50|$|These images {{show how}} Kongbul <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> before/after it is cooked. There might be various {{pictures}} since customers can add any other ingredients, such as cheese, sausages, and noodles, {{that they want}} to add.|$|R
60|$|And {{in point}} of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of {{everybody}} including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over.|$|R
5000|$|Biti-an Spring. This spring located {{alongside}} {{the river was}} noted for its mystic waters. The water <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a boiling water coming beneath the ground. One could see white butterflies flying around the place (believed to be fairies in the spring).|$|R
25|$|Preobrazhenskaya Zastava (Преображенская Застава, 2003) {{is a whole}} block (308 {{apartments and}} retail stores) {{designed}} during the early 1930s with a style similar to the Art Deco adaptations by of Iofan and Vladimirov. An unusual example which <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a period piece, not a modern replica.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s, three {{historical}} figures were created: Betsy Ross, Daniel Boone, and Paul Revere, which were released {{as part of}} the [...] series. These dispenser heads were not made to <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the people they represented, but instead used generic faces with different accessories.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{distance}} between Earth and their own planet, the Gua devised a method of dispatching small metallic orbs containing their consciousnesses through wormholes to Earth and transferring them into specially bioengineered human husks. As a result of this, it is unknown what the Gua <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{mentioned}} {{later on in}} the series that Mrs Slocombe's residence is a block of flats {{at the end of a}} cul-de-sac backing onto a common. In series 7 Mrs Slocombe's residence on the top floor of Grace Brothers resembles what Mrs Slocombe's home <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b>|$|R
50|$|This form of {{a church}} can also be {{recognized}} from the holes which remain from earlier earth-bound post churches built on the same sites. Little is known about what these older churches <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> or how they were constructed, as they were all destroyed or replaced many centuries ago.|$|R
5000|$|In the Sotho-Tswana {{languages}} of southern Africa, batho is the cognate term to Nguni abantu, illustrating that such cognates need not <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the -ntu root exactly. The early African National Congress of South Africa had a newspaper called Abantu-Batho from 1912-1933, which carried columns in English, Zulu, Sotho, and Xhosa.|$|R
40|$|Understanding How Children Learn is a {{vital part}} of working with children. Every child is unique and {{understanding}} differences in learning helps all to benefit. This book goes beyond simply understanding the work of key theorists and the various theories of learning to recognise what learning <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> and how it is best facilitated in any setting...|$|R
5000|$|The one-of-a-kind laugh-track device—known {{throughout}} {{the industry as}} the [...] "laff box"—was tightly secured with padlocks, stood more than two feet tall, and operated like an organ. Only immediate {{members of the family}} knew what the inside <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> (at one time, the laff box was called [...] "the most sought after but well-concealed box in the world").|$|R
60|$|He even produced, {{from some}} hidden recess {{in the old}} dresser, what <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a table-cloth; and when he spread it out, and saw {{it was full of}} holes, he shook his head dubiously for a while, then was at much pains so to spread it over the table as to hide most of its blemishes.|$|R
25|$|New postconstuctivist {{or early}} stalinka {{buildings}} are rare. Preobrazhenskaya Zastava (Преображенская Застава) mixed-use project (two blocks, 308 apartments and retail stores) {{was completed in}} 2002–2005. Unusually for present-day Moscow, it <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a period piece, not a cheap modern replica. There are no trademark square columns or slim porticos, yet {{it is the best}} attempt to recreate a style of the 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|Cumulus fractus clouds <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> ragged cumulus clouds. They may {{originate}} from dissipated cumulus clouds, appearing {{in this case}} as white ragged clouds located at significant distances from each other. Cumulus fractus in particular form on the {{leading and trailing edges}} of summer storms in warm and humid conditions. [...] Observing fractus gives an indication of wind movements under the parent cloud.|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores racial {{representation}} in the United States military throughout each rank level, within all active and reserve branches, to determine whether racial representation is related to rank. Using a census of the U. S. military from the Department of Defense, I establish a summary of what representation <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> overall, and more specifically, what it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> within enlisted, warrant officer, and officer ranks. The citizen-soldier theory contends that failure {{on the part of}} the U. S. military to maintain representative forces threatens the legitimacy and credibility of democracy and could even become a threat to it (Armor and Gilroy, 2010 : 224). Much of the existing research on the military applauds its racially progressive policies and the (overall) proportionately representative forces it maintains. However, there is little scrutiny of what those forces <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> broken down by rank. If the military is to maintain a truly representative force of citizen-soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, then it must be representative among all levels. This research explores what contemporary military representation <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> specifically asking, who is really giving the orders [...] Whites, Asians, Blacks or Hispanics...|$|R
2500|$|The {{afghan hound}} can also {{come with a}} much more [...] "patterned" [...] coat. This descends from the Bell-Murray's and the Ghazni lines, and is {{displayed}} in much lighter feathering of coat, deeper saddle (often <b>actually</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> a saddle) and much shorter hair on the face and neck. It is believed that these particular afghan hounds were a product of much hotter parts of the country.|$|R
2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{responses}} to the non-existence of pure-strategy equilibrium identified by Francis Ysidro Edgeworth and Martin Shubik. [...] Whilst the existence of mixed-strategy equilibrium was demonstrated by Huw Dixon, it has not proven easy to characterize what the equilibrium <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> [...] However, Allen and Hellwig were {{able to show that}} in a large market with many firms, the average price set would tend to the competitive price.|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} supporting lifelong learning for individuals with profound and multiple learning difficulties. Lifelong learning is usually a more mainstream concept and is rarely applied to this marginalized group for whom learning per se is such a challenge. The paper debates whether the concept is a useful one, and what lifelong learning might <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> for someone with with a profound intellectual impairment...|$|R

5000|$|The mascot of Navasota High School is the Rattlers, and is {{characterized}} by a student (typically male) in a rattlesnake costume. The character is named [...] "Venom" [...] but can also be known as [...] "Diamond" [...] if the costume is worn by a female NHS student. [...] "Venom's costume uniquely has legs and feet. He <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a lizard, or as students imply, a [...] "gecko." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{painting}} in the house's lararium, a shrine to the household gods the Lares, depicts Vesuvius as it may have looked before the eruption, with a single vineyard-covered peak instead of the double-peak profile of today. Although some scholars reject the single-peak hypothesis, the painting is generally regarded as the earliest known representation of the volcano, even if {{it should not be}} taken as a record of what Vesuvius <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b>|$|R
50|$|In October 1990 a sculpture, The Student Body, was {{installed}} to {{be representative of}} the UNC student body. Many students felt that the depictions of the characters were unrealistic. The statue showed a black woman balancing books on her head, a white woman looking up a man, and a black man with a basketball. BSM organized a study-in, where students studied around the statue showing what the student body <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{bonus-malus}} system in {{practice in the}} Nigerian motor insurance industry. It {{would appear that the}} regulation is a bit fluid so that what <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a bonus-malus system is more like a rule of thumb as operators do not honor the industry agreed tariff. This paper constructs an alternative bonus-malus scale that has reasonable penalties and that is yet commercially feasible. The model can easily be replicated for other developing economies. </p...|$|R
50|$|An onibi from Chii village, Kitakuwada District, Kyoto Prefecture (later, Miyama, now Nantan). It {{appears in}} {{mountain}} villages, {{and is a}} bluish white ball of fire that lightly floats in the air. It {{is said to have}} an appearance like a hishaku (ladle), but it is not that it <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> the ladle tool, but rather that it appeared to be pulling a long and thin tail, which was compared to a ladle as a metaphor.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the current}} systems have three {{different}} formations in each third, defending, middle, and attacking. The goal is to outnumber the other team {{in all parts of}} the field but to not completely wear out all the players on the team using it before the full ninety minutes are up. So the one single number is confusing as it may not <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a 4–2–1–3 when a team is defending or trying to gain possession. In a positive attack it may <b>look</b> exactly <b>like</b> a 4–2–1–3.|$|R
40|$|John Rawls {{is arguably}} the most {{important}} political philosopher of the past century. His theory of justice has set the agenda for debate in mainstream political philosophy for the past forty years, and has had an important influence in economics, law, sociology, and other disciplines. However, despite the importance and popularity of Rawls's work, there is no clear picture of what a society that met Rawls's principles of justice would <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> This article sets out to explore that question...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{paints a}} {{portrait}} of service industry workers who are outside the institutional parameters of industrial relations. It considers the effects of hard work on the personal horizons of the working poor. By asking workers to describe target earnings and what a ‘better job’means {{against a background of}} long hours, the study shows what distress selling of labour <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> The results indicate that subjects correctly perceive their lack of opportunity and have horizons circumscribed by industrial norms...|$|R
5000|$|Before debuting her visual {{work with}} photography, govy {{performed}} in a few theater, video pieces and films but then decided to focus on writing. In 1999, she published the first book on the internet that <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a real book, which would be published in 2001 under the title [...] "Mes Cendres Nues" [...] by French publisher IDLivre. Her early wiritng {{is also part of}} the French Poetry Anthology “Les Nouveaux Poètes Français et Francophones”, published by Edition Huguet in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|The series {{centers around}} Rita Madsen (Mille Dinesen), a headstrong and {{unconventional}} teacher and single mother. It received generally favorable response from critics, including Henrik Palle in Politiken who {{commented that the}} series [...] "works really well with some characters who <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> people". The series uses locations in and near the former school campus at the National Innovative Centre (SPF) in Islev, Rødovre. The theme song is [...] "Speak Out Now" [...] by the Danish musician Oh Land.|$|R
5000|$|When {{they told}} me Rob was {{probably}} the one, I looked him up and thought, [...] "Yeah, he can do a version of Edward. He’s definitely got that vampire thing going on." [...] And then, when I was on set and I got to watch him go from being Rob to shifting into being Edward, and he <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the Edward in my head, {{it was a really}} bizarre experience. ...He really had it nailed. Twilight author Stephenie Meyer ...|$|R
5000|$|A few {{samples of}} the writing system invented by Melville Bell {{may be seen in}} the images on this page. These images depict Melville Bell's {{intention}} of creating a script in which the characters <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the position of the mouth when speaking them out loud. The system is useful not only because its visual representation mimicks the physical act of speaking, but because it does so, these symbols may be used to write words in any language, hence the name [...] "Universal Alphabetics".|$|R
