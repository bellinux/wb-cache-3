5000|$|Better {{support for}} the Write once, run {{anywhere}} (WORA) methodology that {{does not depend on}} specific APIs being available. This results in little or <b>no</b> <b>porting,</b> which is a major cost in Java ME development.|$|E
50|$|Fahrenheit {{became the}} primary focus of {{development}} at SGI. Their MIPS-based workstations were quickly losing the performance lead they had in the early 1990s, and the company was in serious trouble as the average PC slowly but surely encroached on the high-end graphics market. SGI saw Fahrenheit as an exit strategy; once complete {{they would be able to}} move to a PC-based lineup while still offering the best development tools for a now universal API. Although <b>no</b> <b>porting</b> work began, toolkits like Open Inventor and OpenGL Performer were intended in future to be layered on Fahrenheit, meaning that they could deliver a single fully functional development system for Fahrenheit when it shipped, supporting both their existing customers as well as new ones.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{differences}} between the versions released for each system. Although that {{could be explained by}} different hardware, as of 1993 it was possible to make a sprite-based video game on a 16 bit console using the PC version as a base. In this case, differences were due to US Gold's choice to use two companies developing different versions of the game separately and also to the development methodology of Tiertex, who used a different game programmer for each platform - each one programming in a different assembly language (<b>no</b> <b>porting).</b> Amongst major differences, freestyle moguls are different on the 16-bit versions, and overall the Super NES version is much more unforgiving than the Mega Drive/Genesis version, while the Master System version is the one allowing better control on alpine skiing events.|$|E
40|$|Third-party {{transfer}} is a data transfer mechanism where the party initiating the {{transfer is}} neither the source nor the sink for the data. In this paper, {{we present a}} scheme for supporting third-party transfers on storage systems with network-attached disks (NADs), called SPIRAL 1. SPIRAL allows NADs to send data directly to clients without going through the server. It is transparent to clients and relies only on the linear block interface of the current disks (or the future iSCSI disks). SPIRAL requires <b>no</b> <b>porting</b> of filesystem or application-level functionality to NADs and requires only simple modifications to server applications. To illustrate our approach, we implemented a prototype system on PCs running Linux. We present experimental results for NFS and HTTP on the prototype to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. 1...|$|E

50|$|Komotini is a midland {{city and}} has <b>no</b> <b>port.</b> It {{is served by}} two airports. The nearest is in Alexandroupoli (65 km), {{and the other is}} in Kavala (80 km).|$|R
50|$|Oceangoing vessels had {{previously}} anchored in Flinders Bay, or used the Flinders Bay jetty; however, its short-term operation between the 1890s and 1930s subsequently left the bay with <b>no</b> <b>port</b> facility.|$|R

2500|$|At the time, the United States had <b>no</b> <b>ports</b> on the Pacific {{coast of}} North America, and naval vessels relied on storeships—naval vessels loaded with {{supplies}} and fresh water which sat, stationary, at sea.
