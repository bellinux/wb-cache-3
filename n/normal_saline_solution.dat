A repeat sample two hours later also displayed positive signs of maggots. The maggots were washed in 0.9% <b>normal</b> <b>saline</b> <b>solution</b> and in distilled water and were subsequently preserved in 10% formalin before being submitted to the Vector Control Research Center (VCRC) in Puducherry, for definite species identification.

The last segment on the maggot was transected, and by using a Zeiss binocular dissection microscope, the spiracular plate was removed and placed in Hoyer’s medium. By attaching a camera to a MOTIC BA 300 digital compound microscope, pictures were taken of the whole larva and the spiracular plate. The maggots were approximately 6 - 7 mm length-wise and 1 - 1.5 mm in width and appeared a dullish-white in color. Their carcasses were coated with a tough integument consisting of multiple bands of minute, grayish-brown spines. Closer examination with a microscope revealed a total of 11 separate segments. Each segment, except for the anal segment, had a belt of small, well-developed spines going towards the posterior margins. The anterior and posterior regions were similarly narrow while the middle appeared broad. Two hooks {{were found on the}} pseudo-cephalic segment of the maggot which enabled them to attach to the mucosal lining of the intestine. The appearance of spiracular slits on the solid plate on the peritreme of the posterior spiracle narrowed the results down to the genus Muscina.

METHODS: Three solutions were injected in the stomach of nine pigs BR 1 : <b>normal</b> <b>saline</b> <b>solution,</b> carboxymethylcellulose 0. 5 % and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 0. 25 %. In each pig, submucosal injections with 6 mL per test-solution were performed. One drop of methylene blue was added to all injections for better visualization.

RESULTS: The overall median time of visible submucosal cushion was 37 minutes (range 12 - 60 min) for hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 31 minutes for carboxymethylcellulose (range 10 - 43 min) and 19 minutes for <b>normal</b> <b>saline</b> <b>solution</b> (range 8 - 37 min).

We investigated the effect of 3 commonly used solutions—Ringer's solution, <b>normal</b> <b>saline</b> <b>solution,</b> and heparinized whole blood—on in vitro endothelial and contractile functions of the human radial artery. Methods: Radial artery segments were harvested, cut into 3 -mm rings, and stored in unoxygenated Ringer's solution, <b>normal</b> <b>saline</b> <b>solution,</b> or heparinized whole blood for 45 minutes. Rings stored in Krebs solution were used as controls. The rings were then mounted and stretched to an optimal resting tension in oxygenated Krebs solution at 37 °C. Contraction responses to potassium, norepinephrine, and serotonin and relaxation responses to acetylcholine, verapamil, and nitroprusside were evaluated. Results: Fifty-six radial artery ring segments from 14 patients (n = 7 rings for each contaction-relaxation curve) were studied. Equilibrated resting tension was 9. 6 ± 0. 3 mN (5. 9 ± 0. 2 g), and resting internal circumference was 6. 4 ± 0. 2 mm. Absolute maximum contraction to potassium was significantly less in rings stored in <b>normal</b> <b>saline</b> <b>solution</b> than in rings stored in control solution (10. 7 ± 0. 6 g vs 14. 5 ± 0. 6 g, P <. 01; 95 % confidence intervals, 0. 9 - 6. 9).
