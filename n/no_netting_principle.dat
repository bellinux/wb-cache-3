40|$|Biodiversity {{conservation}} policies {{incorporating a}} <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss (NNL) <b>principle</b> are being implemented in many countries. However, there are linguistic and conceptual inconsistencies {{in the use}} of terms underlying these NNL policies. We identify inconsistencies that emerge in the usage of eight key terms and phrases associated with NNL policies: biodiversity, frames of reference (i. e. baselines, counterfactuals), <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss, mitigation hierarchy, biodiversity offset, in-kind/out-of-kind, direct/indirect and multipliers. For each term, we make recommendations to support conceptual convergence, reduce ambiguity and improve clarity in communication and policy documentation. However, we also warn of the challenges in achieving convergence, especially given the linguistic inconsistencies in several of these key concepts among countries in which NNL policies are employed. Policy implications. The recommendations made in this article, on improving clarity and supporting convergence on key <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss (NNL) concepts, should help eliminate ambiguity in policy documentation. This is crucial if policymakers are to design robust policies that are (i) transparent, (ii) translatable into practice in a consistent manner and (iii) sufficiently understood and supported by stakeholders to be effective in practice...|$|R

40|$|Offsetting is {{a policy}} {{instrument}} intended to provide flexibility for development. We developed a simple calculator to predict when <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible using biodiversity offsetting. Assuming offset ratios ≤ 10 : 1 are indicative of operational feasibility and employing a discount rate of 3 %, we predicted that <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible where biodiversity can be restored within 55 years, which restricts the impacts on biodiversity that can be offset using restoration. Alternatively, <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible by avoiding loss to biodiversity that is declining under the counterfactual {{at an annual rate}} ≥ 6 %. However, this is considerably higher than typical background rates of biodiversity loss so restricts where avoided-loss offsets are feasible. <b>No</b> <b>net</b> loss is theoretically feasible in the broadest range of circumstances if biodiversity gains are provided in advance of development. However, these gains are procured by restoration or avoided loss, so constraints presented by these approaches also apply. We concluded that <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible in a limited range of development scenarios unless offset ratios greater than 10 : 1 are more widely tolerated...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effects of net {{neutrality}} on media diversity. We show that in the net neutrality regime, media firms al- ways provide media diversity, whereas in the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime, the equilibrium of the model depends on the relation between net- work capacity and network traffic. If the network capacity is large relatively to network traffic, the equilibrium of the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime {{is similar to the}} one under the net neutrality regime. However, if network capacity is small relative to network traffic, under the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime media firms do not provide media diversity. The reason is that when network capacity is small relative to network traf- fic, the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime hinders competition. In other words, with <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality, the media firm with priority sees its hinter- land more protected from its rival than under net neutrality, and the contrary for the firm with no priority. As a result, while the media firm with priority has less need to provide media diversity to attract demand and as such advertising revenues, the media firm with no pri- ority finds it more difficult to use media diversity to attract demand and advertising revenues...|$|R

To satisfy this mandate, sellers and buyers (including importers) of tobacco were assessed equally to build a capital account that was drawn upon to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) for any losses of principal and interest resulting from nonrecourse loan operations. Other provisions of this law provided for reducing the level of support for tobacco and made various modifications to the marketing quota and acreage allotment programs. <b>No</b> <b>net</b> cost assessments ended when price support was terminated after the 2004 crop.|$|R

The <b>No</b> <b>Net</b> Cost Tobacco Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-218) required an assessment on 1982 and subsequent tobacco crops to cover potential tobacco price support program losses.
