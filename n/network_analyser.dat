50|$|Experimentally, {{there are}} many {{techniques}} that exist to study magnetic phenomena, {{each with its own}} limitations and advantages. The experimental techniques can be distinguished by being time-domain (optical and field pumped TR-MOKE), field-domain (ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)) and frequency-domain techniques (Brillouin light scattering (BLS), vector <b>network</b> <b>analyser</b> - ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR)). Time-domain techniques allow the temporal evolution of the magnetisation to be traced indirectly by recording the polarisation response of the sample. The magnetisation can be inferred by the so-called 'Kerr' rotation. Field-domain techniques such as FMR tickle the magnetisation with a CW microwave field. By measuring the absorption of the microwave radiation through the sample, as an external magnetic field is swept provides information about magnetic resonances in the sample. Importantly, the frequency at which the magnetisation precesses depends on the strength of the applied magnetic field. As the external field strength is increased, so does the precession frequency. Frequency-domain techniques such as VNA-FMR, examine the magnetic response due to excitation by an RF current, the frequency of the current is swept through the GHz range and the amplitude of either the transmitted or reflected current can be measured.|$|E
40|$|A fast four channel <b>network</b> <b>analyser</b> is {{introduced}} to measure S-parameters in a frequency range from 10 MHz to 4 GHz. The measurement period {{of this kind}} of <b>network</b> <b>analyser</b> is short in comparison with a conventional one, which becomes possible by using highly linear analogue frequency ramps, realized with fractional divider phase locked loop circuits. The settling time for the discrete frequency points, which is typical for a conventional <b>network</b> <b>analyser,</b> is nearly eliminated by the use of frequency ramps. To achieve the necessary bandwidth of 4 GHz in the baseband, a heterodyne principle is applied. A VCO-signal from 5 to 9 GHz is down converted to the baseband with a fixed frequency generator of 9 GHz. The structure of the following <b>network</b> <b>analyser</b> is similar to the structure of a conventional four channel <b>network</b> <b>analyser</b> and therefore all known calibration techniques are suited for the fast <b>network</b> <b>analyser.</b> The intermediate frequency, which is necessary for the evaluation, carries the required information.

40|$|The closed-orbit {{measurement}} {{system for the}} new Antiproton Decelerator (AD) employs 59 electrostatic pick-ups (PU). The intensity range from 2 &# 183; 10 10 down to 10 7 particles poses challenging demands on the dynamic range and noise of the head amplifier. A low noiseamplifier has been developed, having an equivalent input noise of 0. 6 nV/&# 8730;(Hz), allowing beam positions to be measured to &# 177; 0. 5 mm with 5 &# 183; 10 6 particles.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the realisation of a Spread Spectrum <b>Network</b> <b>Analyser</b> using appropriate software {{to control a}} PC interface card, like a soundcard. The software generates a digitised time waveform consisting of a Spread Spectrum signal containing a number of equal amplitude spectral components. The interface card converts this waveform to an analogue signal, which is then passed through the network to be measured and then digitised using the same interface card. The difference between the sent and received spectra is the transfer function of the network and is analysed in both amplitude and phase.

40|$|Abstract. The {{developed}} <b>network</b> <b>analyser</b> {{with four}} ports allows very fast measurements of S-parameters in compari-son with a conventional <b>network</b> <b>analyser.</b> This is possible because highly linear analogue frequency ramps are used. Thus the settling times of stepped frequency sweeps of con-ventional analysers are eliminated. The required high linear-ity and high {{stability of the}} frequency ramps is achieved by using fractional divider phase locked loop circuits. For a practical realization {{it is necessary to}} accept small nonlinearities for the linear analogue frequency ramps. For this reason investigations were performed to clarify effects of small nonlinearities on the measurement precision. Nonlinearities are willingly implemented by programming the fractional frequency ramps accordingly. The gained ex-pertise allows for a further improvement of measurement ac-curacy and dynamic range. ...|$|E
