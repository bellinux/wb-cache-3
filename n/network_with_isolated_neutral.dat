After these disasters distribution networks' operators {{faced with a}} problem how to provide adequate quality of supply in such situation. The decision of utilization cable lines rather than overhead lines were made, which brings new features to distribution networks. The main idea of this work is a complex analysis of medium voltage distribution <b>networks</b> <b>with</b> long cable lines. High value of cable’s specific capacitance and length of lines determine such problems as: high values of earth fault currents, excessive amount of reactive power flow from distribution to transmission network, possibility of a high voltage level at {{the receiving end of}} cable feeders. However the core tasks was to estimate functional ability of the earth fault protection and the possibility to utilize simplified formulas for operating setting calculations in this network. In order to provide justify solution or evaluation of mentioned above problems corresponding calculations were made and in order to analyze behavior of relay protection principles PSCAD model of the examined network have been created. Evaluation of the voltage rise in the end of a cable line have educed absence of a dangerous increase in a voltage level, while excessive value of reactive power can be a reason of final penalty according to the Finish regulations.

TPEPICO spectra are recorded continuously as a function of photon energy, allowing threshold photoelectron spectra and yields of the fragment ions to be obtained. At fixed photon energies, spectra are also recorded with improved time resolution, allowing total mean translational kinetic energy releases, _t, into some dissociation channels to be determined. By comparing _t values for single bond-fission processes (i. e. cleavage of a C-Cl or C-X bond) with those predicted for the limiting extremes of a statistical and an impulsive dissociation, information {{on the nature of the}} photodissociation dynamics can be inferred. Excited states of all three parent cations show evidence for isolated-state behaviour, and the _t values suggest a relationship between the part of the molecule where ionisation occurs and the bond that breaks to form daughter ion + neutral atom products; impulsive values of _t are more likely to be obtained when the breaking bond lies close to the part of the molecule where ionisation occurs, statistical values when ionisation occurs further away from the breaking bond. At higher photon energies, smaller fragment ions are formed following cleavage of more than one bond. With CCl_ 3 F and CCl_ 3 Br, the appearance energies of the daughter ions are close to the thermochemical energy for production of that ion <b>with</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>neutral</b> atoms, suggesting strongly that these ions form by bond-fission processes only. With CCl_ 3 H, at certain energies some fragment ions can only form with molecular neutral fragments (e. g. CCl_ 2 ^+ + HCl), involving bond-breaking and bond-making processes. It is suggested that this phenomenon is related to the small size of the hydrogen atom, and hence less steric hindrance in a tightly-constrained transition state along the reaction coordinate...|$|R

Despite being relatively minor when compared to catastrophes, these events still have profound impacts on traffic flow. To date there has been very little distinction drawn between different types of network-disruption studies and how the methodological approaches used in those studies differ depending on the specific research objectives and on the disruption scenarios being modeled. In this paper, we advance a methodological approach that employs different link-based capacity-disruption values for identifying and ranking the most critical links and quantifying network robustness in a transportation network. We demonstrate how an ideal capacity-disruption range can be objectively determined for a particular network and introduce a scalable system-wide performance measure, called the Network Trip Robustness (NTR) {{that can be used}} to directly compare networks of different sizes, topologies, and connectivity levels. Our approach yields results that are independent of the degree of connectivity and can be used to evaluate robustness on <b>networks</b> <b>with</b> <b>isolating</b> links.

40|$|A typical modern {{industrial}} drive {{consists of}} a power electronic converter, a digital controller, feedback sensors and a motor. Several faults can affect the motor drive and a fault {{in any of the}} above will stop the operation of the drive, or at least it affects the drive’s performance. There are many safety critical applications like power plants, aerospace, pitch drives for wind-turbines, automobiles, etc. where the drive with high availability is very important. For interlinked production processes, as in modern industrial processing plants, a fault in a single drive can result in tremendous damages of materials and machines. Follow-up costs due to the faults with drives in modern production plants can amount to huge sums. So, the adjustable speed drives with high availability is an area of great interest for modern drive solutions. 	In this research project, solutions to improve the availability of different components of the drive are systematically developed and experimentally verified. Solutions to the 1) 	The information processing (digital controller) 2) 	Power section (inverter) 3) 	Feedback sensors (position and current sensors) are presented. 	An improved availability of the digital controller is achieved based on the principles of triple modular redundancy. Three digital signal processors (DSPs) are used in parallel running the same control algorithm. The pulse width modulation (PWM) outputs of all the three DSPs are voted out using a simple majority voting logic which is by itself a fault tolerant. In order to keep all the three DSPs in time synchronism to each other, a serial communication is developed between the three processors, which will exchange the timer values between all the three processors. This communication is also used to exchange the control variables between the three processors such that there is a synchronism in the control variables which are finally used for the control computation. Connections between all the three processors are made such that there is no common point of failure in the system. 	An improved availability of the inverter is achieved by adding a redundant leg to the standard two-level voltage source inverter (VSI). The faulted leg isolation and the redundant leg insertion is done by using independent back-to-back connected thyristors. The proposed inverter provides tolerance to the both short circuit and open circuit faults of the switching devices. 	Fault detection algorithms are implemented for both the cases of position sensor failure and current sensors failure. Position sensorless control algorithm is used in case of a position sensor failure. Normally, for the field oriented control of a PMSM <b>with</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>neutral,</b> two current sensors are sufficient.

The neutral-donor nature of these pair complexes was determined from magneticfield measurements and from two-electron transitions. Excited states of the neutral-donor bound excitons were observed in the form of rotator states analogous to rotational states of the H 2 molecule...|$|R
