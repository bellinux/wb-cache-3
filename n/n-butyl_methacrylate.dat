40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 3 rd January 2002 The addition of 2 -hydroxy- 2 -propyl radicals to n-butyl acrylate and <b>n-butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> has been investigated by time-resolved continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (TR CW EPR) and time-resolved Fourier transform electron paramagnetic resonance (TR FT EPR). The 2 -hydroxy- 2 -propyl radicals were generated by the photolysis of acetone in propan- 2 -ol (through hydrogen abstraction) and by the photolysis of a ketone 5 (through a-cleavage). The TR CW and TR FT spectra were experimentally equivalent for the addition of 2 -hydroxy- 2 -propyl radicals to n-butyl acrylate to produce 3 a. However, there are distinct differences between the TR CW and TR FT spectra for the addition of 2 -hydroxy- 2 -propyl radicals to <b>n-butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> which produces the radical adduct 4 a. In particular, a number of hyperfine lines clearly present in the TR CW spectra are much weaker in, or are absent from, the TR FT spectra. The differences in the TR CW and TR FT spectra are attributed to hindered rotation, which {{is important in the}} spectrum of the adduct of 2 -hydroxy- 2 -propyl radicals to <b>n-butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (4 a), but not in the spectrum of the adduct of 2 -hydroxy- 2 -propyl radicals to n-butyl acrylate (3 a). The hindered rotation is shown to selectively shorten the spin–spin relaxation time, T 2, for certain hyperfine lines in the spectrum of 4 a, resulting in broadening or disappearance of these lines and explaining the differences between the TR CW and TR FT spectra...|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} of poly(n-butyl methacrylate-co-alkyl acrylate) was compared with ultrasonic degradation. For this purpose, different compositions of poly (n-butyl methacrylate-co-methyl acrylate) (PBMAMA) and a particular composition of poly(n-butyl methacrylate-co-ethyl acrylate) (PBMAEA) and poly(n-butyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate) (PBMABA) were synthesized and characterized. The {{thermal degradation}} of polymers shows that the poly(alkyl acrylates) degrade in a single stage by random chain scission and poly(n-butyl methacrylate) degrades in two stages. The number of stages of thermal degradation of copolymers was same as the majority component of the copolymer. The activation energy corresponding to random chain scission increased and then decreased with an increase of <b>n-butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> fraction in copolymer. The effect of methyl acrylate content, alkyl acrylate substituent, and solvents on the ultrasonic degradation of these copolymers was investigated. A continuous distribution kinetics model {{was used to determine}} the degradation rate coefficients. The degradation rate coefficient of PBMAMA varied nonlinearly with <b>n-butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> content. The degradation of poly (n-butyl methacrylate-co-alkyl acrylate) followed the order: PBMAMA < PBMAEA < PBMABA.

The <b>n-butyl</b> acrylate methyl <b>methacrylate</b> copolymer emulsion with hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) and ultraviolet light absorber (UVA), GOLDEN MSA, which is tested here is marketed as an art varnish compatible with various types of paint. Brush and spray applied to modern and historic glass, the coating was weathered in a controlled lab setting on mock-up windows in a Q-Lab QUV weathering machine and in the field on skylights at Eastern State Penitentiary (ESP). The coating was unconventionally applied to the exterior surface of the glass with various glazing combinations and after 1 year at ESP and 900 hours in the QUV positive results proved the coating’s efficiency in blocking UV radiation. The UV readings, obtained by an ELSEC Environmental Monitor Type 765, at ESP decreased, due likely to environmental accumulation which scatters incident light waves, while readings slightly increased in the lab samples.

These studies were devoted at first to the outer and inner segments of the receptors (1 - 8). More recently, the interest has been concentrated on the synaptic connections of the receptors (9 - 12). This work is intended to present a comparative study of all retinal layers of different vertebrates. A special attention has been given to a neuropile-like structure existing between the receptor endings and the bipolar cells. MATERIAL AND METHOD Retinae of the following vertebrates were used: monkey (Macaca rhesus, irus, and mulatta), chicken (Gallus domesticus var.), turtle (Pseudemys sp.), toad (Bufo marinus), and fish (Centropomidae).

40|$|The {{experimental}} induction of amyloidosis in rabbits {{provides a}} tool {{for the study of}} serial morphologic and biochemical changes which precede and accompany the development of this disease. Previous studies, particularly of the spleen, have indicated that amyloid accumulates in close proximity to, but distinct from, the basement membrane, and that amyloid has a characteristic filamentous appearance when viewed in the electron microscope (1). The present report concerns the light and electron microscopic appearance of the kidney during the induction of amyloidosis. The study was undertaken to define further the fine structure of amyloid, to determine its relationship to a more well defined basement membrane, and to study the effects of amyloid deposition upon glomerular endothelial and epithelial cells and the possible relationship of these cells to amyloid deposits. Materials and Methods Amyloidosis was produced in 7 New Zealand white rabbits by subcutaneous injections of 5 mh of a 10 per cent casein suspension twice weekly. The rabbits were maintained on a diet of standard Purina rabbit chow and water. They were sacrificed at 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 10 months, along with untreated rabbits. Kidney was sectioned with razors to portions of 1 to 2 c. ram. and the latter were immediately fixed in buffered osmium acid at 0 °C.

A major {{drawback}} of conventional emulsion polymers {{arises from the}} presence of migrating low molecular weight surfactants that contribute to poor water barrier properties and low adhesion to substrates. In this paper, we demonstrate how living polymer chains obtained by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) {{can be used as}} an efficient stabilizer in emulsion polymerization, leading to the production of surfactant-free latexes, which then form crosslinked films with beneficial properties. Hydrophilic poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) chains obtained by RAFT performed in water are used to mediate emulsion polymerization and produce film-forming latex particles from mixtures of methyl <b>methacrylate,</b> <b>n-butyl</b> acrylate and styrene. Stable dispersions of particles with sizes between 100 and 200 nm are obtained, with very low amounts of coagulum (< 0. 5 wt. %). The particles are stabilized by the PMAA segment of amphiphilic block copolymers formed during the polymerization. Remarkably, low amounts of PMAA chains (from 1. 5 wt. % down to 0. 75 wt. %) are enough to ensure particle stabilization. Only traces of residual PMAA macroRAFT agents are detected in the final latexes, showing that most of them are successfully chain extended and anchored on the particle surface. The Tg of the final material is adjusted by the composition of the hydrophobic monomer mixture so that film formation occurs at room temperature. Conventional crosslinking strategies using additional hydrophobic co-monomers, such as 1, 3 -butanediol diacrylate (BuDA), diacetone acrylamide (DAAm), and (2 -acetoacetoxy) ethyl methacrylate, are successfully applied to these formulations as attested by gel fractions of 100 %. When particles are internally crosslinked with BuDA, chain interdiffusion between particles is restricted, and a weak and brittle film is formed. In contrast, when DAAm undergoes crosslinking during film formation, full coalescence is achieved along with the creation of a crosslinked network. The resulting film has a higher Young’s modulus and tensile strength as a result of crosslinking. This synthetic strategy advantageously yields a surfactant-free latex that can be formed into a film at room temperature with mechanical properties that can be tuned via the crosslinking density...|$|R
40|$|Interactions between {{drugs and}} primary {{packaging}} especially {{play an important}} role, where a health risk of patients by toxicologically unsafe substances is possible. With increasing use of plastic materials as primary packaging for liquid pharmaceuticals the legal requirements have risen sharply. Increasing regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical packaging materials also lead to higher requirements for packaging adhesives. The use of permeable plastic packaging {{increases the risk of}} label adhesives migrating into the liquid medicine. The aim of this work was to conduct an extensive study on permeation of polyacrylate based label adhesives through various plastic materials. Main focus was on the detection of permeated toxicologically questionable (meth) acrylates and their hydrolytic compounds. Many parameters that influence the permeation process should be investigated. To assess the levels of migration the compound specific values as well as global migration limits according to the Bedarfsgegenständeverordnung (BedGgstV) have been taken into account. Some preliminary investigations have been done before starting the study: A Pyrolysis-GC/MS method helped to verify the adhesives according to the specification of the manufacturer. Furthermore, the formation of the characteristic thermal degradation products of poly(meth) acrylates could be observed. During the study their risk of permeation could also be evaluated. Thermogravimetry/MS method have been used in the hardened adhesive to detect so-called residual monomers, which remain due to incomplete polymerization. For the trace analysis of migrated (meth) acrylates and their hydrolytic compounds in aqueous solution, two chromatographic methods have been developed. While for the majority of compounds a headspace-GC/FID method was proven successful for polar monomers such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid a HPLC method has been established. Both methods proved to be valid and robust enough {{to be used in the}} routine analysis of the comprehensive study. In preparation for the migration study an extraction profile of every used adhesive has been created by aqueous extraction and subsequent chromatographic analysis. The migration study revealed the following findings: •	Migration levels in all commercial labels of all adhesive plastic material combinations have been below the global migration threshold of 60 mg/kg stated in the consumer products regulation Bedarfsgegenständeverordnung (BedGgstV). •	Barrier properties of the plastic materials with respect to the global migration of the evaluated plastic materials are in the following order: Polycarbonate > Cycloolefinpolymer > High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) > Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) > Polyvinylchloride (PVC) •	The monomers acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, methyl <b>methacrylate,</b> <b>n-butyl</b> acrylate, 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate, 2 -hydroxypropyl acrylate and their hydrolysis and oxidation products n-butanol, n-butanal, 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol, 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanal and 2 -ethylhexyl acetate permeated depending on their polarity and the polarity of the plastic material into the aqueous solution. Furthermore, the influence of the molecular size of the monomers on the permeation process could be observed. Long chain non-polar compounds have been the most aggressive. •	As expected, an increase in permeation in sensitive of higher temperature and humidity conditions together with longer storage duration was evaluated. •	Furthermore, the influence of the thickness of the adhesive layer as well as the choice of face material (paper or plastic) on the permeability could be determined. Based on the migration results there are adhesive/plastic combinations with varying distinct migration risks.

40|$|Poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) -b-polystyrene (PSt) diblock {{copolymers}} were synthesized by emulsion atom transfer {{radical polymerization}} (ATRP). PBMA macroinitiators that contained alkyl bromide end groups {{were obtained by}} the emulsion ATRP of <b>n-butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> with BrCH 3 CHCOOC 2 H 5 as the initiator; these were used to initiate the ATRP of styrene (St). The latter procedure was carried out at 85 °C with CuCl/ 4, 4 -di(5 -nonyl) - 2, 2 -bipyridine as the catalyst and polyoxyethylene(23) lauryl ether as the surfactant. With this technique, PBMA-b-PSt diblock copolymers were synthesized. The polymerization was nearly controlled; the ATRP of St from the macroinitiators showed linear increases in number-average molecular weight with conversion. The block copolymers were characterized with IR spectroscopy, 1 H-NMR, and differential scanning calorimetry. The effects of the molecular weight of the macroinitiators, macroinitiator concentration, catalyst concentration, surfactant concentration, and temperature on the polymerization were also investigated. Thermodynamic data and activation parameters for the ATRP are also reported...|$|E
40|$|A {{new class}} of water-soluble, {{amphiphilic}} star block copolymers {{with a large number}} of arms was prepared by sequential atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of <b>n-butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (BMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA). As the macroinitiator for the ATRP, a 2 -bromoisobutyric acid functionalized fourth-generation hyperbranched polyester (Boltorn H 40) was used, which allowed the preparation of star polymers that contained on average 20 diblock copolymer arms. The synthetic concept was validated by AFM experiments, which allowed direct visualization of single molecules of the multiarm star block copolymers. DSC and SAXS experiments on bulk samples suggested a microphase-separated structure, in agreement with the core-shell architecture of the polymers. SAXS experiments on aqueous solutions indicated that the star block copolymers can be regarded as unimolecular micelles composed of a PBMA core and a diffuse PPEGMA corona. The ability of the polymers to encapsulate and release hydrophobic guests was evaluated using H- 1 NMR spectroscopy. In dilute aqueous solution, these polymers act as unimolecular containers that can be loaded with up to 27 wt % hydrophobic guest molecules...|$|E
40|$|A {{fluctuation}} theory {{approach to}} a cooperativity onset of the dynamic glass transition is described. Recent dielectric and heat capacity spectroscopy (HCS) experiments for several random copolymers of <b>n-butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> with styrene indicate a steep linear increase of relaxation intensities (Δε,ΔCp) and of square root of cooperativity (Nα 1 / 2) as function of temperature below the onset. A quasi continuous description is derived from kinetic molelcular randomness. This description {{can be applied to}} small cooperativity near the onset. The experimental indications can analytically be reproduced by means of a Landau order parameter expansion adapted to dominance of fluctuation in a free volume approach to the dynamic glass transition. An important parameter of the approach is the minimal cooperativity of order Nαmin≈ 1. The sharp onset obtained in the extrapolation is associated with the construction of a large conditionality raster. Far below the onset, the size of cooperativity at the glass temperature is theoretically estimated to be of order Nα(Tg) ≈ 100 molecules. A new interpretation of the WLF asymptote lg Ω is suggested...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} when unilamellar polymer vesicles {{dispersed}} in water {{made from a}} blockcopolymer, in this case poly((ethylene oxide) 45 -block-(methyl methacrylate) 164), poly((ethylene oxide) 45 -block-(methyl methacrylate) 170), or poly(n-butyl methacrylate) 81 -block-(2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) 20, are exposed to small hydrophobic molecules, here methyl methacrylate as well as <b>n-butyl</b> <b>methacrylate,</b> they can undergo morphological transitions. Upon swelling, the polymersomes lose their original simple bilayer morphology and transform into more complex coil-like and patchy colloidal structures, as investigated experimentally by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations on a model flat bilayer indeed show that transitions can occur upon bilayer swelling, which {{is accompanied by a}} change in the mechanical bilayer properties. The transition involves the formation of water pockets in the interior regions of the bilayer. Co-existence of the various morphologies in the experiments suggests an activation barrier towards morphological changes and a possibility of multiple meta-stable states. The latter indeed is supported by the existence of multiple minima in the surface tension as a function of bilayer area, as found in the simulations...|$|E

The relationship between the bivariate distributions of copolymers and the kinetics of the copolymerization reactions from which they were formed was derived using the terminal copolymerization model. This relationship was used with the mass spectra from the MMA/BMA copolymerizations studied to estimate kinetic parameters which describe the polymerizations. For this copolymerization the reactivity ratios, (catalytic) chain transfer coefficients, and initiator selectivity were determined to be r(MMA) = 1. 09, r(BMA) = 0. 77, C-S,C-MMA = 17 900, C-S,C-BMA = 6150, and S-MMA = 0. 535, respectively The reactivity ratios for these polymerizations were also determined from H- 1 NMR to be r(MMA) = 0. 75 and r(BMA) = 0. 98, using an error-in-variables model (EVM) treatment. The parameters determined from the mass spectra were compared with both the NMR values and literature values, where available, and general agreement is shown...|$|E
40|$|Atom {{transfer}} {{radical polymerization}} of <b>n-butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (BMA) {{was conducted in}} an aqueous dispersed system with different kinds of copper complexes. The partitioning behavior of the copper complexes, including CuCl/ 4, 4 -di(5 -nonyl) - 2, 2 -bipydine (dNbpy), CuCl 2 /dNbpy, CuCl/ 2, 2 -bipydine (bpy), CuCl 2 /bpy, CuCl/bis(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl) ether (bde), and CuCl 2 /bde between the monomer (BMA), and water was studied in detail with ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The results show that with a less hydrophobic ligand, such as bpy or bde, most of the Cu(I) or the Cu(II) complexes migrated from the BMA phase to the aqueous phase, the atom transfer equilibrium was destroyed, and the polymerization was nearly not controlled; it converted to classical emulsion polymerization. As to the very hydrophobic ligand dNbpy, although the partitioning study of the copper complexes indicated that not all the copper species were restricted to the organic phase, the linear correlation between the molecular weight and the monomer conversion and the narrow polydispersities confirmed that the polymerization was still quite well controlle...|$|E

The free radical polymerization was initiated by di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP) at 100 °C in a convection oven. Molecular weights of approximately 11, 000 Da were measured by Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (Maldi-TOF) for tung oil-asolectin copolymers, verifying that significant polymerization occurs under the cure conditions employed. The cure of the co-monomer mixture employed in this work was monitored by Dielectric Analysis (DEA), while changes in the Raman spectrum of all co-monomers {{before and after the}} cure, along with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, have been used to verify the need of a post-cure step and completion of the polymerization reaction. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images of the emulsion after polymerization indicate that vesicles were formed, and vesicle size distribution of samples prepared with different amounts of tung oil were determined using a Zetasizer...|$|E
