In July 1941, fifteen navigator instructors arrived at Turner Field with the rank of cadet. For the next two months, the nav instructors oversaw {{the construction of the}} navigation school while organizing a training syllabus. When navigation training began in September, the instructors were commissioned as 2nd Lieutenants. The aircraft used exclusively for navigation training at Turner was the Beech AT-7, a modification of the C-45 Expeditor. The AT-7 carried three navigation students, each with a <b>navigation</b> <b>table</b> and instruments, an instructor, and a pilot. Navigators received approximately 100 hours of navigation training in the AT-7. In September 1942, the navigation school moved to Selman Field in Monroe, Louisiana.|$|E
40|$|AGNS (Arabidopsis GeneNet {{supplementary}} database) is an Internet-available {{resource that}} {{provides access to}} description of {{the functions of the}} known Arabidopsis genes at various levels—the levels of mRNA, protein, cell, tissue, and ultimately at the levels of organs and the organism in both wild type and mutant backgrounds. AGNS annotates published papers on gene expression and function and by this way integrates, systematizes, and classifies this heterogeneous, disparate, and scattered information. AGNS consists of three databases—the Expression Database (ED), the Phenotype Database (PD), and the Reference Database (RD) —and two controlled vocabularies. ED describes gene expression in wild type, mutants, and transgenic plants; PD contains information on phenotypic abnormalities in mutant and transgenic plants; and RD includes references to the papers and description of plant growth conditions with an indication of the ecotypes used as control in the experiments. Detailed controlled vocabularies on growth stages and morphology were developed around the annotated data. AGNS makes possible the search for genes expressed in particular organs, at particular stages, for genes whose expression is altered in particular mutants, for alleles causing particular phenotypic abnormalities, and for pleiotropic effect of particular mutations. <b>Navigation</b> <b>table</b> and search tools are used to browse the informational content of the database and controlled vocabularies...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{development}} of an autopilot system for leisure Yacht based on NMEA 2000 network and android platform. The developed system can operate both for manual steering and automatic navigation mode. In automatic steering mode, after manipulation of commands which are NMEA 0183 sentences by android platform, our system translates and sends the packets through NMEA 2000 network and the controller which is connected to NMEA 2000 network receives the commands and controls the boat?셲 rudder system automatically. The automatic steering mode will be achieved by cooperation of two controllersone for controlling the rudder system, and another for controlling the vessel?셲 heading. For this reason we have developed a PID controller with an adjustable dead-band gain and a supervisory controller inside dead-band area for the rudder system and a proportional controller to control the heading angle. The reason of using supervisory controller inside rudder controller?셲 dead-band block is to eliminate the steady-state error which occurs after applying dead-band block to the controller. This supervisory controller is an integral controller which specifically supervises the rudder?셲 behavior inside the dead-band area. In this study at the first stage we simulated our system in computer, and examined the proposed method?셲 feasibility. Next step was implementing the system on a real hydraulic steering model developed by us {{and at the end}} we finished the examination by implementing it on a real boat and doing test <b>navigation.</b> <b>Table</b> of Contents Abstract 	vii 1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} boatmen's perception of the Abukuma River as a transportation route from old maps in the Edo era. While the old maps were prepared for specific purposes, they also reflect lifeworld of the people of the period. This study distinguishes expressions of the lifeworld from those for public purposes. Five old maps of the Abukuma River exist, which were drawn in different periods. Maps 1 and 2 cover the upper part, Maps 3 and 4 show the middle part, and Maps 5 presents the lower part of the Abukuma River. Maps 1 and 2 were prepared by merchants for channeling the river for <b>navigation</b> (<b>Table</b> 1). Map 3 was a planning map for river conservation and Map 4 is a copy of Map 3 in the later period. The purpose of Map 5 is unknown. Although the dates and purposes of the maps are various, they are all assumed to have been drawn by painters through the guidance of boatmen. The Abukuma River Maps are colored paintings on scrolls. The river was drawn in the way that readers could see from the upper to the lower part of the river as they open the scroll. The longest scroll is 13 meters, while the shortest one is 3 meters. Like many other river maps of the Edo era, in Maps 1, 2, and 5, landscape of the left side of the river was drawn upside down, while that of the right side was upside up (Plate 3). Maps 3 and 4, by contrast, were drawn from a bird's-eye view (Plate 6). Although the bird's-eye view map can present a three-dimensional view, drawing of some parts of the landscape behind mountains is difficult (Plate 4). In that case, the painter drew these mountains on a separate piece of paper and drew the landscape behind the mountains on the back of the paper; he attached the piece of paper on the map so that the reader could see the back of the paper (Plate 5). The maps with this bird's-eye view are relatively few. Symbols of these maps contain general and thematic landmarks (Fig. 2). The general landmarks are common to all the maps, which include settlements, temples, shrines, tollhouses, trees, ferries, reefs, whirlpools, and shallows. The thematic landmarks are specific to each map, which include navigation routes, breakwaters, domains, and fields. Examinations of these symbols revealed that the thematic landmarks represented specific purposes of the maps. The basic landmarks, on the other hand, reflected perception of the painters and the boatmen. Expressions of dangerous spots as general landmarks, such as the one seen on Plate 2, reflect experiential perception of the boatmen. The expressions of dangerous spots are strongly related to their perception. The degrees of danger were indicated in letters as well as through distorted drawings. As the Abukuma River maps were not made through topographic surveys, a deviation of the distance on the maps from the real one gives us a clue to understand perceptual distance of the period. In Figures 3 through 6, the white sections on the side of the figures represent that they are expressed longer than the real distance; the black sections are expressed shorter. In Maps 2 and 3, sections in the basins were drawn relatively shorter, while those in the V-shaped valleys were indicated longer (Figs. 4 and 5). In Maps I and 5, however, the perceptual distance has no relation with topography (Figs. 3 and 6). In general, the sections with many dangerous spots were drawn longer...|$|E

In this demonstration we present an architecture for SBI based on meta-stars, a novel approach to topic modeling in ROLAP systems. By coupling meta-modeling with <b>navigation</b> <b>tables,</b> meta-stars can cope with changes in the schema of irregular hierarchies and with schemaless ones; besides, they enable {{a new class of}} OLAP queries based on semantically-aware aggregation.
