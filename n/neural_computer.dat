40|$|In this paper, a {{cost-effective}} {{implementation of a}} programmable filterbank front-end for speech recognition is presented. The objective has been to design a real-time bandpass filtering system with a filterbank of 16 filters, with analog audio input and analog output. The output consists of 16 analog signals, which are the envelopes of the filter outputs of the audio signal. These analog signals are then led to an analog <b>neural</b> <b>computer,</b> which performs the feature-based recognition task. One of the main objectives has been to allow the user to easily change the filter specifications without affecting the remaining system, thus a software implementation of the filterbank was preferred. In addition, the <b>neural</b> <b>computer</b> requires analog input. Therefore, we implemented the filterbank on a PC, with the input A/D and the output D/A performed by the PC stereo soundcard. Since multiple analog outputs are necessary for the <b>neural</b> <b>computer</b> (one for each filter), it then follows that the soundcard output should contain the multiplexed 16 filter outputs, while a hardware module is needed for demultiplexing the soundcard output into the final 16 analog signals...|$|E
40|$|A pixel for {{measuring}} two-dimensional (2 -D) visual motion with two one-dimensional (1 -D) detectors has been implemented in very large scale integration. Based on the spatiotemporal feature extraction model of Adelson and Bergen, the pixel is realized using a general-purpose analog <b>neural</b> <b>computer</b> and a silicon retina. Because the <b>neural</b> <b>computer</b> only offers sum-and-threshold neurons, the Adelson and Bergen 2 ̆ 7 s model is modified. The quadratic nonlinearity is {{replaced with a}} full-wave rectification, while the contrast normalization is replaced with edge detection and thresholding. Motion is extracted in two dimensions by using two 1 -D detectors with spatial smoothing orthogonal to the direction of motion. Analysis shows that our pixel, although it has some limitations, has much lower hardware complexity compared to the full 2 -D model. It also produces more accurate results and has a reduced aperture problem compared to the two 1 -D model with no smoothing. Real-time velocity is represented as a distribution of activity of the 18 X and 18 Y velocity-tuned neural filter...|$|E
