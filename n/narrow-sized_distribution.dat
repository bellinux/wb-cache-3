40|$|Netlike {{mesoporous}} alumina membrane with {{layers of}} controllable pore size is fabricated by anodization and following chemical etching. All the nanochannels in this mesoporous membrane are connected together. By adjusting the anodization conditions, a series of mesoporous alumina membrane can be successfully prepared. Mesoporous solids are very important as catalysts and sorp-tion media. However, the size distribution of pores in ordinary mesoporous materials, such as silica, is wide. 1 It {{is well known that}} the mesoporous materials with <b>narrow-sized</b> <b>distribution</b> of pores are more effective than those with large-sized distribution of pores. 2 It was an important achievement that a mesoporous solid with uniform channels (MCM- 41) was synthesized by means of a liquid-crystal templating mechanism. 3 However, the fabrication of mesoporous solids with larger pore diamete...|$|E
30|$|Metallic catalysts, e.g., Pt, Pd, Ru, Cu, Co, and Au, {{have been}} intensively {{studied in the}} {{selective}} hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [4 – 10]. Among the most active and selective catalysts, Pt has been retained {{in the majority of}} the published work for the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [11 – 14]. Its selectivity depends critically on the particle size, i.e., the larger the particle size, the higher the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol [15 – 18]. Smaller Pt particles would reduce the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol. As a result, heterogeneity in size distribution would induce the descent of the overall selectivity. It is therefore highly desirable to have a <b>narrow-sized</b> <b>distribution</b> of Pt nanoparticles which exhibits decent selectivity in addition to high conversion. Loading a preprepared Pt colloid on support has been practiced to prepare supported Pt particles with uniform size [19]. However, organic stabilizers are often used in the preparation of colloidal Pt solution. After the Pt particle deposition on supports, the stabilizer has to be removed typically by heat treatment, during which, unfortunately, the size of Pt particles varies, depending on the temperature and time applied in heat treatment.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{combination}} of mass spectrometry, in situ quick extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and hydrogen chemisorption, we studied the reactions taking place during different pretreatments of the catalyst precursor [Pt} 2 {}+{(NH{ 3 }) { 4 }](NO{ 3 }}-{) { 2 } impregnated on high-surface-area SiO{ 2 } (400 m} 3 {/g). Direct reduction in hydrogen leads {{to the formation of}} Pt metal particles in the temperature range of 150 - 200 }o{C in a fast process. The reduction is accompanied by sintering of the platinum particles, leading to relatively large particles, with an average particle size of approximately 14 - 16 @ 9. Autoreduction in helium leads to multiple steps in the reduction. Around 210 and 240 }o{C, NO{x} released due to the decomposition of NH{ 4 }NO{ 3 }, formed during heating up to 180 - 200 }o{C, reduces the catalyst precursor at a high rate. At higher temperatures, the reduction continues slowly through an autoreduction of the Pt(NH{ 3 }) {x}} 2 {}+{ complex. The slow reduction rate suggests a nonmobile species. Accordingly, the final metal-particle size is small, with particles of 10 - 12 @ 9. Calcination-reduction results in large particles via a similar decomposition of NH{ 4 }NO{ 3 }. Particle-size distribution after autoreduction is considerably smaller than after direct reduction. The key to obtaining small particles with a relatively <b>narrow-sized</b> <b>distribution</b> is to avoid the formation of mobile species. With impregnated [Pt} 2 {}+{(NH{ 3 }) { 4 }](NO{ 3 }}-{) { 2 }, this is best achieved by autoreduction...|$|E
