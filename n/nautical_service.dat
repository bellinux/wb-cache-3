The preparations for the defence of Ticonderoga, and the <b>nautical</b> <b>service</b> on the lake, had met with difficulties at every step. At length, by the middle of August, a small flotilla was completed, and the command given by Gates to Arnold, in compliance with the advice of Washington.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem that}} {{occurred}} was that SCC <b>Nautical</b> Transport <b>Services</b> Inc {{was supposed to}} implement 18 50-seat vessels and not 6 150-seat vessels. It was due to this {{that some of the}} stations could not be used because the boats were too large to navigate. With river tours being operated, many scheduled trips had to be cancelled to accommodate them, causing many frustrated passengers to stop taking the ferry and causing passenger numbers to dwindle. Before this, the numbers were high enough that all ferries were full and SCC <b>Nautical</b> Transport <b>Services</b> Inc was considering purchasing more. The ferry service ceased operations in 2011.|$|R

50|$|At Salem, {{involvement}} in extracurricular {{activities and the}} life in the boarding community and academic achievement are equally emphasized. All students in the upper years must engage in community service such as <b>Nautical</b> <b>Service,</b> THW (Technical Support Organisation) extended First Aid, Community Service (Kindergarten, Disabled people's home, etc.) or Fire brigade at least one afternoon per week. During the terrible aeroplane accident of 2002 in Überlingen, Salem Students {{were some of the}} first at the scene.

50|$|Ferry {{service was}} brought {{back into the}} Pasig River in 2007 under the {{management}} of the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission. It was to be operated by SCC <b>Nautical</b> Transport <b>Services</b> Inc. Six boats with capacity for 150 people, air conditioning, televisions, security, and washrooms were put into service. It was the longest-lasting ferry service down the Pasig in recent years and had the longest route, with 14 stations lining the major hubs on the river. With fares ranging from P25 to P60 per trip and travel times cut in half for many, the ferry allowed many people to skip the congested streets of Manila. With less garbage, less foul odors, fewer shanty towns, and more environmental initiatives being implemented, river tours were being conducted by SCC <b>Nautical</b> Transport <b>Services</b> Inc.|$|R
50|$|The latest Pasig Ferry <b>Service,</b> {{operated}} by <b>Nautical</b> Transport <b>Services</b> Incorporated, was reactivated on April 28, 2014 {{to alleviate the}} traffic situation in Metro Manila {{in light of the}} infrastructure projects being constructed simultaneously.

50|$|In 1984, Klaus D {{was sold}} to A M Tichelaar, Leeuwarden, Netherlands. In August 1985, she {{was sold to}} Stichting Werkgelegenheid Projecten, Groningen, Netherlands and was renamed Enno Doedens Star. Two new diesel engines were fitted in 1986. This was {{followed}} by a rebuild to a three-masted schooner at Vlissingen, Zeeland, Netherlands in 1993. She was renamed Rembrandt van Rijn and reflagged to Panama. The callsign 3FVE7 was allocated. From 1994-96, Rembrandt van Rijn operated cruises to Spitsbergen, Norway. In 1998 or 1999 a different IMO Number, 8941808, was allocated and continues in use. She was sold in October 1998 to Balder Nieuwland B.V., Vlissinger and placed under the management of Oceanwide <b>Nautical</b> <b>Services</b> B.V. Rembrandt van Rijn operated cruises between Panama and the Galapagos Islands from 1998-2001. In 2007, She was laid up at Ghent, Belgium.|$|R

50|$|This ferry {{service was}} not without problems. In {{the early days of}} the service up to June, 2008, the low {{passenger}} turnout nearly caused NTSI (<b>Nautical</b> Transport <b>Services,</b> Incorporated) to go bankrupt and it even considered closing the ferry. However, the continuing surge in the oil prices in the Philippines forced commuters to use alternative modes of transportation, including the ferry. From July 2008, the number of passengers increased 15% every week and almost all boats were full. This and other related events made the NTSI consider purchasing more boats to increase capacity as opposed to closing the line.|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} the marina had 10 berths on one wooden pier. Today it {{is a modern}} nautical port with over 1200 ships. Marina Punat was the first Croatian marina to which the “Blue Flag” acknowledgement for high quality of service and conserved environment was awarded. This recognition is annually awarded and Marina Punat has been the “Blue Flag” bearer consecutively since 1998. In addition the marina, as the only marina on the Adriatic, has a quality system certified according to the standard ISO 9001:2008, {{in the area of}} <b>nautical</b> tourism <b>services,</b> and according to the standard ISO 14001 for the protection and preservation of the environment.|$|R
50|$|It {{was not all}} smooth sailing for {{the latest}} attempt to {{implement}} a ferry service down the Pasig. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission oversaw all operations and built the ferry terminals, while SCC <b>Nautical</b> Transport <b>Services</b> Inc operated the ferry and four of the terminals in Quiapo, Kalawaan, Bambang, and Nagpayong. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission received none of the profits from these stations. Since these were the first four stations, the ferries were generally full {{by the time they}} arrived at the other terminals. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission only received only P5 of every ticket sold, leading them to loss P94.07 million (expenses: P101.4 million; revenue: P7.33 million).|$|R

40|$|Horta was {{the first}} city o f Azores Islands (Portugal) to have a marina, in 1986. The passage of many foreigners and strong {{connections}} with the sea are parts of its history. All that justified the construction of this infrastructure. Across the time {{it is possible to}} verify that yachts {{from all over the world}} brought to this city more than the expected tourism economic impact. In fact, the existence of the marina created and developed a nautical culture in local population, as well as a strong symbolic relationship with the sea, which can be seen at Peter Café Sport and other <b>nautical</b> and social <b>services.</b> That fact makes this structure to be on top, as the most important structure of the city and a brand of this island, as seen in a survey conducted among the local population. As written by a local author, Fraga (1996) “The marina of Horta is one street of the city”, which means that Horta and the marina are seen as just one element. What makes this to happen? The Faial Island has a population of 15038 (2011) inhabitants. Despite that, each year, in one August week there is the “Sea Week” - a nautical festival with competitions, music concerts and other cultural activities. This nautical festival is considered the biggest in Portugal. The Marina of Horta is a reference of best practices and annually is the stage for international yacht sails races partially promoted by the local naval club, one of the most dynamic of the country...|$|R
