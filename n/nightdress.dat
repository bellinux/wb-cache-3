5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her <b>nightdress,</b> her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her <b>nightdress</b> suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her <b>nightdress</b> suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} <b>nightdress</b> was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a <b>nightdress,</b> {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|Gotcha was {{designed}} by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, and a prototype was constructed by Cyan Engineering, Atari's semi-independent research and development subsidiary. Development began in July 1973 as part of Atari's strategy to develop multiple types of games to separate themselves from their competitors, who they saw as focused primarily on creating Pong clones. The cabinet {{was designed}} by George Faraco, initially with the joysticks encased in pink domes meant to represent breasts. Although this design inspired the advertising flyer on which it appears behind a man chasing {{a woman in a}} <b>nightdress,</b> it was changed to use regular joysticks soon after release.|$|E
50|$|In August 1929 {{a newborn}} baby was found drowned in the lake, wrapped in two <b>nightdresses.</b>|$|R
25|$|Madeleine the {{rag doll}} {{was made by}} Firmin's wife, Joan, with an extra long dress to hold their children's <b>nightdresses,</b> but Postgate asked Joan {{to make a new}} version as one of the characters.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George had {{a carpet}} bag in his hand. It {{contained}} <b>nightdresses,</b> {{to be used}} in case he and Rollo should conclude to spend the night on the mountain. He put the carpet bag into the carriage, and then got in himself. The landlord shut the door, and the coachman drove away. Thus they set out on their excursion.|$|R
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her <b>nightdress</b> with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
25|$|In 1813 Ellen-Jane and her daughter, Ellen-Jane {{were on a}} trip in Bath. During {{the trip}} the daughter's <b>nightdress</b> caught fire while she was {{preparing}} for bed and she died of the burns she received. The following year the younger daughter, Marianne, sickened and died {{while they were in}} London. Within three years Ellen-Jane had lost her entire family and in her distress she commissioned Francis Chantrey to secure a likeness of her lost children.|$|E
25|$|The case came {{to court}} in January 2008 where Hodgson denied taking Nicholl {{to any of}} his {{ramshackle}} huts hidden in the Sandbeck Plantation near to the A6136 road, south of Richmond. DNA evidence contradicted this as did the discovery of Nicholl's <b>nightdress,</b> teddy bear and cassette player at the same location. Police believed that Hodgson became jealous of his brother's relationship with Nicholl and he killed her on the night she disappeared. Hodgson's elder daughter, stated in court that Nicholl was seen alive in Richmond two days after her disappearance and had been staying with her uncle (Hodgson's elder brother). Robert Hodgson denied this claim and stated in court {{that he had not}} seen Nicholl for some time.|$|E
6000|$|Gradually {{the young}} ones were captured, and <b>nightdresses</b> finally removed, ready for the clean Sunday shirt. But before the Sunday shirt was slipped over the fleecy head, away darted the naked body, to wallow in the {{sheepskin}} which formed the parlour rug, whilst the mother walked after, protesting sharply, holding the shirt like a noose, and the father's bronze voice rang out, and the naked child wallowing on its back in the deep sheepskin announced gleefully: ...|$|R
50|$|In December 2012 Cotton On {{was fined}} $1 million for selling highly {{flammable}} children's sleepwear misleadingly labelled as low fire danger. The discount clothing retailer, {{which has more}} than 900 outlets across the country, was fined $400,000 for selling more than 1000 <b>nightdresses</b> that breached Australian fire safety standards, and a further $400,000 for selling more than 1000 unsafe pairs of girls' pyjamas, between September and December 2010. It was fined a further $200,000 for false and misleading labels on both sets of clothing items which claimed they were low fire danger.|$|R
25|$|On 7 December 1893 Lee {{carried an}} {{adjournment}} motion in Parliament which censured the Attorney General Edmund Barton and the Minister for Justice Richard O'Connor for their acceptance of private legal briefs {{to act against}} New South Wales Government Railways, leading to their resignation and the prorogation of the parliament. On 27 August 1898, Lee rose to become Minister of Justice in the Free Trader government of George Reid, introducing prison libraries, lights in prison cells and <b>nightdresses</b> for female prisoners. He served in this capacity until his promotion on 3 July 1899 as the Secretary for Public Works. He served in this capacity only briefly when on 13 September 1899, Reid's government fell to William Lyne's Protectionists. He sat on the royal commission on city railway extension in 1897.|$|R
500|$|In 1884 at the Gaiety Theatre, Sarah Bernhardt {{performed}} the sleepwalking scene barefoot and {{clad in a}} clinging <b>nightdress,</b> and, in 1888, a critic noted Ellen Terry was [...] "the stormy dominant woman of the eleventh century equipped with the capricious emotional subltety of the nineteenth century." ...|$|E
500|$|On 13 August 1997, amateur divers {{discovered}} Carol Park's body, clad {{only in a}} <b>nightdress,</b> 75 {{feet down}} at the bottom of Coniston Water. She was nicknamed [...] "the Lady in the Lake" [...] by detectives after the 1943 detective novel by Raymond Chandler, The Lady in the Lake. The body had been wrapped in a pinafore dress, a canvas rucksack and plastic bags, tied with several knots, and weighed down with lead piping. Her eyes had been covered by plasters. It was later reported that the body had landed on an underwater ledge, and had it been thrown into the water a few metres farther from the land, it would probably never have been found.|$|E
500|$|The cabinet for {{the game}} was {{designed}} by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. His designed featured a joystick for each player, which was encased in a pink dome that the player would rest their hands on to control the joysticks, meant to resemble breasts. Faraco later acknowledged that [...] "they didn't have bumps on them or anything, but {{the way they were}} the size of grapefruits next to each other, you got the impression of what they were supposed to be." [...] Atari's second engineer, Don Lange, who assisted with the game, has also stated that the design was intentional on the part of Faraco, who fellow Atari designer Regan Chang has claimed [...] "had some really far out ideas". According to rumor, Faraco got the idea from a joke that joysticks resembled phalluses, and that Atari should make a game with female controls. Like Faraco's initial design for Space Race, which was changed due to its expense after a few dozen units, the joysticks for Gotcha were changed to standard ones shortly into the production run prior to the October 1973 release. The design did inspire the advertising flyer {{for the game}}, however, which features a man chasing a woman in a <b>nightdress</b> with the initial design of the cabinet behind them. The final cabinet stands over 5 feet tall and weighs nearly 200 pounds. The breast-like controllers reappeared in yellow in prototype versions of the 1974 Touch Me arcade game, but were not used in production.|$|E
40|$|Solo {{exhibition}} {{curated by}} Petra Feriancova In reflections on slavery, labour, revolution, and desire, Sharon Kivland exhibits fifteen embroidered linen robes (as {{worn by the}} wild girl of the woods of Champagne when she is domesticated perhaps? No, no, that is merely whimsical – they are the <b>nightdresses</b> of working girls, whatever their embroidered texts declare), and a selection of other works on her favourite subjects, including some small kidskins (a reminder of natural relations), a series of photographs of those French soaps called ‘Bonne Maman’ (so useful in the punitive insistence on good language), leather cartes de visite carrying descriptions of the transgressive body of that natural woman of the demi-monde, Nana, returned to her through a simple change in pronoun, and useful pencils and handkerchiefs. </p...|$|R

60|$|The {{answer to}} this {{question}} is an answer which everybody knows and nobody likes to give. What is driving our ministers of religion and statesmen to blurt it out at last is the plain fact that marriage is now beginning to depopulate the country with such alarming rapidity that we are forced to throw aside our modesty like people who, awakened by an alarm of fire, rush into the streets in their <b>nightdresses</b> or in no dresses at all. The fictitious Free Lover, who was supposed to attack marriage because it thwarted his inordinate affections and prevented him from making life a carnival, has vanished and given place to the very real, very strong, very austere avenger of outraged decency who declares that the licentiousness of marriage, now that it no longer recruits the race, is destroying it.|$|R
500|$|The Chandler's shop at Union Street, as {{depicted}} in a contemporary newspaper illustration, occupied the corner premises of a building of three storeys. The family lived above the shop, with Henry and Mary Ann Chandler sleeping in one bedroom with their six-year-old son Henry, and Ayres sharing a room {{on the second floor}} with her nieces, five-year-old Edith, four-year-old Ellen, and three-year-old Elizabeth. On the night of [...] 1885, fire broke out in the oil and paint shop, trapping the family upstairs. Gunpowder and casks of oil were stored in the lower floors of the building, causing the flames to spread rapidly. Although the shop was near the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade and the emergency services were quickly on scene, by the time the fire engine arrived intense flames were coming from the lower windows, making it impossible for the fire brigade to position ladders. Meanwhile, Ayres, wearing only a <b>nightdress,</b> had tried to reach her sister but was unable to get to her through the smoke. The crowd that had gathered outside the building were shouting to Ayres to jump. Instead she returned to the room she shared with the three young girls and threw a mattress out of the window, carefully dropping Edith onto it. Despite further calls from below to jump and save herself, she left the window and returned carrying Ellen. Ellen clung to Ayres and refused to be dropped, but Ayres threw her out of the building, and the child was caught {{by a member of the}} crowd. Ayres went back into the smoke a third time and returned carrying badly injured Elizabeth, whom she dropped safely onto the mattress.|$|E
2500|$|During Carmilla's stay, Laura has nightmares {{of a large}} cat-like beast {{entering}} {{her room}} and biting her on the chest. The beast then {{takes the form of}} a female figure and disappears through the door without opening it. In another nightmare, Laura hears a voice say, [...] "Your mother warns you to beware of the assassin," [...] and a sudden light reveals Carmilla standing at the foot of her bed, her <b>nightdress</b> drenched in blood. Laura's health declines, and her father has a doctor examine her. He finds a small blue spot on her chest and speaks privately with her father, only asking that Laura never be unattended.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time after}} the Titanic sank, while afloat in Lifeboat No. 1, Lucy Duff-Gordon {{reportedly}} commented to her secretary, [...] "There is your beautiful <b>nightdress</b> gone." [...] A fireman, annoyed by her comment, replied that while the couple could replace their property, {{he and the other}} crew members had lost everything in the sinking. Sir Cosmo then offered each of the men £5 (equivalent to £ in [...] ) to aid them until they received new assignments. While on the RMS Carpathia, the Cunard liner that rescued Titanics survivors, Sir Cosmo presented the men from Lifeboat No. 1 with checks drawn on his bank, Coutts. This action later spawned gossip that the Duff-Gordons had bribed their lifeboat's crew not to return to save swimmers out of fear the vessel would be swamped.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{promising}} newcomers entered the fashion {{scene in the}} 1980s. Angelo Tarlazzi, an extraordinary technician who once worked for Patou, bewitched both the press and his customers with his 'handkerchief' dresses. Made of squares of fabric, they transpired, {{when you came to}} put them on, to be far more complicated than at first appeared. Many a Parisian soirée of the 1980s was enlivened by his dresses, all in a fluid and original style, in which cutting and sewing were kept to a minimum. Chantal Thomas, the queen of sexy stockings and lace, won a devoted following for her seductive underwear and for evening gowns that looked like <b>nightdresses</b> and vice versa. Guy Paulin {{was one of the first}} designers to promote a severe, plain, and uncluttered look. His garments were classical in their proportions and made forcomfort and simplicity, with their harmonious lines reinforced by a subtle palette of colors and fine materials. Under his own name, Joseph designed luxurious knitwear along classic lines, creating loose, sexy garments in neutral colors. Carolina Herrera, long regarded as one of the most elegant members of the jet set, in 1981 launched a series of collections aimed at women like herself, featuring impeccably cut clothes of high quality and attractive evening dresses.|$|R
40|$|Sharon Kivland {{lives in}} the French countryside, though going {{frequently}} to London for discussion on philosophy, politics, and psychoanalysis. She remarks that Jean-Jacques, despite his many fine qualities, despite his declarations on moral and political equality, has a rather different programme of education for girls (of which she rather disapproves, for she cannot find a place there for herself) so she turns instead (naturally) from Emile to Choderlos de Laclos. An admirer of Rousseau, he nonetheless advocates, with fervour, the equality of the sexes, dwelling on ‘la femme-naturelle’, for whom only a revolution can change her current condition of slavery – and where there is slavery {{there can be no}} education (he adds). In reflections on slavery, labour, revolution, and desire, Sharon Kivland exhibits fifteen embroidered linen robes (as worn by the wild girl of the woods of Champagne when she is domesticated perhaps? No, no, that is merely whimsical – they are the <b>nightdresses</b> of working girls, whatever their embroidered texts declare), and a selection of other works on her favourite subjects, including some small kidskins (a reminder of natural relations), a series of photographs of those French soaps called ‘Bonne Maman’ (so useful in the punitive insistence on good language), leather cartes de visite carrying descriptions of the transgressive body of that natural woman of the demi-monde, Nana, returned to her through a simple change in pronoun, and useful pencils and handkerchiefs. The project is educational, but naturally so, intended to induce the convulsive laughter of noisy merriment, the expression of pleasure, and numerous contradictions...|$|R
2500|$|The Vestibule to the Chapel {{contains}} mementos {{from the}} wedding of Leopold II and Maria Luisa of Spain in August 1765. The room contains a chasuble made from the <b>nightdress</b> of Emperor Francis I with the personal help of Empress Maria Theresa. The vestment bears the appliquéd imperial coats of arms of Hungary, Bohemia, Burgundy, and Tyrol on the outer front side, and the Austrian coat of arms on the inside. The initials [...] "F.I." [...] and [...] "M.T." [...] appear on the name tag. The vestibule also contains three large portrait paintings. The first is a full-length portrait of Maria Theresa as the foundress of the Noblewomen's Collegiate Foundation. Dressed in black window's garments, the empress is holding the insignia of the order {{in her right hand}} and showing the foundation document in her left hand. The two other portraits are of Archduchess Maria Elisabeth of Austria as abbess of the foundation, and a matching portrait of Emperor Joseph II in a white uniform jacket bearing the Order of the Golden Fleece and the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 August 1815, Jane {{left her}} home to collect the Lammas rents from her estates {{near the village of}} Esh, County Durham. It was {{arranged}} for her only servant, Isabella Young, to stay with a neighbour at Herrington until her mistress's return, [...] "to save coal and candle". On 28 August, expecting the latter home that night, Isabella went back to her bed at Herrington House, however Jane did not return. During the night, the house was broken into, set on fire and Isabella was murdered. [...] On seeing the blaze, neighbours found Isabella lying dead in her <b>nightdress</b> in the front passage. [...] The fire had not yet reached her body and it was supposed she had been murdered with a poker or other iron object, as she had two large gashes {{on the back of her}} head. [...] The house and all its furniture burnt to the ground with only the walls remaining. [...] Isabella's body was laid out on an old box in a tileless shed at the rear of the house and covered in horse cloth. Twenty-year old Isabella was buried two days later on 30 August at St Michael's Church, Houghton-le-Spring.|$|E
2500|$|Boat 1 had {{room for}} about another 28 {{passengers}} {{but did not}} return to rescue those in the water after Titanic sank. Fireman Charles Hendrickson claimed he told his boat mates: [...] "It's up to us to go back and pick up anyone in the water" [...] but found no support. At least three other crewmembers, as well as the Duff Gordons, Salomon and Stengel, denied hearing any suggestion to go back or opposing any proposition to do so. In the media later, the Duff Gordons in particular were widely criticised for what was interpreted as their callousness {{in the face of the}} disaster. For instance, as Titanic sank, Lucile reportedly commented to her secretary: [...] "There is your beautiful <b>nightdress</b> gone." [...] Fireman Pusey replied that she shouldn't worry about losing her belongings because she could buy more. Pusey mentioned that the crew had lost all their kit and that their pay stopped from the moment of the sinking. Sir Cosmo responded: [...] "Very well, I will give you a fiver each to start a new kit!" [...] Aboard the rescue ship Carpathia, he did as he promised, presenting each of the seven crewmen in his lifeboat a cheque for £5.|$|E
