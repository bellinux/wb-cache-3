25|$|Despite {{his best}} {{intentions}} {{of producing a}} publication that did not dwell {{in the realm of}} heavy political exposé, Simons found a paucity of publishable material written on vaguely socialist themes in a light-hearted vein. With little humor or light fiction from which to choose, The Coming Nation inevitably moved into the usual heavier political fare, with the farmer's son Simons once again revisiting a theme <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>dear</b> <b>to</b> him in a series of articles: the role of the farmer in the American socialist movement.|$|E

500|$|Rumors persisted that Clark {{was forced}} out due to his {{contentious}} relationship with some in Washington, D.C.; however, he has dismissed such rumors, calling it a [...] "routine personnel action". The Department of Defense said it was merely a [...] "general rotation of American senior ranks". However, a NATO ambassador told the International Herald Tribune that Clark's dismissal {{seemed to be a}} [...] "political thing from the United States". General Hugh Shelton would say of Clark during his 2004 campaign that [...] "the reason he came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>dear</b> <b>to</b> my heart. I'm not going to say whether I'm a Republican or a Democrat. I'll just say Wes won't get my vote." [...] Shelton never elaborated further on what these issues were.|$|E
500|$|Born's {{relationship}} with Klein was more problematic. Born attended a seminar conducted by Klein and professors of applied mathematics, Carl Runge and Ludwig Prandtl, {{on the subject}} of elasticity. Although not particularly interested in the subject, Born was obliged to present a paper. Using Hilbert's calculus of variations, he presented one in which, using a curved configuration of a wire with both ends fixed, he demonstrated would be the most stable. Klein was impressed, and invited Born to submit a thesis {{on the subject of}} [...] "Stability of Elastica in a Plane and Space" [...] – a subject <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>dear</b> <b>to</b> Klein – which Klein had arranged to be the subject for the prestigious annual Philosophy Faculty Prize offered by the University. Entries could also qualify as doctoral dissertations. Born responded by turning down the offer, as applied mathematics was not his preferred area of study. Klein was greatly offended.|$|E

2500|$|Gomez continued: [...] new {{message was}} that he had left the Klan, shed the Nazi uniform he had proudly worn in many {{previous}} appearances, and only wanted to serve the people. He eliminated his high-octane anti-Semitic rhetoric. He was particularly concerned with the plight of [...] "European-Americans." [...] He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the [...] "growing underclass." [...] He used the tried and true demagoguery of class envy to sell his message: excessive taxpayers' money spent on welfare, school busing practices, affirmative action... and set-aside programs. He also embraced a subject <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>dear</b> <b>to</b> every Jefferson Parish voter, protection of the homestead exemption.Duke launched unsuccessful campaigns for the U.S. Senate in 1990 and governor in 1991. Villere did not again seek office but instead concentrated his political activity within the Republican organization.|$|E

The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension was a great, adventurous, geeky movie, with enough silly science fiction and great {{characters}} to fill any three lousy summer blockbusters these days... And it gave us so many great, geeky lines to quote." [...] Cosford of The Miami Herald said in his review, [...] "I suspect that Buckaroo's odd musings, particularly the one about being there no matter where you go, are about to enter the popular argot on the scale of [...] "Where's the beef?"—and his prediction has been proved right. (There is a page at CafePress for Buckaroo Banzai Quotes Gifts, for example.) Entertainment Weekly ranked Buckaroo Banzai as #43 in their Top 50 Cult Movies. The film was also ranked #21 on the magazine's [...] "The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83" [...] list. The Guardian has also cited Buckaroo Banzai as one of their [...] "1,000 films to see before you die".|$|E
60|$|Consider the {{one case}} of vice, {{or even of}} mere ingratitude, in those <b>nearest</b> <b>and</b> <b>dearest</b> <b>to</b> a man's heart; and of being so confounded through them, and by them, {{in spite of all}} love, care, strictness, tenderness, teaching, prayers--what not--and all in vain.|$|R

60|$|At that sight, I flung {{myself down}} on my side and gave up all for lost for ever. I thought {{of those who were}} <b>nearest</b> <b>and</b> <b>dearest</b> <b>to</b> me at home, and who would never behold my face again. I must die where I lay, unaided and unpitied.|$|R
2500|$|In 1921, Cruikshank {{was hired}} as the pastor of the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Steubenville, Ohio, {{approximately}} 40 miles west of Pittsburgh. [...] He remained in Steubenville through at least 1926. [...] While working as a minister, Cruikshank continued his interest in football and {{used it as a}} theme in his speeches and sermons. [...] At a 1923 banquet honoring Steubenville's undefeated 1922 football team, Cruikshank spoke of the importance athletics:"I am for athletics in the school. [...] They create a school consciousness, call it spirit if you will. When you leave school after playing on its football team you have something that will always hold your school career <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>dear</b> <b>to</b> you. ... Athletics embue the fellow who plays and the fans as well in a spirit that never says die. ... That's the thing that counts in life, the never give up spirit. [...] To my mind if we can take this spirit out of high school with us it means more to us than our Latin or Greek. [...] In my work especially I find that every walk of life needs the fellow who can take the kick and still come up with a smile but a determination." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was <b>near</b> <b>and</b> <b>dear</b> <b>to</b> our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going to have to go through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E

60|$|But I don't {{know why}} I never heard any one say that but myself. I always {{recognized}} it. But even those <b>nearest</b> <b>and</b> <b>dearest</b> <b>to</b> me couldn't {{seem to see}} it.
