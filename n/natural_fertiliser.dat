40|$|Research on {{innovative}} Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tools is done onstation and on-farm in the PURE project. The {{idea is that}} IPM {{tools are}} tested under well-defined conditions in experimental orchards. Subsequently, they are tested in commercial orchards {{as part of a}} total IPM system where drawbacks and bottlenecks become clear. In subsequent on-station experiments the drawbacks or bottlenecks are solved and adjusted IPM tools are again tested in commercial orchards. We call this the "design - assessment - adjustment cycle". It is meant, together with co-innovation techniques, to promote uptake of innovative IPM tools by commercial farmers. For apple, new innovations are the use of exclusion netting against codling moth (Cydia pomonella), and the use of an antagonist against conidia of Venturia inaequalis. For pear, the overwintering inoculum of brown spot of pear (Stemphylium vesicarium) is reduced by antagonists and <b>natural</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> and the control of pear sucker (Cacopsylla pyricola) is promoted by natural enemies. For both apple and pear an innovative canopy adapted sprayer is used to reduce emissions and to further reduce pesticide use. Efficacy of these innovative IPM tools and IPM systems is assessed by the newly developed software for environmental effects: SYNOPS, for economic effects: PREMISE, and for overall sustainability, including economic, social and environmental aspects: DEXiPM-pomefruit. Results show that the overall sustainability of the conventional system is already high. Nevertheless, innovative IPM tools provided an improvement of environmental quality with an efficient control of diseases or pests. The cost for running the innovative IPM systems was often higher than the conventional system. </p...|$|R

50|$|North Cornwall has {{a stretch}} of {{coastline}} that borders the Celtic Sea to the north. The Carboniferous sandstone cliffs that surround Bude (and stretch down {{as far south as}} Crackington Haven) were formed during the Carboniferous period, around 300 million years ago.

The folded and contorted stratification of shale and sandstone is unique in southern England.

The microbiological process of decomposition of organic matter, in the absence of oxygen takes place in reactors, called digesters. Biogas can be used as a fuel in a gas turbine or burner and can be used in a hybrid solar tower system offering a solution for waste treatment of agricultural and animal residues. A solar tower system consists of a heliostat field, which concentrates direct solar irradiation on an open volumetric central receiver. The receiver heats up ambient air to temperatures of around 700 °C. The hot air’s heat energy is transferred to a steam Rankine cycle in a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The steam drives a steam turbine, which in turn drives a generator for producing electricity. In order to increase the operational hours of a solar tower power plant, a heat storage system and / or hybridization may be considered.

In this report apple juice producing process and organic waste from juice productionin Uzbekistan were overviewed. Two juice processing plants of Uzbekistan “Bagat-Sharbat”and “Meva” and their generated organic waste were overviewed. Also different treatment methods of organic waste and their advantages anddisadvantages were analyzed and compared with anaerobic fermentation process. The studiedorganic waste management methods are animal feeding, incineration, direct land spreading,land filling, composting and anaerobic fermentation. Anaerobic fermentation of organic wastegenerated from fruit juice production was studied. Suggestions and recommendations were done to implement organic wastemanagement for fruit juice industry in Uzbekistan according to studies and calculations. Advantages and disadvantages of different waste management methods are discussedand compared with anaerobic fermentation. Economical and environmental calculations ofanaerobic fermentation process were done. Different biogas plant types all over the world andtheir construction costs were studied and compared. According to studies and calculationsseveral suggestions and recommendations are made. By studying and comparing different waste treatment methods with anaerobic digestion oforganic waste from juice plants following conclusions are made: The benefits of the biogas plant on the fruit juice plant: • Solution of the organic waste-disposal problems • Reduction of obnoxious smells from the organic wastes • Own, stable, self-sufficient energy production (heat, steam and electricity) • Cheap energy, which yields financial savings in the longer term. • Possibility of selling energy or biogas surplus - a source of extra income forthe plant. • Production of high-volume fertiliser that carries a higher content of nitrogen(15 % or more) than artificial fertilisers, and that does not burn the crops, asuntreated slurry can do. This reduces the need for expensive artificialfertilisers. By selling this <b>natural</b> <b>fertiliser</b> additional income for the plant canbe obtained. Local benefits: • Better control of the waste from fruit juice processing organic waste meansless pollution of local environment and water sources. • Removal of chemical fertilisers from the fields and recirculation of nutrients. • Local power plants contribute to creating permanent local jobs in the area. On a global additional, replacing fossil fuels to biogas reduces emissions of CO 2.

40|$|Rivers {{provide a}} large number of {{ecosystem}} services and riparian people depend directly and indirectly on water availability and quality and quantity of the river waters. The country's economy and the people's well-being and income, particularly in agriculturally dominated countries, are strongly determined by the availability of sufficient water. This is particularly true for the country of Myanmar in South-east Asia, where more than 65  % of the population live in rural areas, working in the agricultural sector. Only a few studies exist on river basins in Myanmar at all and detailed knowledge providing the basis for human–water research is very limited. A deeper understanding of human–water system dynamics in the country is required because Myanmar's society, economy, ecosystems and water resources are facing major challenges due to political and economic reforms and massive and rapid investments from neighbouring countries. However, not only policy and economy modify the need for water. Climate variability and change are other essential drivers within human–water systems. Myanmar's climate is influenced by the Indian Monsoon circulation which is subject to interannual and also regional variability. Particularly the central dry zone and the Ayeyarwady delta are prone to extreme events such as serious drought periods and extreme floods. On the one hand, the farmers depend on the <b>natural</b> <b>fertiliser</b> brought by regular river inundations and high groundwater levels for irrigation; on the other hand, they suffer from these water-related extreme events. It is expected that theses climatic extreme events will likely increase in frequency and magnitude in the future as a result of global climate change. Different national and international interests in the abundant water resources may provide opportunities and risks at the same time for Myanmar. Several dam projects along the main courses of the rivers are currently in the planning phase. Dams will most likely modify the river flows, the sediment loads and also the still rich biodiversity in the river basins, to an unknown extent. Probably, these natural and anthropogenically induced developments will also impact a special type of farming; we call it alluvial farming in the river floodplains and on sandbars in the Ayeyarwady River basin in Myanmar, which is called Kaing and Kyun, respectively. Relevant aspects for future development of Myanmar's river basins combine environment-water-related factors, climate, economic and social development, water management and land use changes. Research on these interplays needs to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of these drivers. However, it is only possible to gain a full understanding of all these complex interrelationships if multi-scale spatiotemporal information is analysed in an inter- and trans-disciplinary approach. This paper gives a structured overview of the current scientific knowledge available and reveals the relevance of this information with regard to human–environment and particularly to human–water interactions in Myanmar's river basins. By applying the eDPSIR framework, it identifies key indicators in the Myanmar human–water system, which {{has been shown to be}} exemplary by giving an example of use related to alluvial farming in the central dry zone...|$|E
50|$|State {{industries}} are mostly localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and Haldia port region. There {{are up to}} 10,000 registered factories {{in the state and}} the West Bengal state government has opened Shilpa Sathi, a single window agency in order to provide investors with all kinds of assistance in establishing and running industrial units. Kolkata is noted as one of the major centres for industries including the jute industry. There are numerous steel plants in the state apart from the alloy steel plant at Durgapur. The centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals and <b>fertilisers.</b> <b>Natural</b> resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts have made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries. West Bengal is at the forefronts of leather processing and leather goods manufacturing and has around 666 units producing leather and leather related goods. Currently, 22-25 per cent of India’s tanning activity is undertaken in Kolkata and its suburbs.The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980 - 81, declining to 5% by 1997 - 98. However, the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate.|$|R
2500|$|Animal welfare {{charities}} and campaigners, and vegan and vegetarian groups also joined {{to support the}} case against the dairy. [...] A Facebook group set up by Viva! calling for a halt to construction attracted over 7,500 members. WSPA (now called WAP) launched a campaign in September 2010 in anticipation of the resubmission of Nocton Dairies' proposal, featuring celebrities including Twiggy, Andrew Sachs, Chrissie Hynde, Jenny Seagrove and a large number of soap stars, and attracted over 25,000 pledges from people around the world that 'factory milk from battery cows' would not be used in their cuppas. The results of an Ipsos MORI survey released at the launch showed that 61% of those questioned said they would never buy milk produced in large-scale indoor dairy sheds. Compassion in World Farming's [...] campaign was launched late 2010, and the CPRE also campaigned on the issue. [...] As well as this, a campaign was set up through site 38 Degrees who submitted a petition of over 50,000 signatures to the district council in January 2011 on the basis that the farm was cruel and would put other farmers out of business. [...] 38 Degrees also singled out neighbouring farmers who had been keen to use the 'digestate' (left from the cow manure after anaerobic digestion had taken place) on their arable land as a more sustainable and <b>natural</b> source of <b>fertilisers</b> and to replace essential organic matter. [...] These farmers pulled out of their agreements due to fear of reprisals after being named in adverts which urged the public to target them directly.|$|R
50|$|As of 2015, West Bengal has the fifth-highest GSDP in India. GSDP {{at current}} prices (base 2004-2005) has {{increased}} from 208,656 crores in 2004-05 to 800,868 crores in 2014-2015. GSDP percent growth at current prices has varied {{from a low of}} 10.3% in 2010-2011 to a high of 17.11% in 2013-2014. The growth rate was 13.35% in 2014-2015. The state's per capita income has lagged the all India average for over two decades. As of 2014-2015, per capita NSDP at current prices was Rs78,903. Percapita NSDP growth rate at current prices has varied from 9.4% in 2010-2011 to a high of 16.15% in 2013-2014. The growth rate was 12.62% in 2014-2015In 2015-2016, percentage share of Gross Value Added (GVA) at factor cost by Economic Activity at constant price (base year 2011-2012) was Agriculture-Forestry and Fishery - 14.84%, Industry 18.51% and Services 66.65%. It has been observed {{that there has been a}} slow but steady decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur-Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and <b>fertilisers.</b> <b>Natural</b> resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.|$|R
40|$|Farmers {{in western}} Tanzania are {{establishing}} rotations {{of trees and}} crops {{in an attempt to}} overcome the shortage of wood, reverse deforestation of natural forests and improve soil fertility for food security enhancement. We compared fallows of Acacia crassicarpa, A. julifera, A. leptocarpa, Leucaena pallida and Senna siamea, with traditional bush fallow and continuous sole maize (Zea mays L.). The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the effectiveness of fallow types in terms of N, P and K use by maize. Trees were intercropped with maize for the first 3 years. After 5 years, trees were harvested, wood components were removed, and leaves, twigs and grasses were incorporated into the soil. Factorial N, P, K trials were carried out with maize grown after the fallow types. Parameters studied were grain yield, uptake of N, P and K, and nutrient use efficiency. The effects of fertiliser were much stronger than the effects of fallow types. There was no clear effect of tree fallows on nutrient use efficiency of the following maize. Non-fertilized maize yielded more after acacia than after the other trees and <b>natural</b> fallow. Upon <b>fertiliser</b> application the influences of fallow types became weaker. Fertiliser N improved maize yields more than fertiliser P, and there was a positive NP interaction. Fertilizer K did not bring about clear effects. N recovery efficiency was improved by the application of P and vice versa. When fertilisers were applied, differences in average maize grain yields between tree fallows and natural fallow varied from 300 kg ha¿ 1 (for A. julifera) to minus 250 kg ha¿ 1 (for S. siamea). A yield increase of 300 kg maize grain could also be obtained by application of 10 kg fertiliser N or 8 kg fertiliser P. The best fallow type for soil fertility improvement was Acacia julifera suggesting that this acacia is mining the soil for P and K. In conclusion, benefits of rotational woodlots seem larger in terms of wood production than in terms of soil fertility restoratio...|$|R
