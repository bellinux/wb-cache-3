25|$|Type not trait: The MBTI sorts for type; it {{does not}} {{indicate}} the strength of ability. It allows the clarity of a preference to be ascertained (Bill clearly prefers introversion), but not the strength of preference (Jane strongly prefers extraversion) or degree of aptitude (Harry is good at thinking). In this sense, it differs from trait-based tools such as 16PF. Type preferences are polar opposites: a precept of MBTI is that people fundamentally prefer one thing over the other, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of both.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> snaffle is <b>not</b> {{necessarily}} <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> with <b>a</b> jointed <b>bit</b> mouthpiece, as {{is often}} thought. <b>A</b> <b>bit</b> is <b>a</b> snaffle because it creates direct pressure without leverage on the mouth. It is <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> without <b>a</b> shank. Therefore, a single- or double-jointed mouthpiece, though the most common designs for snaffle <b>bits,</b> does <b>not</b> make <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>a</b> snaffle. Even a mullen mouth (a solid, slightly curved bar) or <b>a</b> bar <b>bit</b> is <b>a</b> snaffle.|$|R

500|$|With Girl Pat secured {{and under}} guard in Georgetown harbour, the Orsborne brothers, Harris, and Stephens {{were taken to}} police {{headquarters}} in the City Hall. The police issued a statement that the four were there [...] "at their own request. They are under no form of detention". In London, officials struggled to establish the exact legal position, and issued confusing statements. Meanwhile, Orsborne and his companions were widely hailed as heroes. The German newspaper Hamburger Fremdenblatt asked: [...] "Is this <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of British tradition, to do the unconventional out of love for adventure, if great personal risks, audacity and romance are connected therewith?". A man {{from the town of}} Hull thought the adventure demonstrated [...] "the spirit of Drake", and called for a public subscription to meet the crew's debts and expenses. An alternative view, expressed in the Hull Daily Mail, was to question whether the men should be regarded so favourably, or merely as [...] "men who have run away with someone else's property".|$|E
500|$|Both Huffington Post Crystal Bell and Washington Post Jen Chaney {{wanted to}} [...] "be honest" [...] about Vocal Adrenaline vs. New Directions in the competition: Bell said that Vocal Adrenaline [...] "put on the better show" [...] and Chaney wrote {{that they were}} [...] "better than New Directions": [...] "their dance moves were sharper and more in sync, and Unique's Minaj-esque {{magnetism}} factor sold the whole thing". VanDerWerff wrote that he [...] "could quibble that Vocal Adrenaline had stronger choreography overall" [...] or that he [...] "found Unique a more engaging performer than Rachel", but that as [...] "New Directions also used its whole ensemble better than Vocal Adrenaline did", he felt that [...] "either outcome seemed reasonable". Dodge simply stated, [...] "We all knew that New Directions would win and they'd get their happily ever after, but it was exciting to see it finally all play out." [...] Bell wrote that [...] "seeing the judges debate behind-the-scenes kind of takes away the entire title", though she appreciated Lohan's Freaky Friday reference. VanDerWerff said that the judging scene [...] "wasn't very good", and Votta described it as [...] "mostly waste". Futterman wrote that there was [...] "not really any emotion" [...] in Lohan's lines, though Strecker thought that the [...] "lines they gave her were pretty funny—if <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> sad".|$|E
500|$|... "Littlest Things" [...] has met mixed reviews; Heather Phares from AllMusic complimented the song, {{saying the}} ballad softens Allen's rough image and celebrates [...] "the mundane moments {{of a dying}} relationship", whereas Blender {{reporter}} Jon Dolan considers it a [...] "forlorn single", where the singer writes about the terror {{of being in a}} relationship [...] "with white-knuckled worry over a snip of florid piano from a ’70s soft-core porn flick". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticised Allen for being a [...] "poser who lacks charisma, bites off of everyone else, and is so sickeningly contemptuous of everyone but herself that it makes the pretty, melancholy piano-and-drum-loop ballad 'Littlest Things' seem like a farce". While analysing Alright, Still, The Guardian reviewer, Sophie Heawood, described the lyrics as the [...] "perfect description of missing someone: 'We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt/ I was just so happy in your boxers and your T-shirt'." [...] Mark Pytlik from Pitchfork Media gave a positive review, saying that [...] "'Littlest Things' is a supple piano-tickler that provides one of Allen's sweetest lyrical moments while simultaneously leaving Ms. Dynamite in the dust on the R balladeering front". He believed that the song is made out of Allen's [...] "comfort zone" [...] of songs such as [...] "Smile", the result being of [...] "high order, if <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more erratic". IGN reviewer Todd Gilchrist named the song as the album's [...] "most affecting tune", while thought it [...] "compiles a sad and beautiful checklist of the intimate moments she no longer shares with her dearly departed boyfriend".|$|E

2500|$|In this {{atmosphere}} of growing conflict, Mussolini persuaded Hitler {{to put the}} dispute to a four-power conference and on 29 September 1938, Hitler, Chamberlain, Édouard Daladier (the French Prime Minister) and Mussolini met in Munich. Czechoslovakia {{was not to be}} a party to these talks, nor was the Soviet Union. The four powers agreed that Germany would complete its occupation of the Sudetenland but that an international commission would consider other disputed areas. Czechoslovakia was told that if it did not submit, it would stand alone. At Chamberlain's request, Hitler readily signed a peace treaty between the United Kingdom and Germany. Chamberlain returned to Britain promising [...] "peace for our time". Before Munich, President Roosevelt sent a telegram to Chamberlain saying [...] "Good man", and afterwards told the American ambassador in Rome, [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> upset over the final result." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1964 general {{election}}, Powell said in {{his election}} address, [...] "it was essential, for the sake not only of our own people but of the immigrants themselves, to introduce control over the numbers allowed in. I am convinced that strict control must continue {{if we are to}} avoid the evils of a [...] "colour question" [...] in this country, for ourselves and for our children". Norman Fowler, then a reporter for The Times, interviewed Powell during the election and asked him what the biggest issue was: [...] "I expected to be told something about the cost of living but <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of it. [...] "Immigration," [...] replied Powell. I duly phoned in my piece but it was never used. After all, who in 1964 had ever heard of a former Conservative cabinet minister thinking that immigration was an important political issue?" ...|$|E
2500|$|He is {{mentioned}} again {{later that year}} at Edessa. The local citizens were attempting to pay ransom for the safe return of prisoners held at Antioch. Bouzes prevented them from doing so. [...] "Chosroes ...wished to sell off all the captives from Antioch. And when the citizens of Edessa learned of this, they displayed an unheard-of zeal. For {{there was not a}} person who did not bring ransom for the captives and deposit it in the sanctuary according to the measure of his possessions. And there were some who even exceeded their proportionate amount in so doing. For the harlots took off all the adornment which they wore on their persons, and threw it down there, and any farmer who was in want of plate or of money, but who had an ass or a sheep, brought this to the sanctuary with great zeal. So there was collected an exceedingly great amount of gold and silver and money in other forms, but <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of it was given for ransom. For Bouzes happened to be present there, and he took in hand to prevent the transaction, expecting that this would bring him some great gain. Therefore Chosroes moved forward, taking with him all the captives." ...|$|E
