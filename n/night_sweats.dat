5|$|While Denver {{may not be}} as {{recognized}} for historical musical prominence as some other American cities, it has an active pop, jazz, jam, folk, and classical music scene, which has nurtured several artists and genres to regional, national, and even international attention. Of particular note is Denver's importance in the folk scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Well-known folk artists such as Bob Dylan, Judy Collins and John Denver lived in Denver at various points during this time, and performed at local clubs. Also, three members of the widely popular group Earth, Wind, and Fire are from Denver. More recent Denver-based artists include Nathaniel Rateliff & the <b>Night</b> <b>Sweats,</b> The Lumineers, Air Dubai, The Fray, Flobots, Cephalic Carnage, Axe Murder Boyz, Deuce Mob, and Five Iron Frenzy.|$|E

The patient was a 53 -year-old Caucasian male, presented with <b>night</b> <b>sweat,</b> weakness, and weight loss. Radiological findings were compatible with tuberculosis, however, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy materials were negative for malignancy or tuberculosis. A testicular mass was detected during the physical examination and orchidectomy material revealed acid-fast bacilli containing caseating granuloma.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia usually follows a slower course. Symptoms accumulate over several months and include fever, cough, difficulty breathing, wheezing, and weight loss.

25|$|The body {{is remarkably}} good at hiding the {{symptoms}} {{and as a}} result people with RCC often have advanced disease by the time it is discovered.

When RCC metastasises, it most commonly spreads to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, adrenal glands, brain or bones. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have improved the outlook for metastatic RCC.|$|E
25|$|Patient A {{suffers from}} schizophrenia. Their {{treatment}} included {{a combination of}} ziprasidone, olanzapine, trazodone and benzotropine. The patient experienced dizziness and sedation, so they were tapered off ziprasidone and olanzapine, and transition to quetiapine. Trazodone was discontinued. The patient then experienced excessive sweating, tachycardia and neck pain, gained considerable weight and had hallucinations. Five months later, quetiapine was tapered and discontinued, with ziprasidone re-introduction into their treatment due to the excessive weight gain. Although the patient lost the excessive weight they gained, they then developed muscle stiffness, cogwheeling, tremor and <b>night</b> <b>sweats.</b> When benztropine was added they experienced blurry vision. After an additional five months, the patient was switched from ziprasidone to aripiprazole. Over the course of 8 months, patient A gradually experienced more weight gain, sedation, developed difficulty with their gait, stiffness, cogwheel and dyskinetic ocular movements. A pharmacogenomics test later proved the patient had a CYP2D6 *1/*41, with has a predicted phenotype of IM and CYP2C19 *1/*2 with predicted phenotype of IM as well.|$|E
