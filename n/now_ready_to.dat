5|$|The Venetians {{were taken}} by {{surprise}} when the city fell, as the fleet under Morosini was still sailing off the western coast of Greece. Following their customary strategy, they reacted by sending their fleet to blockade Gallipoli and cut off passage of the Dardanelles. However, the Venetians were by <b>now</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> disengage themselves from this profitless venture, and soon instructed Morosini to seek peace. In July, Hamza Bey signed a peace treaty with the Venetians (ratified on 4 September) whereby the Republic recognised its loss of Thessalonica, restored passage of the Dardanelles, and acknowledged, in exchange of an annual tribute of 236 ducats, Ottoman overlordship over Patras in the Morea. In exchange, the Venetians secured the Sultan's recognition of their possessions in Albania: Durazzo, Scutari, and Antivari.|$|E
5|$|When Davies {{presented}} his {{ideas for the}} U.S. Millionaire to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer. Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on Millionaires production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, {{a number of other}} popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. Millionaire during its development, including Peter Jennings, Bob Costas, Phil Donahue, and Montel Williams, but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British Millionaire and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show. When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. Millionaire. With production <b>now</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of Millionaires production.|$|E

25|$|In July 1444, the Hungarian king {{informed}} Thomas of {{his intention}} break the truce with the Ottomans. King Thomas {{decided to make}} the best of his membership in the Christian coalition. Already in May he had conquered the lucrative silver mining town of Srebrenica, taken by the Ottomans from the Serbian Despotate, which in turn had taken it from Bosnia. He now decided to resume his war against the rebellious Kosača, an Ottoman tributary. The Turks were <b>now</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> assist the Duke and broke into Bosnia, forcing the King to flee from Kozograd to Bobovac and enabling Kosača to reverse all his losses. In August, the Ottomans restored Serbia to Đurađ Branković, who allied with Kosača against King Thomas. The destruction of the Hungarian army at the Battle of Varna, in which King Vladislaus himself perished, in November 1444 left Thomas vulnerable. Forced again to rely on Venice alone, Thomas repeated his earlier offer, but the Republic declined and made peace with Kosača. In April 1445, Thomas lost Srebrenica and the entire Drina Valley to Branković. Ivaniš Pavlović came to his aid again, and the two advanced towards Pomorje. Thomas retook Drijeva, but his advance was suddenly halted, perhaps by another Turkish incursion or a truce. Hostilities finally ended only in September.|$|E
25|$|The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in an {{internal}} report by delegate George Burnier, stated the following in April 1920:There are two distinct military organizations in Hungary: the national army {{and a kind}} of civil guard which was formed when the communist régime fell. It is the latter which has been responsible for all the reprehensible acts committed. The Government managed to regain control of these organizations only a few weeks ago. They are now well-disciplined and collaborate with the municipal police forces.This deep hostility toward Communism would be the more lasting legacy of Kun's abortive revolution. It was a conviction shared by Horthy and his country's ruling class that would help drive Hungary into what might have been a fatal alliance with Adolf Hitler.The nation of the Hungarians loved and admired Budapest, which became its polluter in the last years. Here, {{on the banks of the}} Danube, I arraign her. This city has disowned her thousand years of tradition, she has dragged the Holy Crown and the national colours in the dust, she has clothed herself in red rags. The finest of the nation she threw into dungeons or drove into exile. She laid in ruin our property and wasted our wealth. Yet the nearer we approached to this city, the more rapidly did the ice in our hearts melt. We are <b>now</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> forgive her.|$|E

The idea incubated with real estate developer Bruce Firestone for months and accepted that Ottawa was <b>now</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> again support a franchise. He decided to launch a bid for the Ottawa franchise through his development firm Terrace Investments. Firestone first told his fellow Terrace executives, Cyril Leeder, and Randy Sexton, after a game of shinny hockey in March 1988.

500|$|New York went 8–4–1 in 1926, and {{withstood}} {{a challenge}} from an upstart American football league {{led by a}} team featuring Grange. Grange and his agent had formed the American Football League and placed their flagship team, the Yankees, in New York. Grange's agent, C.C.

Angered, Pyle swore revenge, saying [...] "I am <b>now</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> put the National Football League, and Mr. Mara out of business." [...] According to a story published by The New York Times in December 1926, the Giants lost over $50,000 during the season. Grange's league lasted one season however, and was subsumed into the NFL. Grange went back to playing for the Bears before the 1928 season, and the Yankees folded a year later.|$|E

500|$|Under the new {{management}} of Mick Hancock, Duran Duran's tour manager, the band {{returned to work}} in May 1985 with a tour of Scandinavia. They also made a headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival on 21 June 1985, when they played live {{for the first time}} two new songs that would later be included on the album—"Satellite" [...] and [...] "All in Your Mind". <b>Now</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> start recording, they entered the studio with Clive Langer and their former producer Ian Broudie to record the songs they had played at Glastonbury, as well as [...] "Like a Rollercoaster" [...] and [...] "Jimmy Brown". Not liking the results of this session, the band considered Eddy Grant and ABBA's production team before settling on Laurie Latham as their producer. McCulloch had been impressed by the sharp quality of Latham's production on The Stranglers' single [...] "Skin Deep". The band met with Latham in Brussels and recorded [...] "All in Your Mind", [...] "Like a Rollercoaster" [...] and [...] "Jimmy Brown", which was renamed [...] "Bring on the Dancing Horses". [...] "Bring on the Dancing Horses" [...] appeared on the WEA compilation album Songs to Learn & Sing in November 1985, and was released as a single in the same month.

500|$|During the 1992 Japanese {{leg of the}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour, Frusciante, {{overwhelmed}} by the band's new-found success and his drug addiction, abruptly quit in May. Circle Jerks bassist Zander Schloss was auditioned but after four days of rehearsing, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith decided that Schloss did not fit with their future plans. The band originally had wanted Dave Navarro as their guitarist but Navarro's band, Jane's Addiction had just broken up and he wasn't ready to join another band. With a major summer tour planned including a headlining spot at Lollapalooza, guitarist Arik Marshall of L.A. band Marshall Law was hired as Frusciante's official replacement and would finish out the remainder of tour with the band. Coming off their most successful tour the band was excited to start recording their next album however during pre-production of their sixth studio album, tensions grew between the band and Marshall, and they dismissed him from the band in early 1993. Shortly following Marshall's firing, the band held open auditions {{that proved to be}} a failure. Kiedis attended a show by local L.A. band, Mother Tongue and quickly was drawn to the band's guitarist, Jesse Tobias. Tobias was recruited after a series of auditions; however, his tenure with the band was brief and after weeks of writing and rehearsals for the next album the band stated that [...] "the chemistry wasn't right" [...] and he was fired although the band already had his replacement ready. Chad was friends with and in contact with Navarro, who he said was <b>now</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> join the band so on September 5, 1993 Navarro was officially hired as the band's seventh guitarist and work quickly began on the band's next record, One Hot Minute, which would be released in 1995 and was seen as a disappointment in sales compared to their previous album.|$|E
