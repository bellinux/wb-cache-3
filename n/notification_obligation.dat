The measures were not effective, and the scientific knowledge was still limited and did not provide the necessary answers in 2008. To curb the epidemic, the control had to change from a risk-based approach to the precautionary principle which finally, during the lambing season of 2009 / 2010, led to the culling of more than 50, 000 pregnant goats from infected herds.

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{edition of the}} Journal of Media Law, Professor Gavin Phillipson {{considered}} whether the United Kingdom must impose a prior <b>notification</b> <b>obligation</b> on the media in respect of stories that concern the private conduct of individuals. Such a notification requirement would allow time for the subjects of such stories to seek interim relief to prevent publication. Max Mosley has asked the European Court of Human Rights to oblige the UK to introduce such a rule. Professor Phillipson concluded that Mosley should win his case. This paper proceeds, first, by questioning the fundamental premise of the Phillipson / Mosley argument: that damages are inadequate to compensate harms done through publication of private information. Secondly, it considers the practical ramifications of {{the imposition of a}} prior notification requirement, both in terms of the ‘workability’ of a legal obligation and the impact it would have on media freedom. Thirdly, it airs the question of whether – in light of the margin of appreciation afforded to contracting states – it would be legitimate for the Strasbourg court to compel the introduction of a specific measure to assist the protection of privacy.

The study's purpose is to investigate how the notification requirements in Social Services Act, chapter 14, section 1, are applied in primary schools and how to best collaborate among the team of professionals responsible for dealing with suspected child neglect or abuse. The study's research question is: How do the various professions at school (apart from the teachers) deal with suspicions of child neglect or abuse? How does this affect the school management and structural management of suspected neglect? How is the report prepared and submitted to the social services? The results are based on in-depth interviews with nine people of different professions within the school health. Collaboration within the pupil health team worked mainly very well, but in one case, it did not work well at all. Many times, however, it {{was a lack of}} communication between student health teams and the teachers. The main conclusion of the study is that the importance of a well-functioning student health team is of paramount importance for dealing correctly with suspected child neglect. Firstly, this is best achieved by ensuring the quality training for school heads in matters relating to the <b>notification</b> <b>obligation.</b> Secondly, the student health personnel have to be well known faces among the teachers. Thirdly, it is crucial that horizontal cooperation is initiated by the principal.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} cooperation between primary schools and authorities {{of social and}} legal protection of children. Social and legal protection of children is provided to children whose parents fail to fulfil the obligations defined in parental responsibility or fail to pursue or abuse the rights defined in parental responsibility. Social and legal protection is also provided to children leading immoral or shiftless way of life or regularly escaping from their parents. The general <b>notification</b> <b>obligation</b> assigns schools to notify local authorities of communities with wide competences of fact that indicate that a child requires social and legal protection. The goal of the thesis {{is to find out}} how a primary school cooperates with a children social-law care department in relation to social pathologic behaviour in primary school children. Two research questions were set to reach the goal. I tried to find out in what way cooperation between primary schools and authorities of social and legal protection of children is conducted and whether primary school teachers and social workers consider the cooperation efficient, by means of semi -structured interviews with primary school teachers and with social workers. The data obtained this way were analysed by the open data coding method. The cooperation is based on mutual transfer of information on pupils with problems, reports and written assessment of pupil's behaviour and school result. Social workers and primary school teachers meet at consultation meetings and also at disciplinary boards and case conferences. School teachers and social workers consider their cooperation effective. Certain problems however occur in their cooperation. To make the cooperation more effective two teachers propose more frequent updating of laws and applicable regulations with regard to current needs of children and legislation modification. Social workers propose establishment of a multidisciplinary team, an increase of the number of social workers and presence of a lawyer at the children social-law protection department, education in social and legal protection of children for primary school teachers, and an Internet forum. The results of the thesis may be used for making the cooperation more efficient and for prevention of risky behaviour among primary school children...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} many discussions this year about the {{problems}} arising from fast or ‘instant’ loans, and the first proposals have been prepared for solving these problems legally. The topic is not characteristic of Estonia alone: excessively easy access to consumer loans has brought with it over-borrowing by consumers {{in all of the}} Nordic and Baltic countries. However, there are slight and sometimes even quite significant differences in the methods used in a bid to tackle these problems from one country to the next. In this Juridica International publication, consumer‑credit experts from seven Nordic and Baltic countries share and reflect upon their national experiences. Their research results demonstrate that so-called soft solutions such as a <b>notification</b> <b>obligation</b> for lenders or additional requirements imposed on advertising of fast loans do not produce the desired effect on their own. Rather, the experiences of our neighbours indicate that a requirement of licensing for creditors, establishment of interest-rate restrictions, and measures under procedural law should be central if one is to avoid implementing requirements related to consumer credit without having holistically and fully assessed what is necessary. It is pleasant to see that Estonia is among those moving toward the above-mentioned solutions. We would like to offer a big ‘thank you’ to the Estonian–Norwegian scientific co‑operation programme that has enabled publishing the outcomes of the research carried out under the project EMP 205. Last year marked the passing of 20 years since the adoption of the Law of Property Act. For an Estonia that had just restored its independence, the Law of Property Act was the legislation that served as the first pillar in shaping a legal order focused on market economic relations, and its importance for the functioning of modern economic circulation cannot be overestimated. The jubilee of the Law of Property Act was celebrated on 28 – 29 November 2013 in Tartu with an international conference, and selected works from among the presentations at that event make up the first portion of this issue, examining developments in the law of property. Also here, via a recurring theme of the articles, we are given a look at the experiences of other countries and have an opportunity to learn from them: there is land-register reform in progress both in Scotland and in Latvia, and it seems that the systems there are becoming increasingly similar to the one we are using. W. Faber provides us with an opportunity for comparison, to consider whether and to what extent the Estonian law on proprietary security rights corresponds to the modern solutions of the Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR). C. Von Bar and C. Martinson show well that any kind of legislative solution requires a clear understanding of the main concepts of the law (here, of property). But the traditional concepts of law are exactly what our fickle and rapidly changing time has challenged. The relevance of things as physical objects is constantly decreasing in a digital world and digital business. In a loan taken out online or via a mobile phone, personal contact between the lender and the borrower is lost and readiness to take loan decisions {{on the spur of the}} moment increases. However, just as progress requires innovation, people need something routine and secure to manage their lives. Accordingly, it is especially nice that Juridica International is once again published on paper, not only as an online version. Then again, you could just as well read it on a tablet as you relax in a rocking chair beside a fireplace. Enjoy the reading...|$|E
40|$|This thesis scrutinizes the {{proportionality}} {{and describes}} the subsidiarity of proposals for security breach notification laws (hereafter: SBNLs) in the European Union. An SBNL obliges that a security breach within a company or government must be notified to affected customers and a supervisory authority. A law stands the proportionality test if {{the requirements of}} effectiveness and necessity are met. Effectiveness {{means that there is}} a causal relationship between the measure and the aim pursued. Necessity means that no less restrictive policy options are available that achieve the same aims. The closely linked subsidiarity test assesses the necessity of the European Union approach: the question whether the aims of the SBNL and cybersecurity cannot be achieved sufficiently by the Member States individually. Subsidiarity is to a great extent a political question and consequently described more limitedly. Why these tests? Proportionality and subsidiarity are fundamental principles of EU law. They demand the European legislature not to go beyond what is necessary to attain the objectives in the Treaties and to only adopt measures if a European Union approach has added value. The European Court of Justice scrutinizes whether European legislation is in accordance with these principles. The laws that have been assessed are Article 31 of the proposed Data Protection Regulation (hereafter: PDPR) and Article 14 of the proposed Cybersecurity Directive (hereafter: PCD). Article 31 PDPR concerns a single uniform personal data breach <b>notification</b> <b>obligation.</b> A personal data breach entails the unauthorized access to and/or theft of personal data. Article 14 PCD concerns the harmonization of national (significant) loss of integrity breach notification obligations. A loss of integrity concerns the loss of control over computer systems. A personal data breach always entails a loss of integrity, but a loss of integrity can also occur without the loss of personal data. The aim of the SBNL in the PDPR is “to ensure that individuals are in control of their personal data and trust the digital environment” in order to “increase the effectiveness of the fundamental right to data protection”. The aim of the SBNL in the PCD is: “to create a culture of risk management and improve the sharing of information between the private and public sectors. ” The subsidiarity question covers cybersecurity in general and SBNLs in particular. The Commission argues that a European cybersecurity approach is necessary because of the cross border aspect of the Internet, the necessity of a uniform secure Internet for the Single Market and the protection of fundamental rights. Indeed, there is European cybersecurity legislation and a European cybersecurity policy framework. Regarding the PDPR and the PCD in particular, the Commission argues {{that there is a need}} to harmonize national initiatives in order to create a level playing field, legal certainty and lower administrative burdens for companies to notify. A literature review in this thesis shows that the United States aims to replace a state level SBNLs by a federal SBNL. The obligation to comply simultaneously with multiple SBNLs caused significant administrative burdens for companies. This strengthens the conception that SBNLs can better be achieved at a European level, although this remains a political consideration. From an apolitical point of view, this thesis did not find a convincing argument about the inappropriateness of a European approach regarding cybersecurity and SBNLs. The proportionality test contains two elements. The first element of the proportionality test, the effectiveness test, is performed more extensively in this thesis than the Commission did in its impact assessment of both the PDPR and the PCD. Legal scholars and the European legislator, usually assess the first aspect of proportionality limitedly. In the PDPR and PCD, the Commission did not mention in what way the SBNL is suitable to achieve the aim “to ensure that individuals are in control of their personal data and thrust in the digital environment” and “to create a culture of risk management and improvement of information sharing between private and public parties”. This is a deficiency in the analysis of legislation. This thesis challenges the aforementioned assumption that determination of causality is straightforward. This is done by a more substantive assessment of the proportionality test. This thesis contributes an empirical study from a security economics perspective, in order to substantively review (the complexity of) effects of SBNLs. Do the (expected) effects of SBNLs match the aims it should attain according to the European proposals? And are these effects desirable? Legal impact assessments can benefit from this perspective, because knowledge about the effectiveness of the law will be enhanced. To structure the empirical study, a first and second order effect of SBNLs have been distinguished. The first order effect is the effect of (characteristics of) SBNLs on the amount of breach notifications. Generating notifications is not one of the final aims of the proposed legislation, but a means to achieve the second order effect. The second order effect includes the positive and negative effects of the law on society. A literature review is conducted to provide an overview of what is already known concerning those two effects. The quantitative analysis systematically assesses the first order effect of American SBNLs by a longitudinal dataset containing security breach notifications. The subsequent qualitative analysis reviews the perception of Dutch security experts and managers regarding the first and second order effect and outcomes of the quantitative analysis. The results can substantiate the first element of the Commissions’ proportionality test of European SBNLs: This study proves the first order effect empirically by means of analyzing American data. The laws have an effect on the amount of breach notifications. The effect is relatively large: a notification increase of at least 50 % can be attributed to the law, by a fixed effects regression analyzing differences in breach notification before and after the introduction of the law. The database is partly constructed by underlying sources that only register officially notified breaches, which can explain this high relative increase. From an absolute perspective, the effect is minor: less than 0. 05 % of the companies notified a security breach in America in the eight-year period that was researched. To compare: a recent study in the United Kingdom published that 88 % of the companies surveyed had experienced data theft in 2009. The low absolute number of breaches could be explained by the incompleteness of the dataset, high compliance costs for a company due to reputation damage and unawareness of breaches. The introduction of the law thus has a structural first order effect, at least in the database of known security breaches. It is however ambiguous which aspects of the law cause this effect. Literature review and qualitative analysis showed that enforced sanctions generate compliance with the law and that reputation damage is a major driver for non-compliance. Confidential treatment of the notification and benefits from information sharing about security breaches are perceived as minor incentives for compliance. The quantitative analysis only confirmed that some American laws qualified as strict by American Attorneys cause an increase in notifications, but it is ambiguous what exactly makes these laws strict. The literature review and the qualitative study demonstrated several positive second order effects perceived in literature and by security managers and experts, such as increased investments in security, fostered cooperation between companies (literature only), increased awareness of consumers of security breaches and faster risk mitigation. The first two effects match with the aim of the PCD to 1.) create a culture of risk management and 2.) enhance information exchange between the private and public sectors respectively. The last two effects correspond with the aim of the PDPR to enhance personal data control of individuals. However, the positive effects can be nuanced. The security managers interviewed already shared security information with competitors, and did not see an incentive for cooperation with the government following from a security breach notification, because they did not value the government as a center of expertise. Moreover, a security expert challenged the effect of increased investments in security because the law provides an incentive to notify, not to improve security practices. Accepting the ‘risk’ of a notification might be less expensive than improving security practices in order to avoid notifications. This is however not confirmed in literature review or by other qualitative analysis, which implicates that the risk of not providing incentives to improve security practices at all must be perceived as low. Lastly, an increased number of security breach notifications might result in an overload of information that could also result in disinterest and a notification fatigue instead of enhanced awareness and risk mitigation. This overload is not a big treat given the current low amount of notified security breaches. For instance, in America, about 600 million records were breached in the eight-year period observed. This would entail that, on average, an American citizen would be notified twice in eight year. Hence, the second order effects in literature and qualitative analysis, although they are perceptions that can be nuanced, do match the objectives pursued in legislation. But, the objectives are vaguely defined and while their attainment could constitute effectiveness in the legal sense, the question remains what makes an SBNL effective and when an SBNL is effective. Moreover, there are also additional negative effects associated with SBNL in literature and qualitative analysis, such as reputational costs and maintenance costs. The second element of the proportionality test concerns the question whether there are less restrictive equally effective measures available. The SBNL can restrict companies, because it infringes the fundamental freedom to conduct a business by imposing administrative, compliance- and reputational costs. This study offers two observations concerning this infringement. First, the freedom to conduct business is more infringed than the Commission states. The cost assessment of the Commission only included the costs of making a notification, which are estimated between 125 euro and 20000 euro per notification. But, literature and qualitative analysis showed that there are costs that the Commission did not take into account, such as the reputation damage incurred (estimations up to 2 % of a company’s turnover) and the costs of processing and enforcement of breach notifications. The cost estimation of the Commission thus is undervalued compared with the total societal costs of an SBNL. Second, the coexistence of the PDPR and the PCD unnecessarily infringes the freedom to provide a business as it imposes unnecessary costs for companies. In many cases, a breach thus should be notified twice to both the European supervisory authority and to the competent national authority, because the scope of personal data loss and loss of integrity overlap. Second, the proposals are regulated by a different legal instrument and emit different signals. The confidential treatment in the PCD will not function properly if simultaneously companies are forced to publicly disclose the same information in the PDPR. To conclude, the fuzziness of the aims and the complexity of measuring effects hamper the determination of a reasonable expectation of causality between the measure and the aims pursued. The Commission sets aims that are fuzzy and hard to measure, and does not specify how these goals will be achieved through the adoptions of SBNLs. Likewise, the empirical measurement of effects in part ? showed that it is complex to pinpoint effects of SBNLs. Moreover, the Commission undervalued societal costs and adverse effects. In my view, in the current situation, a reasonable expectation of effectiveness is not demonstrated sufficiently. In the theoretically desired situation, the goals are clear and measurable. The law is effective because the measurable aims are achieved by the measure. But, still, effectiveness is not simply attaining aims. Even if the causal relation between the measure and its aims can be proved in a narrow sense, the question remains whether the achievement of these aims is effective. From a security economics perspective, it can be argued that the law is effective if the revenues of positive effects are higher than the societal costs of negative effects. This requires an accurate empirical measurement of these effects, initiated in part ?, and a quantification of these effects. Unfortunately, this approach towards effectiveness does not cover non-economic, non-measurable aims such as the protection of fundamental rights. The protection of fundamental rights is not always ‘efficient’ and can certainly not always be quantified, but European legislation must remain within the boundaries of fundamental rights. Moreover, the complexity of the legal interferences in the field of cybersecurity makes it impossible to provide an exhaustive balance sheet of all (expected) effects. A security economics perspective would not be the perfect means to define effectiveness, because some aims are not measurable and expected effects are complex. Both a legal and an economic approach do not provide an optimal outcome for the definition of ‘effectiveness’. There is no uniformity of what makes a law effective. Thus, still the effectiveness question remains. What is needed to determine the effectiveness of SBNLs? Who may decide when a law is effective? In a democracy, we all should decide. More concrete: the European Commission, Parliament and Council state ex ante in the ordinary legislative procedure the aims of the law. The European Court of Justice decides ex post whether the law is effective. Thus, effectiveness in redefined, as legal and economic approaches towards effectiveness are troublesome. This definition must be regarded as a starting point for further research on interpreting effectiveness of the law. "Effectiveness is the causality between a legislation and its aims defined by a democratic decision making process where as much information as possible about (potential) positive and negative effects is provided. " Hence, taking this definition into account, improving information about potential positive and negative effects is the key tool to enhance effectiveness of the law and correctly assess its necessity. The executed empirical analysis in this thesis has provided knowledge about the effects of SBNLs that can be used by the Commission. Increased availability of information about societal impact (expectations) enhances decision making of the legislature ex ante and the scrutiny of the Court ex post that determine the proportionality of cybersecurity laws. The Commission, which has the power of initiative, should invest to provide this information. To conclude, additional information about effects of legislation on society will improve the quality of draft legislation and the judicial decision about proportionality. For example, information about the adverse reputation damage on companies, demonstrated in this thesis, will play a vital role when judging about the infringement on the freedom to conduct business. Additional information about effects will not be decisive in a judicial decision, since also non measurable effects need to be balanced and (expected) effects have a certain margin of error. The proportionality test as such must be seen in relation to these inherent flaws within measuring effectiveness of the law on society. Often, causality between the measure and the aim can and will not be ‘proven’ scientifically by the legislature and the Court. Nevertheless, the proportionality principle has been a corner stone of European Law to analyze the effectiveness and necessity of legislation. Further enhancement of the execution of this principle by improving information about societal effects increases the democratic legitimacy of European Union law. Therefore, this thesis recommends the European Commission to enhance information about effects. This can be done to improve the measurement of (the expectation of) effects before and after the adoption of the law. These recommendations can be used for improving European laws in general and the PDPR and PCD in particular. Before the adoption of the law, a reasonable expectation of effectiveness should be provided by the Commission. This entails the operationalization of measurable aims, the separation of non-measurable aims and a substantiated expectation of causality between the law and the aims. This thesis recommends to operationalize aims that are in essence measurable. For instance, the perception of personal data control by European citizens can be measured. Another option is to use a proxy. The amount of personal data security breaches serves as a proxy for the aim of personal data control. Fundamental rights that are associated with the aims of the legislation, such as the freedom of speech and the freedom of expression, have an intrinsic value, which cannot be operationalized. These important non measurable aims should be included separately as informative input for a democratic legislative decision making process. An effective consideration of the democratic decision making process necessitates an extensive overview of potential negative effects as well. To provide a reasonable expectation of effectiveness, an extensive study of the expected effects is recommended by means of academic literature, secondary available comparative (quantitative) analysis and expert interviews. This threefold approach, adhered in this thesis, has enhanced the knowledge about expected effects and requires further development and a wider application. As a result, a conceptual framework clarifies the effects to enhance the decision maker’s information. Before the introduction of the law, the increased information about expected positive and negative effects and non-measurable aims allows for a more enhanced discussion about the desirability of the legislation. Ideally, the expected effects of the measurable part of the legislation will be quantified in order to clarify and structure the discussion about the desirability of the law. Consequently, the discussion solely concerns normative choices about the balance between non quantifiable effects with the sum of the measurable positive effects and negative effects. After the introduction of the law, the central registration of breach notifications, surveys about the perception of the effectiveness of the law and the registration of relevant proxies are key tools to empirically measure effectiveness.

The aim of this article is to compare the measures on data breaches from the above viewpoints and highlight the relevant issues in order to reach an appropriate solution. To address the issues related to data breaches, legal rules among countries should be common to all due to the worldwide circulation of personal data. Nonetheless, different features are recognizable through the analysis in each chapter. Companies in Japan have thus far eagerly abided by data security obligations even if they are ineffective for data protection. Conducting PIAs is another option to prevent security incidents. If data breach notification rules are introduced, the subject matters to be publicized must be identified and followed by enforcement actions. Also, such rules should contribute to the avoidance of secondary harm. In the U. S., while compensations for data leakage and security breach notification rules have apparently been effectively managed, it is needed to reduce serious harm arising from massive data breach. Obliging companies to maintain data traceability might serve this. In the U.

40|$|Abstract. Existing {{access control}} systems are {{typically}} unilateral {{in that the}} enterprise service provider assigns the access rights and makes the access control decisions, {{and there is no}} negotiation between the client and the service provider. As access management systems lean towards being user-centric, unilateral approaches can no longer adequately preserve the user’s privacy, particularly where the communicating parties have no pre-existing trust relationships. Establishing sufficient trust is therefore essential before parties can exchange sensitive information. This paper describes a bilateral symmetric approach to access control which deals with privacy and confidentiality simultaneously in distributed transactions. We introduce the concept of Obligation of Trust (OoT) as a privacy assurance mechanism that is built upon the XACML standard. The OoT allows communicating parties to dynamically exchange their privacy requirements, which we term <b>Notification</b> of <b>Obligations</b> (NOB) as well as their committed obligations, which we term Signed Acceptance of Obligations (SAO). We describe some applicability of these concepts and show how they can be integrated into distributed access control systems for stricter privacy and confidentiality control. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{the notion}} of sans-papiers (undocumented migrants) has become popular both inthe media and in the vernacular to {{designate}} foreign people living on French or European territorywithout a residence permit (Morice, 2008 a). However, they do have documents, which theyregularly submit to government offices, and others which they just as frequently receive, such asacknowledgements of residence card applications, requests for supplemental applications,refusals to regularize, 1 denials {{to the right of}} asylum and <b>notifications</b> of <b>obligation</b> to leave thecountry. Consequently, the concept of ‘clandestine worker’ points to the ambiguity of theseforeign workers’ fate: not hunted down as true traffickers because they work, but never admittedwithin the so-called host society, and still regarded as deviant by the law; this is the ambivalence Iwant to address. The chapter investigates the subjectivity of the individuals who live with thisparadox daily. Even though the foreign workers’ situation is often analysed, 2 the way theyinternalize their status and the way that it structures their relationships with others remainsrelatively under-studied. I therefore address one of the internal boundaries of French society(Fassin, 2010) by highlighting the lived experiences of a stigmatized group: the sans-papiers, themigrants whose full recognition is denied by the state. I particularly aim to understand how thesemigrants, day after day, internalize this legal categorization as a part of their social identity,which in turn defines all their social relations...|$|R

The theoretical part defines what the social and legal protection for children is responsible for, how the cooperation between individual subjects work and what <b>notification</b> and information <b>obligations</b> are the subjects bound to fulfil. Attention is also paid to the tasks of OSPOD, NZDM and the role of entrusted persons in the system. The practical part is focused on three main topics. 1) Do the NZDMs have an authorisation to perform social and legal protection of children (and advantages and disadvantages associated with it) ? 2) What is the role of NZDM in the system of Child protection (With what clients they work? How can NZDMs help their clients?

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{describe}} a bilateral symmetric approach to authorization, privacy protection and obligation enforcement in distributed transactions. The authors introduce {{the concept of the}} obligation of trust (OoT) protocol as a privacy assurance and authorization mechanism that is built upon the XACML standard. The OoT allows two communicating parties to dynamically exchange their privacy and authorization requirements and capabilities, which the authors term a <b>notification</b> of <b>obligation</b> (NoB), as well as their commitments to fulfilling each other's requirements, which the authors term signed acceptance of obligations (SAO). The authors seek {{to describe}} some applicability of these concepts and to show how they can be integrated into distributed authorization systems for stricter privacy and confidentiality control. Design/methodology/approach – Existing access control and privacy protection systems are typically unilateral and provider-centric, in that the enterprise service provider assigns the access rights, makes the access control decisions, and determines the privacy policy. There is no negotiation between the client and the service provider about which access control or privacy policy to use. The authors adopt a symmetric, more user-centric approach to privacy protection and authorization, which treats the client and service provider as peers, in which both can stipulate their requirements and capabilities, and hence negotiate terms which are equally acceptable to both parties. Findings – The authors demonstrate how the obligation of trust protocol {{can be used in a}} number of different scenarios to improve upon the mechanisms that are currently available today. Practical implications – This approach will serve to increase trust in distributed transactions since each communicating party receives a difficult to repudiate digitally signed acceptance of obligations, in a standard language (XACML), which can be automatically enforced by their respective computing machinery. Originality/value – The paper adds to current research in trust negotiation, privacy protection and authorization by combining all three together into one set of standardized protocols. Furthermore, by providing hard to repudiate signed acceptance of obligations messages, this strengthens the legal case of the injured party should a dispute arise...|$|R

40|$|The {{decisions}} {{of everyday life}} are to an increasing extent made by a new deciding force: the proprietary algorithm. The information society of today is a “world of automatic decision-making”, {{as more and more}} decisions are delegated to automatic systems which are able to process data and make decisions, often with little supervision from human decision-makers. Such automated decision-making presents an interesting dichotomy of interests: the companies that develop the algorithms and data processing mechanisms have an interest in keeping them protected and hidden from competitors, while individuals {{have a vested interest in}} getting insight into, and understanding of, how decisions based on their personal data are being made. This thesis sets out to analyze this conflict, looking to answer how data protection rights to a transparent processing of personal data can be reconciled with trade secret rights in automated decision-making. The topic is studied from an EU point of view with legal dogmatism as the methodological base, and the main research question is divided into three parts corresponding with the chapters of the thesis. Firstly, the data protection rights to a transparent processing of personal data are as regards automated decision-making are reviewed. The main rights relating to the transparent processing of personal data are found in the <b>notification</b> <b>obligations,</b> access rights and safeguards relating to automated decision-making of the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation, and the rights are also collectively referred to as the “right to explanation”. The analysis in the chapter shows multiple ambiguities and gaps, leaving the scope of the rights unclear and to be further clarified in case law and through guidance by data protection authorities. The multiple requirements and the ambiguous nature of the right to an explanation results in that it allows both data subjects and trade secret holders to read the right in a favorable way to their own interests, giving rise to a significant legal uncertainty. Secondly, the trade secret rights behind automated decision-making are analyzed. Trade secret law offers a wide protection for various types of data processing algorithms and methods a private company may use in the automated processing of personal data. As regards the protection of such information in the light of data subject transparency rights, the most crucial interest of trade secret holders is to ensure that sufficient steps are taken to keep the information secret. This interest is jeopardized by the obligations on companies to meet the requirements of data subject transparency rights, since a disclosure to a large amount of data subjects could render the information generally known, losing its trade secret status. While trade secret rights may function as one of companies’ main ways of limiting the applicability of the right to explanation, the General Data Protection Regulation also makes clear that trade secret rights cannot be the base for refusing data subjects all information. Thus, data controllers must walk a fine line between meeting their data protection obligations while simultaneously keeping their data processing methods secret. Lastly, a balancing exercise is conducted in order to analyze how the conflicting rights in automated decision-making can be balanced and reconciled. The analysis of the balancing norms of the Trade Secrets Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation shows a contradictory situation that affirms both a precedence of trade secrets on data protection rights, as well as a precedence of data protection rights on trade secrets. Ultimately, a slight preference for data protection rights is seen. However, national legislation and case law on the previous right of access under the Data Protection Directive shows another reality where trade secret rights have a strong restricting factor on any transparency rights of data subjects. It remains to be seen whether the reinforced rights of the General Data Protection Regulation might embolden national legislators and courts to implement a more transparency-friendly approach in which trade secrets are given less protection when compared to the right to an explanation. Until then, the possibilities of the right to an explanation to enhance transparency in automated decision-making must be viewed with certain disbelief, due to the ambiguity of the right itself and the strong restricting nature of trade secret rights. As a consequence, solutions for reconciliation must be found elsewhere, and the thesis concludes by presenting three alternative approaches to reconciling the rights in order to enable a functioning transparency in automated decision-making...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The District of Columbia's (the District) transportation system {{is critical to the}} District's residents and businesses, the federal government, and the millions of tourists who visit the nation's capital annually. To help build and maintain its bridges and roads, the District receives federal highway funds from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). All of the District's bridges and about 30 percent of its roads are eligible for these funds; the remaining roads are maintained under the local transportation program using District funds. In 2003, the District expended a total of about $ 242 million on its bridge and road infrastructure, of which almost $ 158 million were federal-aid expenditures. To better manage its transportation services, the District reorganized its transportation infrastructure functions, creating a stand-alone Department of Transportation in 2002. According to the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), a lack of resources and inadequate attention to emerging infrastructure problems allowed local road conditions to decay to the point that in 1999, nearly 50 percent of local roads were rated fair or poor by FHWA. In addition, the District Department of Transportation's (DDOT) stakeholders believed that the organization was reactive, lacked vision, failed to communicate with citizens, and was unable to quickly respond to problems. Furthermore, we noted in 2000 that according to FHWA, the District's average processing times for transportation infrastructure design and construction contracts were lengthy [...] over 25 and 21 months, respectively, from <b>notification</b> of <b>obligation</b> ceiling to notice to proceed. To bring enhanced attention to transportation planning and management functions, as well as to improve processing times and overall performance, the Department of Transportation separated from the Department of Public Works and adopted a project management team approach to improve the planning, design, and construction of infrastructure projects. The reorganization is expected to provide more focus and leadership on transportation services and increase accountability for service delivery. A Member of Congress asked us to provide information on (1) the District's reorganization of its transportation department, (2) the department's performance measurement system, and (3) the District's use of federal-aid funds, including the average time frames for processing design and construction contracts. ...|$|R

The globalization of markets, combined with the extraordinary expansion of merger control laws over the past two decades, has resulted in an increasing number of mergers inviting multiple regulatory responses. This has {{had a significant impact on}} the complexity, time and cost associated with transnational mergers and has highlighted the differences in law, policy and procedure employed by more than 70 jurisdictions now adopting targeted merger regimes. By contrast with other areas of competition law and policy, the treatment of mergers involves a significant regulatory component, with most jurisdictions adopting ex ante <b>notification</b> and suspension <b>obligations</b> for mergers exceeding defined thresholds. The justification for this lies in the structural change to the market affected by the merging of assets, personnel and intellectual property, which are difficult to reverse. However, ex ante regulation also has the consequence of subjecting the vast majority of benign or beneficial mergers to the cost and delay associated with administrative scrutiny. This cost and delay has the potential to jeopardize time-sensitive transactions or postpone expected efficiency gains. Where markets extend beyond domestic borders, these costs are multiplied and the slowest and most prescriptive jurisdiction will influence or determine the time at which the merger can close, if at all, and on what conditions.                  <br /...|$|R
40|$|This article explores {{potential}} treaty {{defenses and}} valuation defenses for host States to mitigate or temporarily excuse non-performance of obligations owed to investors during economic emergencies, {{arising from the}} host State's good faith performance of obligations under the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Defenses under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), such as the lex posterior rule of application of treaties in Article 30 or treaty interpretation in Article 31, are of limited utility for avoiding primary breaches of the investment treaty, since these defenses considerably depend upon the host State's a priori <b>notification</b> of ICESCR <b>obligations</b> to investors {{at the time of}} the establishment of the investment. Lacking these revisions to the due diligence process, it is submitted that a host State can advance a more pragmatic defense by proposing equitable adjustments in the valuation of compensation, taking into account the host State's good faith performance of ICESCR obligations. Adjustments are justifiable and appropriate, since tribunals tend to accept an unrealistic definition of the fair market value' standard, based on market assumptions of perfect competition, for pre-crisis valuations of investments. The bloating of the pre-crisis valuation of an investment thus tends to increase its ultimate differential with the post-crisis valuation of an investment, leading to damage assessments beyond what parties could ordinarily have foreseen from the investment contract. While tribunals have predominantly referred to 'compensation' within the general law of international responsibility, they have problematically neglected the counterpart practice of equitable adjustment within this legal regime...|$|R
