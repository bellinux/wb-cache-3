40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{evidence of}} <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (NO) in decidual biopsies and fetal membranes of preeclamptic women. BACKGROUND: <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> a potent vasodilator, has been postulated {{to have a}} role in the etiology of preeclampsia. Investigations in peripheral blood have led to conflicting results. We therefore decided to study whether immunohistochemically detectable <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> is produced in the decidua and within the fetal membranes. METHODS: Forty-two pregnant women at 28 weeks gestation or more were enrolled. Twenty were normotensive and 22 had preeclampsia. Women with chronic hypertension, diabetes and multiple pregnancies were excluded. Maternal blood samples prior to cesarean section (CS), decidual biopsies during CS, and fetal membrane specimens were obtained. The tissue specimens were fixed immediately (after delivery of the baby and placenta) in formalin, washed, and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemical staining for <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthases</b> (NOS) I, II, III was performed and reviewed in conjunction with routine hematoxylin and eosin sections, using light microscopy. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the level of immunostaining of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthases</b> in both normotensive and hypertensive patients.

40|$|Proteoglycan {{production}} {{is one of}} the major extracellular matrix components implicated in the dynamic process of intervertebral disc degeneration. Mechanical stress is an important modulator of the degeneration, but the underlying molecular mechanism at the proteoglycan level remains unclear. The aim of this work was to study the regulation of proteoglycan production by cyclic tensile stretch applied to intervertebral disc annulus fibrosus cells. Matrix metalloproteinases do not seem to be implicated in the regulation of proteoglycan production. By contrast, nitrite oxide {{production is}} induced by cyclic tensile stretch, in a time, intensity, and frequency dependant manner. Using a non-specific <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthases</b> inhibitor [NG-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMA) ], we suppress totally the inhibition of proteoglycan production induced by cyclic tensile stretch suggesting the implication of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthases</b> in the observed phenomenon.

The present work focuses on the molecular docking analysis of quercetin and its analogues against iNOS enzyme. Earlier there are reports of quercetin inhibiting iNOS enzyme in certain experiments as anti cancer agent. But the clinical use of quercetin is limited by its low oral bioavailability and therefore needed its molecular modification to improve its pharmacological properties.

25|$|Nitric oxide is also {{generated}} by phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) {{as part of}} the human immune response.

In this way, the immune system may regulate the armamentarium of phagocytes that play a role in inflammation and immune responses. Nitric oxide is secreted as free radicals in an immune response and is toxic to bacteria and intracellular parasites, including Leishmania and malaria; the mechanism for this includes DNA damage and degradation of iron sulfur centers into iron ions and iron-nitrosyl compounds.|$|E

For the body to generate nitric oxide through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (by nitrate reductase, a bacterial enzyme) occurs in the mouth, by commensal bacteria, an obligatory and necessary step. Monitoring nitric oxide status by saliva testing detects the bioconversion of plant-derived nitrate into nitric oxide. A rise in salivary levels is indicative of diets rich in leafy vegetables which are often abundant in anti-hypertensive diets such as the DASH diet.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) {{deficiency}} can {{be detrimental}} to the vascular function after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMIs can lead to cardiac dysfunction through two distinct changes; increased oxidative stress via free radical accumulation and decreased NO bioavailability. Free radical accumulation occurs due to increased electron transport uncoupling at the active site of endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> (eNOS), an enzyme involved in converting L-arginine to NO. During an AMI, oxidative degradation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor in NO production, limits BH4 availability and limits NO productionby eNOS. Instead, eNOS reacts with oxygen, another cosubstrates involved in NO production. The products of eNOS are reduced to superoxides, increasing free radical production and oxidative stress within the cells. A H2S deficiency impairs eNOS activity by limiting Akt activation and inhibiting Akt phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site. Instead, Akt activity is increased to phosphorylate the eNOST495 inhibition site, downregulating eNOS production of NO.|$|E

This study aimed at detection of the role of both inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthases</b> (iNOS) and endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthases</b> (eNOS) expression in diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy patients. MethodologyRenal biopsies and clinical data of 30 diabetic patients, 10 nondiabetic patients with renal impairment, and 10 control individuals were assessed for eNOS and iNOS expression. Results Both glomerular eNOS and iNOS expression levels were increased in diabetic nephropathy patients and this was associated with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. In nondiabetic patients, increased serum creatinine was found to be associated with increased iNOS and eNOS expression, and, together with the control group, they showed increased iNOS expression in tubular and interstitial cells. An association between cigarette smoking and increased expression of both iNOS and eNOS was detected in diabetic patients. Conclusion The presence of iNOS is associated with tubular damage resulting in renal failure. The upregulation of NO in diabetes mellitus type 2 may explain the endothelial dysfunction that is associated with almost all diabetic complications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} significant {{cause of death in}} postmenopausal women. The loss of estrogen biosynthesis with advanced age is suggested as one of the major causes of higher CVD in postmenopausal women. While some studies show beneficial effects of estrogen therapy (ET) /hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) in the cardiovascular system of healthy postmenopausal women, similar studies in diabetic counterparts contradict these findings. In particular, ET/HRT in diabetic postmenopausal women results in a seemingly detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system. In this review, the comparative role of estrogens is discussed in the context of CVD in both healthy and diabetic postmenopausal women in regard to the synthesis or expression of proinflammatory molecules like advanced glycation end products (AGEs), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGEs), inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthases</b> (iNOS) and the anti-inflammatory endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthases</b> (eNOS). The interaction of AGE–RAGE signaling with molecular <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (NO) may determine the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and influence the overall redox status of the vascular microenvironment that may further determine the ultimate outcome of the effects of estrogens on the CVD in healthy versus diabetic women...|$|R

25|$|Metal ions {{are common}} cofactors. The study of these cofactors {{falls under the}} area of bioinorganic chemistry.

Although chromium deficiency causes impaired glucose tolerance, no human enzyme that uses this metal as a cofactor has been identified. Iodine is also an essential trace element, but this element is used {{as part of the}} structure of thyroid hormones rather than as an enzyme cofactor. Calcium is another special case, in that it is required as a component of the human diet, and it is needed for the full activity of many enzymes, such as <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase,</b> protein phosphatases, and adenylate kinase, but calcium activates these enzymes in allosteric regulation, often binding to these enzymes in a complex with calmodulin.

25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation was studied by Li H. et al. (2008). They {{showed that in}} spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) non-selective NSAIDs and the coxibs produce oxidative stress, indicated by enhanced vascular superoxide(O2−) content and elevated peroxide in plasma, which is in tune with enhanced expression of NADPH oxidase, which was noticed with use of diclofenac and naproxen and, to a lesser degree, rofecoxib and celecoxib. Nitrite in plasma was also decreased suggesting a diminished synthesis of vascular nitric oxide (NO). This decrease in NO synthesis did not result from decreased expression of endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> (eNOS) because expression of eNOS mRNA was not reduced, and even upregulated for some products. The decrease in NO synthesis could, rather, be explained by loss of eNOS function. For eNOS to be normally functional, it needs to form a dimer and to have its cofactor BH4, {{which is one of}} the most potent naturally occurring reducing agents. BH4 is sensitive to oxidation by peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which is produced when NO reacts with O2−, so it has been hypothesized that depletion of BH4 can occur with excessive oxidative stress (that can be caused be NSAIDs) and, hence, be the cause of eNOS dysfunction. This dysfunction, which is referred to as eNOS uncoupling, causes the production of O2− by eNOS, thereby leading to more oxidative stress produced by eNOS. In a study, both the selective COX-2 inhibitors and the non-selective NSAIDs produced oxidative stress, with greater effects seen with non-selective NSAIDs use. This could fit with the hypothesis concerning the prostacyclin/thromboxane imbalance. That is, although the non-selective NSAIDs produce more oxidative stress, they prevent platelet aggregation, whereas the COX-2 inhibitors reduce prostacyclin production, and, hence, the cardiovascular risk for the non-selective NSAIDs is not higher than for the coxibs.|$|E
