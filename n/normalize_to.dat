5000|$|The {{information}} {{distance is}} absolute, {{but if we}} want to express similarity, then we are more interested in relative ones.

Hence we need to <b>normalize</b> <b>to</b> obtain a similarity metric.

50|$|The {{first part}} of the book {{discusses}} regeneration, primarily in salamanders and frogs. Becker studied regeneration after lesions such as limb amputation, and hypothesized that electric fields {{played an important role in}} controlling the regeneration process. He mapped the electric potentials at various body parts during the regeneration, showing that the central part of the body normally was positive, and the limbs were negative. When a limb of a salamander or frog was amputated, the voltage at the cut (measured relative to the central part of the body) changed from about -10 mV (millivolts) to +20 mV or more the next day—a phenomenon called the current of injury. In a frog, the voltage would simply change to the normal negative level in four weeks or so, and no limb regeneration would take place. In a salamander, however, the voltage would during the first two weeks change from the +20 mV to -30 mV, and then <b>normalize</b> (<b>to</b> -10 mV) during the next two weeks—and the limb would be regenerated.|$|E
