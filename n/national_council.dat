This dissertation deals with the functions of the five <b>national</b> <b>councils</b> for disabled persons, namely the councils for the blind, the deaf, the mentally handicapped, the physically handicapped and persons suffering from epilepsy. More specifically, the objectives of the research which preceded the writing of the dissertation were the following: to explore the functions of the five <b>national</b> <b>councils</b> for disabled persons. to construe the functions of the five <b>national</b> <b>councils</b> for disabled persons as management functions. to use Zetterberg's conceptual framework for scientific theorizing in an analysis of the functions. to determine how the status, objectives and functions of the aforementioned <b>national</b> <b>councils</b> may be made more purposeful. A literature study was undertaken to determine to what extent organisational and management theories are relevant to the <b>national</b> <b>councils...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the meantime, however, {{peace talks}} between the warring factions continued, with the First Paris Peace Conference on Cambodia held in Paris in 1989. On 26 February 1990, {{following}} the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting was held, at which the Supreme <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> was established to safeguard Cambodian sovereignty. Initially, the Supreme <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> was to have 12 members, with three seats allocated to each faction of the CGDK, and three to the pro-Vietnam Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party. However, Hun Sen objected to the proposed arrangement, calling instead for each faction of the CGDK to be given two seats {{for a total of}} six, and the Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party to have six seats. In 1991 the Supreme <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> began representing Cambodia at the UN General Assembly. Then, in a bold move, Hun Sen renamed the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party to the Cambodian People's Party in an effort to portray his party as a democratic institution and renounce its revolutionary struggle.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Béla H. Bánáthy, Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the Monterey Bay Area Council, {{formulated}} {{the idea}} of an experimental leadership training program. He named it White Stag Leadership Development after the white stag of Hungarian mythology, the emblem of the Fourth World Scout Jamboree, which Bela had attended when he was 14 years old. With the active interest and support of the Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board, Bela continually improved his experimental program. In 1963 Maury Tripp and Fran Peterson were working closely with Bela. They also served on the <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> of the Boy Scouts of America and brought the White Stag program to their attention. In November 1963, Dr. John W. Larson, a staff researcher for the <b>National</b> <b>Council,</b> observed the program's annual Indaba at the Presidio of Monterey. Impressed with what he witnessed, he recommended that the national office conduct a detailed analysis of the White Stag program.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Thurman {{founded the}} Aframerican Women’s Journal, the first {{publishing}} vehicle of the <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> of Negro Women (NCNW), which she edited from 1940 until 1944. In 1941, an archive committee {{was formed to}} design a plan for collecting works about the achievements of African-American women. Though their plans focused primarily on written records and professional accomplishment and would thus reflect middle-class life, the committee initiated work on collecting historical records of black women. In 1944, Thurman became the committee's chair and her mother donated $1,000 toward creating the <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> of Negro Women's National Library, Archives, and Museum. On June 30, 1946, they held an archive drive, printing notices in newsletters and asking ministers, organizations, librarians and others to help them acquire photographs, books and mementos.

Among the prominent {{members of the board}} were Albert Jolis and Jeane Kirkpatrick while Midge Decter, Yuri Yarim-Agaev, Richard Perle, Saul Bellow, Robert Conquest and Martin Colman were on the body's advisory committee. The Foundation aimed to be a coordinating centre for dissident and democratic movements seeking to overturn communism in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. It organised protests in the communist countries and in the West, and opposed western financial assistance to communist governments. The Foundation also created the <b>National</b> <b>Council</b> to Support Democratic Movements (<b>National</b> <b>Council</b> for Democracy) with the goal of aiding the emergence of democratic rule-of-law governments, and providing assistance with the writing of constitutions and the formation of civil institutions.|$|E
