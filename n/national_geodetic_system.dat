40|$|The Battle of Vimy Ridge was a {{military}} engagement between the Canadian Corps and the German Empire during the Great War (1914 - 1918). In this battle, Canadian troops fought as a single unit and won the day. It marked an important point in Canadian history as a nation. The year 2017 marks the centenary of this battle. In commemoration of this event, the Pas-de-Calais Departmental Council financed a 3 D recording mission {{for one of the}} underground tunnels (souterraines) used as refuge by the Canadian soldiers several weeks prior to the battle. A combination of Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) and close-range photogrammetry techniques was employed in order to document not only the souterraine, but also the various carvings and graffitis created by the soldiers on its walls. The resulting point clouds were registered to the French <b>national</b> <b>geodetic</b> <b>system,</b> and then meshed and textured {{in order to create a}} precise 3 D model of the souterraine. In this paper, the workflow taken during the project as well as several results will be discussed. In the end, the resulting 3 D model was used to create derivative products such as maps, section profiles, and also virtual visit videos. The latter helps the dissemination of the 3 D information and thus aids in the preservation of the memory of the Great War for Canada...|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the system of land {{administration}} and the field of public national spatial data infrastructure in Slovenia and Iceland, which are among the smaller European countries regarding the geographical dimension and number of inhabitants. This requires an adjustment {{of the system of}} public administration, including the areas of <b>national</b> <b>geodetic</b> service and <b>system</b> of spatial planning, as discussed in the thesis.

Within the study practice at the Icelandic National Agency for Spatial Planning (Skipulagsstofnun) in Reykjavik I have obtained information on organisation of national surveying and mapping service, spatial planning and spatial data infrastructure. Based on interviews and conversations with the responsible for each field in competent Icelandic institutions and on the basis of studies of available literature, we have studies the regulation of study fields in Slovenia and Iceland. Content of the thesis is divided into several chapters, which present administrative regulation, responsible ministries, institutions and organizations operating in the study fields in both countries. The work includes presentation of spatial data infrastructure and implementation of INSPIRE directive in both countries, <b>national</b> <b>geodetic</b> reference <b>systems,</b> basic spatial data as well as land data within land administration system.

This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the currently used transformation parameters from different sources in the region, and give preliminary recommendations for using these sets also. The differences between transformed, original and WGS- 84 coordinates were calculated and evaluated.

40|$|Surveying and mapping {{activities}} {{consist of}} geodetic measurements and observations, mapping {{as well as}} of other works and procedures required for registering data on real estate and space, for identifying property line locations and for technical purposes. The competence of the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia comprises the mandated duties of the <b>national</b> <b>geodetic</b> service which include creation, administration and updating of databases related to the basic <b>geodetic</b> <b>system,</b> registration of real estate, state border, spatial units and house numbers, and to the topographic and cartographic system. Apart from mandated duties having been implemented traditionally and at a high-level of expertise (also in the field of engineering geodesy), the <b>national</b> <b>geodetic</b> service has also been increasingly adapting to user needs by providing quality products and services. The new legislation and user needs provide guidance to the surveying and mapping profession, and its development, and they require adjustment to new areas of expertise. The greatest challenges in the current year can be used as opportunities in terms of participation in managing physical planning on municipal level, creating new spatial databases, supporting subsidies in agriculture, introducing mass real estate valuation and by taking part in European projects...|$|R

50|$|The current {{geodetic}} {{model of}} the earth used in the US is the North American Datum 1983, often called NAD83. The system is used to define horizontal co-ordinates of reference markers all over the US. Although created as a geocentric datum which originates {{at the center of}} the earth, more recent models of the earth have shown the origin to be 2.2 m off the centre of the earth. Elevation is recorded against the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD 88), which uses as its origin point Father Point, in Quebec, Canada. Error in the system is approximately 0.5 mm per mile, resulting in a total error of approximately 1 m from one corner of the continental US to the other. Due to these developments, the <b>National</b> <b>Geodetic</b> Survey is working on new <b>geodetic</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
