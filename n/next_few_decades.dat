40|$|Field {{investigations}} {{of an ancient}} fortress wall in southern Myanmar reveal an offset of ~ 6 m across the Sagaing fault, the major right-lateral fault between the Sunda and Burma plates. The fault slip rate implied by offset of this 16 th-century fortress is between 11 and 18 cm yr^(– 1). A palaeoseismological excavation within the fortress reveals at least two major fault ruptures since its construction. The slip rate we obtained is comparable to geodetic and geological estimates farther north, but is only 50 per cent of the spreading rate (38 mm yr^(– 1)) at the Andaman Sea spreading centre. This disparity suggests that other structures may be accommodating deformation within the Burma Plate. We propose two fault-slip scenarios to explain the earthquake-rupture history of the southern Sagaing fault. Using both small offset features along the fault trace and historical records, we speculate that the southern Sagaing fault exhibits a uniform-fault-slip behaviour and that {{one section of the}} fault could generate a M 7 + earthquake within the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>decade...</b>|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{population}} and socio-economic development have put great pressure on water {{resources of the}} Yellow River (YR) basin. The anticipated climate and socio-economic changes may further increase water stress. Many studies have investigated the changes in renewable water resources under various climate change scenarios, but few have considered the joint pressure from both climate change and socio-economic development. In this study, we assess water scarcity under various socio-economic pathways with emphasis {{on the impact of}} water scarcity on food production. The water demands in the 21 st century are estimated based on the newly developed shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and renewable water supply is estimated using the climate projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)   8. 5 scenario. The assessment predicts that the renewable water resources would decrease slightly then increase. The domestic and industrial water withdrawals are projected to increase in the <b>next</b> a <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> and then remain at the high level or decrease slightly during the 21 st century. The increase in water withdrawals will put the middle and lower reaches in a condition of severe water scarcity beginning in the <b>next</b> a <b>few</b> <b>decades.</b> If 40  % of the renewable water resources were used to sustain ecosystems, a portion of irrigated land would have to be converted to rain-fed agriculture, which would lead to a 2 – 11  % reduction in food production. This study highlights the links between water, food and ecosystems in a changing environment and suggests that trade-offs should be considered when developing regional adaptation strategies...|$|R
