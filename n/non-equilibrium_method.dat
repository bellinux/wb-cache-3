The key-step consists of physically framing the computational strategy of "total energy morphing'', recently presented by us as an efficient implementation of the JE [M. Zerbetto, A. Piserchia, D.

Chem., 2014, 35, 1865 - 1881], in terms of build-up of the real thermodynamic state of a bulk material from the corresponding ideal state, in which the particles are non-interacting. In this context, the JE machinery yields the excess free energy versus suitably chosen controlled state variables, whose thermodynamic derivatives eventually lead to the equation of state. As an explanatory case study, we apply the methodology to derive the equation of state of gaseous methane by constructing the Helmholtz free energy versus the particle density (at fixed temperature) and then evaluating the thermodynamic derivative with respect to the volume.

40|$|The Jarzynski {{equality}} (JE), which relates {{works of}} non-equilibrium trajectories {{to the free}} energy difference of the initial and final states of the non-equilibrium process, provides {{an efficient way to}} calculate free energies of systems in simulations and experiments. However, wider applications of the JE are limited by the requirement that the initial distribution of non-equilibrium trajectories must be equilibrium. Here we extend the JE to a matrix form, the Jarzynski matrix equality (JME), which transforms the free energies of metastable conformational regions in the initial system to that of final one. Therefore, we can calculate the free energies from non-equilibrium trajectories which started from an arbitrary initial distribution.

Using Medflies as an example, we present a new approach to invasion genetics that measures DNA sequence variation within introns from multiple nuclear loci. These loci are so variable that even relatively recently founded Medfly populations within California and Hawaii retain ample genetic diversity. Invading populations have only lost 35 % of the ancestral genetic variation.

Modifications to the dispersion relation are calculated directly with MD methods at high temperature. The {{results indicate that the}} dispersion relation starts to change for very thin films, at around two nanometers. The reasons are band folding and phonon confinement. Thermal resistivity is analyzed by the direct <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>method,</b> and the results are compared to kinetic theory with modified dispersion relations. Thermal resistivity is affected by both surface scattering and dispersion. Moreover, in thin films, the characteristic vibrational frequency decreases, which in standard anharmonic scattering models indicates a longer relaxation time and affects the resistivity. The results indicate that in very thin films, the resistivity becomes highly anisotropic due to differences in surface scattering.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of hydrogen with metals has great environmental significance in problems {{ranging from the}} catastrophic failure of materials due to hydrogen embrittlement to safe and efficient storage of hydrogen as a metal hydride. Chromium (Cr) is widely used as an alloying agent to produce materials such as stainless steel and as an electroplated coating on materials to prevent corrosion and to minimize wear. Hydrogen which co-deposits with chromium during electroplating forms hexagonal close packed CrH or face centered cubic CrH 2 which cracks the deposit. The behavior of hydrogen in Cr, especially the crystal structure modifications of metal Cr when it is exposed to hot, dense hydrogen gas is not completely understood. In equilibrium study, chromium hydride has been found of hexagonal close packed structure under 400 Â°C with high hydrogen pressure. Experiments at higher temperatures are limited by the equipment and technology. This dissertation describes a novel, <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>method</b> which was used to synthesize a new chromium hydride phase. Single crystal, body centered cubic Cr thin films were prepared by vacuum evaporation. These films were exposed to high temperature (close to the melting point of Cr), high pressure hydrogen gas in a ballistic compressor. This was followed by rapid cooling (3 ̆e 105 ËšC/s) to room temperature. Using the transmission electron microscope (TEM), second phase particles of superhexagonal structure, which has lattice constant A= 4. 77 Ã… and C/A= 1. 84, {{are found in the}} films. This structure has a volume per Cr atom slightly larger than that of hexagonal closed packed CrH, so that the superhexagonal structure may contain more hydrogen than the hexagonal close packed CrH. The superhexagonal particles have a definite orientation relationship with the matrix: [021][subscript sh] II [OOl][subscript b] and (212) [subscript sh] II (IIO) [subscript]b. The superhexagonal structure is quite stable in air and at room temperature, but decomposes to body centered cubic Cr when heated by the electron beam illumination in the TEM. No such particles were observed in Cr films exposed to pure argon under similar conditions in the ballistic compressor. Positive identification of hydrogen content was obtained by high-temperature vacuum extraction in a discharge tube. After vacuum extraction, hydrogen spectrum was observed, and the intensity of electron diffraction from superhexagonal structure decreased. Using an energy dispersive spectrometer with the capability of detecting elements down to atomic number six (carbon), no changes in composition of the films were found by comparing the characteristic x-ray spectra of the same film before and after exposure to hot, dense hydrogen in the ballistic compressor.

40|$|Significant {{differences}} exist among literature for thermal conductivity of various systems computed using molecular dynamics simulation. In some cases, unphysical results, for example, negative thermal conductivity, have been found. Using GaN {{as an example}} case and the direct <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>method,</b> extensive molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo analysis of {{the results have been}} carried out to quantify the uncertainty level of the molecular dynamics methods and to identify the conditions that can yield sufficiently accurate calculations of thermal conductivity. We found that the errors of the calculations are mainly due to the statistical thermal fluctuations. Extrapolating results to the limit of an infinite-size system tend to magnify the errors and occasionally lead to unphysical results. The error in bulk estimates can be reduced by performing longer time averages using properly selected systems over a range of sample lengths. If the errors in the conductivity estimates associated with each of the sample lengths are kept below a certain threshold, the likelihood of obtaining unphysical bulk values becomes insignificant. Using a Monte-Carlo approach developed here, we have determined the probability distributions for the bulk thermal conductivities obtained using the direct method.
