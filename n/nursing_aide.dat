40|$|<b>Nurse</b> <b>aides</b> {{provide the}} {{majority}} of care to patients in nursing homes and thus are vital links in the early identification and treatment of agitation in dementia. Agitation increases in frequency as dementia progresses and unrecognized and untreated agitation may develop {{into a state of}} acute aggression (termed catastrophic reaction) in which demented patients become severely disturbed and may harm themselves or others. <b>Nurse</b> <b>aides,</b> however, are sometimes characterized as unable or unwilling to provide accurate observations of demented patients’ behavior, and thus are incapable of assisting with this important research. This study examined a process by which <b>nurse</b> <b>aides</b> were enlisted to identify and rate agitation in late stage dementia patients. Results indicate that <b>nurse</b> <b>aides</b> accurately identified agitation at a high level of agreement (r = >. 90), on three occasions, with nurse experts. This high level of agreement was achieved along {{with a high level of}} <b>nurse</b> <b>aide</b> participation (75 percent), and with relatively little training time, i. e., approximately one hour per <b>nurse</b> <b>aide.</b> There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of aides participating versus those declining participation; likewise, participation rates in unionized versus non-unionized homes were not significantly different. The characteristics of the training program are described and the opinions of both <b>nurse</b> <b>aides</b> and administrators discussed as to why this program was successful...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{main purpose}} of this study was to discuss the {{nationality}} differences of foreign <b>nurse</b> <b>aides</b> and the effect of work stressors influencing work adjustment. And of helping them adapt to Taiwanese society, we summarized the difficulties that foreign <b>nurse</b> <b>aides</b> face in Taiwan. Methods The subjects included 80 foreign <b>nurse</b> <b>aides</b> from the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam who worked in long-term care facilities in Tao Yuan County. We recruited volunteers at the participating facilities to complete the anonymous questionnaires. The return rate of the questionnaire was 88. 75 %. The validated instruments of Hershenson's (1981) and Schaefer and Moos (1993) were adopted to measure work stressors and work adjustment, respectively. A forward-backward translation process was used in this study. Results Indonesian foreign <b>nurse</b> <b>aides</b> respect their work, and are better workers than Vietnamese and Filipino nurse aids in many respects, which shows how the nationality of the foreign <b>nurse</b> <b>aides</b> might affect work adjustment. The stress created from patient care tasks influenced the foreign nurse aides' personal relationships at work and also affected their attitude when they performed their tasks. In addition, pressure from their supervisors might have affected their work skills, work habits, personal relationships, self-concepts or work attitudes. Moreover, a heavy workload and improper scheduling might have affected the personal relationships and work attitudes of the foreign <b>nurse</b> <b>aides.</b> It was found that work stressors had a significant correlation with work adjustment. Conclusions The results of the present study indicate that training programs are important factors for work adjustment among foreign <b>nurse</b> <b>aides.</b> Furthermore, celebration and leisure activities could be provided to release them from work stressors. More effort should be put into improving the working environment, namely providing a more supportive and enriching atmosphere. Based on these findings, we have a better understanding of how to assist foreign <b>nurse</b> <b>aides</b> in the future. </p...|$|R

To date, there is limited information about how the physical and postural demands vary across different shifts—different lengths and times. Fifty-four <b>nursing</b> <b>aides</b> from local long-term health care facilities were observed for an entire shift to document the whole body postural response and physical activities.

40|$|Older {{persons with}} mental disorders, {{excluding}} dementia disorders, constitute a vulnerable group of people. With the future international {{increase in the}} older population, mental disorders will increase as well, thus entailing new challenges for their caregivers. These older persons often remain in their own homes, and in Sweden they are cared for by <b>nursing</b> <b>aides.</b> With little previous research, an increased workload and facing new strenuous situations, {{it is important to}} make use of the knowledge the <b>nursing</b> <b>aides</b> possess and to deepen the understanding of their experiences. The study aimed at illuminating the meaning of caring for older persons with mental disorders as experienced by <b>nursing</b> <b>aides</b> in the municipal home help service. Interviews with nine female <b>nursing</b> <b>aides</b> were performed and analysed with a phenomenological hermeneutical research method inspired by the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur. Being altruistically egoistic emerged as a main theme in the nursing aides&#x 2019; narratives. The nursing aides&#x 2019; experiences could be interpreted as a movement between being altruistic and egoistic. The findings revealed a continuous distancing by the <b>nursing</b> <b>aides</b> and their struggle to redress the balance between their altruistic and egoistic actions. Caring for these older persons constitutes a complex situation where distancing functions as a recourse to prioritize oneself and to diminish the value of caring. The study suggests that an increased knowledge base on older persons with mental disorders, followed by continuous supervision, is necessary for the <b>nursing</b> <b>aides</b> to improve the quality of the care given...|$|R

Second, how the safety culture of nursing homes varied according to facility characteristics and market charac-teristics was examined. Methods. Data came from 72 nursing homes and 1579 <b>Nurse</b> <b>Aides</b> (response rate of 55 %). From these <b>nursing</b> homes, <b>Nurse</b> <b>Aides</b> completed The Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) instrument, a previously validated survey with 12 subscales used to assess safety culture. The nursing home scores from this instrument were compared with the hospital scores. Ordinary least squares regression {{was used to examine}} the association between nine nursing home facility characteristics and two market characteristics and the overall safety culture score. Results. All of the 12 HSOPSC subscale scores from the nursing home sample were considerably lower than the benchmark hospital scores, indicating a less well-developed safety culture. The significant facility and market characteristics from the regression analysis resembled many of those found when similar characteristics are used in examinations of quality. Conclusions. These results are important in clearly showing that {{the resident}} safety culture of <b>Nurse</b> <b>Aides</b> in many <b>nursing</b> homes may be poorly developed...|$|R
