It accepts a format string, which {{specifies}} methods for formatting items, {{and a list}} of items to be formatted. Named for the intention of printing to a printer, it actually outputs to stdout. Characters in the format string are copied to the output or, if a % is encountered, are used to format an item. In addition to the standard formats, %b causes printf to expand backslash escape sequences (for example \n for newline) and %q outputs an item that can be used as shell input.

5000|$|If a new key, {{other than}} the <b>null</b> <b>string,</b> is {{inserted}} into a leaf node of the trie, then the computer {{can go to the}} last preceding node where there was a key or a bifurcation to perform a depth-first search to find the lexicographic successor or predecessor of the inserted key for the purpose of splicing the new key into the circularly linked list. The last preceding node where there was a key or a bifurcation, a fork in the path, is a parent node in the type of trie shown here, where only unique string prefixes are represented as paths in the trie. If there is already a key associated with the parent node that would have been visited during a movement away from the root during a right-hand, forward-moving, depth-first traversal, then that immediately ends the depth-first search, as that key is the predecessor of the inserted key. For example, if Bashful is inserted into the trie, then the predecessor is the <b>null</b> <b>string</b> in the parent node, which is the root node in this case. In other words, if the key that is being inserted is on the leftmost branch of the parent node, then any string contained in the parent node is the lexicographic predecessor of the key that is being inserted, else the lexicographic predecessor of the key that is being inserted exists down the parent node's branch that is immediately {{to the left of the}} branch where the new key is being inserted. For example, if Grumpy were the last key inserted into the trie, then the computer would have a choice of trying to find either the predecessor, Dopey, or the successor, Happy, with a depth-first search starting from the parent node of Grumpy. With no additional information to indicate which path is longer, the computer might traverse the longer path, D, O, P. If Dopey were the last key inserted into the trie, then the depth-first search starting from the parent node of Dopey would soon find the predecessor, [...] "Doc", because that would be the only choice.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the <b>null</b> <b>string</b> {{origin of the}} ambitwistor string. Classically, the <b>null</b> <b>string</b> is the tensionless limit of string theory, and so too is the Ambitwistor string. Both have as {{constraint}} algebra the Galilean Conformal Algebra in two dimensions. But something interesting happens in the quantum theory since there is an ambiguity in quantizing the <b>null</b> <b>string.</b> We show that, given a particular choice of quantization scheme and a particular gauge, the <b>null</b> <b>string</b> coincides with the ambitwistor string both classically and quantum mechanically. We also show that the same holds for the spinning versions of the <b>null</b> <b>string</b> and Ambitwistor string.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the string {{conformal}} anomaly is studied in detail. We use a reformulated string Lagrangian which allows to consider the string tension $T_{ 0 }$ as a small perturbation. The expansion parameter is the worldsheet speed of light c, which is proportional to $T_{ 0 }$. We examine carefully the interplay between a <b>null</b> (tensionless) <b>string</b> and a tensionful string which includes orders $ c^{ 2 } $ and higher. The conformal algebra generated by the constraints is considered. At the quantum level the normal ordering provides a central charge proportional to $ c^{ 2 } $. Thus {{it is clear that}} quantum <b>null</b> <b>strings</b> respect conformal invariance and it is the string tension which generates the conformal anomaly. Comment: More references are included.
