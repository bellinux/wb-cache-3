40|$|This {{research}} examines investment behavior within industries {{characterized by}} <b>network</b> <b>economies.</b> That is, industries {{in which the}} value of a product to consumers increases with the number of other consumers that purchase compatible products. I analyze indirect <b>network</b> <b>economies</b> by investigating the ability of firms, producing complementary products, to coordinate investment decisions over time. I also investigate the influence of direct <b>network</b> <b>economies</b> on the quantity-setting strategies of a durable good monopolist. When networks are present an incumbent technology has an advantage over an entrant, due to the value consumers place on an installed network of compatibility. This network can hinder the adoption of an innovation. Within industries characterized by indirect networks, strategic interdependencies exist as firms, who produce complementary products, invest in innovative technologies. Diffusion of innovations requires coordination, so that a new product might appear on the market accompanied by a minimal network of compatible complementary products. Game theoretic techniques are used to model this coordination process as it evolves over time. To determine if observed behavior is consistent with Nash refinements of selection among Pareto-rankable Nash equilibrium paths, economic experiments were conducted. The experimental data reveals that in a time-dependent multi-stage coordination game, subjects are unable to focus on the Pareto-dominant Nash equilibrium (PDNE) strategy path. However, given repetition subjects converge toward it. The data show that a higher cost of exiting the existing technology or a higher level of strategic uncertainty decreases the level of coordination on the PDNE strategy path. I also investigate the impact of a network parameter on a durable good monopolist's quantity-setting strategies. This two-period model reveals that the presence of <b>network</b> <b>economies</b> increases prices in both periods. Thus, the monopolist's profits increase relative to a model without <b>network</b> <b>economies.</b> Finally, I discuss how the combination of durability and <b>network</b> <b>economies</b> affect investment in incompatible product upgrades. When <b>network</b> <b>economies</b> exist, a firm must anticipate the interdependencies and uncertainties that exist among consumers. Thus, if sufficient demand for product quality exists relative to demand for network benefits, diffusion of the innovation should occur...|$|R

50|$|The <b>network</b> <b>economy</b> is the {{emerging}} economic order within the information society. The name {{stems from a}} key attribute - products and services are created and value is added through social networks operating on large or global scales.

Business models for capturing ownership rights for value embedded in products and services created by social networks are being explored.|$|E
50|$|Kelly (1998) {{states that}} in a <b>network</b> <b>economy,</b> value is created and shared by all members of a network rather than by {{individual}} companies and that economies of scale stem from {{the size of the}} network - not the enterprise. Similarly, because value flows from connectivity, Boyett and Boyett (2001) point out that an open system is preferable to a closed system because the former typically have more nodes. They also indicate that such networks are blurring the boundaries between a company and its environment.|$|E
