5|$|On 9 July 2015, the FDA {{toughened}} {{warnings of}} increased {{heart attack and}} stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<b>NSAID).</b> Aspirin is an <b>NSAID</b> but is not affected by the new warnings.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer <b>NSAID</b> drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an <b>NSAID</b> or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims {{to compare}} use {{and costs of}} anti-secretory and {{cardiovascular}} co-medication in osteoarthritis patients treated with selective or non-selective <b>NSAIDs.</b> METHOD: A retrospective study examined Belgian patients aged 65 years or more who suffer from osteoarthritis and are chronic users of selective <b>NSAIDs</b> (n = 1, 376) or non-selective <b>NSAIDs</b> (n = 8, 482). A before-and-after analysis compared drug use and costs between period 1 (first 6 months of 2002) and period 2 (several 1 -year periods stretching over 2003 - 2004). A cohort analysis contrasted patients taking selective <b>NSAIDs</b> with patients taking non-selective <b>NSAIDs.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anti-secretory co-medication included histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. Cardiovascular co-medication referred to cardiac glycosides, anti-arrhythmics, anti-thrombotics, anti-angina drugs, anti-hypertensive drugs and serum-lipid-reducing drugs. Volume of drug use was expressed as number of packages and costs were computed in Euro. RESULTS: The volume of anti-secretory co-medication increased by 36 % with selective <b>NSAIDs</b> and by 55 % with non-selective <b>NSAIDs</b> between periods 1 and 2. Cardiovascular co-medication rose by 18 % with selective <b>NSAIDs</b> and by 12 % for non-selective <b>NSAIDs.</b> Focusing on patients who did not take anti-secretory co-medication in period 1, patients taking selective <b>NSAIDs</b> were {{just as likely to}} start anti-secretory co-medication in period 2 as patients taking non-selective <b>NSAIDs</b> (odds ratio: 1. 05; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 90 - 1. 23). Patients taking selective <b>NSAIDs</b> were just as likely to start cardiovascular co-medication as patients taking non-selective <b>NSAIDs</b> (odds ratio: 1. 03; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 78 - 1. 36). Annual costs of treating osteoarthritis in ambulatory care amounted to 756 with selective <b>NSAIDs</b> and 416 with non-selective <b>NSAIDs.</b> This originated from higher acquisition costs (278 vs. 24) and higher costs of co-medication (477 vs. 392) with selective <b>NSAIDs.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The use of selective and non-selective <b>NSAIDs</b> is accompanied by a higher use of co-medication over time. The increase in anti-secretory co-medication was more prominent with non-selective <b>NSAIDs.</b> The rise in cardiovascular co-medication was more pronounced with selective <b>NSAIDs.</b> Treatment of osteoarthritis with selective <b>NSAIDs</b> is more expensive than with non-selective <b>NSAIDs</b> in terms of acquisition costs and costs of co-medication. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (<b>NSAID)</b> and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E

5|$|NSAIDs are {{the usual}} {{first-line}} treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly {{more or less}} effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been {{the most commonly used}} <b>NSAID,</b> an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the current prescribing trends of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) among private practitioners and practitioners at tertiary care teaching rural hospital. Methods: The prospective survey study was carried out by obtaining response to feedback questionnaire related to use of <b>NSAIDs</b> from 25 private and 25 tertiary care practitioners. Results: <b>NSAIDs</b> use was routine amongst private (66 %) and tertiary care (77. 6 %) practitioners. Preferences of tertiary care practitioners were paracetamol (36 %), diclofenac (20 %), aceclofenac (20 %), ibuprofen (20 %) and etoricoxib (4 %) while that of private practitioners were ibuprofen (40 %), paracetamol (32 %), diclofenac (16 %) and aceclofenac (12 %). Use of Fixed Dose Combinations (FDC) was 72 % in private and 68 % in tertiary care practitioners. While prescribing FDCs, private practitioners preferred <b>NSAIDs</b> + <b>NSAIDs</b> (100 %) over <b>NSAIDs</b> + muscle relaxants (44. 44 %), <b>NSAIDs</b> + Serratiopeptidase (55. 56 %), and <b>NSAIDs</b> + antacids (44. 44 %) similarly tertiary care practitioners also preferred <b>NSAIDs</b> + <b>NSAIDs</b> (100 %) over <b>NSAIDs</b> + muscle relaxants (47. 06 %), <b>NSAIDs</b> + Serratiopeptidase (36 %), and <b>NSAIDs</b> + antacids (28 %). Of the <b>NSAIDs</b> + <b>NSAIDs</b> combination ibuprofen + paracetamol (70 %) was preferred by private practitioners and diclofenac + paracetamol (61 %) by tertiary practitioners. Paracetamol was safely used during pregnancy by both groups. Adverse effects observed included gastritis (98 %), urticaria (32 %), and anaphylaxis (2 %), although no fatality was observed. Conclusion: Not much of a difference was observed in prescribing habits of both groups. Though beneficial and routinely prescribed, <b>NSAIDs</b> with equal risk potential were observed to be cautiously used with appropriate knowledge amongst both the groups.

We	hypothesized	that	the	cutaneous	irritation	by	topical	<b>NSAIDs</b>	might be {{suppressed by}} trehalose, which has protective effects on biological membranes. Using the three-dimensional cultured human skin model, Living Skin	Equivalent-high,	 we	found	that	cutaneous	damage	due	to	<b>NSAIDs</b>	was	reduced	by	concomitant	use	of	trehalose	and	that	this effect of	trehalose	was	reinforced	by	co-lyophilization	of	<b>NSAIDs</b>	with	trehalose. The	anti-inflammatory	effect	of	co-lyophilized	<b>NSAIDs</b> with trehalose	was	comparable	to	that	seen	with	<b>NSAIDs</b>	alone	in	a	rat	model.

40|$|The {{influence}} of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (<b>NSAIDs)</b> {{on the development}} of gastric mucosal lesions (GMLs) was investigated clinicopathologically in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and experimentally in rats treated with <b>NSAIDs.</b> Two hundred and seventy-three patients with RA including 248 patients under <b>NSAIDs</b> therapy were employed in this clinical study. GMLs were classified into two categories, gastritis and/or gastric erosion (GGE) and gastric ulcer (GU). Of 273 patients with RA, GMLs were found in 146 patients, consisting of 90 patients with GGE, 32 patients with GU and 24 patients with both GGE and GU. Frequencies of GMLs were 58 % (143 / 248) in RA patients under <b>NSAIDs</b> therapy and 12 % (3 / 25) in those without <b>NSAIDs,</b> indicating a close association between development of GMLs and treatment with <b>NSAIDs.</b> Interesting- ly, patients under rectal <b>NSAIDs</b> therapy also developed GMLs at an almost the same frequency as those under oral <b>NSAIDs</b> therapy. The development of GMLs was confirmed experimentally in rats given sodium diclofenate intrarectally, suggesting that rectal admin- istration of <b>NSAIDs</b> is not safe enough to prevent GMLs induced by <b>NSAIDs.</b> On the other hand, the use of <b>NSAIDs</b> prodrugs may reduce the incidence of GMLs. Acidity in gastric juice was increased in patients with GMLs. In NSAIDs-treated rats, H₂ receptor antago- nists (H₂-RAs) and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) were both effective in preventing GMLs. In the present clinical observation, PPI was superior to H₂-RAs in healing GU in the patients treated with <b>NSAIDs.</b> The gastric mucosal blood flow measured by laser Doppler flow meter was decreased in RA patients with GU.
