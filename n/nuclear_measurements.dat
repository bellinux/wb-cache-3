Exploiting the particular modeling structure of remote <b>nuclear</b> <b>measurement,</b> and the form that the likelihood ratio takes in this setting, the paper presents analytical Chernoff bounds for the error probabilities, which in turn allow the selection of threshold constants for the likelihood ratio test in a computationally efficient manner compared to Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R
