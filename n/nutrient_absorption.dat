5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and <b>nutrient</b> <b>absorption.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced <b>nutrient</b> <b>absorption</b> and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E
40|$|L-theanine has various {{advantageous}} {{functions for}} human health; {{whether or not}} it could mediate the <b>nutrients</b> <b>absorption</b> is unknown yet. The effects of L-theanine on intestinal <b>nutrients</b> <b>absorption</b> were investigated using rats ingesting L-theanine solution (0, 50, 200, and 400 [*]mg/kg body weight) per day for two weeks. The decline of insulin secretion and glucose concentration in the serum was observed by L-theanine. Urea and high-density lipoprotein were also reduced by 50 [*]mg/kg L-theanine. Jejunal and ileac basic amino acids transporters SLC 7 a 1 and SLC 7 a 9, neutral SLC 1 a 5 and SLC 16 a 10, and acidic SLC 1 a 1 expression were upregulated. The expression of intestinal SGLT 3 and GLUT 5 responsible for carbohydrates uptake and GPR 120 and FABP 2 associated with fatty acids transport were inhibited. These results indicated that L-theanine could inhibit the glucose uptake by downregulating the related gene expression in the small intestine of rats. Intestinal gene expression of transporters responding to amino acids absorption was stimulated by L-theanine administration...|$|R
50|$|Nutrigenomics is {{a branch}} of {{nutritional}} genomics and {{is the study of}} the effects of foods and food constituents on gene expression. This means that nutrigenomics is research focusing on identifying and understanding molecular-level interaction between nutrients and other dietary bioactives with the genome. Nutrigenomics has also been described by the influence of genetic variation on nutrition, by correlating gene expression or SNPs with a <b>nutrient's</b> <b>absorption,</b> metabolism, elimination or biological effects. By doing so, nutrigenomics aims to develop rational means to optimise nutrition with respect to the subject's genotype.|$|R

5|$|Dr. George Spomer of the University of Idaho has {{discovered}} protocarnivorous activity and function in several glandular plant species, including Cerastium arvense, Ipomopsis aggregata, Heuchera cylindrica, Mimulus lewisii, Penstemon attenuata, Penstemon diphyllus, Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia, Ribes cereum, Rosa nutkana var. hispida, Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana, Solanum tuberosum, Stellaria americana, and Stellaria jamesiana. These species {{tested positive for}} protease activity, though {{it is unclear whether}} the protease is produced by the plant or by surface microbes. Two other species evaluated by Dr. Spomer, Geranium viscosissimum and Potentilla arguta, exhibited protease activity and were further examined with 14C-labeled algal protein for <b>nutrient</b> <b>absorption</b> activity. Both of these latter species displayed an ability to digest and absorb the labeled protein.|$|E
5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and <b>nutrient</b> <b>absorption</b> in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the <b>nutrients.</b> <b>Absorption</b> may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hydroponic {{system was}} used to {{investigate}} the interaction between different levels of Cd and Al in barley seedlings. The results showed that stress exposure promoted Al or Cd accumulation in plants, leading to strongly inhibited growth. Concentration- and tissue-dependent responses to Al or Cd stress in barley leaves, stems, and roots were found in four nutrient concentrations. Thus, stress generally inhibited Mg, Zn, and Ca absorption, but increased Fe accumulation and Ca translocation from roots to aboveground parts. Binary metal combinations significantly increased Al levels in plant parts, and aggravated growth inhibition as well as <b>nutrients</b> <b>absorption</b> disorder caused by Al treatments, especially the combination of 90 µM Al+ 5 µM Cd. By contrast, combined treatments decreased Cd concentration in plants, and the combinations of 10 µM Cd+Al alleviated Cd-induced growth and metabolism anomaly...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHuman gut {{microbiota}} is {{a complex}} ecosystem with several functions integrated in the host organism (metabolic, immune, <b>nutrients</b> <b>absorption,</b> etc.). Human microbiota is composed by bacteria, yeasts, fungi and, last but not least, viruses, whose composition has not been completely described. According to previous evidence on pathogenic viruses, the human gut harbours plant-derived viruses, giant viruses and, only recently, abundant bacteriophages. New metagenomic methods have allowed to reconstitute entire viral genomes from the genetic material spread in the human gut, opening new perspectives on {{the understanding of the}} gut virome composition, the importance of gut microbiome, and potential clinical applications.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the protective effects of dietary glutamate and aspartate supplementations on diquat-induced oxidative stress in piglets. Diquat injection significantly reduced growth performance, including body weight, average daily weight gain, and feed intake (P< 0. 05). Meanwhile, diquat administration induced oxidative stress evidenced by the decreased serum nitric oxide (NO) and elevated malondialdeyhde (MDA) concentration (P< 0. 05). Furthermore, diquat-induced oxidative stress disrupted intestinal absorption system and decreased serum threonine, serine, and glycine levels. Dietary supplementation with glutamate improved final body weight, antioxidant system, and expressions of amino acids transporters and enhanced serum glutamate concentration compared with diquat group (P< 0. 05). While aspartate failed to alleviate diquat-induced oxidative stress, growth depression, and dysfunction of <b>nutrients</b> <b>absorption</b> except for liver relative weight. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with glutamate confers beneficial effects on diquat-induced oxidative stress in piglets, while aspartate exhibits little effects...|$|R
