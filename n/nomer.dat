40|$|The recent detections {{of cosmic}} shear signal {{announced}} by several groups {{have demonstrated the}} feasibility of this challenging program and convinced astro- <b>nomers</b> of its potential for cosmology. Cosmic shear analysis demands to handle Gigabytes of data in order to probe several square degrees in subarcsecond deep imaging mode. The success of these surveys is sensitive to the designs of the observation strategy, {{the organization of the}} data reduction pipelines and the links of the data base with surveys like X-ray or spectroscopic follow up. We describe the cosmic shear surveys we have carried out at the VLT and at CFHT and the way we handle this huge data set in a more general context including the VIRMOS and the XMM-LSS surveys, and the future CMB surveys.

40|$|The equinox of Jupiter, {{defined as}} when the Sun passes through {{the plane of the}} equator of Jupiter and hence through the orbital plane of the Galilean satellites, will take place in 2009. The French {{committee}} for IYA 20091 will take this opportunity to propose coordinated observations. The equinox of Jupiter is favourable for many events such as eclipses of the Galilean satellites by the planet Jupiter, occultations and transits and also mutual phenomena among the satellites themselves. These events are very easily observable, even with a small telescope, since the Galilean satellites are very bright. The events are spectacular since the satellites will disappear within a few seconds. We propose that these phenomena be observed worldwide by amateur astro <b>nomers,</b> students and schoolchildren. Observers should send their data to a central web-site which will analyse each observation and provide a database of all the observations. Many observations can be explained in terms of the physics and the dynamics of the Galilean satel-lites themselves. The history of astronomy is also relevant as the Galilean satellites were the first celestial objects observed extensively from Earth and were used as the first reliable clock for longitude calculations. At the end of the observational campaign, the results will be collated and the scientific benefits from these observations will be explained and published...|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to a growing car market and the increasing demand of purchasing and selling cars from different regions, the oblong transit plate was introduced, based on paper. When registered, the car was given two plates which should {{be attached to the}} inner side of the windshield and the rear glass. The word [...] "транзит" [...] and [...] "передний номер" [...] (perednij <b>nomer,</b> lit. [...] "Frontal number") or [...] "задний номер" [...] (zadnij <b>nomer,</b> lit. [...] "Rear number") was written on the top row, the second row contained the three-letter regional code (or the two-letter one for military vehicles), and the third row housed the four digits. The oblong metal transit plate was the same with the car, but the regional code contained only 2 letters, which were positioned beneath the word [...] "транзит". This format does not distinguish between civil and military equipment.The diplomatic format received a change as well. The color scheme was the inverse of that of normal plates (white-on-black). Initially, it was the same as the previous diplomatic format, only with the letter [...] "Д" [...] moved to the first place (or to the bottom row on rear plates), but later on the Cyrillic letter eventually got replaced by its Latin equivalent, [...] "D". From the mid-1960s onwards the standard for plates belonging to foreign entities was in force, which sets the format as [...] "L-NN-NNN", where a [...] "D" [...] in the place of L meant a member of diplomatic representatives, a K for correspondents, and an M for sales representatives. It is worth noting that there was a slight change for the plates beginning with M, which removed the dash between the letter and the first number. For example, [...] "M51 01-10" [...] where the first two numbers succeeding the M is the country code.|$|E
5000|$|Russia officially {{has long}} denied {{organized}} presence of their military units in Ukraine. Nevertheless, evidence of its soldiers' involvement is rampant. On 25 August 2014 ten Russian paratroopers were captured in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defense {{maintained that the}} men were lost and crossed the border into Ukraine by accident. In May 2015 two suspected Russian GRU agents (Military intelligence) were detained by Ukrainian forces, Russia's Ministry of Defense stated the men were former soldiers who were not on active duty {{at the time of}} capture. The two men were later exchanged for captured Ukrainian pilot and politician Nadiya Savchenko In July 2015 a Russian major was detained near Donetsk as he drove an ammunition truck into a Ukrainian checkpoint, the Russian military maintained the man was not involved with the Russian military and fought for local separatists. The major was later exchanged for captured Ukrainian soldiers. In September 2015 Ukraine's border guards detained 2 Russian internal troops when they crossed the border in Ukraine's Luhansk oblast, the Russian servicemen stated they were lost and crossed the border by accident, with the Russian Military of Defense accusing Ukraine's forces of crossing into the nearby Russian village and abducting the servicemen. In October 2015, Russian Ministry of Defence admitted that [...] "special forces were pulled out of Ukraine and sent to Syria" [...] and that they were serving in eastern Ukraine on territories held by pro-Russian rebels. On 17 December 2015 when asked about the two detained Russian citizens in Ukraine who were being accused of being military intelligence officers President Vladimir Putin responded: [...] "We never said there were not people there who carried out certain tasks including in the military sphere." [...] This was generally taken as an admission that Russian military operatives were deployed to Ukraine. Before that declaration there had been a large amount of circumstantial evidence that confirmed the presence of Russia's military. Large part of the evidence are military vehicles and weapons that are unique to Russian armed forces and never present in Ukraine before the conflict. The OSCE monitoring mission has also noted the presence of troops declaring themselves as Russian servicemen in DPR-controlled territory. As the rest of the post-Soviet republics every Russian military equipment has a hull number (bortovoi <b>nomer).</b> However all equipment in possession of the Russian puppet organizations LPR and DPR has all hull number painted over to conceal its relation to the Russian Armed Forces.|$|E

40|$|The {{use of the}} <b>nomer</b> ‘corporate’ {{is hardly}} an issue in {{contemporary}} scholarship on corporate governance. I will argue that this <b>nomer</b> is important for two main reasons. First, the corporate form distinguishes itself from {{any other form of}} business representation. In this sense, {{it is important to know}} exactly how this form is different to understand how conceptions of ‘corporate governance’ relate to different forms of representation. Second, it is my contention that the use of a particular understanding of incorporation directly informs the concept of internal governance in terms of constituency, structure, ownership and the locus of corporate agency. It is in this sense that I argue that the identification of corporate constituencies and the allocation of agency and ownership is a precondition of business ethics. With this aim in mind, I explore the governance in corporations as the result of the legal understanding of incorporation and the separate legal entity. I explore two historical positions from which five legal positions on the separate legal entity can be derived. These five positions provide reference points for the attribution of ownership and agency between the separate legal entity and the aggregation of individuals that together make up the corporation. Incorporation, as the legal act that constitutes the corporation, can then be shown to adopt multiple and mutually exclusive positions. These positions are central to the debate on the respective claims to agency and ownership between the separate legal entity and the aggregation of individuals. I then end the article by arguing that all concepts of incorporation create legal and economic issues regarding the allocation of ownership and agency, which makes their understanding and the choice behind them important for theories of governance...|$|E
40|$|Paul Tillich’s view {{on reality}} is that anxiety is part of being human. According to Reinhold Niebuhr, Christian realism has a {{realistic}} and an idealistic side to it. Reality is always changing and filled with tension. On the other hand there is a vision of otherworldliness, a vision of transcendence in everydayness. The theological <b>nomer</b> “Christian” indicates an awareness of God’s presence {{as well as the}} human tendency to be self-directed. The objectives of this article are to “rephrase” Niebuhr’s knowledge of the reality of the secular world, conceptualise Tillich’s categories of “anxiety” and “fear” against the background of the reality of the secular world, and explain Niebuhr’s notion of “Christian realism”. Their insights are used to empower the church to overcome homophobia in the faith community’s pastoral care of gays.
