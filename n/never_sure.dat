5|$|Seventy {{minutes of}} footage, mostly {{dealing with the}} origin, were not {{included}} in the final cut. Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet. Editor Kyle Cooper, creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits. Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in compressing these to the film's start. This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.|$|E
25|$|Sure, {{there have}} been controversies as well. Naya Daur (right) was one instance, thanks to the Madhubala episode. She was a fine person, it was merely that in this one instance, things went badly wrong. For my film she did about ten days work and then her father refused {{to allow her to}} go {{outdoors}} {{for the rest of the}} shoot - I was <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> why. So we took Vyjayanthimala for the role and her father filed a suit against us.|$|E
500|$|Other leading {{literary}} {{figures who}} admired Wodehouse were A.E. Housman, Max Beerbohm and Hilaire Belloc; {{on the radio}} and in print Belloc called Wodehouse [...] "the best writer of our time: the best living writer of English... the head of my profession". Wodehouse regarded Belloc's plaudit as [...] "a gag, to get a rise out of serious-minded authors whom he disliked". Wodehouse was <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> that his books had literary merit as well as popular appeal, and, Donaldson suggests, must have been overwhelmed when the University of Oxford conferred an honorary doctorate of letters on him in June 1939. His visit to England for the awarding ceremony was the last time he set foot in his native land.|$|E

500|$|Clarke was <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> if {{she would}} finish her novel or {{if it would be}} published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.|$|E
500|$|Verity {{earned the}} respect of Bradman, {{generally}} regarded as the greatest batsman to have played cricket, and enjoyed bowling at him. Bradman described Verity as a great cricketer and wrote that throughout their respective careers, he [...] "grew {{more and more to}} respect [...] both as a gentleman and as a player." [...] Robertson-Glasgow thought that Verity was [...] "one of only three or four bowlers who came to the battle with Bradman on not unequal terms". During the 17 Tests in which they faced each other, Verity dismissed Bradman eight times, more than any other bowler. Robertson-Glasgow believed that, but for Verity, Bradman would have averaged over 150 in Tests instead of his actual batting average. In all first-class cricket, Verity dismissed Bradman 10 times in total, on two occasions twice in the same game. Only Clarrie Grimmett equalled 10 first-class dismissals of Bradman. However, Bradman once said: [...] "I think I know all about Clarrie (Grimmett), but with Hedley I am <b>never</b> <b>sure.</b> You see, there's no breaking-point with him." ...|$|E
500|$|The Harris Theater {{was built}} to fill {{the need for a}} modern {{performance}} venue in downtown Chicago, which would be a new home for previously itinerant performing arts companies. Such troupes were <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> from year to year where {{they would be able to}} perform; for example, the Chicago Tribune reported in 1993 that six dance companies lost their performance space during renovations at the Civic Opera House. The need for a new theater was identified by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in a 1990 study; the new venue had to be flexible, affordable, and technically and physically [...] "state-of-the-art". Once the need was identified, the theater was the culmination of [...] "years of planning by Chicago's philanthropic, arts, business and government leaders" [...] including groups like Music of the Baroque, which now perform there regularly. The plan also extended Chicago's performing arts district, which had been predominantly west of Michigan Avenue, east towards Lake Michigan, and linked it more with the Museum Campus and Michigan Avenue cultural institutions.|$|E

500|$|Macaulay {{displayed}} a temper when matters went against him. Robertson-Glasgow {{described him as}} an unusual man, [...] "fiercely independent, witty, argumentative, swift to joy and anger. He had pleasure in cracking a convention or cursing an enemy... A cricket-bag came {{between him and his}} blazer hanging on a peg; and he'd kick it and tell it a truth or two, then laugh." [...] Bill Bowes described how, when he was bowling, he would glare and mutter under his breath; he seemed to be [...] "filled with a devilish energy". He would make sharp or biting comments, particularly if a fielder made a mistake when he was bowling and although often amusing, it could at times hurt the recipients, and his anger made his team-mates wary of him. Yet, he could also express appreciation when a skillful batsmen hit a good shot from his bowling; the result was that his colleagues were <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> what to expect from him, even after playing with him for years. Herbert Sutcliffe said he could be charming when not playing, but his wit could be sharp. Robertson-Glasgow nevertheless described him as [...] "a glorious opponent; a great cricketer; and a companion in a thousand".|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{spent the}} next ten years working on the novel in her spare time, while editing cookbooks {{full-time}} for Simon & Schuster in Cambridge. She also published stories in Starlight 2 and Starlight 3; according to the New York Times Magazine, her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was <b>never</b> <b>sure,</b> however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule.

500|$|In {{the years}} between his return from Paris in 1908 and the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, Vaughan Williams increasingly established himself as a figure in British music. For a rising composer it was important to receive performances at the big provincial music festivals, which generated publicity and royalties. In 1910 his music featured at two {{of the largest and most}} prestigious festivals, with the premieres of the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral in September and A Sea Symphony at the Leeds Festival the following month. The leading British music critics of the time, J. A. Fuller Maitland of The Times and Samuel Langford of The Manchester Guardian, were strong in their praise. The former wrote of the fantasia, [...] "The work is wonderful because it seems to lift one into some unknown region of musical thought and feeling. Throughout its course one is <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> whether one is listening to something very old or very new". Langford declared that the symphony [...] "definitely places a new figure in the first rank of our English composers". Between these successes and the start of war Vaughan Williams's largest-scale work was the first version of A London Symphony (1914). In the same year he wrote The Lark Ascending in its original form for violin and piano.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of backing tracks {{on the first}} three sides of the album were recorded at I.D. Sound Studios, Los Angeles, engineered by James Lowe with assistance from John Lee. The studio {{was one of the}} first independent units in LA, and Lowe believes Rundgren chose it due to the ability to work hands-on without record company interference and having all the latest technology and equipment. Rundgren played every instrument in turn, starting with the drums, noting it [...] "was the logical place to start," [...] with the others individually laid down on top. While recording the drums, Rundgren would try and hum the song in his head to remember where he was, but [...] "if I would screw up, then I would change the song afterwards, to fit the mistake that I had made, because it was easier than going back and fixing it." [...] In retrospect, Rundgren felt he might have performed better with a click track, being a novice drummer at the time, but concluded that the end result [...] "sound like a band". He didn't think his lack of technical proficiency on the instrument was a particular handicap, saying that [...] "people comprehend what you're playing, and it has a greater impact." [...] Engineering the album, Lowe recalled he was [...] "mostly working in the dark", and that Rundgren would leave spaces for instruments during recording, spontaneously developing a song as it was being recorded. [...] "I was <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> exactly where the song was going until we'd put down about four or five tracks." ...|$|E

2500|$|The order-off {{rule was}} not popular with players or umpires. Umpires were <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> how rough things {{had to get}} before they could order a player off, rather than {{awarding}} a free kick to an opponent. [...] The order-off rule was dispensed with after two seasons. [...] Even so, the order-off rule {{must be seen as}} an attempt by the VFA to curb the rough play that was cited as {{one of the reasons for}} the formation of the VFL.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} critics have commented {{that as he}} grew older the line that {{distinguished}} Thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred. Thompson himself admitted during a 1978 BBC interview that he sometimes felt pressured {{to live up to}} the fictional self that he had created, adding [...] "I'm <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> which one people expect me to be. Very often, they conflict— most often, as a matter of fact.... I'm leading a normal life and right alongside me there is this myth, and it is growing and mushrooming and getting more and more warped. When I get invited to, say, speak at universities, I'm not sure if they are inviting Duke or Thompson. I'm not sure who to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{spent most}} of his playing career under the tough {{captaincy}} of Brian Sellers, who won six championships in eight seasons. [...] "I got a rollicking in my first match for putting my foot on the ball. In my first season, my spinning finger was so worn it was bleeding but Mr Sellers said I had to keep going and bowled me into the wind all day." [...] In that match, [...] at Bristol, Robinson took 2–168 as Hammond stroked 143. [...] "You were only paid if you played and I was <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> of my place. As an uncapped player I got pounds 7 or pounds 8 a match but had to pay my own travel and hotel expenses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fonda's {{relationship}} with his children {{has been described as}} [...] "emotionally distant". Fonda loathed displays of feeling in himself or others, and this was a consistent part of his character. Whenever he felt that his emotional wall was being breached, he had outbursts of anger, exhibiting a furious temper that terrified his family. In Peter Fonda's 1998 autobiography Don't Tell Dad (1998), he described how he was <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> how his father felt about him. [...] He never volunteered to his father that he loved him until he was elderly, and Peter finally heard, [...] "I love you, son." [...] His daughter Jane rejected her father's friendships with Republican actors such as John Wayne and James Stewart. [...] Their relationship became extremely strained as Jane Fonda became a left-wing activist.|$|E

He made his way to his club because of the sheer impossibility of sleep. He stood on the threshold of the reading room and looked in at the little group of semi-somnolent men. In his way he was popular, and he received a good many sleepy greetings.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "apparition" [...] is {{considered}} crucial as it implies both presence and absence - and thus transience as mentioned previously. It gives human life a spiritual, mystical significance, {{but one that}} we can <b>never</b> be <b>sure</b> of.|$|R
2500|$|Confessing at {{some point}} that [...] "the world was my school", Caragiale dissimulated his {{background}} and critical eye {{as a means to}} blend into each environment he encountered, and even adopted the manners and speech patterns he later recorded in his literary work. He thus encouraged familiarity, allowing people to reveal their histories, motivations, and culture. Vianu recounted: [...] "The man was a consummate actor and a pince-sans-rire, an ironist [...] to the point where his partners of dialog were <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> if they were spoken to «seriously» [...]" [...] In one of his pieces from 1899, he welcomed the famous actors Eleonora Duse and Jean Mounet-Sully to Bucharest, imitating the exaggerated style of other theater chroniclers—the article ended with Caragiale confessing that he had not actually seen the two perform. In one other instance, as a means to comment on plagiarism, the author also parodied his own O făclie de Paşte—which he turned into the sketch, Noaptea Învierii.|$|E
2500|$|Entering the 1973 season, Stewart {{had decided}} to retire. He {{nevertheless}} won at South Africa, Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands, and Austria. His last and then record-setting 27th victory came at the Nürburgring with a 1–2 for Tyrrell. [...] "Nothing gave me more satisfaction than to win at the Nürburgring and yet, I was always afraid." [...] Stewart later said. [...] "When I left home for the German Grand Prix I always used to pause {{at the end of}} the driveway and take a long look back. I was <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> I'd come home again." [...] After the fatal crash of his teammate François Cevert in practice for the 1973 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Stewart retired one race earlier than intended and missed what would have been his 100th Grand Prix. Stewart had already won the Drivers' Championship at the Italian Grand Prix two races previously; this was a race where Stewart had to come into the pits to change a flat tyre, and he drove from 20th to finish 4th.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{draft for}} the remake had moved the setting to {{northern}} California, and altered the third act to include {{elements of the}} supernatural. When that script was rejected, Carl Ellsworth {{was brought in to}} touch up the script written by Adam Alleca. Ellsworth had previously worked with Craven on Red Eye, but had never seen the original Last House on the Left. After reading the script and watching the 1972 film—the latter he found difficult to watch because of its extreme nature—Ellsworth decided that the first thing they needed to do was to establish someone whose survival you wanted the audience to root for. The writer wanted to know how the [...] "typical family" [...] would react to such a heinous act being perpetrated on their daughter, and what they were truly capable of. Craven points out that most of the early script problems were based around deciding what elements to include. They were <b>never</b> <b>sure</b> how much of the Krug family needed to be seen, what elements from the original film should be included, or even if Mari should live or die.|$|E
