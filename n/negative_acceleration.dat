40|$|Flexible robots {{have given}} rise to {{numerous}} investigations, and their use is easily justified in two main cases: (1) when the weight of the robot has to be minimized and (2) when collisions of the robot with the environment are foreseen, as a flexible lightweight robot delivers less impact energy. Much work has been done by different authors on the position control of flexible robots using feedback of the tip position or tip acceleration. However, the use of these sensing devices is problematic in practical applications of flexible arms: three-dimensional tip position sensing is expensive, and occlusions appear at some arm configurations. Accelerometers cannot be used when contact of the tip with the environment is expected because these sensors cannot stand the high <b>negative</b> <b>accelerations</b> produced at the impact (unless very low speed motions are performed).

We highlight the very good agreement between the calibrated and corrected accelerations and the accelerations from POD for the large-scale signal structure, where the accelerations drop from − 200 to − 700  nm/s^ 2 during half a day and then increase again to − 200  nm/s^ 2 during a bit more than one day. For the finer signal structures, we see differences up to 800  nm/s^ 2 between calibrated and corrected accelerations and the accelerations from POD. This is shown in more detail in the bottom left panel of Fig.  10, which zooms in on 12 : 00 – 18 : 00  UTC on March 17, 2015, where we can see that the difference are due to short and strong <b>negative</b> <b>accelerations</b> that are not well captured in the accelerations from POD due to their 10 -min time resolution.|$|R
2500|$|The {{gravitational}} torque {{between the}} Moon and the tidal bulge of Earth causes the Moon {{to be constantly}} promoted to a slightly higher orbit and Earth to be decelerated in its rotation. [...] As in any physical process within an isolated system, total energy and angular momentum are conserved. [...] Effectively, energy and angular momentum are transferred from the rotation of Earth to the orbital motion of the Moon (however, most of the energy lost by Earth (−3.321 TW) is converted to heat by frictional losses in the oceans and their interaction with the solid Earth, and only about 1/30th (+0.121 TW) is transferred to the Moon). The Moon moves farther away from Earth (+38.247±0.004mm/y), so its potential energy (in Earth's gravity well) increases. It stays in orbit, and from Kepler's 3rd law it follows that its angular velocity actually decreases, so the tidal action on the Moon actually causes an angular deceleration, i.e. a <b>negative</b> <b>acceleration</b> (−25.858±0.003"/century2) of its rotation around Earth. The actual speed of the Moon also decreases. Although its kinetic energy decreases, its potential energy increases by a larger amount.|$|E

40|$|Natural {{communities}} of marine bacteria, an isolate (FMB-Bf 3) from one marine community, and Escherichia coli were examined by video microscopy for {{the magnitude and}} uniformity of their speed. Natural communities formed tight microswarms that showed higher speeds (mean = 230 microns s- 1) than did E. coli (15 microns s- 1) or FMB-Bf 3 (mean = 62 microns s- 1). Outside the microswarms, the marine bacteria slowed to 45 microns s- 1. Between turns, in mid run, and while travelling in straight lines, the natural-community bacteria accelerated up to 1, 450 microns s- 2 while the cultured bacteria showed maximum accelerations of 70 and 166 microns s- 2. The frequency distribution of speed change for the marine bacteria was skewed towards a few large <b>negative</b> <b>accelerations</b> {{and a range of}} positive accelerations. The general pattern was one of relatively slow increases in speed followed by abrupt declines. The results indicate that the mechanical generation and energetic maintenance, as well as the environmental function, of bacterial motility need reappraisal.

40|$|Using a nonlinear, 2 -D {{time-dependent}} numerical model, we {{simulate the}} propagation of gravity waves (GWs) in a time-varying tide. Our simulations show that when a GW packet propagates in a time-varying tidal-wind environment, not only its intrinsic frequency but also its ground-based frequency would change significantly. The tidal horizontal-wind acceleration dominates the GW frequency variation. Positive (<b>negative)</b> <b>accelerations</b> induce frequency increases (decreases) with time. More interestingly, tidal-wind acceleration near the critical layers always causes the GW frequency to increase, which may partially explain the observations that high-frequency GW components are more dominant {{in the middle and}} upper atmosphere than in the lower atmosphere. The combination of the increased ground-based frequency of propagating GWs in a time-varying tidal-wind field and the transient nature of the critical layer induced by a time-varying tidal zonal wind creates favorable conditions for GWs to penetrate their originally expected critical layers. Consequently, GWs {{have an impact on the}} background atmosphere at much higher altitudes than expected, which indicates that the dynamical effects of tidal–GW interactions are more complicated than usually taken into account by GW parameterizations in global models...|$|R

40|$|Herein I {{propose a}} multi-scale {{dynamical}} analysis {{to facilitate the}} physical interpretation of tide gauge records. The technique uses graphical diagrams. It is applied to six secular-long tide gauge records representative of the world oceans: Sydney, Pacific coast of Australia; Fremantle, Indian Ocean coast of Australia; New York City, Atlantic coast of USA; Honolulu, U. S. state of Hawaii; San Diego, U. S. state of California; and Venice, Mediterranean Sea, Italy. For comparison, an equivalent analysis {{is applied to the}} Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index. Finally, a global reconstruction of sea level and a reconstruction of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index are analyzed and compared: both sequences cover about three centuries from 1700 to 2000. The proposed methodology quickly highlights oscillations and teleconnections among the records at the decadal and multidecadal scales. At the secular time scales tide gauge records present relatively small (positive or <b>negative)</b> <b>accelerations,</b> as found in other studies. On the contrary, from the decadal to the secular scales (up to 110 -year intervals) the tide gauge accelerations oscillate significantly from positive to negative values mostly following the PDO, AMO and NAO oscillations. In particular, the influence of a large quasi 60 - 70 year natural oscillation is clearly demonstrated in these records. The multiscale dynamical evolutions of the rate and of the amplitude of the annual seasonal cycle of the chosen six tide gauge records are also studied. Comment: 11 figure, 3 tables, 16 pages.

40|$|Low {{frequency}} {{sea level}} {{variability in the}} Mediterranean Sea and in the Atlantic Iberian coast is investigated by use of tide gauge records. The five tide gauge records that span most of the 20 th century show positive trends between 1. 2 and 1. 5 ± 0. 1 mm yr? 1 and <b>negative</b> <b>accelerations</b> between ? 0. 3 ± 0. 3 and ? 1. 5 ± 0. 4 mm yr? 1 century? 1. Sea level trends obtained from the 21 longest records (> 35 yr) are smaller in the Mediterranean (0. 3 ± 0. 4 to ? 0. 7 ± 0. 3 mm yr? 1) than in the neighbouring Atlantic sites (1. 6 ± 0. 5 to – 1. 9 ± 0. 5 mm yr? 1) for the period 1960 – 2000. Decadal sea level trends in the Mediterranean are not always consistent with global values, in particular for the 1990 s, during which the Mediterranean has shown enhanced sea level rise of up to 5 mm yr? 1 compared to the global average (mostly attributed to higher warming). The atmospheric and steric contributions to the observed sea level trends for 1960 – 2000 are also examined. The atmospherically induced sea level is obtained from a barotropic model forced by wind and atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric contribution accounts for 20 – 50 per cent of the observed yearly sea level variability and introduces negative trends of – 0. 2 to – 0. 9 mm yr? 1. The steric sea level, obtained from T and S climatologies, has negative trends ranging from ? 2. 1 ± 0. 6 to ? 0. 1 ± 0. 3 mm yr? 1. Other shorter tide gauge records (> 7 yr) are used to quality check longer series and to explore their consistency with the long-term records and identify short but apparently consistent tide gauge records...|$|R
