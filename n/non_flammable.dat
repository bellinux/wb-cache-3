40|$|Heavy metal is {{a source}} of {{contaminants}} in the industries effluents. It can be released into the environment in gaseous, particulate and transportation, microelectronic product and finally waste disposal (Bradl, 2005). For instance, generation of heavy metal waste has been estimated to be 4000 and 150, 000 tonne/year alone in Portugal and European countries (Silva et al., 2005). This show that amount of waste being generated annually is respectively a huge amount. Therefore, heavy metal needed to remove from the sources to avoid contaminations to the environment and human health. Solvent extraction is one of the effective techniques to remove Cu(ll) from aqueous solution. The common conventional solvents used are petroleum- base such as such as kerosene, chloroform, dichloromethane, ndodecane, isododecane, ndecanol, n-heptane, n-hexane and cumene. These petroleum-based diluents, which form the bulk components in the organic phase, are usually toxic, non-renewable, <b>non</b> biodegradable, <b>flammable</b> and volatile in nature (Venkareswaran et al., 2007). They are difficult to handle and will result in ecological hazard to the aquatic systems in the case of solvent loss due to entrainment in the aqueous phase. Hence, it is essential to find a greener replacement for the conventional petroleum-based organic solvents in order to curb the environmental problem. Cooking palm oil which has a great potential as greener substitutes for the conventional solvents owing to their outstanding characteristics such as nontoxicity, inflammability, nonvolatility, renewability and biodegradability. The unlimited bioresources, as well as relatively simpler processing steps and technologies involved, ensure the use of cooking palm oils as solvent substitutes cheaper than the conventional organic solvents...|$|R

40|$|In {{the quest}} for {{sustainable}} commercial production of bioproducts such as lipids, pigments and proteins and for pollution mitigation and CO 2 abatement, microalgae are increasingly receiving an attention due to their high growth rate, high CO 2 sequestration and their lack of requirement for fertile soil surface compared to conventional crops. Because microalgal biomass consists of individual cells with rigid cell walls, extraction of useful components from the biomass is often problematic. Extraction and processing with supercritical fluids (SCF) is increasingly gaining importance in the food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries and can be a solution for these specific problems. Carbon dioxide {{is the most common}} supercritical fluid due to its moderate critical temperature (31. 3 oC) and pressure (72. 9 atm) and hence particularly desirable for the extraction of thermally labile natural products. Since the extraction conditions are relatively mild, the residual algal biomass can still be maximally valorized. Because CO 2 is gaseous at room temperature, it yields a solvent free extract. Moreover, carbon dioxide is a non toxic, <b>non</b> <b>flammable,</b> odorless, tasteless and inexpensive gas. The goal of this work is to investigate the possibility of using supercritical carbon dioxide extraction to obtain the lipids and other valuable products from microalgae. The supercritical fluid extractions are carried out at different temperatures, pressures as well as with different extraction times and carbon dioxide flow rates. Both the lipid yield and composition are considered in order to optimize the supercritical carbon dioxide extraction and to compare its efficiency with the conventional extraction methods. status: publishe...|$|E

The faculty of chemical and natural resources (FKKSA) laboratory is used as model for the drawing. Pressure drop is the main calculation for piping. It will determine either fluid will flow smoothly and reach the next point of the pipe. For the calculation, initial pressure of air is 125 psi and deionized water is 18 psi. The pressure drop percentage must not exceed 30 percent or otherwise the fluid cannot reach the next point of pipe. As the result, the fluid will flow to the final point of pipe because the pressure drop percentage is not exceeding 30 percent. Piping materials also crucial for piping and it is depends on the type of fluid.

40|$|Within {{the field}} of energy storage and charge transfer, the lithium polymer {{batteries}} {{are one of the}} leading technologies, due to their low manufacture cost and their possible variety of packaging shapes. Despite their good thermal stability and very good weight to energy ratio, lithium ion batteries use as a electrolyte system a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate as solvent which have a high risk of deflagration when they come in contact with water. Thus the developement of new materials for lithium-ion-batteries are necessary. For the electrolyte there are special requirements in terms of energy- and power density e. g. in order to minimize thermal loss. High conductivity electrolytes with conductivities in the range of milisiemens are as essential as safe materials, like <b>non</b> <b>flammable</b> non-volatile materials. To fulfill these requirements it is important to develop a polymeric lithium ion conductor, which is free of flammable organic solvents in order to ensure safety.

40|$|The latest legal {{requirements}} call to an increasing degree of purification for plastics, for both virgin and recycled material. Abidance {{by the law}} demands new processing technologies for purifying plastics. The extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide could be an approach. Supercritical carbon dioxide {{is characterized by a}} high diffusion coefficient, a low viscosity and a high density. These properties are determining the outstanding solubility in scCO 2 even for higher molecular substances. Furthermore CO 2 is <b>non</b> <b>flammable,</b> ecologically safe, inexpensive and non toxic. One disadvantage of CO 2 is its low polarity and thus its low solubility for polar substances. The polarity of the extracting agent can be influenced specifically by dosing additional cosolvents like methanol in scCO 2. Carbon dioxide also is a gas which causes the greenhouse effect and should therefore be recycled. The usage of scCO 2 as an extracting agent in a twin screw extruder offers high potential for decreasing the amount of contaminations in the polymer melt. The extraction process is examined in the present paper for cleaning polymer melts. Main objective of the extraction is to remove foreign substances as monomers, solvent residues, processing aids and contaminations, which are diffusing into the interior material by using the plastics. These contaminations are dispersed or dissolved in the polymer. The applicability of a twin screw extruder for purifying polymer melt is analysed for both virgin material (two types of polyamide 12) to remove monomers and specifically contaminated high density polyethylene. To implement the extraction process on a twin screw extruder the compounding process has to be modified regarding this process technology, {{in order to keep the}} CO 2 in its overcritical state at high pressures > 75 bar. This is an additional requirement for common twin screw extruders. Pressure tightness was achieved by using a copper sealing in combination with a sealing paste. For dimensioning the extruder for extraction purposes, the processing unit should feature few linkage points. Besides the pressure tightness of the extruder the screw configuration has to be determined and optimised. A reflow zone following the zone for the CO 2 -outlet is proved to provide the possibility for the carbon dioxide, which is swept away with the polymer, to flow against the polymer flow back to the CO 2 outlet. After elaborating a sufficient process for taking samples, dependences of different processing parameters the extraction effect were researched. In general the highest extraction effect can be realised by increasing pressure, screw speed, processing temperature and the CO 2 -flow. Contrary to this an increased temperature level results in charred melt and a high CO 2 flow has a negative effect on the economy of the extraction process. The integration of a degassing unit and a counter flow process were also investigated. To do so an extruder cascade is inevitable due to safety reasons. Furthermore the extruder cascade facilitates stable processing conditions and simplified process control. Regarding the counter flow processing, the used screw configuration is inappropriate. Due to this improvement of the screw design is inevitable. Industry is reluctant using supercritical fluids despite of the considerable advantages. Reasons for the scepticism can be found in the high investment cost al well as using hegh pressure processing technology. However the increasing relevance of {{legal requirements}} and the progressive development will promote this technology...|$|E
