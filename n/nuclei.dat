5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} have odd atomic numbers; hence, their {{isotopes}} must be either odd–odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or odd–even (proton number is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd <b>nuclei</b> have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even <b>nuclei</b> have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd <b>nuclei</b> are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, {{and are therefore more}} strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E
5|$|At higher pressures, skin {{tension of}} the bubble <b>nuclei</b> reduces gas {{diffusion}} to a slower rate. The model assumes that bubble skins are stabilized by surfactants over calculable times scales, which results in variable persistence of the bubble <b>nuclei</b> in the tissues.|$|E

5|$|In 1917 Rutherford bombarded {{nitrogen}} gas with alpha particles and observed hydrogen <b>nuclei</b> being emitted {{from the gas}} (Rutherford recognized these, because he had previously obtained them bombarding hydrogen with alpha particles, and observing hydrogen <b>nuclei</b> in the products).

5|$|In the far {{future of}} the universe, {{assuming}} that proton decay does not occur, cold fusion occurring via quantum tunnelling would cause the light <b>nuclei</b> in ordinary matter to fuse into 56Fe <b>nuclei.</b> Fission and alpha-particle emission would then make heavy <b>nuclei</b> decay into iron, converting all stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers project {{directly}} to the deep <b>nuclei,</b> but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep <b>nuclei.</b> Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals {{directly to}} the deep <b>nuclei.</b> The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E

5|$|The deep <b>nuclei</b> of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular <b>nuclei,</b> the sole sources of output from the cerebellum. These <b>nuclei</b> receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four <b>nuclei</b> (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform <b>nuclei</b> are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed <b>nuclei</b> belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular <b>nuclei</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{final stage}} {{occurs when a}} massive star begins {{producing}} iron. Since iron <b>nuclei</b> are more tightly bound than any heavier <b>nuclei,</b> any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy. To a very limited degree such a process proceeds, but it consumes energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter <b>nuclei,</b> such energy cannot be released by fission.|$|E
5|$|The {{fusion of}} two <b>nuclei</b> that create larger <b>nuclei</b> with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an {{exothermic}} process that releases {{more energy than}} is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier <b>nuclei,</b> the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing <b>nuclei</b> that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive <b>nuclei</b> can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.|$|E

5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic <b>nuclei</b> to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar <b>nuclei.</b> The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine <b>nuclei.</b> The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine <b>nuclei</b> via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular <b>nuclei,</b> spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular <b>nuclei</b> and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E

5|$|For his {{discovery}} of the neutron, Chadwick was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society in 1932, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935, the Copley Medal in 1950 and the Franklin Medal in 1951. His {{discovery of the}} neutron {{made it possible to}} produce elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by beta decay. Unlike the positively charged alpha particles, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the <b>nuclei</b> of other atoms, neutrons do not need to overcome any Coulomb barrier, and can therefore penetrate and enter the <b>nuclei</b> of even the heaviest elements such as uranium. This inspired Enrico Fermi to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of <b>nuclei</b> with slow neutrons, work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938.|$|E
