Normorphine has been shown to be an effective analgesic in animals (Orahovats and Lehman, 1958). In man, 40 mg of normorphine were equivalent to 10 mg of morphine in the relief of postoperative pain, and no adverse side effects were noted with either drug at these dosages (Lasagna and DeKornfeld, 1958). Houde and Wallenstein (unpublished observations, 1959) compared normorphine and morphine for relief of pain in patients suffering with cancer and found that dose-effect curves of each were parallel, and that morphine was 2. 62 times as potent as normorphine in the relief of this type of pain. Normorphine has been compared with mor-phine for addiction liability. When substituted for morphine in addicted patients normorphine completely suppressed the morphine abstinence syndrome, but the intensity of abstinence ob-served after withdrawal of normorphine in addicted patients was considerably less than that observed following withdrawal of morphine (Fraser et at., 1958). Since these studies indicated that normorphine is an effective analgesic in man and induces less physical dependence as com-pared to morphine, parallel studies were under-taken for the purpose of comparing the human pharmacology of <b>norcodeine</b> (including its addic-tion liability) with that of codeine.

The measured lipophilicity profiles (pH 2 - 11, 0. 15 M KCl matrix) of M 3 G and M 6 G were compared using a proton donor solvent (chloroform) and a proton acceptor solvent (propylene glycol dipelargonate, PGDP), in addition to octanol. The log P values and lipophilicity profiles of M 6 G and M 3 G determined in octanol-water have confirmed the unexpectedly high lipophilicity of the two glucuronides. These results show the importance of measuring the effect of pH on lipophilicity, since log D (pH 7. 4) values gave a notably different order of lipophilicity for the opiates compared with log P.

40|$|The ip {{injection}} of nicotine (2 or 4 mg/kg) to rats produced {{an increase in}} tryptophan pyrrolase activity in liver within 2 hours after drug administration. The elevation in enzyme activity reached a peak at 4 hours after drug injection and returned toward control levels by 6 hours. Administration of 4 mg of nicotine per kilogram to rats 4 times a day for 3 consecutive days produced an elevation of ethylmorphine and <b>norcodeine</b> metabolism in postmitochondrial supernatant fractions from liver. The chronic administration of nicotine (5. 9 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water for 7 days produced an elevation in the metabolism of ethylmorphine, <b>norcodeine,</b> and aniline by liver microsomes. This increased enzyme activity was maintained for 5 weeks when nicotine was continued at that dose. However, if the dose was lowered below 4. 4 mg/kg/day, the increased activity was not maintained. The activities of tryptophan pyrrolase and tyrosine transaminase were not altered by chronic drug treatment. An increase in the capacity of liver microsomes to synthesize protein was observed when nicotine treatment was continued for 4 weeks. These data indicate (1) that an elevation of microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes can be achieved after the acute administration of nicotine, but only when convulsive doses are given several times a day, suggesting that the increased activity after acute drug treatment may be a stress-related event; and (2) that the chronic administration of nicotine can increase the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, possibly by inducing enzyme synthesis...|$|E

All specimens were screened by an opiate [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 100 ng/mL] and oxycodone assay [ELISA, 100 ng/mL or enzyme immunoassay (EIA), 50 ng/mL] and simultaneously tested by LC–MS–MS [limit of quantitation (LOQ) = 50 ng/mL] for 10 opiate analytes (codeine, <b>norcodeine,</b> morphine, hydrocodone, dihydrocodeine, norhydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone). Approximately two-thirds of the specimens were positive for one or more opiate analytes. The number of analytes detected in each specimen varied from 1 to 8 with 3 (34. 8 %) being most prevalent.

METHODS: Ten methadone- and eight buprenorphine-maintained subjects received a single 60 mg dose of codeine phosphate. Blood was collected at 3 h and urine over 6 h and assayed for codeine, <b>norcodeine,</b> morphine, morphine- 3 -and- 6 -glucuronides and codeine- 6 -glucuronide. RESULTS: The urinary metabolic ratio for O-demethylation was significantly higher(P = 0. 0044) in the subjects taking methadone (mean ± SD, 2. 8 ± 3. 1) {{compared with those}} taking buprenorphine (0. 60 ± 0. 43), likewise for 6 -glucuronide formation (0. 31 ± 0. 24 vs. 0. 053 ± 0. 027; P < 0. 0002), {{but there was no}} significant difference(P = 0. 36) in N-demethylation. Similar changes in plasma metabolic ratios were also found. In plasma, compared with those maintained on buprenorphine, the methadone-maintained subjects had increased codeine and <b>norcodeine</b> concentrations (P < 0. 004), similar morphine(P = 0. 72) and lower morphine- 3 - and - 6 - and codeine- 6 -glucuronide concentrations (P < 0. 008). CONCLUSION: Methadone is associated with inhibition of CYP 2 D 6 and UGTs 2 B 4 and 2 B 7 reactions in vivo, even though it is not a substrate for these enzymes. Plasma morphine was not altered, owing to the opposing effects of inhibition of both formation and elimination; however, morphine- 6 -glucuronide(analgesically active) concentrations were substantially reduced.

Recent findings showed that paracetamol may act through cerebral cyclo-oxygenase, descending opioidergic inhibitory pathways, serotonin pathway, and the endocannabinoid system; while codeine activity seems to related not only to its conversion to morphine, as previously known, but also by itself and through its metabolites, such as <b>norcodeine</b> (NORC) and codeine- 6 -glucuronide (C- 6 -G).

Urine samples were prepared by centrifugation to remove large particles and direct injection into the LC-MS-MS. Separation and detection of all compounds was accomplished within 6 rain. Linearity was established for all opiates except 6 MAM from 50 ng/mL to 10, 000 ng/mt; 6 MAM from 0. 25 ng/mt to 50 ng/mL with all correlation coefficients (r) > 0. 99.

Aliquots of the solutions were withdrawn at 3 -day intervals, extracted with organic solvent at basic pH and analyzed by GC-MS before and after trimethylsilylderivatization; where applicable separated compounds were identified by database mass spectral libraries. Other compounds were tentatively characterized from GC-MS data and reaction mechanistic interpretations. At neutral pH, codeine was partially oxidized to <b>norcodeine</b> and codeinone while at basic pH only the former compound was formed. In both cases, light had no effect. In the acidic solutions exposed to light, codeine was autoxidized to two products which were tentatively characterized as epimeric forms of 10 -hydroxycodeine. None of the three products was detected in pharmaceutical preparations of codeine or in opium. The nature of the oxidation products of codeine in aqueous solution is determined by the state of protonation of the molecule as well as by the presence or absence of photo effects.

The required submicrosomal components for benzphetamine demethylation, as determined either by formaldehyde liberation or by NADPH oxidation, are cytochrome P- 450, NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase, and a heat-stable lipid fraction. Similar re-quirements were shown for the oxidation of aminopyrine, ethylmorphine, and hexobarbital. Laurate and benzphetamine were found to be mutually inhibitory, as would be expected if a common "methyl hydroxylase " were involved.

The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for AC was 0. 5 and 1. 0 pg/L. The LOD of the other analytes was 2. 0 pg/L and the LOQs ranged from 2 to 10 pg/L. The assay was linear for each analyte from the LOQ to 200 pg/L or 400 pg/L (morphine and codeine) with r> _ 0. 996, except for diacetylmorphine which was linear to 100 pg/L with r = 0. 994. The within-run and between-run precision were below 10 % CV for all analytes. There was no significant hydrolysis of AC to codeine in urine (pH 4. 7 and 8. 0) after 23 weeks of refrigeration or freezing. After storage at room temperature in urine of pH 8. 0, AC was completely hydrolyzed after 5 weeks, but at pH 4. 7, 58 % of the AC remained after 15 weeks of storage at room temperature. The sensitivity of this assay was adequate to detect AC in the urine of heroin abusers. In preliminary studies, AC was detected in 6 of 69 opiate positive urines.

Opiates have been used and misused for thousand of years and addiction to them develops both in humans and in animals. The mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not fully understood. We examined {{the roles of the}} neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor for glutamate, two of the most important anti-opioid neurotransmitter systems, in the development of morphine tolerance. An antagonist of CCK-B receptors acutely partially reversed established morphine tolerance, indicating a role for CCK through activation of CCK-B receptors in maintaining morphine tolerance. The role of the NMDA receptor in the development of morphine tolerance was not so clear, because NMDA antagonists of different types significantly potentiated morphine analgesia both in drug naive and morphine tolerant rats. The combination of a CCK-B antagonist and NMDA antagonist did not potentiate each other. We also examined the role of genetic differences in opiate sensitivity and the development of tolerance among four rat strains: Sprague-Dawley, Spontaneously Hypertensive, Wistar-Kyoto and Dark Agouti. Significant differences in sensitivity to nociceptive stimulation, response to morphine, morphine tolerance and withdrawal and in opioid-NMDA receptor interactions was observed among the different strains of rats, some of which may be of genetic origin. Both gender and strain differences in codeine metabolism were observed. Female rats did not form <b>norcodeine</b> via N-demethylation in any of the four strains. Both male and female Dark Agouti rats showed deficits in the formation of morphine via O-demethylation of codeine as a result of reduced CYP 2 D 1 enzyme activity.

The use of a QTOF instrument enabled the simultaneous application of two acquisition functions with different collision energies: a low energy (LE) function, where none or poor fragmentation took place, and a high energy (HE) function, where fragmentation in the collision cell was promoted. This approach, known as MSE, enabled the simultaneous acquisition of full-spectrum accurate mass data of both protonated molecules and fragment ions in a single injection, providing relevant information that facilitates the rapid detection and reliable identification of these emerging contaminants in the sample matrices analyzed. In addition, isomeric compounds, like the opiates, morphine and <b>norcodeine,</b> could be discriminated by their specific fragments observed in HE TOF MS spectra, without the need of reference standards. UHPLC–QTOF MS was {{proven to be a}} powerful and efficient technique for rapid wide-scope screening and identification of many relevant drugs in complex matrices, such as influent and effluent urban wastewater.

40|$|Thirteen healthy volunteers {{participating}} in anopen and randomized study received two single doses (25 and 50 rag) of codeine orally two weeks apart. Urine concentrations f opiates were studied for 96 h, and plasma concentrations of codeine and the metabolites codeine- 6 -glucuronide (C 6 G), morphine, morphine- 3 -glucuronide (M 3 G), and morphine- 6 -glucuronide (M 6 G) were monitored for 24 h. Plasma was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Measurements of urine {{were made with}} the EMIT opiate-screening assay and with gas chromatography-mass pectrometry for total (conjugates liberated by acid hydrolysis) codeine, morphine, and <b>norcodeine.</b> In urine, the ratio between total recovered morphine a d codeine as expressed in percent ranged from 2. 3 to 23. 3 % with a mean value of 9. 8 %. This ratio increased with time, and, in all but three subjects, rose to greater than 1 after 22 - 36 h. In 58 % of cases, this occurred within the detection time in the EMIT assay. The detection time in the EMIT screening assay {{was found to be}} 20 - 39 h after the 25 -rag dose and 30 - 52 h after the 50 -rag dose. Elimination rates calculated from urine data corrected for creatinine concentration showed that morphine was eliminated more slowly than codeine. In plasma, the highest concentrations and area-under-curve values were observed for C 6 G, followed by codeine and M 3 G. All compounds had peak plasma values 1 - 2 h after dosing. The elimination of M 3 G was slower than that of C 6 G. We concluded that the relative proportion of codeine and morphine varies both between individuals nd as a function of time and that morphine may be present in concentrations above those of codeine even after moderate nd single doses of codeine. This must be taken into consideration when interpreting the presence of opiates during drugs-of-abuse testing...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study whether a {{quadrupole}} time-of-flight (QToF) mass analyzer, coupled to an ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system, can be a valuable alternative for a triple-quadrupole (QqQ) mass analyzer, for quantitative toxicological purposes. The case study considered was the quantification of 16 opioids (6 -monoacetylmorphine, buprenorphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, norbuprenorphine, <b>norcodeine,</b> norfentanyl, oxycodone, oxymorphone, pholcodine and tilidine) in human plasma. Both methods were validated in parallel in terms of selectivity, matrix effects, extraction recovery, carry-over, bias, precision and sensitivity. Accuracy-profile methodology {{was used to determine}} the optimal calibration model, and to estimate bias, repeatability, intermediate precision and total error. Selectivity was demonstrated for all opioids and deuterated analogues, except for codeine-d 3 on the UHPLC-QTOF. For most compounds, extraction recoveries were in the range 60 to 80 % on both systems, except for the synthetic analogues, buprenorphine, fentanyl and tilidine, where large variability is observed. Carry-over was negligible on both systems. For different opioids, the optimal calibration model was different between the systems. The accuracy profiles {{of the majority of the}} opioids indicated that, over the entire tested concentration range, for more than 5 % of the future measurements, total errors are expected to exceed the a priori defined 15 % acceptance limit. For some exceptions, however, the measurements even suffer from total errors above 30 %, which can be attributed to the solid phase extraction procedure that was applied as sample pretreatment technique. Sensitivity was generally tenfold better on the LC-QToF system, probably due to the difference in ion choice for quantification between both systems. In conclusion, the best performing system seemed to depend on the compound, on the parameter and even on the concentration. Accuracy profiles clearly provided valuable information complementary to that obtained in classical validation tests, and therefore preferably are taken into account when deciding on a method's performance.

40|$|Oral fluid {{specimens}} (N = 1406) {{were collected}} from 19 subjects prior to and up to 72 h following controlled administration of oral codeine. Volunteers provided informed consent {{to participate in this}} National Institute on Drug Abuse Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. A modification of Cozart Microplate Opiate EIA Oral Fluid Kit (Opiate ELISA), employing codeine calibrators, was used for semiquantitative analysis of opiates, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the confirmation and quantitation of codeine, <b>norcodeine,</b> morphine, and normorphine in oral fluid. GC-MS limits of detection and quantitation were 2. 5 microg/L for all analytes. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has proposed a 40 -microg/L opiate screening and a 40 -microg/L morphine or codeine confirmation cutoff for the detection of opiate use. Oral fluid opiate screening and confirmation cutoffs of 30 micro g/L are in use in the U. K. Utilizing 2. 5 -, 20 -, 30 -, and 40 -microg/L GC-MS cutoffs, 26 %, 20 %, 19 %, and 18 % of the oral fluid specimens were positive for codeine or one of its metabolites. Six Opiate ELISA/confirmation cutoff criteria (2. 5 / 2. 5, 10 / 2. 5, 20 / 20, 30 / 20, 30 / 30, and 40 / 40 microg/L) were evaluated. Calculations for Opiate ELISA sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency were determined from the number of true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative results at each screening/confirmation cutoff. Sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency for the lowest cutoff were 91. 5 %, 88. 6 %, and 89. 3 %. Application of the cutoff currently used in the U. K. yielded sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency results of 79. 7 %, 99. 0 %, and 95. 4 % and similar results of 76. 7 %, 99. 1 %, and 95. 1 % when applying the SAMHSA criteria. These data indicate that the Opiate ELISA efficiently detects oral codeine use. In addition, the data, collected following controlled oral codeine administration, may aid in the interpretation of opiate oral fluid test results and in the selection of appropriate oral fluid screening and confirmation cutoffs...|$|E
