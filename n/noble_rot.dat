5|$|Togusa tracks {{down one}} of the missing children, now {{assigned}} to an elderly man in the <b>Noble</b> <b>Rot</b> program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State. Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of the <b>Noble</b> <b>Rot</b> Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.|$|E

All the children are listed as the children of <b>Noble</b> <b>Rot</b> Senior Citizens and Section 9 begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when {{they are part of}} a larger body of 20,000 children. Soon afterwards, the Puppeteer causes the disappearance of the sixteen children and Batou reveals to Togusa that he believes Kusanagi to be the Puppeteer. Section 9 next intercepts a Siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of Ka Rum's assassination. After his capture it is revealed the informant and the target are one in the same. The sniper says that the Puppeteer is a mechanism in the Solid State and cannot be killed.|$|E

25|$|With optimal {{ripeness}} {{and balance}} between acidity and sugars {{being such a}} viticultural priority for Chenin blanc, many growers (such {{as those in the}} Loire Valley) will harvest the grapes in tries or successive pickings through the vineyards. During each series of picking only the ripest clusters or individual grapes are harvested by hand during a period that could last four to six weeks and include three to six passes through the vineyard. For the production of sweet botrytized wines, pickers will look for the grapes that have achieved the necessary amount of the <b>noble</b> <b>rot.</b> In hot and dry years where no <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> occurs, pickers may leave ripened grapes on the vine long enough to shrivel, or passerillé, where it could later be effected by <b>noble</b> <b>rot.</b> In areas that experience a lot of vintage variation, winemakers may decide on a day by day basis what style and dryness of Chenin blanc they could make, with the grapes harvested during each tries going to different styles of wine. For some producers in Vouvray, which may have up to six tries during harvest, the first few tries could go to sparkling and dry wine production while the later tries could go towards sweet wine production.|$|E
25|$|Semillon B: a grape {{originally}} from Bordeaux vineyards, {{it is the}} main variety used for sweet wines from Bordeaux and Bergerac due to its ability to take the <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> It possesses a fig-like characteristic and is often paired with Sauvignon blanc to mellow its strong berry-like flavours.|$|E
25|$|However, {{for some}} sweet wines, a {{successful}} harvest requires manual work {{and training for}} pickers to pick only clusters where the berries have reached optimum ripeness or {{have been affected by}} <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> (for the Sélection de Grains Nobles). For sparkling wines hand picking is recommended and it is absolutely necessary for white wines from grapes with coloured skin.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{produced}} {{in the region of}} Barsac, such as Premiers Crus Château Climens and Château Coutet are allowed to be labeled either with the commune name or with Sauternes. The intense sweetness {{is the result of the}} grapes being affected by Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that is commonly known as <b>noble</b> <b>rot.</b> In the autumn, the Ciron river produces mist that descends upon the area and persists until after dawn. These conditions are conducive to the growth of the fungus which desiccates the grape and concentrates the sugars inside. The three main grapes of this area are Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle.|$|E
25|$|The Chenin blanc grapevine buds {{early in}} the growing season and ripens mid to late in the harvest year. However, in warm years, the balance between the Loire's {{marginal}} climate and the warmth needed to attain full ripeness {{has the potential of}} producing wines with some depth of complexity and finesse. The age of the vine can have an influence on wine quality, with older vines producing naturally lower yields. When infected by <b>noble</b> <b>rot,</b> which also lowers yields and adds and intensifies certain flavors, the wines develop less overtly floral aroma notes but more depth and layers.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} YAN that winemakers {{will see in}} their grape musts depends {{on a number of}} {{components}} including grape variety, rootstock, vineyard soils and viticultural practices (such as the use of fertilizers and canopy management) as well as the climate conditions of particular vintages. Infections by mold, such as Botrytis cinerea (known as <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> when it is desired) can reduce the amino acid content of grape must by as much as 61%. Some regions are noted for having low YAN such as Washington State which during a typical vintage will have 90% of tested must below 400mg N/L and nearly a quarter be below 150mg N/L.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} types of white wine, dry white wine is the most common. More or less {{aromatic}} and tangy, it {{is derived from the}} complete fermentation of the wort. Sweet wines, on the other hand, are produced by interrupting the fermentation before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol; this is called Mutage or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, passerillage (straining), or the use of <b>Noble</b> <b>rot.</b> Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are wines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the bottle is opened.|$|E
25|$|Sweet white wines. In several {{locations}} and appellations throughout the region, sweet white wine {{is made from}} Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle grapes affected by <b>noble</b> <b>rot.</b> The best-known of these appellations is Sauternes, which also has an official classification, and {{where some of the}} world's most famous sweet wines are produced. There are also appellations neighboring Sauternes, {{on both sides of the}} Garonne river, where similar wines are made. These include Loupiac, Cadillac, and Sainte Croix du Mont. The regional appellation for sweet white wines is Bordeaux Supérieur Blanc. In 2007, 3.2% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the wine}} regions in Anjou are located south of the river Loire, with the one notable {{exception}} of Savennières which {{is located on the}} right bank of the river just south of Angers. The tributaries of the Loire, particularly the Layon and Aubance, play significant roles in the area's wine production with vineyard planted on their right banks and sheltered from wind by nearby hill sides. The Aubance and Layon flow parallel to each other going northwest towards the Loire and when the climate is favorable can help promote the development of <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> that {{is at the heart of}} the region's sweet wine production.|$|E
25|$|The aromas {{and flavor}} notes of Chenin blanc often include the {{descriptors}} of minerally, greengage, angelica and honey. Chenin wines produced from <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> will often have notes of peaches and honey that develop into barley sugar, marzipan, and quince as they age. Dry or semi-sweet Chenin blanc from the Loire will often have notes apple, greengage, and chalky minerals that develop into more honey, acacia, and quince aromas. New World styles of Chenin, {{such as those}} of South Africa, are more often made to be consume young and exhibit rich tropical fruit notes such as banana, guava, pear, and pineapple. The alcohol level for dessert styles Chenin rarely goes above 12%, which keeps the wines more in balance. Drier styles of Chenin {{are more likely to be}} around 13.5%.|$|E
25|$|Coteaux du Layon AOC This large {{appellation}} overlaps the Saumur AOC to {{the southeast}} and the Anjou Coteaux de la Loire AOC in the northwest. The region {{has a long history}} of winemaking sweet white wines dating back to the 4th century AD. Today the AOC is dedicated to 100% Chenin blanc wines that, in favorable years, are afflicted by <b>noble</b> <b>rot.</b> Yields are restricted to a maximum of 30 hectoliters per hectare and wines must have a minimum 12% alcohol level in order to qualify for AOC designation. In 2003 mandatory harvest sugar levels being increased from 204grams per liter to 221 g/l or 294 g/l for the newly established Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN) designation and minimum residual sugar levels in the finished wines increased from 17 g/l to 34 g/l.|$|E
25|$|The region around Vouvray, Montlouis-sur-Loire and Touraine {{has some}} of the most diverse plantings of all the Loire region and makes a wide variety of white, red and rosé wines. For white wines the main grape is Chenin blanc but Sauvignon blanc and (to a smaller extent) Chardonnay is also planted. For red wines the main grape is Cabernet franc with some smaller plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay and Malbec. The rosé wines are made from an {{assortment}} of Gamay, Pineau d'aunis, Pinot gris and Pinot noir. The villages of Vouvray and Montlouis are the largest appellations in the region and make only white wines from Chenin blanc. The wines can vary in sweetness from bone dry (often appearing as sec on the wine label) to very sweet moelleux wines that are often infected by <b>noble</b> <b>rot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (<b>noble</b> <b>rot)</b> form a harmonious whole.|$|E
25|$|Located {{along the}} right {{bank of the}} Loire river east {{of the city of}} Tours, the Vouvray region is {{situated}} on top a plateau that is dissected by small streams and tributaries of the Loire such as the Cisse and its tributary the River Brenne. These streams contribute to the unique climate conditions that promote the development of the Botrytis cinerea fungus that causes the <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> used to produce sweet dessert style wines. The climate of the region is mostly continental with some maritime influence from the Atlantic Ocean located more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the west. Wine production in the region is highly dependent on the climate with significant vintage variation expressed year due to the variable climate. Cooler climate years shift the bulk of production towards drier styles of wine including sparkling Vouvray. More warmer climate years promote the production of sweeter, dessert style wines.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the wine}} renaissance of the 1960s, {{the quality of}} California's dessert and {{fortified}} wines have been dramatically improved. Beringer {{was one of the}} first to create a botrytized wine from Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. Though unlike in Sauternes, Beringer's wine was made of grapes regularly harvested and then introduced at the winery to Botrytis cinerea spores created in a laboratory. Since then California winemakers in places like the Anderson Valley AVA have found vineyards where this <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> can occur naturally on the grapes. The Anderson and Alexander Valley AVAs have also developed a reputation for their Late Harvest wines made from Riesling. Several French and Italian style Muscat wines are produced throughout California and are known for their intense aromatics and balanced acidity. The port-style wines in California are often made from the traditional Portuguese wine grapes like Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão and Tinta Roriz. Some uniquely Californian styles are also made from Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.|$|E
25|$|As can be {{seen from}} the table, Grüner Veltliner is the {{dominant}} white grape in Austria, producing generally dry wines ranging from short-lived Heuriger wines to Spätleses capable of long life. The ancient Welschriesling variety is used in the <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> dessert wines of the Neusiedlersee; it also makes undistinguished dry wines for drinking young, as does Müller-Thurgau (Rivaner). Neuburger was supposedly found as flotsam in the Danube in the 1850s, but is now known to be a cross between Silvaner and the ancient Roter Veltliner. Frühroter Veltliner is also known as Malvasier, suggesting a link to the Malvasia grape family of the Eastern Mediterranean. Muscat Ottonel is used in dessert wines from the Neusiedlersee, as is Bouvier, which is related to the muscat family and is a parent of the Orémus (Zéta) grape used in Tokaji. There were high hopes for Goldburger, a cross between Welschriesling and Orangetraube bred in Klosterneuburg, but after an initial wave of planting, enthusiasm has dimmed. Zierfandler (Spätrot) and Rotgipfler are local grapes of the Thermenregion, and are often blended together as Spätrot-Rotgipfler. It is worth noting that Pinot gris is known as Ruländer in Austria, and sometimes as Grauburgunder; Pinot blanc is known as Weißburgunder or Weissburgunder, and Sauvignon blanc is called Muskat Sylvaner. Riesling plays a much smaller role than in Germany, but the relatively small amount grown is used for some of Austria's most appreciated dry white wines.|$|E

2500|$|... "noble rot" [...] is {{a method}} of {{concentration}} depending on climatic conditions. The Botrytis cinerea creates microscopic perforations of the grape skin through which water is allowed to evaporate while maintaining the other components. The action of botrytis induces different flavours in the grape related to chemical reactions in the berry. The precocity of the varietal-land and low vigour of the vine are favourable to the action of <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> and helps prevent gray rot. This type of grape {{is used for the}} production of Hungarian Tokaji, Fortified wines of Aquitaine (Sauternes, Barsac, Loupiac, Monbazillac, etc.), and some selections of <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> berries in Alsace and Germany: Trockenbeerenauslese ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{made from}} {{selected}} overripe shrivelled grapes often affected by <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> making extremely rich sweet wines. [...] "Trocken" [...] in this phrase {{refers to the}} grapes being dried on the vine rather than the resulting wine being a dry style.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} event {{took place in}} 1775 at Schloss Johannisberg in Rheingau, when the courier delivering the harvest permission was delayed for two weeks, {{with the result that}} most of the grapes in Johannisberg's Riesling-only vineyard had been affected by <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> before the harvest began. Unexpectedly, these [...] "rotten grapes" [...] gave a very good sweet wine, which was termed Spätlese, meaning late harvest. From this time, late harvest wines from grapes affected by <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> have been produced intentionally. The subsequent differentiation of wines based on harvested ripeness, starting with Auslese in 1787, laid the ground for the Prädikat system. These laws, introduced in 1971, define the designations still used today.|$|E
2500|$|Chenin B: a French grape {{from the}} Loire Valley, {{it is also}} grown in South Africa. It yields a very fruity wine, {{sometimes}} mineral, dry, or sweet depending on the soil. It can be kept {{for a long time}} and take on the <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{made from}} very ripe, hand {{selected}} bunches, typically semi-sweet or sweet, sometimes with some <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> character. Sometimes Auslese is also {{made into a}} powerful dry wine, but the designation Auslese trocken has been discouraged after the introduction of Grosses Gewächs. Auslese is the Prädikat which covers the widest range of wine styles, and can be a dessert wine.|$|E
2500|$|Sauternes is a French sweet {{wine from}} the Sauternais {{region of the}} Graves section in [...] Bordeaux. Sauternes is made from Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc, and Muscadelle grapes that have been {{affected}} by Botrytis cinerea, also known as <b>noble</b> <b>rot.</b> This causes the grapes to become partially raisined, resulting in concentrated and distinctively flavored wines. Due to its climate, Sauternes {{is one of the few}} wine regions where infection with <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> is a frequent occurrence. Even so, production is a hit-or-miss proposition, with widely varying harvests from vintage to vintage. Wines from Sauternes, especially the Premier Cru Supérieur estate Château d'Yquem, can be very expensive, due largely to the very high cost of production. Barsac lies within Sauternes, and is entitled to use either name. Somewhat similar but less expensive and typically less-distinguished wines are produced in the neighboring regions of Monbazillac, Cérons, Loupiac and Cadillac. In the United States, there is a semi-generic label for sweet white dessert wines known as sauterne without the [...] "s" [...] at the end and uncapitalized.|$|E
2500|$|The {{east side}} of the Neusiedler See is also known as Seewinkel, [...] "corner of the lake". The shallow Neusiedler See (Lake Neusiedl) {{is one of the few}} places on earth where <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> attacks grapes {{reliably}} every year. This means that botrytised dessert wines can be made more easily, and hence sold more cheaply, than in other areas famous for this style of wine. Increasingly, red wine is also being made in this region.|$|E
2500|$|The {{enrichment}} {{of some of}} {{the population}} created a craze for rare wines. This phenomenon, which was already responsible for the development of sherry in England, was reproduced in Central Europe. The discovery of the benefits of the <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> on white grapes took place around 1650 in Hungary for the development of Tokaji wine. Hugh Johnson declared that: [...] "the Tokay of three centuries ago was the best sweet wine in the world, it was inherited from a long-standing winemaking tradition". Developed with a grape whose exceptional maturity is due to a trade secret, this wine is also developed its qualities through a process which long remained a secret in underground cellars of the winery. Prized by the House of Habsburg, Tokay experienced profitable trading. Attempted imitation came to nought and the use of <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> remained a secret. It was not until 120 years later that a method of very late harvest was experimented with on the steep banks of the Rhine. Its use in Sauternes was attested in 1836 in the Château La Tour Blanche but at that time very late harvest gave a very rich wine that required several years to age in barrels.|$|E
2500|$|... {{made from}} grapes {{that have been}} {{naturally}} frozen on the vine, making a very concentrated wine. Must reach at least {{the same level of}} sugar content in the must as a Beerenauslese. The most classic Eiswein style is to use only grapes that are not affected by <b>noble</b> <b>rot.</b> Until the 1980s, the Eiswein designation was used in conjunction with another Prädikat (which indicated the ripeness level of the grapes before they had frozen), but is now considered a Prädikat of its own.|$|E
2500|$|The chief viticultural hazard in the Hunter Valley is {{the threat}} posed by vintage season rains. Site {{selection}} on well drained soils are considered of vital importance and much effort is put into ensuring the canopy is open so air flow can help dry the grapes off. [...] Of particular concern is bunch rot often caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea. In the production of late harvest wines, such as Semillon, Botrytis can be desirable and is known as <b>noble</b> <b>rot.</b> But for other grape varieties, particularly red wine grapes, the fungus is unwelcome with its infection described as grey rot.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, Pedro Ximénez {{is known}} under the synonym of Pedro {{and has been}} {{historically}} used in producing unfortified, sweet sticky wines infected with <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> and labeled as [...] "Pedro Sauterne" [...] (in reference to the French dessert wine Sauternes). While the grape was once widely planted in the irrigated vineyards of New South Wales {{near the town of}} Griffith, in recent years plantings have declined. Some limited plantings of the grape can still be found in Western Australia in the Margaret River region, in the Barossa Valley of South Australia and the Rutherglen region of Victoria where—despite Rutherglen's reputation for dessert wines—Pedro Ximénez is often used to produce dry, unfortified wines.|$|E
2500|$|Wine {{production}} {{in this area}} is highly variable and dependent on climate conditions, with cooler years promoting the production of dry (sec) and sparkling Vouvray while warmer, more favorable vintage encourages the production of sweet moelleux or liquoreux styles produced by <b>noble</b> <b>rot</b> {{in a manner similar to}} the sweet dessert wines of Sauternes. With the naturally high acidity of Chenin blanc, Vouvrays from favorable vintages have immense aging potential, with some examples drinking well into 100 years of age. [...] However, it is more common to find a well aged Vouvray peaking at the 40 year mark. Across the Loire River from Vouvray is the Montlouis AOC which produces Chenin blanc based wines like Vouvray that tend to have less acidity and concentration of flavor.|$|E
2500|$|Furmint can be {{produced}} {{in a variety of}} styles ranging from bone dry to extremely sweet wines afflicted by <b>noble</b> <b>rot.</b> The grape has the potential to produce wines with naturally high levels of acidity with complex flavors derived from phenolic compounds in the juice and through brief contact with the grape skins. Furmint wines, particularly the botrytized dessert wines, can have immense aging potential with some well made examples from favorable vintages continuing to age for over a century. These wines, described by wine expert Oz Clarke as nearly [...] "immortal", are most often the aszú style wines of Tokaji made from the top 10-15% of Furmint harvested. This potential comes from the balance of acidity and high levels of sugars in the wine which act as preservatives during the aging process.|$|E
