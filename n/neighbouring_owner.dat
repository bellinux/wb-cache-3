40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a mixed method data collection. The study {{is part of the}} Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme. It is widely accepted, at least in principle, that most kinds of natural resources are best handled collaboratively. Collaborative management avoids conflict and enhances the efficiency with which the resource is managed. However, simply knowing that collaboration is a good idea does not guarantee that collaboration can be achieved. In this project, the researchers have addressed issues of conflict and collaboration in ecological resource management using the example of wild deer in Britain. Deer are an excellent example since they highlight problems around ownership and because they offer both societal benefits and drawbacks. Wild deer are not owned, though the land they occupy is. As deer move around, they usually cross ownership boundaries and thus provoke potential conflicts between <b>neighbouring</b> <b>owners</b> who have differing management goals. Deer themselves are valued and a key component of the natural environment, but their feeding commonly limits or prevents woodland regeneration and can thus be harmful to ecological quality. Deer provide jobs but they also provoke traffic accidents. This study used a variety of methods from across the natural and social sciences, including choice experiments, semi-structured interviews with individuals and focus groups. It also incorporated the use of participatory GIS to map deer distributions and habitat preferences in conjunction with stakeholders. The study confirmed conventional wisdom about the importance of collaboration. However, it also showed that there were many barriers to achieving effective collaboration in practice, such as contrasting objectives, complex governance arrangements, power imbalances and personal relationships. Mechanisms for enhancing collaboration, such as incentives and incorporating deer within broader landscape management objectives, were examined. Though these proposals were worked out for the case of deer, {{they are likely to be}} applicable much more widely and should be considered in other cases of disputed or rapidly changing ecological resource management. Ecology data from this study are available at the Environmental Information Data Centre of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Further information and documentation for this study may be found through the RELU Knowledge Portal: Collaborative deer management. Main Topics : Wild deer, ecological resource management, conflict and collaboration, participation, stakeholders, and local knowledge. <br...|$|R
40|$|Elaborate {{secondary}} sexual traits {{offset the}} costs that they impose on their bearer by facilitating reproductive benefits, through increased success in intrasexual contests or increased attractiveness to choosy mates. Some traits enhance both strategies. Conversely, I show that spotted bowerbirds Chlamydera maculata may face a trade-off. The trait that best predicts their mating success, numbers of Solanum berries exhibited on a bower, also provokes increased intrasexual aggression {{in the form}} of bower destructions by <b>neighbouring</b> bower <b>owners,</b> which reduce the quality of the male's bower. At natural berry numbers, levels of mating success in the population are skewed, but levels of destruction do not vary with berry number. When berry numbers are artificially exaggerated, increased levels of destructions occur, but mating success does not increase. When offered excess berries, either to add to the bower or artificially placed on the bower, bower owners preferred to use numbers of berries related to the number that they displayed naturally. This decision is made without direct experience of the attendant changes in destruction or mating success. This indicates that bower owners may assess their own social standing in relation to their neighbours and modulate their display accordingly...|$|R
50|$|The {{first piece}} of land reform {{legislation}} in the 21st century, the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 {{was passed by the}} Scottish Parliament on 3 May 2000 and received royal assent on 9 June the same year. The act formed the core of a three part reform of Scottish property law, alongside the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003 and Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004. The main provisions of the act included the abolition of feudal superiorities and tenure, {{to be replaced by a}} system of outright ownership in which those who had been vassals became outright owners. This necessitated the extinction of superiors’ rights to collect feu duties, for which they were entitled to compensation in the form of a single payment of a size that, when invested at an annual rate of 2.5%, would yield interest equal to the former feu duty. However, as Scotland's remaining feu duties had been fixed many years previously, inflation meant that by the time of the act’s passing their value was, in most cases, effectively nominal. The act also extinguished superiors’ rights to enforce real burdens, conditions on the holding of land, retaining only those conditions enforceable by <b>neighbouring</b> land <b>owners</b> or by certain legal bodies on public policy grounds. The legal basis of real burdens and title conditions was then reformulated in the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003. The end of feudal tenure simplified titles to land, while the subsequent Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003 modernised the types of interests and conditions that can be attached to those titles. Finally, common law surrounding tenements was then reformed in light of these changes under the Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004, completing the abolition of Scotland's feudal property system.|$|R
40|$|The Ontario Tobacco Control Act of 1994 {{imposed a}} total ban on smoking in schools, and on school {{property}} for every {{school in the}} province. The imposition of this policy created problems for school administrators. For instance, students who were smoking on walkways and properties adjacent to school boundaries, clashed with <b>neighbouring</b> property <b>owners</b> who were angry about the resulting damage and disruption. The enforcement of this policy consumes valuable resources at each school; therefore, knowledge {{about the impact of}} the policy is important. If effective, this policy has the potential to improve the health of students over their lifetime, by preventing or delaying smoking behaviour. Alternatively, an ineffective policy will continue to create administrative problems for the school and serve no legitimate purpose. Therefore, knowledge {{about the impact of the}} smoking ban policy on students' smoking intentions assists policy makers and school administrators in their understanding of the policy's impact within the schools. This research provided an impact evaluation of the ban on smoking in schools and on school property in Ontario. A total of 2069 students, from five high schools, in the Niagara Region, provided complete responses to a survey, designed to test whether smoking intentions were affected by the imposition of the policy. The study used Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991), specifically, the perceived behavioural control measure, to gain some understanding of students' perceptions of control over smoking imposed by the ban. The findings indicate the policy has the potential to influence students' overall smoking intentions. The ban on smoking policy was found to be a significant predictor of the smoking intentions of high school students. As well, attitude, social norms, and perceptions of control were significant predictors of smoking intentions. Exploratory findings also indicated differences between the control beliefs of students from different high schools, indicating potential differences in the enforcement of the smoking ban between schools. The findings also support the utility of the theory of planned behaviour as a methodology for evaluating the influence of punitive policies. This research study should be continued by utilizing the full theory of planned behaviour, including two phases of data collection and the measurement of actual smoking behaviour...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} conundrums facing evolutionary biologists is how variation between individuals is maintained in situations where there {{is expected to be}} strong directional selection on an elaborate male trait. Sexual selection via female choice leads to the evolution of elaborate male traits, and consensus among females in their mate choice decisions can result in high reproductive skew. Such strong directional selection pressure may be expected to reduce genetic variation over time, yet high levels of inter-individual variation sustain such preferences. In this thesis I explored potential mechanisms that may maintain variation between individuals {{in one of the most}} unusual and exaggerated avian male traits; the bowers displayed by male spotted bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus maculatus. Choosy females exert strong selection pressure on males, yet males vary widely in their ability to exhibit a high quality display. 	My results showed that male bower owners were remarkably consistent in their display of decorations, a trait expected to experience a high level of fluctuation due to variation in the ecological and social environment. Given the range of factors that may introduce inconsistency, my results suggest that males actively maintain consistent displays, although I found no evidence for the adaptive benefits of doing so. I then explored three mechanisms that may be expected to maintain variation in bowerbird display. I found that attending the bower imposed physical costs on males, but these costs were only apparent in seasons of environmental stress. Males varied in their cognitive and problem-solving abilities, but I found no impact of higher cognitive performance on a male’s reproductive fitness. The final mechanism I tested was the impact of the social environment on male mating success. I found that males actively engage in marauding, a form of intrasexual competition targeting the bowers of rival males. Marauding was highly targeted and non-random within the population, and predominantly occurred between <b>neighbouring</b> bower <b>owners.</b> However, I was unable to determine what factors predicted these non-random interactions, and found no impact of the marauding rates experienced on male mating success. 	In the final part of this study, I looked at the novel occurrence of collaborative display between male bower owners and other non-bower-owning males. I found that these auxiliary males may gain delayed benefits from attending the bowers of experienced males, but was unable to determine what impact contributions from auxiliaries had on bower owning males and females attempting to assess them. I conclude by discussing the implications of my results for models of sexual selection...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{land and}} the things on it can be enjoyed {{by a number of}} people at once, the law must {{accommodate}} multiple interests in its ownership rules, and often determine whose interests have priority. When the freehold of land is owned by one person, no conflict will arise in who has priority of its use. In the Latin phrase, Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, one may, in general, use property in any way so long as it harms nobody else. This gives the owner the sole right to bring claims in crime or tort, particularly for others causing a nuisance, or committing a trespass, against the owner's peaceful enjoyment of property. Depending on the nature of interference, an owner may also have claims for compensation against state authorities who seek to compulsorily purchase property, or state officials who wish to enter or search property. However, when more than one person is interested in real estate, rules of ownership priority are needed to determine who may bring claims. Rules must also determine the content of rights that the interested parties have among one another. First of all, land may be co-owned in two main ways. In a [...] "joint tenancy", the law presumes owners agree that if one owner dies, his or her whole share will pass to the other owners. The case law primarily deals with the conditions under which a tenant's share will be severed to create a [...] "tenancy in common", where there is no right to survivorship, and then under what conditions a tenant in common may require the property be sold to realise its value. Second, owners may lease their property to tenants for a defined period of time. The law also recognises that owners may simply licence their property for use by others, which in theory creates only personal rights. Largely because more statutory and common law privileges attach to leases, the courts have been careful to police the boundary between the two. Third, English property law recognises the ability to charge or mortgage assets to a lender with a loan contract. This means that if the owner defaults on repayments, the lender has the security of being permitted to take possession of and to sell the property. And fourth, <b>neighbouring</b> property <b>owners</b> may create rights to use or restrict each other's use of their land through easements and covenants. Although such things may arise by agreement, English law acknowledges their proprietary character, and so they bind successors in title.|$|R
40|$|With {{a declining}} {{population}} of roughly 3000 - 5000 individuals in Africa, African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) {{are one of}} the most endangered carnivores in the world. As the global human population expands, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that large portions of land will be set aside for conservation, especially in developing countries. Thus, recent wild dog conservation efforts in South Africa have concentrated on establishing a managed metapopulation. A metapopulation is a group of geographically isolated subpopulations of a species that are managed (using supplementation and harvesting) to mimic natural gene flow. The Great Fish River Nature Reserve (GFRNR) in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa has been identified as a potential reserve to become part of the national wild dog metapopulation. My research aimed to conduct a feasibility assessment of the long-term (~ 25 years) success of a wild dog reintroduction into the GFRNR. This assessment included biological modelling of wild dogs and their expected prey, and determining the potential anthropogenic threats to wild dogs on the private and communal land surrounding the reserve. I used VORTEX population modelling and determined that the GFRNR is likely to have a wild dog carrying capacity of ~ 22 individuals. Using a 25 -year modelling simulation, the most appropriate wild dog reintroduction scenario would be to reintroduce six females and four males initially and supplement the population with one female and two males in years 3, 10, 15 and 23. In addition, the harvesting/removal of one male and one female in years 10 and 20 would be required to ensure 100 % population persistence and adequate genetic diversity. Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) are expected to be the two most important prey species for reintroduced wild dogs in the GFRNR. Furthermore, wild dogs are likely to prefer the north-western and south-western sectors of the reserve because of the relatively high prey densities in these areas. However, regular monitoring of both the potential prey and the wild dog populations is essential to ensure persistence of the wild dogs and to prevent prey populations decreasing precipitously. Using structured questionnaire interviews (n = 128), I found that while <b>neighbouring</b> land <b>owners</b> and local communities were generally positive about the potential wild dog reintroduction (56 % of all respondents), several threats to wild dogs were identified along the reserve boundary and on the adjoining unprotected land. Some private landowners and members of rural communities around the reserve (34 %) stated that they would kill any wild dogs that dispersed onto their land. In addition, some respondents (8 %) admitted to believing in traditional uses for wild dog products (e. g. fur) which could result in the illegal killing of wild dogs outside of the GFRNR for traditional purposes. Poaching and the presence of unvaccinated domestic dogs on neighbouring land were also identified as being potential threats to a reintroduced wild dog population. However, such anthropogenic threats appear to be localised to the western and southern boundaries of the reserve. Therefore, by implementing preventative measures (such as anti-snare collars, anti-poaching patrols and vaccination against rabies and canine distemper) the likelihood of such threats occurring can be reduced. I conclude that the GFRNR can sustain a population of wild dogs and successfully contribute to South Africa‘s national metapopulation. An additional reserve will benefit the country‘s metapopulation by increasing the number of wild dogs available for translocation, thereby increasing genetic diversity and overall resilience (to environmental change, disease etc.) of South Africa‘s wild dog population. This will contribute towards the future conservation of this endangered species...|$|R
40|$|The Commons {{apartment}} building in the inner Melbourne suburb of Brunswick has won swags of awards, including the Best of Best at the 2014 BPN Sustainability Awards. Among its many lauded attributes is its total lack of on-site car parking. Residents get a yearly public transport ticket and membership of a car share scheme with a prepaid usage allowance. A share car {{is located on the}} street in front of the building. Cycling is the fastest mode of transport into the city, so there are 76 bike spaces for just 24 apartments. The council waived the car parking requirement on the proviso that no on-street parking permits would ever be issued to residents. More than 620 people are on the waiting list for a Commons-type apartment. The proponents, Breathe Architecture, thought they’d do The Commons again, across the road. With the Nightingale they intended to add a bicycle maintenance service as part of the package. The carpark-less Commons {{apartment building}} won multiple awards, but its successor project, the Nightingale, has been blocked on appeal. Again Moreland City Council waived the requirement for car parking. But the <b>neighbouring</b> site <b>owner,</b> a developer, objected on the grounds that a reduction in car parking was acceptable but not a full waiver. The matter went to appeal. The Nightingale proponents and supporters were shocked when Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) member Russell Byard agreed with the developer and revoked the planning permit. The VCAT decision has been roundly criticised. Byard’s decision is 180 degrees from a 2012 VCAT decision, which accepted that the waiver of parking for dwellings was an important component of sustainability. This was deemed a “Red Dot Decision”, meaning it is of interest or significance, but as there is no doctrine of precedent at VCAT, members are not obliged to be guided by previous VCAT decisions.       Sustainability is a test of political will Byard has left himself open to opprobrium because his defence of personal car ownership would do a human rights lawyer proud: he could have been more circumspect in attacking the objectives of policy he so obviously disagrees with. At the end of the day, however, his decision is based on the law and thus highlights deep flaws in policymaking and the administration of the planning system. Byard stated that the Moreland Planning Scheme contains: … repeated reference to encouragement and enablement, reduction and sustainability, but not to policy provisions that actually get down to, or think through, strategic questions in relation to waiver or reduction to zero. That is, the scheme has no teeth. At the most basic level, planning law does not sufficiently support the over-arching objectives for sustainability in planning policy. Moreland and other councils have attempted to put teeth into their planning schemes in relation to matters such as sustainability, housing affordability and disability requirements, but each time the state planning minister has overruled them. The ball is firmly in the Victorian government’s court. The Commons got a waiver because no one appealed the council’s decision to grant the permit, so the adequacy of the law was not tested in that case. A few kilometres away in the Capital City Zone (which covers the Melbourne CBD) the law indisputably permits waivers and sets a maximum of one car parking space per dwelling for developments over four storeys. Apartment parking has many costs Incredibly, the southern hemisphere’s tallest residential building, Australia 108, which will have more than 1100 apartments, will include a 10 -storey podium car park for 500 cars. Initial analysis of high-rise development permits and proposals for nearby Fishermans Bend (which has been incorporated in the Capital City Zone) indicates that the sheer volume of proposed car parking means the place will be gridlocked much of the day. Nightingale, which proposes 20 apartments, is located two minutes from a railway station, four minutes from a bus route and a tram service, and is a few steps away from one of Melbourne’s busiest cycling routes. Nightingale is closer to public transport than Australia 108. The future residents of Fishermans Bend will need to get on their bikes as the area will not have any public transport for a long time.   Breathe Architecture’s Jeremy McLeod explains the vision behind projects such as the Nightingale apartments.   Urban consolidation policies premised on the suburban ideal of car ownership can only deliver the worst of outcomes; intensification without relief from traffic and less efficiency rather than more. The time has come for housing provision in certain areas to be separated from car parking provision. Both would be cheaper and housing affordability improved. As for VCAT’s concern for buyers of apartments who want car parking, it’s a market: no-one can force them to buy an apartment they do not want. But today people are forced to buy car parks they do not want, which many can ill afford to do.
