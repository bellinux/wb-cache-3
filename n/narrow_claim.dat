25|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an {{increase}} in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that what {{is true of the}} parts must be true of the whole. The <b>narrow</b> <b>claim</b> transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred to be good for the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{response}} to Bradford R. Clark, The Eleventh Amendment and the Nature of the Union, 123 Harv. L. Rev. 1817 (2010). In his article, The Eleventh Amendment and the Nature of the Union, Professor Bradford Clark offeres an explanation for the puzzling text of the Eleventh Amendment, which appears to preclude federal jurisdiction over suits against a state by citizens of other states but not by its own citizens. Professor Clark argues that the Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s text made sense to the Founders because they did not envision any suits against the states arising under federal law. Thus, by clarifying that the states could not be sued under Article III 2 ̆ 7 s diversity provisions, the Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s framers were effectively precluding all suits against the states in federal court. In this response, the author notes that Professor Clark 2 ̆ 7 s defense of the Eleventh Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s text combines a <b>narrow</b> <b>claim</b> and a broad claim. the author finds Professor Clark 2 ̆ 7 s <b>narrow</b> <b>claim</b> that the Founders understood that the federal obligations of the states would be enforceable in suits against state officials rather than the states themselves to be well supported. On the other hand, he is unconvinced by Professor Clark 2 ̆ 7 s broader claim that the Founders understood that the federal government would lack the power to impose legal obligations on the states. He finds Professor Clark 2 ̆ 7 s evidence for this claim to be equivocal, most of it being susceptible to a narrower reading. In his view, the Founders did not settle this particular aspect of the legislative power of the federal government...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether patent subsidy {{programs}} aimed at promoting regional innovations have aroused {{a large number of}} low-quality applications in China and created biased patent statistics as an indicator for innovations. We found that patent filing fee subsidies encouraged filing of low-quality patent, resulting in a decreased grant rate. Though reward conditioned on grants increased patent grant rate, it also brought patents with <b>narrow</b> <b>claim</b> breadth. Our empirical results confirmed a general concern that patent subsidies have side effects in encouraging patent applications of low quality or low value. However, the patent subsidy programs does not affect the trend of granted patents, particularly for those applied by firms. Therefore, while the surge of patent applications has upward biases as an innovation indicator, increases in granted patents can be explained by uprising of technological capability at enterprise sector in China. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{supporting}} gene patents, {{the patent}} office, {{the courts and}} other supporters have assumed that gene discoveries are identical to traditional inventions and therefore the patent system should treat them as identical. In other words, they have assumed that the relatively broad claims that are used for traditional inventions are also appropriate for encouraging gene discovery. This article examines this assumption and finds that gene discoveries are critically different from traditional inventions and concludes that the patent system cannot treat them as identical. As a doctrinal matter, this article applies the generally overlooked constitutional requirements of inventorship and originality and concludes that broad claims to gene discoveries cannot be supported because gene discoveries are essentially copied from nature and thus relatively unoriginal. As a policy matter, the article finds that broad gene patents are also a demonstrably worse bargain for society. Broad gene patents run contrary to patent law 2 ̆ 7 s own drive to encourage desirable forms of competition. Having addressed the policy and doctrinal problems with broad gene patents, the article proposes not invalidating gene patents per se but rather <b>narrowing</b> their <b>claim</b> scope. The article proposes a <b>narrower</b> model <b>claim</b> to realign gene patenting with patent law 2 ̆ 7 s doctrinal and policy foundations. Following copyright 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of low authorship works like maps and charts, the model <b>claim</b> <b>narrows</b> <b>claims</b> in low inventorship works like gene discovery. The model claim protects the initial gene discovery against outright piracy but it is narrow enough to allow for independent creation, and thus competition, from later arriving discoverers...|$|R

40|$|In 2006, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} discovered a method to create pluripotent stem cells—cells that have the potential to become almost any other type of cell in the human body—by inserting specific genes into a skin cell. The resulting cells were called induced pluripotent stem cells (“iPS cells”). The ability to manufacture stem cells could eventually eliminate the need to harvest stem cells from embryos, thereby rendering the embryonic stem cell debate irrelevant. Should a patent claim directed toward an iPS cell-related technology be challenged in the future, the absence of a bright-line test for patentable subject matter could present challenges to the presiding court. This Note proposes two new standards by which courts should evaluate whether products of nature and processes in the life sciences are patentable subject matter and, applying those standards, concludes that sufficiently <b>narrow</b> <b>claims</b> directed to iPS cells and preparation methods would likely be upheld as patentable subject matter...|$|R
5000|$|In some jurisdictions, once {{a patent}} is issued, the patent holder may request a [...] "reissue" [...] of the patent to correct {{mistakes}} in the issued patent.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{governing}} forces for analytics, especially concerning citizens’ behaviours and their transactions, {{that depend on}} which of three spheres of operation an institution is in (corporate, public sector/government, and academic). We argue that aspirations and missions also differ by sphere even as digital spaces have drawn these spheres ever closer together. We propose that citizens’ expectations and implicit permissions for any exploitation of their data require the perception of a fair balance of benefits, which should be transparent (accessible to citizens) and justifiable. We point out that within the corporate sphere most analytics does not concern identity, targeted marketing, nor any direct interference with individual citizens; but instead it supports strategic decision making, where the data is effectively anonymous. With the three spheres we discuss the nature of models deployed in analytics, including "black-box” modelling uncheckable by a human mind, {{and the need to}} track the provenance and workings or models. We also examine the recent evolution of personal data, where some behaviours, or tokens, identifying individuals (unique and yet non-random) are partially and jointly owned by other individuals that are themselves connected. We consider the ability of heavily and lightly regulated sectors to increase access or to stifle innovation. We also call for clear and inclusive definitions of “data science and analytics”, avoiding the <b>narrow</b> <b>claims</b> of those in technical sub-sectors or sub-themes. Finally we examine some examples of unethical and abusive practices. We argue for an ethical responsibility to be placed upon professional data scientists to avoid abuses in the future. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} a {{philosophical}} {{analysis of the}} consumption based capital asset pricing model (CCAPM), investigating in particular its epistemological and methodological foundations. Financial markets are integral parts of advanced and developing economies. They matter because they channel unspent household income into banks’ savings accounts and assets such as bonds and stocks. Financial economists have traditionally taken interest in the pricing mechanism that underlies this capital allocation. The consumption based capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) is a prominent effort to describe, explain and predict such prices. It tells a story of investors’ trade-off between consumption now and later and which portfolio of assets to hold. The CCAPM based narrative intuitively makes sense, and the chosen methodology involving theoretical assumption, mathematical models and empirical tests follows the professions’ standards of good scientific practise. But does CCAPM’s research programme provide knowledge for use? My thesis seeks {{to answer this question}} in a novel way. Instead of embarking on yet another asset pricing research project, I let Philosophy of Science inform my analysis. Following a “primer” introducing essential CCAPM topics and notations, I discuss, in turn, its theoretical foundation, mathematical model, and empirical test results from a philosophy of science perspective. I find that a few fundamental principles and several auxiliary assumptions combine to develop a simplified, partial and idealized theory of investors, financial markets and assets. The model reflects and represents this theory but also makes <b>narrow</b> <b>claims</b> that are distances away from the real situations they target. Unsurprisingly, ideal model assertions fail standard statistical tests of significance. I conclude that mathematical deductive modelling rooted in orthodox, a priori based fundamental principles create ideal and fictional settings that limit their scope and portability. The development of even more granular models within this orthodox paradigm that searches for “event regularities” will not render the desired knowledge for use. The real situations are possibly too complex to be captured in simplified assumptions, ideal theories and mathematical structures. Novel methodological and ontological approaches to asset pricing are in demand. Hence, claims about tendencies in the real data might replace the current focus on point-forecasts...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{claiming}} {{has been}} the issue {{at the heart of}} the software patent problem. Functional claiming is particularly problematic in software patents as inventors may use them to broadly claim an entire goal instead of a particular implementation. The accumulation of such software patents has created a patent thicket, leading to their abuse by patent trolls, causing extended litigation, and making it difficult for patent examiners to search through prior art. This paper presents an alternate approach by using nonobviousness to tackle the software problem in two phases: first during prosecution to prevent functional claims from being issued and second, post grant, through Markman hearings to retroactively invalidate functional claims prior to trial. By applying a nonobviousness filter, both the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office and courts can more efficiently weed out overbroad functional patents by focusing on the merits of the invention and the scope of claims instead of getting bogged down in determining whether a claim meets the requisite structural elements of § 112 (f) in order to then <b>narrow</b> the <b>claim</b> through the statute...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question whether}} (and how) the shareholders matter for social welfare. Answers to the question have changed over time. Observers in the mid-twentieth century believed that the socio-economic characteristics of real world shareholders were highly pertinent to social welfare inquiries. But {{they went on to}} conclude that there followed no justification for catering to shareholder interest, for shareholders occupied elite social strata. The answer changed during the twentieth century’s closing decades, when observers came to accord the shareholder interest a key structural role in the enhancement of economic efficiency even as they also deemed irrelevant the characteristics of the human holders (and beneficiaries of holders) of shares. Under this view, the shareholder interest, as the residual claim on corporate wealth, is directly aligned with society’s interest in maximizing corporate (and therefore societal) wealth and so qualifies for political solicitude. In recent years, the quest for political solicitude has made the jump from theory to practice: a “shareholder class” is said to have risen in our political economy as an off-shoot of the growth of stock ownership by the middle class. Thus do real world shareholders again bear on social welfare. The description of the shareholder class focuses on the diffusion of shareholding downward from its base point among the socio-economic elite into the middle and working classes as the result of pension fund saving schemes and the appearance of cheap, diversified equity investment vehicles. The public dominates the private in the resulting picture of corporate politics: shareholders emerge as a democratic interest group engaged in a struggle with entrenched managers. We confirm that the shareholder interest has achieved political salience, but take a critical look at the claims regarding shareholders and social welfare. As to the claim regarding the social welfare consequences of maximization of corporate wealth, we make a technical correction: it is not, strictly speaking, a social welfare <b>claim,</b> but a <b>narrower</b> <b>claim</b> addressed to economic efficiency. We then enter an empirical objection to the political economic extension: the shareholder class is not meaningfully middle and retains elite characteristics. It follows that there is nothing inherently democratic (or progressive) about the shareholder interest in corporate politics. Shareholder politics is better described as a contest between two elite groups—corporate managers and investment intermediaries—both of which act as delegees of the same elite class of shareholder beneficiaries...|$|R

The district court held that Scoggin’s sprayer was not obvious because even though its individual elements were not novel, nothing in the prior art would have suggested the combination of elements. After the initial rejection of his patent, Scoggin drafted claims more carefully to distinguish the prior art, limiting new claims to the use of a rib seal, rather than a washer or gasket, to maintain a seal, as well as the existence of a small space between the overcap and the sprayer. Clark held that because Scoggin <b>narrowed</b> his <b>claims</b> to meet the limitations requested by the patent examiner, Cook Chemical could not now claim broader subject matter (see Prosecution history estoppel).
