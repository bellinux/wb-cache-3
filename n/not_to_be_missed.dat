5|$|A soundtrack album, Soma Bringer Original Soundtrack, was {{released}} through the Sleigh Bells label on April 2, 2008. The soundtrack covers three discs. In addition to tracks used in-game, the album includes four tracks with full orchestral versions of particular tracks. Ben Schweitzer, writing for RPGFan, positively compared the score to earlier works by Mitsuda, calling it his best recent soundtrack despite some tracks being overly similar to earlier work. Don Kotowski of Video Game Music Online gave the soundtrack album a perfect score of 5/5 stars. He frequently praised Mitsuda's style, and like Schweitzer {{noted that it}} often recalled his earlier work. He also praised the additional tracks for their richness and depth, finishing his review by {{saying that it was}} a soundtrack <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> by buyers of video game music.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} expressionist use of {{monolithic}} materials was by Erich Mendelsohn at the Einstein Tower. <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> was a pun on the towers namesake, Einstein, and {{an attempt to}} make the building out of one stone, Ein stein. Though not cast in one pour of concrete (due to technical difficulties, brick and stucco were used partially) the effect of the building is an expression of the fluidity of concrete before it is cast. 'Architecture of Steel and Concrete' was the title of an 1919 exhibition of Mendelsohn's sketches at Paul Cassirer's gallery in Berlin.|$|E

In the winter, mullet fishing, religious celebrations and regional festivities are beautiful demonstrations of the local culture.

Miranda is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed.</b> [...] the old saying goes, it takes talent to be that bad". Another commentator wrote similarly: [...] "It's so awful, it's brilliant." [...] Woman Around Town called Miranda [...] "an atrocious, comedic masterpiece." [...] Perez Hilton praised Miranda's parody of the hit song [...] "Chandelier" [...] as [...] "the crowning achievement of music video parodies ... utterly fantastic". TheaterJones noted that Ballinger: [...] "has hit on a character that reflects the zeitgeist of our time and does it with tongue firmly planted in cheek." [...] In 2015, Playbill concluded: [...] "Miranda Sings is a huge talent. With very demonstrative facial expressions, a unique take on makeup and wardrobe and her almost unbelievable vocal stylings, she cuts an undeniable figure {{in the world of}} online music video." [...] The Guardian characterized Miranda's channel as [...] "so bad it's great". Miranda has been compared with such absurd comic creations as Roseanne Roseannadanna and Andy Kaufman's characters, Kimmy Schmidt, [...] "a distaff Napoleon Dynamite" [...] and Pee-wee Herman.|$|E

60|$|Accordingly, {{that same}} evening the poor soul stands in Cloisterham High Street, {{looking at the}} many quaint gables of the Nuns’ House, and getting through the time as she best can until nine o’clock; at which hour she has reason to suppose that the {{arriving}} omnibus passengers may have some interest for her.

60|$|Rumours of the {{projected}} representation had spread far and wide. Six {{times the number of}} tickets issued might have been readily sold.

When ladies, hitherto only beheld in frigid, impenetrable positions behind their coachmen in Markton High Street, were about to reveal their hidden traits, home attitudes, intimate smiles, nods, and perhaps kisses, to the public eye, it was a throwing open of fascinating social secrets <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> for money.|$|E

60|$|Thus {{passed the}} day--between visits from desponding doctors and vain {{measures}} {{for reducing the}} inflammation. At night Mr. Harding would have prevailed on {{her to go to}} rest, promising to keep watch in her stead; but she only shook her head, and said she could not. She had not seen, and had scarcely thought of, the elder children all day; but at about eleven o'clock at night she was startled by a sound of lamentable crying,--Johnnie's voice in the nursery. The poor little boy's nerves had been so much shaken by the fire at Martindale, that he had become subject to night alarms, which sometimes showed their effect for the whole subsequent day; and his mother stole away on hearing his cry, leaving Arthur in Mr. Harding's charge, and hoping <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{thought a}} good deal about it on that evening, and was still {{thinking}} about it on the following morning. He had promised to go up to Curzon Street on the Monday,--really on some most trivial mission, on a matter of business which no man could have taken in hand whose time was of the slightest value to himself or any one else. But now that mission assumed an importance in his eyes, and seemed to require either a special observance or a special excuse. There was no real reason why he should not have stayed away from Curzon Street for the next fortnight; and had he done so he need have made no excuse to Mrs. Trevelyan when he met her. But the opportunity for a little excitement was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed,</b> and instead of going he wrote to her the following note:-- ...|$|E

This was a chance <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed,</b> and taking her {{daughter}} with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before. The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them. At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom. Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which the princess had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head.|$|E
5000|$|Ten {{years after}} the scandal, another gang called [...] "Ergenekon" [...] was {{discovered}} and tried.

60|$|No one {{was amazed}} {{when the next}} day the Cardinal arrived, and told his grand-nieces and the Lady of Glenuskie that he had {{arranged}} that they should go forward under the escort of the Earl and Countess of Suffolk, who were to start immediately for Nanci, there to espouse and bring home the King's bride, the Lady Margaret. There was reason to think that the French Royal Family would be present on the occasion, as the Queen of France was sister to King Rene of Sicily and Jerusalem, and thus the opportunity of joining their sister was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed</b> by the two Scottish maidens. The Cardinal added that he had undertaken, and made Sir Patrick Drummond understand, that he would be at all charges for his nieces, and further said that merchants with women's gear would presently be sent in, when they were to fit themselves out as befitted their rank for appearance at the wedding. At a sign from him a large bag, jingling heavily, was laid on the table by a clerk in attendance. There was nothing to be done but to make a low reverence and return thanks.|$|E
60|$|From this {{conversation}} the bishop {{had made his}} way to the vicarage of Mogham Banks. The vicar of Mogham Banks was a sacerdotal socialist of the most advanced type, with the reputation of being closely in touch with the labour extremists. He was a man addicted to banners, prohibited ornaments, special services at unusual hours, and processions in the streets. His taste in chasubles was loud, he gardened in a cassock and, it was said, he slept in his biretta; he certainly slept in a hair shirt, and he littered his church with flowers, candles, side altars, confessional boxes, requests for prayers for the departed, and the like. There had already been two Kensitite demonstrations at his services, and altogether he was a source of considerable anxiety to the bishop. The bishop did his best not to know too exactly what was going on at Mogham Banks. Sooner or later he felt he would be forced to do something--and the longer he could put that off the better. But the Rev. Morrice Deans had promised to get together three or four prominent labour leaders for tea and a frank talk, and the opportunity was one <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>missed.</b> So the bishop, after a hasty and not too digestible lunch in the refreshment room at Pringle, was now in a fly that smelt of straw and suggested infectious hospital patients, on his way through the industry-scarred countryside to this second conversation.|$|E
