40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{technology}} for <b>networked</b> <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> developed at the CERN Document Server (CDS) research group, called the CERN Document Server Software (CDSware). Standardization of <b>networked</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> {{in the field of}} grey literature has recently become a subject of an intensive research in the digital library community. The current state-of-the-art in this area effectively allows to provide various <b>networked</b> <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> such as <b>information</b> brokering or other value-added services upon distributed or federated data. This refers specifically to a variety of newly developed frameworks, such as the Open Archives initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAi-PMH). The CDSware technology offers a comprehensive solution for a document management of a large grey literature document repository, compliant with a variety of networking standards essential for a wide deployment of <b>networked</b> <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> Includes: Conference preprint, Powerpoint presentation, Abstract and Biographical notes, Pratt student commentaryXAInternationa...|$|R

50|$|The Name Service Switch (NSS) is a {{facility}} in Unix-like operating systems {{that provides a}} variety of sources for common configuration databases and name resolution mechanisms.

40|$|Future {{heterogeneous}} wireless networks will encompass different {{link layer}} technologies and allow selecting {{the most appropriate}} network depending on different criteria. To support mobile nodes in the selection process, <b>network</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> are developed that provide the mobile node with sufficient <b>information</b> about its <b>network</b> neighborhood, typically focusing on the optimization of handover processes. In this paper, we take a more general approach towards <b>network</b> <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> which is needed to support mobile communications in the existing environments of WLAN hotspots and wide area mobile communications networks. We introduce the notion of “service maps”, a mobile data management approach allowing a mobile user to obtain a detailed view of available networks and the services they offer depending on the user context such as geographic position, mobility paths, and application requirements. We review our experiences with networking in highly mobile scenarios from which we derive a set of requirements for a general <b>information</b> <b>service</b> and present our system design and data model that also accounts for business and (incremental) deployment considerations...|$|R

These questions related to the business information needs of Red Angus breeders, their use of information technology, the business impact of network use, and perceived barriers to network adoption and use.

50|$|NetInfo was {{introduced}} in NeXTSTEP version 0.9, and replaced both the Unix system configuration files and Sun Microsystems' <b>Network</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Service</b> (Yellow Pages) on NeXT computers. It immediately caused controversy, much unfavorable. Not only was NetInfo unique to NeXT computers (although NeXT later licensed NetInfo to Xedoc, an Australian software company who produced NetInfo for other UNIX systems), DNS queries went through NetInfo. This led to a situation where basic tasks such as translating a UNIX UID to a user name string would not complete because NetInfo was stalled on a DNS lookup. At first, {{it was possible to}} disable NetInfo and use the Unix system files, but as of NeXTSTEP version 2 disabling NetInfo also disabled DNS support. Thus, NeXT computers became notorious for locking a user out of everyday tasks because a DNS server had stopped responding.|$|E
