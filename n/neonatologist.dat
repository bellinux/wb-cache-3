25|$|In 2007, Michael Munro, a Scottish <b>neonatologist</b> at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, {{was cleared}} of {{malpractice}} by the GMC Fitness to Practice panel after giving 23 times the standard dose of pancuronium to two dying neonates. In {{the final minutes}} of life, each baby was suffering from agonal gasping and violent body spasms, which was highly distressing for the parents to witness. Munro administered pancuronium to the babies after advising the parents that this would ease their suffering and could also hasten death. It is on record that neither of the children's parents was unhappy with Dr Munro's treatment of their babies.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 2013, McMath's family filed {{a lawsuit}} in Alameda County Superior Court, petitioning the court to require Children's Hospital Oakland to keep McMath on life support. In a pretrial conference on December 23, Judge Evelio Grillo {{appointed}} Paul Graham Fisher, M.D., the chief of Child Neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine, to provide an independent medical opinion regarding the declaration of brain death. McMath's family also requested to have Paul A. Byrne, M.D. conduct a separate evaluation. Byrne, a pediatric <b>neonatologist,</b> has campaigned against the medical consensus of accepting brain death as death. The court denied that request.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} {{features}} {{a cast of}} eight actors who receive star billing. Kate Walsh stars as Dr. Addison Montgomery, a <b>neonatologist</b> who moved to Santa Monica in order to reinvent herself. Audra McDonald and Taye Diggs play the respective characters of fertility specialist Dr. Naomi Bennett and health guru Dr. Sam Bennett, Addison's divorcee college friends. The role of Naomi was originally played by Merrin Dungey in the backdoor pilot. According to a writer from Variety, network executives replaced her with McDonald due to concerns over the lack of chemistry between Dungey and Diggs. The recasting {{did not result in}} reshooting any of the pilot's previous scenes. Amy Brenneman is Dr. Violet Turner, a therapist who constantly doubts herself. Paul Adelstein portrays pediatrician Dr. Cooper Freedman, who is a sex addict. Tim Daly plays the seductive alternative medicine specialist, Dr. Pete Wilder, and Chris Lowell is the receptionist Dell Parker, who frequently appears shirtless in the office.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{management}} options, risks and thematic content that obstetricians and <b>neonatologists</b> discuss in periviable counseling. STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen obstetricians and 15 <b>neonatologists</b> counseled simulated patients portraying {{a pregnant woman}} with ruptured membranes at 23 weeks of gestation. Transcripts from video-recorded encounters were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed for informational content and decision-making themes. RESULT: Obstetricians more frequently discussed antibiotics (P= 0. 005), maternal risks (< 0. 001) and cesarean risks (< 0. 005). <b>Neonatologists</b> more frequently discussed neonatal complications (P= 0. 044), resuscitation (P= 0. 015) and palliative options (P= 0. 023). Obstetricians and <b>neonatologists</b> often deferred questions about steroid administration to the other specialty. Both specialties organized decision making around medical information, survival, quality of life, time and support. <b>Neonatologists</b> also introduced themes of values, comfort or suffering, and uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Obstetricians and <b>neonatologists</b> provided complementary counseling content to patients, yet neither specialty took ownership of steroid discussions. Joint counseling and/or family meetings may minimize observed redundancy and inconsistencies in counseling...|$|R
40|$|The {{views of}} 34 <b>neonatologists</b> (a 78 % {{response}} rate) and 192 {{neonatal intensive care}} nurses (a 66 % response rate) were obtained on work, stress, and relationships in neonatal intensive care units. The survey was conducted by post and included Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). A comparison of the responses of <b>neonatologists</b> and nurses to 21 identical statements showed significant differences in 12. Most <b>neonatologists</b> felt that they involved nurses in critical patient care decisions, provided adequate pain relief for their patients, gave nurses adequate information on patients' progress after discharge, and were aware of little doctor-nurse conflict. However, the nurses' responses differed significantly in these areas, suggesting that the <b>neonatologists</b> may have a more rosy view {{of life in the}} neonatal intensive care unit than their nurse colleagues. Twenty seven per cent of <b>neonatologists</b> and 32 % of nurses had GHQ scores indicating psychological dysfunction. The <b>neonatologists</b> who had dysfunctional scores differed from their colleagues in only one area surveyed [...] a higher proportion experienced conflict between the demands of their work and their personal lives...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objectives To examine work satisfaction, {{quality of}} life, and leisure time of {{neonatology}} fellows and senior <b>neonatologists</b> in Israel. Methods A validated questionnaire was delivered {{during the second}} half of 2008 to all the neonatology fellows and senior <b>neonatologists</b> in Israel. Descriptive analysis, parametric Student’s t -test, and aparametric Mann Whitney and χ 2 tests were conducted. Results Of 114 practicing <b>neonatologists</b> in that period in Israel (including both seniors and fellows), 112 (98. 25 %) participated in the study. The majority of <b>neonatologists</b> were male (53. 2 %), married (91. 7 %), 40 – 60 [*]years old (69. 7 %), and studied in Israeli medical schools (62. 0 %). Most did their pediatric residencies and fellowships in Israel (97. 2 % and 75. 7 %, respectively). The average number of night/on-call shifts of fellows and senior <b>neonatologists</b> was 8. 8 per month (SD[*]±[*] 3. 425) and the number of active on-call shifts was 4. 04 (SD[*]±[*] 3. 194). The satisfaction level of <b>neonatologists</b> in Israeli medical centers with patient care, self-reward, work relations, and quality of life was high, but their satisfaction level with workload, income and prestige, and leisure time was low. The general index of work satisfaction and the general index of indices were both high in relation to the mid-range values. The majority of <b>neonatologists</b> stated that they would choose to practice medicine again. Most of them would encourage medical students to choose the same specialty they had chosen. Only a few <b>neonatologists</b> were contemplating changing their choice of specialty. Most <b>neonatologists</b> want to continue practicing medicine; however, a significant number will not recommend that their children do so. Conclusions The satisfaction level of <b>neonatologists</b> in Israel is high, mainly due to satisfaction with their work. High satisfaction levels promise high quality patient care, as well as high satisfaction levels of patients and their families. However, satisfaction with leisure time was low and it will require greater attention and focused steps to correct this. </p...|$|R

40|$|Group B {{streptococcus}} (GBS) is {{the leading}} infectious cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in Australian newborns. Although intrapartum chemoprophylaxis is recommended {{to reduce the risk of}} neonatal GBS transmission and disease, controversy exists as to the best method to select women 'at risk' for this treatment. Our study aimed to survey the opinions of obstetricians and <b>neonatologists</b> currently in practice in Australia on GBS screening and treatment. Of the 488 obstetricians and 68 <b>neonatologists</b> currently in practice who responded to the survey, 271 obstetricians (56 %) and 40 <b>neonatologists</b> (61 %) supported universal antenatal screening. Of those respondents who did not support a universal antenatal screening policy, 196 (93 %) and 24 (92 %) of the obstetricians and <b>neonatologists</b> respectively, supported antenatal screening based on risk factors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cranial {{ultrasound}} (cUS) findings help {{doctors in}} the clinical management of preterm infants and in their discussion with parents regarding prediction of outcome. cUS is often used as outcome measure in clinical research studies. Accurate cUS performance and interpretation is therefore required. AIMS: The aims {{of this study were}} (i) to assess the interobserver variability in cUS interpretation, and (ii) to evaluate whether level of cUS expertise influences the interobserver variability. METHODS: Fifty-eight cUS image series of preterm infants born below 32 weeks of gestation collected within the Swiss Neonatal Network were sent to 27 observers for reviewing. Observers were grouped into radiologists, experienced <b>neonatologists</b> and less experienced <b>neonatologists.</b> Agreement between observers was calculated using Kappa statistics. RESULTS: When cystic periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular haemorrhagic infarction were combined to one outcome, agreement among all observers was moderate. When divided into subgroups, kappa for the combined outcome was 0. 7 for experienced <b>neonatologists,</b> 0. 67 for radiologists and 0. 53 for inexperienced <b>neonatologists.</b> Marked difference in interobserver agreement between experienced <b>neonatologists</b> and radiologists could be found for haemorrhagic periventricular ifraction (HPI). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that interobserver agreement for interpretation of cUS varies from poor to good varying with the type of abnormality and level of expertise, suggesting that widespread structured training should be made available to improve the performance and interpretation of cUS...|$|R

40|$|Neurologists {{increasingly}} {{recognize that}} critically ill patients {{are at high}} risk for seizures, particularly nonconvulsive seizures, and that neuromonitoring is a useful tool for diagnosing seizures and assessing brain function in these patients. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (EEG) is a simplified bedside neurophysiology tool that has become widely used in neonates over the past decade. Despite widespread interest by both neurologists and <b>neonatologists</b> in continuous brain monitoring, amplitude-integrated EEG has been largely ignored by neurologists, forcing <b>neonatologists</b> to "go it alone" when interpreting data from this bedside tool.

40|$|Parents {{at risk of}} {{delivering}} a baby {{at the threshold of}} viability are faced with a critical decision. When a child is born between 23 and 25 weeks of gestation, parents are asked {{to decide whether or not}} to resuscitate their child. In essence, they are faced with a choice between life and death. We conducted a qualitative study to explore how parents and <b>neonatologists</b> engage in decision-making in a context of imminent and unplanned delivery at the threshold of viability. Twelve parents and attending <b>neonatologists</b> in a specialized tertiary care centre in Montreal, Canada were separately interviewed immediately following neonatal consultation. Results highlight how <b>neonatologists</b> and parents engage in decision making from different standpoints: while <b>neonatologists</b> focus on the management of the unborn baby, parents have yet to fully conceptualize their infant as a distinct entity since they are in a process of grieving their pregnancy and their parenthood project. Moreover, in their attempt to ensure an informed decision, <b>neonatologists</b> adopt either of two models through provision of the most up-to-date and objective information available: "remaining as neutral as possible to allow parents to make their own decision", or, "formulating a proposal to which parents can choose or not to assent". Overall, if the provided information fits parents' expectations, they tend to feel confident with their decision. However, if it does not take their experience into account, their decision is experienced as a solitary process. Parents express the need to receive more than just factual information from <b>neonatologists.</b> They also require support and engagement from caregivers to manage the uncertainty. This brings into question the traditional concept of neutral informed consent and suggests the necessity of a shared decision-making model to ensure that the decision to resuscitate extremely premature babies, at the limits of viability, becomes a truly ethical task.

40|$|Objectives: To measure burnout in {{a cohort}} of <b>neonatologists</b> and to explore its {{association}} with several psychological and biographic factors. Materials and methods: A total of 110 <b>neonatologists</b> filled in a personal questionnaire composed of four parts: (a) biographic data, (b) personal beliefs, (c) attitudes toward clinical decisions and (d) a validated tool (the Link Burnout Questionnaire [LBQ]) to assess their burnout. The LBQ categorizes burnout into four subscales: psycho-physical exhaustion, relationship deterioration, sense of professional failure and disillusion. Scores of each subscale range from 6 (minimum) to 36 (maximum). Burnout values were matched with the data of the personal questionnaire. Results: Most <b>neonatologists</b> (60 %- 65 %) were in the "at risk" range for burnout. High burnout was experienced by 30 % of the <b>neonatologists.</b> Having no children is associated with low rates of burnout; work experience of less than 5 years, believing that living with a physical disability is unworthy and having recurrent death ideation are associated with high rates of burnout. The attitude to resuscitating a 24 -week baby is inversely correlated with the disillusion rate. Conclusion: In our cohort, burnout exceeds the alarm threshold in one-third of cases.
