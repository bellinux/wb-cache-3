5000|$|I {{do not go}} as far as to name, or classify, {{what the}} Dark Fall {{actually}} is. That would be rather foolish.

I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to state what I believe exists in the next world, or whether anything exists at all. The writing in Dark Fall leaves each gamer to come to their own conclusions in regards to concepts such as ghosts, evil, death and purgatory.

[...] I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> Bob's Burgers to always remind {{me so much}} of The Simpsons, but I could be persuaded if it was always this good."

It's all insane, but kind of sweet too, especially when Bob has an awkward heart-to-heart with Gene, and the entire family rises up to help Gene in his time of need. Once again, Bob's Burgers gets some of the best voice acting on TV as well, as Hamm is great as the toilet, constantly misunderstanding Gene's commands, like when Gene tells him [...] "I love you," [...] and Hamm responds, [...] "you have to throw up?"

5000|$|Bryne Yancey of Alternative Press was {{critical}} of the band's musical divergences on the album, stating that [...] "Unfortunately, much like adolescence itself, This Is Only a Test isn't without its moments of awkwardness. Whether it's piano-heavy power ballads ('College'), spoken-word verses written as diary entries ('Diary of a Teen Tragedy') or five-minute electronic tracks {{about not being able}} to participate in P.E. class ('Excuse Me, Coach'), Smoking Popes occasionally veer off their tried and true template of catchy, soulful pop-punk, and do so with mixed results." [...] However, he noted that [...] "there are still plenty of hooks to be found on the album, especially it its loaded first half", comparing the band to Weezer and calling the album [...] "a mostly successful experiment." [...] Tori of Punknews.org had similar criticisms, saying of [...] "Excuse Me, Coach" [...] that [...] "I'm not sure what they were thinking, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to know", and calling the spoken-word verses in [...] "Diary of a Teen Tragedy" [...] "downright cringeworthy": [...] "The reality remains that the Caterer brothers are not high schoolers. Hearing a man in his late 30s sing about how he can't get a prom date is a little off-putting." [...] However, he called these [...] "small complaints", concluding that [...] "Aside from a couple blunders, This Is Only a Test is a thoroughly enjoyable pop-rock album. At a brisk 10 songs totaling less than 40 minutes, it leaves you wanting more. Plenty to sing along to here." ...|$|E
40|$|Colenso College a {{group of}} eight Year 8 (Grade 6) boys has {{assembled}} for their first photovoice session.

I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be here! I’ve got nothing to say! We’re all the naughty kids – are we in trouble? The conversation continues like this with each boy talking himself out of participating in a research project organized to find out more about how young adolescent students, loosely classified as ‘at risk’, experience school and learning, and more generally what makes them ‘tick’. Kate (Middle School Director of Curriculum and my research off-sider) and I can feel the session slipping away and the potential of our research evaporating. One of the boys (a leader and an influence in the group even at this early stage) draws breath and shares HIS view with the group [said with fist banging the desk and with true Dr King charisma]: My mum says being part of this group is an opportunity for me to have a say – to tell the truth about school. A ripple goes through the group, the energy skyrockets and all the boys respond ‘Yeah! ’ And so, Photovoice in the Middle: How Our students Experience Learning at School and Beyond is born. One year on and the full staff of William Colenso College are preparing to begin the 2008 school year. They are engaged in a two-hour workshop looking at how their planning and practice in Term One can address explicitly dimensions of engaged learning and conditions for engagement selected from the findings of the Photovoice project.

40|$|Well, OK, to be honest, I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> your {{tired or}} your poor, and besides, The Statue of Liberty has that pretty well covered. But I {{am sure that}} I want your Phase II failures. I REALLY want your Phase II failures. Before I explain what I mean, I should review the {{progress}} in making drugs to treat serious human illnesses {{in the first decade}} of the 21 st century- or, more accurately, the lack of progress. While it’s been true for a long time that about the hardest thing human beings have ever tried to do is to make a drug, it seems as though lately it’s got even harder. The number of new therapeutics approved for use on humans, per year, has been essentially flat for more than two decades. During this time, new technologies such as structure-based drug discovery have been created, pharmaceutical companies have merged to form giant entities, and hundreds of biotechnology companies have been launched to rival them, the research expenditure of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has more than doubled, and the R&D budget of the drugs industry has shot up. Yet despite all that, we are not developing new drugs any faster than we did before. Why not? One reason is that the diseases we are now trying to treat, such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, are harder than many of the infectious diseases that dominated our efforts 50 years ago. But another reason lies in the nature of the drug development process itself. For every drug that is used clinically to treat a disease, more than 6, 000 completely new chemical compounds are synthesized. On average, about 20 drug candidates are tested in people for every one that gets to market. (The failure rate for biopharmaceuticals, which are macromolecules rather than small organic compounds, is a lot better, but still very high: about one in five of those candidates tested in humans make it to the clinic.) For chemical drugs the process takes, on average, about 12 years from target identification to drug approval and costs close to US$ 1 billion (the timeline is shorter fo...|$|E
