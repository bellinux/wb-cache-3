When Whale realized the trick he beat Starfish ragged, which is how Starfish still is today.|$|E

5|$|Assuming less {{load and}} rolling friction, Raepsaet, in contrast, calculates a maximum pulling force of 27kN, {{which would have}} <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> {{slightly}} smaller towing crew. Under these circumstances, the use of harnessed oxen—which has been refuted by Tolley {{on the basis of}} their relatively diminished pulling capabilities— would have become feasible. However, the necessary expenditure of energy at the Diolkos must be regarded in both scenarios as considerable.|$|E

You <b>need</b> <b>a</b> core set of courses. You <b>need</b> <b>a</b> minimum of four courses - a minimum - taught by permanent faculty. You <b>need</b> <b>an</b> environmental law survey class. You <b>need</b> <b>a</b> distinct natural resources law survey class. You <b>need</b> <b>a</b> distinct international environmental law class.

Weighted kappa {{was used as}} kappa (unweighted) does not consider the degree of disagreement. Reliability was estimated for the ASSQ scoring system with Cronbach’s alpha. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value [22] were estimated from the ASSQ scoring system sleep problem categories to the SMP categories after the clinical interview. Sensitivity was estimated {{as the number of}} subjects determined by the ASSQ scoring system as <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention from the SMP (moderate and severe) divided by the number of subjects <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. Specificity was estimated by the number of subjects determined by the ASSQ scoring system as not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical sleep intervention (none, mild categories) divided by the number of subjects not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. The positive predictive value was estimated by dividing the subjects for which there was agreement on <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention (moderate, severe categories) by the actual number of subjects <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. The negative predictive value was estimated by dividing the subjects for which there was agreement on not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention by the actual number of subjects not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP.|$|R
