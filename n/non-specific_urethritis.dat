40|$|Reiter's {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} of unknown aetiology, but is probably of infective origin, with the primary focus in the genital tract. It occurs characteristically in young men in association with <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis,</b> arthritis, and conjunctivitis. In {{the course of time}} other features were noted to be sometimes associated, including haemorrhagic cystitis, iritis, sacro-iliitis, ankylosing spondylitis, balanitis, stomatitis, keratoderma blenorrhagica, and other skin lesions. Formes frustes are also recognized, of which the combination of <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis</b> and arthritis alone is the com-monest. The natural history of these clinical types of the syndrome appears to be essentially the same (Csonka, 1958) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} aetiological {{factors in}} non-gonococcal and <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis</b> are reviewed.

When reviewing the infective aetiology of non-gonococcal urethritis, {{it was noted that}} more than one organism (or potential pathogen) would be present in many cases. It is therefore surmised that there may be at times a mixed aetiology and at other times a truly non-specific aetiology. Isolations by different workers have indicated that the following organisms might be expected: Chlamydia 40 per cent.; Mycoplasma-M. hominis 20 per cent., T-strain over 60 per cent.; Trichomonas 15 per cent.; Candida possibly over 5 per cent.

40|$|Trends in the {{prevalence}} of venereal diseases in Pondicherry is discussed for the period 1961 - 65 based on the past records of Venereal Disease Clinics in General Hospital Pondicherry run by {{the staff of the}} Medical College, Pondicherry. Diseases like lympho-granuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale and <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis</b> have been diagnosed which were not reported before 1959.

40|$|Inflammatory arthritis, tendinitis, and {{fasciitis}} after <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis</b> ("sexually acquired reactive arthritis" (SARA)) was studied prospectively in 531 {{men with}} <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis,</b> with particular {{reference to the}} frequency of isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis {{and the presence of}} HLA-B 27. Satisfactory cultures were obtained from the urethral swabs from 384 patients; and HLA typing was performed on 482, of whom 30 (6 %) were HLA-B 27 -positive. Arthritis developed in 16 patients, and five of the 14 (36 %) with satisfactory cultures were positive for C trachomatis; 135 of the patients without arthritis were also positive for C trachomatis, an identical proportion. Seven of the 15 patients (40 %) with arthritis who were HLA-typed were HLA-B 27 -positive. Six of the 30 patients with HLA-B 27 developed peripheral arthritis in contrast to only nine of the 452 patients lacking the antigen, suggesting a tenfold increase susceptibility. C trachomatis, however, was no more prevalent in cultures from HLA-B 27 -positive men than from the others. Thus carriage of C trachomatis is unlikely to be influenced by HLA-B 27. C trachomatis may be an important pathogen in some cases of SARA but {{does not appear to be}} an exclusive trigger factor for this condition...|$|E

Neither the duration of symptoms of urethritis nor a history of previous urethritis affected the chlamydial isolation rate significantly. Of 40 patients with severe discharge 30 (75 %) harboured C. trachomatis. One-third of the Chlamydia-positive patients had a severe urethral discharge, while this was present in only 15 % of Chlamydia-negative patients.

We must assume that with our present isolation techniques we are missing, at any single visit, at least 9 % of chlamydial infections. C. trachomatis was also found in 32 (23 %) of 139 men with gonorrhoea. Positive cultures were obtained from 15 (79 %) of 19 men, who later developed post-gonococcal urethritis (PGU).

The most notable factor in determining the interval between infection and attendance, however, was whether or not the sexual contact was known. Infections by known contacts were associated with prolonged duration of symptoms which negated the benefit of past experience and, to some extent, of anxiety. Thus, patients should be made more generally aware that known contacts may be a source of infection, especially after a break in a relationship, and that they should return to the clinic as soon as symptoms develop. Furthermore, doctors should examine carefully even the most persistently "neurotic" patients, because they may eventually become infected...|$|E

Repeat isolation attempts in 155 of these patients were successful in eight men in whom results had been negative on the initial visit, but they were unsuccessful in eight men who initially had had positive cultures. We must assume that with our present isolation techniques we are missing, at any single visit, at least 9 % of chlamydial infections. C. trachomatis was also found in 32 (23 %) of 139 men with gonorrhoea. Positive cultures were obtained from 15 (79 %) of 19 men, who later developed post-gonococcal urethritis (PGU).

40|$|A trial {{comparing}} {{the efficacy of}} three different tetracyclines, each in two different dosage regimens, {{in the treatment of}} <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis</b> is described. There was a significant association between the retreatment rate and sexual intercourse. Age, race, duration of symptoms, previous infection, and indulgence in alcohol did not appear to influence the results whereas treatment of sexual contacts before resumption of sexual intercourse significantly reduced the retreatment rate. Single-dose treatment with doxycycline was shown to be ineffective. Treatment with doxycycline for seven days or triple tetracycline for seven days was less effective than triple tetracycline for 21 days or oxytetracyline for seven or 21 days, all of which gave the same success rate...|$|E
40|$|Exudate from Bartholin's ducts from 30 {{selected}} {{patients was}} investigated for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

Concurrent infection of the ducts was present in seven (29. 2 %); the remaining two patients were sexual contacts of men with <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis.</b> The duct exudate was mucopus in seven patients, cloudy mucus in one, and clear mucus in the other.

However, the microscopical criteria that they used in reaching a diagnosis varied between clinics. The most commonly applied criterion was that of less than five leucocytes per high power field.

40|$|Infection of the {{urinary tract}} {{of males and}} females *by non-bacterial agents has been known to bacterio-logists, venereologists, and urologists for many years. Notwithstanding this fact, and {{especially}} during and after the world war 1939 - 45, numerous cases of so-called abacterial, aseptic, or non-specific infections of the urinary tract have been published in current medical journals regardless ofa few papers pointing out new routes for a possible explanation as to the true nature of many such undefinable infections. In most instances, probably because of difficulties arising from war- conditions, no proper search appears to have been made for non-bacterial living agents. Review of the Literature Among others, Collins (1946) during a period of six months observed 120 cases of non-specific prostatitis at the urological clinic of the Royal Canadian Naval Hospital in St. John, Newfound-land. Phillips (1946) pointed out the great fre-quency of non-specific infections-pyelitis, cystitis, epididymitis, prostatitis, etc. Vassallo (1946) during a period of eighteen months observed twenty cases of heematurias and pyurias following, in most instances, non-bacterial urethritis; Cooper and McLean (1946), in a group of one hundred cases of chronic prostatitis, found that 50 per cent. had a previous history of <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis,</b> and 14 per cent. no previous history of urethritis.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the incidence of}} urethritis in men in Dutch general practice, the applied diagnostic procedures in relation to existing guidelines, and the underlying causes. Descriptive. The incidence of urethritis in the period 1998 - 2007 was calculated from data received from 45 GP sentinel stations. The network of participating general practices is nationally representative of age, sex and geographical distribution, and of distribution between town and countryside. From 2004 to 2007 additional questionnaires for each patient were filled in by the general practitioner, and were analysed for applied diagnostics and final diagnosis. From 1998 - 2003 the incidence of urethritis increased from 17 to 25 per 10, 000 men and decreased to 20 per 10, 000 men in 2007. The highest incidence of urethritis was found in urban areas and in the 15 - 34 years age group. Penile discharge was reported in 82 % of the men for whom a questionnaire was filled out. In 10 % of the men without discharge the first voided urine sediment was assessed {{for the presence of}} leucocytes. Diagnostic tests were generally carried out on urethral smears and sometimes on urine samples. 10. 5 % of the men were not tested. In 76 % of men both gonorrhoea and Chlamydia were tested and found to be positive in 11 % and 28 % respectively. The remaining cases (62 %) were defined as <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis,</b> in which in the majority no microbiological pathogen was identified. Urethritis was more often caused by gonorrhoea and/or Chlamydia in younger men, while it was more often diagnosed as <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis</b> in older men. One third of men with urethritis who underwent laboratory tests had a Chlamydia or gonorrhoea infection. In the majority of cases no pathogen was identified. Compliance with the diagnostic guidelines for urethritis may be improved by more frequent testing of first voided urine sample...|$|E
40|$|The conclusions, where pertinent, of the 10 {{papers on}} the {{treatment}} of <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis</b> which {{have appeared in the}} British Journal of Venereal Diseases between 1971 and now are reviewed. Recent studies purport to argue, but in fact assume, that tetracyclilne treatment for <b>non-specific</b> <b>urethritis</b> is both effective and desirable; current practice agrees with this assumption. To prove effectiveness, studies over much longer follow-up periods would be necessary. These studies should compare results not only of different methods and doses of tetracycline, of different regimens, and of different types of the drug; they should also compare results over a prolonged period with placebos and with other drugs, for instance those outside the antibiotic range and with no suspected side effects. Only then would it be reasonable to hold a firm view on the desirability or the effectiveness of the treatment. With patience and properly conducted experiments results may emerge to justify some view. At the moment the data are ill-assembled although voluminous and fail to support conclusions that have any clarity or force; moreover they are so haphazard that they cannot be compared with one another. Some venereologists are sceptical about treatment, some advocate the administration of one single dose, others say the four- or five-day regimen is preferable, and so on up to those who maintain that the 21 -day regimen is the best. The coexistence of such mutually incompatible, firmly-held views may well suggest that the whole system of investigation put together to validate such views is quite inappropriate. That would be a radical thesis, and perhaps none the worse for that. What is not a radical thesis, however, is that at present the whole system of data and argument is in disarray...|$|E

The question of multiple aetiology was explored by testing statistically whether various clinical features such as age, incubation period, severity of symptoms, and previous infection were related to outcome. No subgrouping of the condition could be found.
