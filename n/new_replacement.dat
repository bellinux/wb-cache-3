5|$|After CoreFire, the world's {{greatest}} superhero, goes missing, {{the former}} members of The Champions re-unite to investigate his disappearance, bringing in two <b>new</b> <b>replacement</b> heroines, Lily and Fatale. They immediately suspect CoreFire's nemesis, Dr. Impossible, was involved, {{even though he has}} been incarcerated in a maximum security prison since his defeat by Damsel during his twelfth world domination attempt. An interrogation by two novice heroes about CoreFire's disappearance gives Dr. Impossible the chance to escape and initiate a new attempt at world domination. The New Champions search for Impossible, convinced he is responsible for CoreFire's demise, while he gathers the materials needed to advance his plan. This is intercut with flashbacks to earlier times and his origin, as well as reflections on other paths he could have taken in life.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Royal Australian Navy traces the {{development}} of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) from the colonisation of Australia by the British in 1788. Until 1859, vessels of the Royal Navy made frequent trips to the new colonies. In 1859, the Australia Squadron was formed as a separate squadron and remained in Australia until 1913. Until Federation, five of the six Australian colonies operated their own colonial naval force, which formed on 1 March 1901 the Australian Navy's (AN) Commonwealth Naval Force which received Royal patronage in July 1911 and was from that time referred to as Royal Australian Navy (RAN). On 4 October 1913 the <b>new</b> <b>replacement</b> fleet for the foundation fleet of 1901 steamed through Sydney Heads for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1774 by the German botanist Jacob Christian Schäffer. Schaeffer {{gave it the}} binomial Elvella clavata, and called it Der keulenförmige Faltenschwamm ("the club-shaped wrinkled sponge") in the vernacular. In 1794, Christian Hendrik Persoon published Spathularia flavida as a nomen novum (<b>new</b> <b>replacement</b> name), as Schaeffer's published name was not legitimate. Elias Fries sanctioned this name in {{the first edition of}} his Systema Mycologicum (1821). According to the taxonomical database MycoBank, additional synonyms include Boletus elvela as defined by August Johann Georg Karl Batsch in 1783, and Spathularia clavata published by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1889. In a 1955 publication, American mycologist Edwin Butterworth Mains considered Charles Horton Peck's 1903 Mitruliopsis flavida to be the same species as S.flavida.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was tasked with {{the protection of}} the oil fields at Ploiești, which were vital to the German war effort. They trained some Romanian officers in German Panzer tactics. Apart from training and maintaining their equipment, the soldiers had nothing to do and became bored. In March 1941 Strachwitz was sent back to Cosel in Germany where a <b>new</b> <b>replacement</b> unit was to be founded. He returned via his home town and 24 hours later a telegram from Hube called him back. This was preceded by a series of events in Belgrade. On 25 March 1941, the government of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia had signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort {{to stay out of the}} war. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'état led by Air Force commander General Dušan Simović. As a result, Hitler chose not only to support Mussolini's ambitions in Albania and in the Greco-Italian War but also to attack Yugoslavia. For this purpose the mobilized forces of Panzergruppe I (1st Panzer Group) under the command of Generaloberst Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist were ordered to attack Belgrade in what would become the Invasion of Yugoslavia.|$|E

25|$|The F2002 was {{not only}} a {{development}} of the championship-winning Ferrari F2001, but a completely revolutionary model involving many technologies not seen previously. Since the late 1990s Ferrari had been using the same basic concept and design of gearbox and although this had been used to win drivers and constructors titles from 1999 onwards the technical team pushed ahead with a new version instead. The <b>new</b> <b>replacement</b> gearbox casing was made of ultra lightweight and higher strength titanium, thus reducing its weight by as much as 15% and lowering the car's centre of gravity. The new compact design allowed for great advancement in the bodywork and increasing the car's aerodynamic efficiency at the rear.|$|E
25|$|When the Molineux Street Stand {{failed to}} meet new safety legislation, the club began {{building}} a <b>new</b> <b>replacement</b> stand behind the existing one, on land where housing had been demolished. This new all-seater stand – named the John Ireland Stand after the then-club president – was completed in 1979, as the planned first stage of a rebuilding of the entire stadium. The £2million cost of this stand though made the club's financial situation critical and it entered receivership in 1982. By the time the team dropped into the Fourth Division in 1986, only the John Ireland Stand and the South Bank terrace remained in use after new safety laws implemented following the Bradford City stadium fire forced the closure of both the now-dilapidated North Bank and Waterloo Road Stand, which the club lacked the finance to improve.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 2001, the National Automobile Dealers Association {{conducted}} a study revealing {{the average age of}} vehicles in operation in the US. The study found that of vehicles in operation in the US, 38.3% were older than ten years, 22.3% were between seven and ten years old, 25.8% were between three and six years old, and 13.5% were less than two years old. According to this study the majority of vehicles, 60.6%, of vehicles were older than seven years in 2001. This relatively high age of automobiles in the US might be explained by unaffordable prices for comparable <b>new</b> <b>replacement</b> vehicles and a corresponding gradual decline in sales figures since 1998. Also, many Americans own three or more vehicles. The low marginal cost of registering and insuring additional older vehicles, many of which are rarely used, could cause the study to be skewed as these vehicles are still given full weight in the statistics.|$|E
