40|$|Objective. - To assess urinary 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin {{levels in}} a large {{consecutive}} series of patients with migraine and several comorbidities (chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, insomnia, anxiety, and depression) as compared with controls. Background. - Urine analysis is widely used {{as a measure of}} melatonin secretion, as it is correlated with the <b>nocturnal</b> <b>profile</b> of plasma melatonin secretion. Melatonin has critical functions in human physiology and substantial evidence points to its importance in the regulation of circadian rhythms, sleep, and headache disorders. Methods. - Urine samples were collected into a single plastic container over a 12 -hour period from 8 : 00 pm to 8 : 00 am of the next day, and 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin was measured by quantitative ELISA. All of the patients were given a detailed questionnaire about headaches and additionally answered the following questionnaires: Chalder fatigue questionnaire, Epworth somnolence questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Results. - A total of 220 subjects were evaluated - 73 (33 %) had episodic migraine, 73 (33 %) had chronic migraine, and 74 (34 %) were enrolled as control subjects. There was a strong correlation between the concentration of 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin detected and chronic migraine. Regarding the comorbidities, this study objectively demonstrates an inverse relationship between 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin levels and depression, anxiety, and fatigue.

40|$|A {{pathological}} nocturnal {{blood pressure}} (BP) profile, either non-dipping or reverse dipping, occurs {{in more than}} 50  % of subjects diagnosed with multiple system atrophy (MSA) or Parkinson's disease (PD). This may play a negative prognostic role in α-synucleinopathies, but, being mostly asymptomatic, remains largely underdiagnosed. In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed at developing a decision-support algorithm to predict pathological <b>nocturnal</b> BP <b>profiles</b> during a standard tilt-table examination in PD and MSA. Sixteen MSA and 16 PD patients underwent standard tilt-table examination and 24 -h ambulatory BP monitoring (24 -h ABPM). Clinical and tilt test differences between patients with a normal and a pathological <b>nocturnal</b> BP <b>profile</b> at 24 -h ABPM were assessed, and a decision-support algorithm was developed accordingly. 75  % of MSA and 31  % of PD patients showed a pathological <b>nocturnal</b> BP <b>profile.</b> This was associated with more pronounced orthostatic BP drop (p =  0. 03), joint occurrence of orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension (p =  0. 046), and lack of BP overshoot in the late phase II (II_L, p =  0. 002) and in the phase IV (p =  0. 007) of the Valsalva manoeuvre.

40|$|Background: The lack {{of catch}} up growth (CUG) in small for gestational age (SGA) {{children}} {{may be related to}} a reduced sensitivity to insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-I). Aim: To assess the sensitivity to IGF-I in small for gestational age children, measuring basal and post IGF-I <b>nocturnal</b> <b>profile</b> of growth hormone (GH). Patients and methods: We studied 34 prepubertal SGA children aged 4 to 11 years. Twenty three had CUG and 11 did not have CUG. As an IGF-I sensitivity test, nocturnal GH levels were measured every 20 minutes from 23 : 00 h to 07 : 00 h, both under baseline conditions and after the administration of a subcutaneous bolus of 1 mg/kg/body weight of the IGF-I + IGFBP- 3 complex (Somatokine®). Results: At the time of the study, the Z scores for height among children with and without CUG were - 1. 55 ± 0. 22 and - 3. 24 ± 0. 28, respectively (p < 0. 0001). There were no statistical differences between CUG + vs CUG- patients in mean basal GH (6. 6 ± 0. 5 and 5. 6 ± 0. 6 ng/ml, respectively). After Somatokine® administration, mean GH, and the mean GH area under the curve (AUC) decreased significantly in both groups. However, mean overnight GH AUC decreased in all SGA children with CUG, after Somatokine® administration, whereas 3 out of 11 SGA children without CUG had an increase in their mean GH AUC in response to Somatokine®.

40|$|OBJETIVOS: Identificar em pacientes com oclusão do ramo da veia central da retina utilizando a monitorização ambulatorial da pressão {{arterial}} e medidas clínicas da pressão arterial: prevalência de hipertensão e o perfil noturno da pressão arterial. MÉTODOS: Prospectivamente, 93 olhos de 83 pacientes com oclusão do ramo da veia central da retina foram submetidos à avaliação oftalmológica. Após, os pacientes foram encaminhados para avaliação clínica e monitorização da pressão arterial. Pacientes sem descenso da pressão durante o sono ("non-dipper") foram definidos como um declínio na pressão arterial sistólica PURPOSE: To identify {{in patients}} with branch retinal vein occlusion using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and clinical blood pressure measures: hypertension prevalence, and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>profile</b> of blood pressure. METHODS: Prospectively, 93 eyes of 83 patients with branch retinal vein occlusion were submitted to ophthalmological examination. Afterwards the patients were submitted to clinical evaluation and blood pressure monitoring. Non-dipper {{was defined as a}} fall in systolic blood pressure < 10 %, and dipper when this value was higher. RESULTS: Disease affected one eye in 73 (88 %) patients. The temporal superior branch was the site of occlusion in 61 (65. 6 %) eyes, while in the others the infero-temporal branch was affected. Seventy six (92 %) patients were diagnosed as hypertensive after clinical evaluation. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring identified 76 hipertensives, 5 normotensives, 1 white-coat hypertensive and one masked hypertensive subjects. The two latter were excluded from the analysis. Of the 81 analyzed patients, forty (49 %) were dippers and 41 (51 %) were non-dippers. Among the HT (n= 76), 36 (47 %) were dippers and 40 (53 %) were non-dippers. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of hypertension in our series was extremely high (92 %) which suggests that physiopathology of the disease has a close relationship with changes promoted by hypertension. A little {{more than half of the}} hypertensives were non-dippers (n= 40; 52, 6 %).

40|$|Most animals conduct daily {{activities}} exclusively either {{during the day}} or at night. Here, hormones such as melatonin and corticosterone, greatly influence the synchronization or regulation of physiological and behavioral cycles needed for daily activity. How then do species that exhibit more flexible daily activity patterns, responses to ecological, environmental or life-history processes, regulate daily hormone profiles important to daily performance? This study examined the consequences of (1) nocturnal activity on diel profiles of melatonin and corticosterone and (2) the effects of experimentally increased acute melatonin levels on physiological and metabolic performance in the cane toad (Rhinella marinus). Unlike inactive captive toads that had a distinct <b>nocturnal</b> melatonin <b>profile,</b> nocturnally active toads sampled under field and captive conditions, exhibited decreased <b>nocturnal</b> melatonin <b>profiles</b> with no evidence for any phase shift. Nocturnal corticosterone levels were significantly higher in field active toads than captive toads. In toads with experimentally increased melatonin levels, plasma lactate and glucose responses following recovery post exercise were significantly different from control toads. However, exogenously increased melatonin did not affect resting metabolism in toads. These results suggest that toads could adjust daily hormone <b>profiles</b> to match <b>nocturnal</b> activity requirements, thereby avoiding performance costs induced by high nocturnal melatonin levels. The ability of toads to exhibit plasticity in daily hormone cycles, could have broad implications for how they and other animals utilize behavioral flexibility to optimize {{daily activities}} in response to natural and increasingly human mediated environmental variation...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that {{in the absence of}} photic cues, the circadian rhythms of rodents can be readily phase-shifted and entrained by various nonphotic stimuli that induce increased levels of locomotor activity (i. e., benzodiazepines, a new running wheel, and limited food access). In the presence of an entraining light-dark (LD) cycle, however, the entraining effects of nonphotic stimuli on (parts of) the circadian oscillator are far less clear. Yet, an interesting finding is that appropriately timed exercise after a phase shift can accelerate the entrainment of circadian rhythms to the new LD cycle in both rodents and humans. The present study investigated whether restricted daytime feeding (RF) (1) induces a phase shift of the melatonin rhythm under entrained LD conditions and (2) accelerates resynchronization of circadian rhythms after an 8 -h phase advance. Animals were adapted to RF with 2 -h food access at the projected time of the new dark onset. Before and at several time points after the 8 -h phase advance, <b>nocturnal</b> melatonin <b>profiles</b> were measured in RF animals and animals on ad libitum feeding (AL). In LD-entrained conditions, RF did not cause any significant changes in the <b>nocturnal</b> melatonin <b>profile</b> as compared to AL. Unexpectedly, after the 8 -h phase advance, RF animals resynchronized more slowly to the new LD cycle than AL animals.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} menopause, hormone therapy (HT) and aging on sleep. Further, the mechanisms behind these effects were examined by studying the associations between sleep and the <b>nocturnal</b> <b>profiles</b> of sleep-related hormones. Crosssectional study protocols were used to evaluate sleep in normal conditions and during recovery from sleep deprivation. The effect of initiation of HT on sleep and sleeprelated hormones was studied in a prospective controlled trial. Young, premenopausal and postmenopausal women were studied, and the methods included polysomnography, 24 -h blood sampling, questionnaires and cognitive tests of attention. Postmenopausal women were less satisfied with their sleep quality than premenopausal women, {{but this was not}} reflected in sleepiness or attention. The objective sleep quality was mainly similar in pre- and postmenopausal women, but differed from young women. The recovery mechanisms from sleep deprivation were relatively well-preserved after menopause. HT offered no advantage to sleep after sleep deprivation or under normal conditions. The decreased growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) levels after menopause were reversible with HT. Neither menopause nor HT had any effect on cortisol levels. In premenopausal women, HT had only minor effects on PRL and cortisol levels. The temporal link between GH and slow wave sleep (SWS) was weaker after menopause. PRL levels were temporally associated with sleep stages, and higher levels were seen during SWS and lower during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Sleep quality after menopause is better determined by age than by menopausal state. Although HT restores the decreased levels of GH and PRL after menopause, it offers no advantage to sleep quality under normal conditions or after sleep deprivation...|$|R

The weekly geometric mean of individual exposures ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 6 µT. The results are compared to those of 15 unexposed men age-matched, with the same synchronization and physical activity that served as controls (individual exposures ranged from 0. 004 to 0. 092 µT). Blood samples were taken hourly from 20 : 00 h to 08 : 00 h. Exposure over a long period and on a daily basis to magnetic fields resulted in no changes in the levels or patterns of hematological and immune system variables. Our data show that a long-term exposure to 50 -Hz magnetic fields does not affect the hematological and immune system functions or their profile in healthy men, at least for the variables studied, and suggest that magnetic fields have no cumulative effects on these functions...|$|R
40|$|Flight at high {{altitude}} {{is part of}} a migration strategy that maximises insect population displacement. This thesis represents the first substantial analysis of insect migration and layering in Europe. Vertical-looking entomological radar has revealed specific characteristics of high-altitude flight: in particular layering (where {{a large proportion of the}} migrating insects are concentrated in a narrow altitude band). The meteorological mechanisms underpinning the formation of these layers are the focus of this thesis. Aerial netting samples and radar data revealed four distinct periods of high-altitude insect migration: dawn, daytime, dusk, and night-time. The most frequently observed <b>nocturnal</b> <b>profiles</b> during the summertime were layers. It is hypothesised that nocturnal layers initiate at a critical altitude (200 – 500 m above ground level) and time (20 : 00 – 22 : 00 hours UTC). Case study analysis, statistical analysis, and a Lagrangian trajectory model showed that nocturnal insect layers probably result from the insects’ response to meteorological conditions. Temperature was the variable most correlated with nocturnal insect layer presence and intensity because insects are poikilothermic, and temperatures experienced during high-altitude migration in temperate climates are expected to be marginal for many insects’ flight. Hierarchical effects were detected such that other variables—specifically wind speed—were only correlated with insect layer presence and intensity once temperatures were warm. The trajectory model developed comprised: (i) insect flight characteristics; (ii) turbulent winds (which cause vertical spread of the layer); and (iii) mean wind speed, which normally leads to horizontal displacements of hundreds of kilometres in a single migratory flight. This thesis has revealed that there is considerable migratory activity over the UK in the summer months, and a range of fascinating phenomena can be observed (including layers). The UK has moved from one of the least studied to perhaps the best studied environments of aerial insect migration and layering in the world.

40|$|Objective There {{is limited}} {{information}} regarding the effects of IGF-I and/or IGFBP- 3 on circulating ghrelin concentrations. To {{determine the effects of}} IGF-I on GH and ghrelin concentrations, we examined the GH and ghrelin <b>nocturnal</b> <b>profiles</b> before and after the administration of the IGF-I/-IGFBP- 3 complex (Iplex (TM)) to low birth weight children. Design The children were studied on two separate occasions, the first under basal conditions, and the second time after the sc administration of 1 mg/kg of Iplex (TM) at 2100 h. Blood samples for determination of GH and ghrelin were obtained every 20 min between 2300 h and 0700 h, while the children were sleeping. In each patient, we calculated the mean GH and ghrelin area under the curve (GH AUC and GHR AUC), both under basal conditions and after the administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP- 3 complex. Setting The study was performed at a University Research Centre located at a General Hospital in Santiago, Chile. Patients Twenty prepubertal children (11 boys and 9 girls), born after a full-term pregnancy with a birth weight below 2. 8 kg were studied at a mean +/- SEM age of 7. 3 +/- 0. 5 years (range 4 - 11 years). Their mean height was - 1. 8 +/- 0. 3 standard deviation score (SDS) and their mean BMI was 0. 1 +/- 0. 2 SDS {{at the time of the}} study. Main outcome and results Mean nocturnal GH AUC exhibited a significant decrease (2903 +/- 185 vs 1860 +/- 122 ng/ml min, P < 0. 01), whereas mean GHR AUC showed a significant increase after administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP- 3 complex (68 +/- 16 vs 288 +/- 36 ng/ml min, P < 0. 01). Conclusions These findings indicate that the IGF-I/IGFBP- 3 complex appears to have opposite effects on circulating GH and ghrelin concentrations in low birth weight children, suggesting that, in addition to its known negative feed-back effect on GH, IGF-I and/or IGFBP- 3 may have a positive feed-back effect on ghrelin...|$|R

HRV and BG were analyzed from 12 am- 6 am following hockey activity and low activity days. Hockey-type IHE on a cycle ergometer decreased BG by - 1. 9 ± 2. 8 mmol/L, while an actual hockey game increased BG by 1. 0 ± 3. 2 mmol/L.

We report nighttime measurements of NO 3, NO 2, and O 3, in the polluted marine boundary layer southwest of Vancouver, BC during a three week study in summer of 2005. The concentration of N 2 O 5 was calculated using the well known equilibrium, NO 3 +NO 2 ↔N 2 O 5. Median overnight mixing ratios of NO 3, N 2 O 5 and NO 2 were 10. 3 ppt, 122 ppt and 8. 3 ppb with median N 2 O 5 /NO 3 molar ratios of 13. 1 and median nocturnal partitioning of 4. 9 %. Due to the high levels of NO 2 that can inhibit approach to steady-state, we use a method for calculating NO 3 lifetimes that does not assume the steady-state approximation. Median and average lifetimes of NO 3 in the NO 3 -N 2 O 5 nighttime reservoir were 1. 1 – 2. 3 min. We have determined <b>nocturnal</b> <b>profiles</b> of the pseudo first order loss coefficient of NO 3 and the first order loss coefficients of N 2 O 5 by regression of the NO 3 inverse lifetimes with the [N 2 O 5]/[NO 3] ratio. Direct losses of NO 3 are highest early in the night, tapering off as the night proceeds. The magnitude of the first order loss coefficient of N 2 O 5 is consistent with recommended homogeneous rate coefficients for reaction of N 2 O 5 with water vapor early in the night, but increases significantly {{in the latter part of}} the night when relative humidity increases beyond 75 %, consistent with heterogeneous reactions of N 2 O 5 with sea salt and/or other aerosols with rate constant k het = 1. 2 × 10 − 3 s − 1. Analysis indicates that a correlation exists between overnight integrated N 2 O 5 concentrations in the marine boundary layer, a surrogate for the accumulation of chlorine containing photolabile species, and maximum 1 -h average O 3 at stations in the Lower Fraser Valley the next day when there is clear evidence of a sea breeze transporting marine air into the valley. The range of maximum 1 -h average O 3 increase attributable to the correlation is ΔO 3 =+ 1. 1 to + 8. 3 ppb throughout the study for the average of 20 stations, although higher increases are seen for stations far downwind of the coastal urban area.

40|$|Objectives: Intermittent hypoxia (IH), {{resulted}} from recurring episodes of upper airway obstruction, is the hallmark feature {{and the most}} important pathophysiologic pathway of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). IH {{is believed to be the}} most important factor causing systemic inflammation. Studies suggest that insulin resistance (IR) is positively associated with OSA. In this study, we hypothesized that the recurrence of IH might result in cellular and systemic inflammation, which was manifested through the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines after IH exposure, and because IR is linked with inflammation tightly, this inflammatory situation may implicate an IR status. Methods: We developed an IH 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocyte and rat model respectively, recapitulating the <b>nocturnal</b> oxygen <b>profile</b> in OSA. In IH cells, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) DNA binding reactions, hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 a (HIF- 1 a), glucose transporter- 1 (Glut- 1), necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin (IL) - 6, leptin, adiponectin mRNA transcriptional activities and protein expressions were measured.

40|$|Twenty-four-hour blood {{pressure}} (BP) {{and heart rate}} profiles were recorded in 19 patients 1 and 7 months after cardiac transplantation using noninvasive ambulatory monitors and were analyzed using the periodogram method. These recordings were {{compared with those of}} control subjects matched for age, sex and daytime ambulatory BP. One month after transplantation, the nighttime decrease in systolic and diastolic BPs were attenuated in the patients as compared to the control subjects (p less than 0. 001). The daily oral dose of prednisolone was inversely correlated with the magnitude of the nighttime decreases in systolic and diastolic BPs (r = - 0. 47 and - 0. 53, p less than 0. 05). In contrast, 7 months after transplantation, the nighttime decrease in systolic and diastolic BPs reappeared in the patients and was of similar magnitude as that in the control subjects. When the immunosuppressive regimens during the 2 periods of recordings were compared, the reduction in the daily oral dose of prednisolone administered to the patients 7 months after transplantation was correlated with the observed increase in the day-night systolic and diastolic BP difference (r = 0. 61, p less than 0. 01 and r = 0. 51, p less than 0. 05). Thus, data show the reappearance of normal circadian BP profiles in patients with long-term heart transplants, and suggest that glucocorticoid administration may contribute to the abnormal <b>nocturnal</b> BP <b>profiles</b> observed 1 month after transplantation.

40|$|Leptin, an {{adipocyte}} hormone, is a {{trophic factor}} for the reproductive system; however, it is still unknown {{whether there is a}} dynamic relation between fluctuations in circulating leptin and hypothalamic—pituitary–ovarian (HPO) axis hormones. To test the hypothesis that fluctuations in plasma leptin concentrations are related to the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol, we sampled plasma from six healthy women every 7 min for 24 h during days 8 – 11 of the menstrual cycle. Cross-correlation analysis throughout the 24 -h cycle revealed a relation between release patterns of leptin and LH, with a lag of 42 – 84 min but no significant cross-correlation between LH and estradiol. The ultradian fluctuations in leptin levels showed pattern synchrony with those of both LH and estradiol as determined by cross-approximate entropy (cross-ApEn). At night, as leptin levels rose to their peak, the pulsatility profiles of LH changed significantly and became synchronous with those of leptin. LH pulses were fewer, of longer duration, higher amplitude, and larger area than during the day. Moreover, the synchronicity of LH and leptin occurred late at night, at which time estradiol and leptin also exhibited significantly stronger pattern coupling than during the day. We propose that leptin may regulate the minute-to-minute oscillations in the levels of LH and estradiol, and that the nocturnal rise in leptin may determine the change in <b>nocturnal</b> LH <b>profile</b> in the mid-to-late follicular phase that precedes ovulation. This may explain the disruption of hypothalamic—pituitary–ovarian function that is characteristic of states of low leptin release, such as anorexia nervosa and cachexia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{significant}} {{delay in}} the timing of endogenous circadian rhythms {{has been associated with}} delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD). More recently, other mechanisms have also been proposed to account for this disorder. To further explore the etiology of DSPD, the present study compared <b>nocturnal</b> melatonin <b>profiles</b> of 26 DSPD patients (18 males, 8 females; age, 21. 73 ± 4. 98 years) and 17 normally timed good sleepers (10 males, 7 females; age, 23. 82 ± 5. 23 years) in a time-free, dim-light (< 10 lux) laboratory environment. A 30 -h modified constant routine with alternating 20 -min sleep opportunities and 40 min of enforced wakefulness was used to measure the endogenous melatonin circadian rhythm. Salivary melatonin was sampled half-hourly from 1820 h to 0020 h and then hourly from 0120 h to 1620 h. DSPD patients had significantly later timed melatonin profiles that were delayed by approximately 3 h com- pared to normal sleepers, and there were no notable differences in the relative duration of secretion between groups. However, melatonin secretion between dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) and acrophase was less prominent in DSPD patients compared to good sleepers, who showed a more acute initial surge of melatonin following the DLMO. Although the regulatory role of melatonin is unknown, abnormal melatonin profiles have been linked to psychiatric and neurological disorders (e. g., major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, Parkinson disease). These results therefore suggest that in addition to a delayed endogenous circadian rhythm, a diminished initial surge of melatonin secretion following DLMO may contribute to the etiology of DSPD...|$|R

Collected dialysates were assayed by radioimmunoassay for melatonin concentrations. A non-linear regression was fitted through the obtained datapoints to determine the time points at which a 50 % increase (IT 50) and decrease (DT 50) of the nocturnal melatonin peak were reached. In a first experiment, the <b>nocturnal</b> melatonin <b>profiles</b> of four animals were determined throughout 5 consecutive days. In a second experiment, we analysed the melatonin profiles during the night in rats originating from three different breeding colonies (Dépré Harlan, and Iffa-Cŕedo). A low intraindividual variability {{was found on the}} phase markers IT 50 and DT 50, as on peak duration of melatonin rhythms estimated over 5 subsequent days in the same animal. In contrast, animals showed a large interindividual variability in their profile phase markers and the values were dependent on the origin of the breeding colony. Each rat colony was characterized by early or late IT 50 and DT 50 as long or short peak length. It is concluded from experiment 1 that the melatonin rhythm is a very stable circadian marker. Nevertheless, great caution must be taken in the choice of animal groups while studying circadian rhythms due to the large interindividual variability observed in experiment 2. Therefore, as the technique allows the use of the animal as its own control, the present study demonstrated that the use of the microdialysis technique is of interest in studies on the circadian syste...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work Blackadar’s concept of nocturnal {{inertial}} oscillations is extended. Blackadar’s concept describes frictionless inertial oscillations above the nocturnal inversion layer. The current work includes frictional effects within the nocturnal boundary layer. It is {{shown that the}} <b>nocturnal</b> wind speed <b>profile</b> describes an oscillation around the nocturnal equilibrium wind vector, rather than around the geostrophic wind vector (as in the Blackadar case). By using this perspective, continuous time-dependent wind profiles are predicted. As such, information on both the height and {{the magnitude of the}} nocturnal low-level jet is available as a function of time. Preliminary analysis shows that the proposed extension performs well in comparison with observations when a simple Ekman model is used to represent the equilibrium state in combination with a realistic initial velocity profile. In addition to jet dynamics, backward inertial oscillations are predicted at lower levels close to the surface, which also appear to be present in observations. The backward oscillation forms an important mechanism behind weakening low-level winds during the afternoon transition. Both observational and theoretical modeling studies are needed to explore this phenomenon further...|$|R
40|$|Ecosystem carbon budgets {{depend on}} there being good {{representative}} surface flux observations for all land use types {{during the entire}} diurnal cycle. In calm conditions that often occur at night, especially in areas of small roughness (such as pastures), ecosystem respiration rate is poorly measured using the eddy covariance (EC) technique. <b>Nocturnal</b> vertical <b>profiles</b> of temperature, humidity and winds were observed using tethered balloon soundings in a pasture in the eastern Amazon during two campaigns in 2001. The site is characterized by very weak winds at night, {{so that there is}} insufficient turbulence for the eddy covariance technique to determine fluxes accurately. To compensate, the time evolution of the profiles is used to determine surface fluxes at early morning and these are compared to those observed by eddy covariance at a nearby micrometeorological tower. The nocturnal boundary layer thickness h is determined as the height to which the surface fluxes must converge so that energy budget closure is achieved. The estimated values range from 30 m, around 2200 LST, to more than 100 m just before dawn. These are in good agreement with the observed thickness of a frequently-observed fog layer {{during the middle of the}} night. During the early portion of the night, when the accumulation layer is shallow, there is appreciable decrease of dCO 2 /dt with height. On calm nights, CO 2 accumulation rate is larger near the surface than at higher levels. On windier nights, this accumulation rate is vertically uniform. Hence, extrapolation of tower profiles for estimating fluxes must be done carefully. Although uncertainties remain large, an alternate approach to the eddy covariance method is described for measuring nighttime surface CO 2 fluxes under stable atmospheric conditions. 8 / 11 / 03 3 1...|$|R

It starts with a male-phase flower that shows secondary pollen presentation on the perianth and follows with a female phase after the corolla is removed or abscissed. We examined the potential for insects, lizards, and mammals to act as pollinators. Observations and experiments on breeding system, phenology, floral scent, flower visitors, and lizard feeding were undertaken in southern Australia. Acrotriche serrulata sets little fruit by autonomous selfing but readily sets fruit after facilitated geitonogamy and xenogamy. Flower anthesis is diurnal and <b>nocturnal.</b> The nectar <b>profile</b> includes acetaldehyde, ethanol, and ethyl acetate. The nocturnal mammals Trichosurus vulpecula and the introduced Rattus rattus were the only visitors observed to actively forage on the flowers. In contrast, the skinks Egernia whitii, Niveoscincus ocellatus, and Niveoscincus metallicus routinely passed flowers full of nectar and foraged only on those presented during feeding observations. Insects visited the flowers but did not behave as pollinators. Acrotriche serrulata {{is likely to be}} pollinated by nocturnal mammals attracted to its flowers by scent. Effective pollinators appear to be rare over some of its range. This may have implications for the long-term reproductive success and conservation of A. serrulata...|$|R

Investigations of soil, leaf, tree and micro-climatological variables were undertaken to validate a soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) model. A comparison of measured and modelled rates of sap flow showed strong positive correlations across the 115 day study period. Using measured and modelled data we examined (a) {{the sensitivity of}} sap flow to abiotic and biotic factors; (b) the depth from which water uptake must occur to achieve observed rates of tree sap flow; (c) {{the importance of the}} water content of the upper soil profile as a determinant of sap flow; (d) the occurrence of nocturnal sap flow. We found that sap flow was very sensitive to the leaf area of the stand, whole tree conductance and the critical water potential of the leaves but insensitive to stem capacitance and increases in root biomass. Water uptake must have occurred from depths of up to 3 m and sap flow was independent of the water content of the upper soil <b>profile.</b> <b>Nocturnal</b> sap flow was observed and this was mostly because of incomplete stomatal closure at night...|$|R
40|$|Abstract It {{is known}} that day-active Nile grass rats, Arvicanthis niloticus, {{increase}} the amount of activity in the night relative to that in the day when provided with running wheels. This was confirmed in the present study. Animals without a wheel displayed 69. 0 % of their general activity in the L phase of a 12 : 12 h light-dark cycle; animals provided with wheels had only 48. 6 % of their wheel revolu-tions in the light. The contribution of direct (masking) responses to light to the increased nocturnality of animals with wheels was examined in two experi-ments. In experiment 1, masking was tested by exposing the animals to repeated cycles of 30 min of entraining light and 30 min of a different, usually dimmer light, during the L phase of a 12 : 12 h light-dark cycle. For animals with wheels, there was more running during the 30 -min pulses of dim light or darkness than during the 30 -min periods of entraining light. In contrast, for animals without wheels, there was more general activity during the 30 -min periods of entraining light than during the 30 -min pulses of dim light or darkness. In experiment 2, the animals were first exposed to a 12 : 12 h light-dark cycle and then put on a 1 : 10 : 1 : 12 h LDLD skeleton photoperiod. Animals with wheels increased their running during the subjective day of the skeleton photoperiod compared to that in the actual day of the 12 : 12 h light-dark cycle. Animals without wheels showed similar levels of general activity during the subjective day of the skeleton photoperiod and the actual day of the 12 : 12 h cycle. These experiments demon-strate that when Nile rats have running wheels, their increased nocturnal activity is associated with an increased suppression of locomotion in direct response to light. It is possible that changes in masking responses to light may be an essential and integral component of switching between diurnal and <b>nocturnal</b> activity <b>profiles...</b>|$|R
40|$|The risk of {{cardiovascular}} diseases and sleep-disordered breathing increases after menopause. This cross-sectional study focuses on overnight transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO 2) measurements and {{their power to}} predict changes in the early markers {{of cardiovascular}} and metabolic diseases. The endothelial function of the brachial artery, the intima-media thickness of the carotid artery, blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin A 1 C and plasma levels of cholesterols and triglycerides were used as markers of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The study subjects consisted of healthy premenopausal women of 46 {{years of age and}} postmenopausal women of 56 years of age. From wakefulness to sleep, the TcCO 2 levels increased more in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women. In estrogen-users the increase in TcCO 2 levels was even more pronounced than in other postmenopausal women. From the dynamic behaviour of the nocturnal TcCO 2 signal, several important features were detected. These TcCO 2 features had a remarkable role in the prediction of endothelial dysfunction and thickening of the carotid wall in healthy premenopausal women. In addition, these TcCO 2 features were linked with blood pressure, lipid profile and glucose balance in postmenopausal women. The <b>nocturnal</b> TcCO 2 <b>profile</b> seems to contain significant information, which is associated with early changes in cardiovascular diseases in middle-aged women.

40|$|Hypertension {{increases}} the cardiovascular risk in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). In chapter 2 {{we found that}} hypertension was highly prevalent in adult (77. 2 %), paediatric (62. 7 %) and young adult (86. 4 %) KTRs. Transition from the paediatric to adult care did not affect hypertension and there were large variations in hypertension management policies between Dutch centres as shown in chapter 3. The randomised-crossover clinical trial in chapter 4 reports that sodium restriction in stable KTRs on RAAS inhibition is feasible, decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) but only modestly effects urinary albumin excretion. In chapter 5, we studied <b>nocturnal</b> BP dipping <b>profiles</b> (as additional CV risk factor) in KTRs using the prolonged release once-daily tacrolimus compared to the twice-daily formulation. No difference was found. In chapter 6, we hypothesised that sympathetic nerves regrow after transplantation and can be visualised using ¹²³I-mIBG scintigraphy. We demonstrated that ¹²³I-mIBG uptake at 15 min, but not at 4 h p. i, significantly correlated with time after transplantation, suggesting functional reinnervation in renal allografts over time, independent of allograft function. In chapter 7, we hypothesised that changes in sympathetic nerve activity assessed by renal ¹²³I-mIBG scintigraphy, relate to changes in BP and catecholamines after catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (RDN). No changes in ¹²³I-mIBG parameters were found, suggesting that incomplete denervation is a {{possible explanation for the}} lack of RDN efficacy.

40|$|In {{this work}} the dynamic {{behaviour}} {{of the wind}} in the nocturnal boundary layer is studied, with a particular focus on systematic behaviour of the near-surface wind. Recently, an extension of the well-known Blackadar model for frictionless inertial oscillations above the nocturnal boundary layer was proposed by Van de Wiel et al., which accounts for frictional effects within the nocturnal boundary layer. It appears that the <b>nocturnal</b> wind velocity <b>profile</b> tends to perform an inertial oscillation around an equilibrium wind profile, rather than around the geostrophic wind vector (as in the Blackadar model). In the present study we propose the concept of ‘composite hodographs’ to evaluate the ideas and assumptions of the aforementioned analytical model. Composite hodographs are constructed based on a large observational dataset from the Cabauw observatory. For comparison and deeper analysis, this method is also applied to single-column model simulations that represent the same dataset. From this, it is shown that winds in the middle and upper part of the nocturnal boundary layer closely follow the dynamics predicted by the model by Van de Wiel et al. In contrast, the near-surface wind shows more complex behaviour that can be described by two different stages: (1) a decelerating phase where the wind decreases rapidly in magnitude due to enlarged stress divergence in the transition period near sunset (an aspect not included in the analytical model), and (2) a regular type of inertial oscillation, but with relatively small amplitude as compared to the oscillations in the middle and upper parts of the nocturnal boundary layer.

40|$|Nitrous acid (HONO) often {{plays an}} {{important}} role in tropospheric photochemistry as a major precursor of the hydroxyl radical (OH) in early morning hours and potentially during the day. However, the processes leading to formation of HONO and its vertical distribution at night, which can have a considerable impact on daytime ozone formation, are currently poorly characterized by observations and models. Long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) measurements of HONO during the 2006 TexAQS II Radical and Aerosol Measurement Project (TRAMP), near downtown Houston, TX, show <b>nocturnal</b> vertical <b>profiles</b> of HONO, with mixing ratios of up to 2. 2 ppb near the surface and below 100 ppt aloft. Three nighttime periods of HONO, NO 2 and O 3 observations during TRAMP were used to perform model simulations of vertical mixing ratio profiles. By adjusting vertical mixing and NO x emissions the modeled NO 2 and O 3 mixing ratios showed very good agreement with the observations. Using a simple conversion of NO 2 to HONO on the ground, direct HONO emissions, as well as HONO loss at the ground and on aerosol, the observed HONO profiles were reproduced by the model for 1 – 2 and 7 – 8 September in the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL). The unobserved increase of HONO to NO 2 ratio (HONO/NO 2) with altitude that was simulated by the initial model runs was found to be due to HONO uptake being too small on aerosol and too large on the ground. Refined model runs, with adjusted HONO uptake coefficients, showed much better agreement of HONO and HONO/NO 2 for two typical nights, except during morning rush hour, when other HONO formation pathways are most likely active. One of the nights analyzed showed an increase of HONO mixing ratios together with decreasing NO 2 mixing ratios that the model was unable to reproduce, most likely due to the impact of weak precipitation during this night. HONO formation and removal rates averaged over the lowest 300 m of the atmosphere showed that NO 2 to HONO conversion on the ground was the dominant source of HONO, followed by traffic emission. Aerosol did not play an important role in HONO formation. Although ground deposition was also a major removal pathway of HONO, net HONO production at the ground was the main source of HONO in our model studies. Sensitivity studies showed that in the stable NBL, net HONO production at the ground tends to increase with faster vertical mixing and stronger NO x emission. Vertical transport was found to be the dominant source of HONO aloft...|$|R
