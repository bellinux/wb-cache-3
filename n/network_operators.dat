40|$|This paper studies Cournot {{competition}} with two generators who share one transmission {{line with a}} limited capacity to supply price-taking consumers. In such a game the <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> needs a rule to allocate transmission capacity. Three rules are studied: all-or-nothing, proportional, and efficient rationing. The first result {{is that if the}} <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> taxes the whole congestion rent, the generators strategically change their production quantities, such that the <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> obtains no congestion rent. This gives poor incentives for investment in transmission capacity. The second result is that the <b>network</b> <b>operator</b> can create competition among the generators, which can increase welfare. Marginal nodal congestion pricing, which is optimal under perfect competition, is sub-optimal when generators can set their production quantities freely. It does not generate revenue for the <b>network</b> <b>operator,</b> nor does it increase competition among the generators. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Without {{commenting on}} the {{morality}} of the bill, the Canadian <b>Network</b> <b>Operators</b> Consortium noted that smaller, independent ISPs would likely be unable to afford expensive new equipment to allow authorities real-time monitoring of their customers and may have to discontinue business. The Ministry had estimated that the initial cost of the bill to be $80 Million over four years, and $6.7 Million dollars each year after that. The ISPs claimed the cost could be much higher. According to the CBC, the costs would have either translated as higher telecommunications costs for Canadian consumers, or increased federal {{taxes to pay for}} the program.|$|E

25|$|The {{broadcast}} flag {{concept was}} developed by Fox Broadcasting in 2001, and {{was supported by the}} MPAA and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A ruling in May 2005, by a United States courts of appeals held that the FCC lacked authority to impose it on the TV industry in the US. It required that all HDTVs obey a stream specification determining whether a stream can be recorded. This could block instances of fair use, such as time-shifting. It achieved more success elsewhere when it was adopted by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), a consortium of about 250 broadcasters, manufacturers, <b>network</b> <b>operators,</b> software developers, and regulatory bodies from about 35 countries involved in attempting to develop new digital TV standards.|$|E
