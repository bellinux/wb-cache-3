But the technology needed to do so would entail a dangerous expansion of the government's surveillance powers. Internet users are watching how their privacy is slowly being undermined with justifications of national security and anti-terrorist purposes. This surveillance is justified or not, users must know what options are available to them to protect their privacy. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze and compare different ways to avoid the Internet traffic eavesdropping (carried out both by governments or malicious particulars). The analysis consists on a description of the different protocols and technologies involved in each option as well as the difficulties to implement them and the technical knowledge of the users in order to take profit of them.

30|$|This paper {{introduces}} a software system development addressing the technical issue {{as mentioned above}} regarding the involvements of end users in BIM based design process via the utilisation of computer game engine combined with BIM (Christiansson et al. 2011; Eastman et al. 2008). A computer game engine is used due to its intuitive controls (easy enough for <b>non-professional</b> end <b>users),</b> immersive 3 D technology and network capabilities that allow for multiple simultaneous users. BIM has been specified due to the growing trend in industry for {{the adoption of the}} design method and the 3 D nature of the models, which suit a game engine’s capabilities. The key contribution is to show a way that allows the functional involvement of <b>non-professional</b> end <b>users</b> in the professional design process. The core research is to develop a two-way data transferring channel between the end users ‘playing’ in game environment (through Web pages or thin client end) and the professional BIM design team. The other supporting developments include the extraction of the necessary information from the professional BIM model (through C# based Revit API development), game environment development, and setting up the underlying computing environment etc. The developed prototype further extends the current BIM implementation to cover <b>non-professional</b> end <b>users.</b> With further improvement and development, e.g., embedded with the appropriate governance model, it could be used to realize a more integrated life cycle based building design/construction/maintenance process to better address the end user’s requirements, and hence to improve the efficiency and productivity in the industry.|$|R

Even "end-user" programmers in previous studies have often worked in organizations where programming is recognized to be demanding professional work- the term 'vower-user" recognizes this technical kudos. But as personal computers become widespread, and most new domestic appliances incorporate microprocessors, many people are engaging in programming-like activities in domestic or <b>non-professional</b> contexts. Such <b>users</b> often have less motivation and more obstacles to programming, meaning that they may be unlikely even to take the first steps.

40|$|On 12 th November 2002 in Soesterberg in the Netherlands, the 'Behaviour and Traffic — Contact Group for Research and Policy' {{organized}} a seminar, with as theme 'Safety Culture in Traffic'. This {{was aimed at}} establishing the state of affairs about the phenomenon of a safety culture in traffic, and the chances and threats involved. Within the road safety world, this often-used English concept is frequently associated with the road haulage industry. However, {{and this was the}} goal of the seminar, the <b>non-professional</b> road <b>users</b> should also be able to profit from a safety culture. During the seminar, a number of aspects of such a culture were discussed. The whole idea of a safety culture originated in the chemical industry. Many of the principles that apply there are also applicable in the traffic system. This was the starting point of the presentation by Patrick Hudson of Leiden University. Next, Rob Aarse of the Dutch Transport Operators Association discussed {{the way in which the}} safety culture ideas had found their way to the employers and management in the transport industry. Peter Levelt of SWOV then viewed it from the point of view of the individual road user (bottom-up) and examined the role of emotions and moods. Finally, Annick Starren and Cécile Pluijmaekers of the Goods Transport sector of the Ministry of Transport approached the points of view and activities from the central government side. The common factor in each of these contributions was, building on the experiences in industry and the transport sector, to attempt to determine in which way the policy makers and the politicians could create a safety culture in their workplaces; i. e. the road users in the Netherlands. There were also four parallel sessions. In these, the ideas were then further discussed in depth under the supervision of the discussion leader.

40|$|In {{the first}} few years of the 21 st Century, access to and use of Web 2. 0 digital {{technologies}} by everyday, <b>non-professional</b> web <b>users</b> increased considerably in the UK. Today anyone of any age with access to a computer, digital tools and an internet connection can engage in social media dialogues as creators and publishers of digital content. This practice is no longer the preserve of the professional. Many academics and media commentators see this as a significant shift from the way individuals traditionally receive and ‘passively’ consume media to a position where they are more actively, responsively and inclusively engaged. In the last fifteen years much research has been concerned with the online actives of children and young people. Several web commentators have written with enthusiasm of the ‘net generation’ and ‘digital natives’. However, little research has been conducted into the digital and online engagement of adult web users. This study investigates how adults aged 18 - 28, 40 - 50 and + 65 create, publish and share content online. Content creation, in the context of this project, is defined as an arrangement of visual and/or audio material that requires some element of composition or editing. Through the use of qualitative interviews this research provides an insight into the practices of these three age ranges of adults who use digital technology and the internet to create and share their content. The study addresses how they use content sharing to communicate online and their motivations for engaging in these practices. Issues of this kind are of importance for individuals’ selfexpression and participation in an increasingly digitalised world. The research found that participants from all age groups often used both digital and analogue technologies side-by-side and this helped, rather than hindered, their ability to create and share content. Several participants, particularly the over- 65 s, revealed that digital technologies were enablers that unlocked suppressed behaviour and creative desires. Artistic self-expression, personal achievement, affiliation to others and receiving recognition and feedback were all given as motivational reasons for creating and sharing content across the age spectrum. The research findings offer an alternative to the over-simplistic and sometimes polemical perception that the so-called ‘digital generation’ are more digitally adept and literate than older internet users...|$|R
40|$|From {{the late}} 1940 s to the mid 1990 s, {{the use of}} {{magnetic}} tape recorders provoked aesthetic, social, and political debates about the decentralization of sonic production. At the very moment that postwar mass culture seemed most ascendant and critics began to identify it as a coherent object of study and scorn, reel-to-reel tape recorders allowed users to reproduce and manipulate mass-produced sounds emanating from radio and recording studios, {{as well as the}} sounds of their households, their communities, and the larger world outside their homes. Many <b>non-professional</b> tape <b>users,</b> non-commercial sonic researchers, and hobbyist audio networkers would come to believe that they could be more than passive recipients of culture industry products and the dominant ideologies that they transmitted; through an active engagement with tape, they hoped to teach listeners to become producers themselves. Listening to their works produced via tape, reading their voluminous writings, and combing their archival collections for evidence of wider connections to their practices, I argue that such tape enthusiasts developed a set of media theories through a self-reflexive recording practice I call active listening. This dissertation follows hobbyists and professional recordists ranging from New York City folklorist and advertiser Tony Schwartz, composer and educator R. Murray Schafer and his World Soundscape Project in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the Iowa City-based audio collective the Tape-beatles, who all proposed multiple forms of engagement with, against, and about mass culture. They made structural critiques of commercial culture industries for separating producers from consumers in the name of profits, perceptual arguments about the capacity for sound to activate new political imaginaries, and aesthetic moves that aimed to reintegrate presumably alienated listening subjects. Not only did the ubiquity of mass culture throughout North America give listeners a shared vocabulary, but the act of appropriating and manipulating sounds on tape fostered a self-consciousness about how mass culture worked and how it might be made to work differently. Such forms of engagement both attempted to eliminate boundaries between the production and consumption of mass culture and bolstered an ideological investment in the idea of mass culture as a passive and alienating force...|$|R

40|$|Initial user {{benefits}} from search engine technology have been critically degraded over {{time by the}} rapid increase of Internet pages. Traditional retrieval strategies therefore yield increasingly poor results due to {{a dramatic increase in}} ballast in the results. Search engine users thus increasingly experience information overload. Technical approaches to dealing with this problem have caused an initial euphoria, yet have proven ineffective in solving the problem. Enhancement of user empowerment in the area of Internet-based information retrieval must therefore be grounded in the augmentation of user capabilities. Alternative retrieval strategy approaches including a demonstration of their best areas of application are offered. Issues of information literacy and information anxiety are explored with regard to their relevancy to improving the retrieval skills of <b>non-professional</b> <b>users.</b> Users must redefine their information needs and processing habits. Pre-filtering of perceived information requirements to reduce the amounts of information actively sought and acquired, while upgrading its quality, i. e. improving the precision/recall ratio, is a learnable trait.

40|$|A {{large number}} of people in Sweden use {{chainsaws}} and injuries are unfortunately common. To decrease the number of injuries a voluntarily ’chainsaw driver license’ has been developed, and is awarded individuals who through theoretical and practical examinations have proved their skills in safe chainsaw work. To get prepared for the examinations, educations are available either as courses or as study circles. Study circles are signified by the lack of formal tutor and are therefore based on participatory learning. The study circle based education is mainly aimed for the {{large number of}} <b>non-professional</b> chainsaw <b>users.</b> The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the study circle education’s short and medium term effects on theoretical knowledge in safe chainsaw work. Moreover, it aimed for identifying demands, drivers and obstacles for chainsaw education among self-employed forest owners. The theoretical examination was redone by 31 unprepared individuals a little more than one year after they had undergone study circle education and approval for the B-level chainsaw driver license. The test results was on average one point lower (6 %) and 74 % of the individuals did still pass the approval limit. To take the chainsaw driver license through study circle education implies, hence, that the participants more than a year after the examination still remembers and consequently have the possibility to employ the theoretical knowledge that is considered necessary for safe and efficient chainsaw work. Study circle participants were generally very satisfied with the education and felt that they had reached the educational goals. Long-lasting knowledge and pleased participants indicates the appropriateness of study circles for chainsaw education. How well the education’s practical elements are managed and applied after the examination is, however, unknown for both study circles and other educational forms. Hence, further research on the topic is recommended. The opinion to chainsaw education was investigated among visitors to the forest fair SkogsNolia 2007 and among persons recommended by those who redid the theoretical examination. Drivers for educational interest were connected to both work safety and efficiency, but the willingness to pay was very low. Neither age, sex nor forest ownership affected the interest or the willingness to pay. Relatively un-experienced chainsaw users seem to be easiest to recruit for chainsaw education. However, for novices the requirement of own equipment might be repelling while most experienced individuals not are likely to consider the education useful. The education was preferred to be given intensively during nights and week-ends, which is a combination of the set-up of study circles and courses. Consequently, both educational forms seem to be needed...|$|R

Moreover, we had the advent of personal computers, the first hobby and ‘garage’ computers, leading to companies such as Atari, Apple and Microsoft. Before that, there was already ARPANET (1969) leading to Internet and the TCP/IP protocol suite in the 1970 s. Tim Berners-Lee introduction of the World Wide Web and the introduction of graphical web browsers in the early 1990 s were other milestones.

40|$|Because Urban Design is a {{territory}} of integrative synthesis, the “overall view” {{that it requires}} comes through the collaboration of various sources of knowledge, some through professional and others through <b>non-professional</b> knowledge of <b>users.</b> The representation of actors involved in design (be them other professionals, urban deciders or users) {{is a part of}} research and teaching culture for several reasons namely because social and cultural interaction in the context of Urban Design management requires several capacities. CRPOLIS, an research interdisciplinary center on urban studies in Barcelona University is linked to Urban Design teaching at master’s degree level and supports an interdisciplinary research program also at PhD level in collaboration with other centers, in Spain and Portugal (such as CESUR-IST) where some cases of real “hands on” processes are developed. The role of interdisciplinarity in collaborative knowledge is relevant in gathering and interacting in three major directions: 1. In the construction of collaborative interdisciplinary research methodologies 2. In the design process of cities in transformation 3. In the development of design practice and studio teaching methods We shall see in this paper how interdisciplinary approaches correspond to new and complex urban transformations, focusing on the importance of actors’ interaction processes, combining professional and non-professional knowledge and theory-practice relations. Therefore, we aim at a deepening in public space area of knowledgeunder the growing complexity of urban life. We see it as a base for further development of collaborative projects and their implications on community empowerment and urban governance at local level. Motivations of this line of work are persistent in several ongoing research projects, aiming to: -Understand public space as a cohesion factor both in urban life and urban form -Manage processes and strategies as elements of urban transformation, -Stimulate the understanding of actors’ roles in urban design practices. -Favoring the questioning of emerging aspects of urban space production [...] . The paper presents and analyses processes, methods and results from civic participation projects developed in the neighbourhood of Barò de Viver (Barcelona) and in the District of Marvila (Lisbon). In the first case, a long process initiated in 2004 and partially completed in 2011, neighbours developed the projects "Memory Wall" and Ciutat d'Asuncion Promenade as part of identity construction in public space, in collaboration with a team of facilitators from CrPolis group. In the second case, different participatory processes dated from 2001 and 2003 have resulted in the implementation of a specific identity urban brand and communication system with an ongoing project of "maps" construction according to the neighbours perception and representation systems. We may conclude that processes of urban governance require more active participation of citizens in projects regarding the improvement of quality of life. At the same time, the implementation of these processes requires a clear interdisciplinary approach, both with respect to the negotiation processes and the development of public space as an "urban structuring product" that we can axiomatically define by its multidimensional structure and its interaction with urban social life. In all these projects neighbors have a prominent role, which in theory and method offers a serious reflection on how to develop participatory processes on public space with actors interactionat the same level, with local governments, experts and politicians, involving non-professional knowledge in collaborative environment...|$|R
