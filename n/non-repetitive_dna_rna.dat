50|$|The {{proportion}} of <b>non-repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> is calculated {{by using the}} length of <b>non-repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> divided by genome size.

50|$|When {{talking about}} genome composition, one should {{distinguish}} between prokaryotes and eukaryotes {{as there are}} significant differences with contents structure. In prokaryotes, most of the genome (85-90%) is <b>non-repetitive</b> <b>DNA,</b> which means coding DNA mainly forms it, while non-coding regions only take a small part. On the contrary, eukaryotes have the feature of exon-intron organization of protein coding genes; the variation of repetitive DNA content in eukaryotes is also extremely high. In mammals and plants, the {{major part of the}} genome is composed of repetitive DNA.|$|R

50|$|The Qubit {{fluorometer}} uses fluorescent dyes {{to determine}} the concentration of nucleic acids and proteins in a sample. The UV-absorbance method uses a spectrophotometer to measure the natural absorbance of light at 260 nm (for <b>DNA</b> and <b>RNA)</b> or 280 nm (for proteins). The more <b>DNA,</b> <b>RNA</b> or protein in the sample, the more light is absorbed. The absorbance is a natural property of <b>DNA,</b> <b>RNA,</b> free nucleotides, proteins and some amino acids and many other compounds as well. Because so many molecules absorb light at 260 nm, this measurement is subject to inaccuracy due to potential contamination of the sample with these other molecules.

The unwinding of the <b>DNA.</b> <b>RNA</b> hybrid is a property unique to helicase II since helicase I, Rep protein, and helicase IV failed to catalyze the reaction.
