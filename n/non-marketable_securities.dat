If the government continues to run deficits in other parts of the budget, the government will have to issue debt held by the public to fund the Social Security Trust Fund, in effect exchanging one type of debt for the other. Other large intragovernmental holders include the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation's Resolution Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Medicare).|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} debt {{can also be}} classified into marketable or <b>non-marketable</b> <b>securities.</b> Most of the marketable securities are Treasury notes, bills, and bonds held by investors and governments globally. The <b>non-marketable</b> <b>securities</b> are mainly the [...] "government account series" [...] owed to certain government trust funds such as the Social Security Trust Fund, which represented $2.74 trillion in 2011.|$|E

Debt held {{by government}} accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of various government programs that have been invested in Treasury securities. Since 2016, this has comprised one-third of the US debt and originates from federal governmental spending in the form of mandatory spending programs,discretionary spending programs and unpaid interest the government owes to creditors.|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{government}} borrowed {{and spent the}} trust funds' assets, there is no [...] "lockbox" [...] or marketable investment portfolio of $2.4 trillion for Social Security or $380 billion for Medicare. The trust funds contain non-marketable [...] "IOU's" [...] that {{the government}} is legally obligated to pay. In the absence of significant budget surpluses, the government will be required to convert these <b>non-marketable</b> <b>securities</b> to marketable securities by borrowing in the future, as trust fund claims are redeemed.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} types of {{marketable}} treasury securities: Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). There are also several types of non-marketable treasury securities including State and Local Government Series (SLGS), Government Account Series debt issued to government-managed trust funds, and savings bonds. All of the marketable Treasury securities are very liquid and are heavily traded on the secondary market. The <b>non-marketable</b> <b>securities</b> (such as savings bonds) are issued to subscribers and cannot be transferred through market sales.|$|E
50|$|The {{accumulated}} surpluses are {{invested in}} special <b>non-marketable</b> Treasury <b>securities</b> (treasuries) {{issued by the}} U.S. government, which are deposited in the Social Security Trust Fund. At the end of 2009, the Trust Fund stood at $2.5 trillion. The $2.5 trillion amount owed {{by the federal government}} to the Social Security Trust Fund is also a component of the U.S. National Debt, which stood at $15.7 trillion as of May 2012. By 2019, the government is expected to have borrowed nearly $3.8 trillion against the Social Security Trust Fund.|$|R
40|$|The American {{deficit in}} the balance of {{payments}} of recent years has had its counterpart in the accumulation of US government securities in the hands of foreigners. Dollars earned by foreigners have been, to a large extent, invested in US government securities. In 1966, foreign official institutions, mainly foreign central banks, held 6. 316 billion dollars in US Treasury bills; by May of 1973 this total had risen to 35. 736 billion. Marketable US government securities (held mainly by foreign central banks) rose in the same period from 2. 329 billion to more than 7 billion dollars; <b>non-marketable</b> government <b>securities</b> (bonds and notes) increased from 695 million in 1966 to 16. 012 billion in May of 1973...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of these changes, {{particularly}} the tax increases, the Social Security system began to generate a large short-term surplus of funds, intended to cover the added retirement costs of the [...] "baby boomers." [...] Congress invested these surpluses into special series, <b>non-marketable</b> U.S. Treasury <b>securities</b> held by the Social Security Trust Fund. Under the law, the government bonds held by Social Security are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.|$|R
5000|$|The Social Security Administration {{collects}} {{payroll taxes}} {{and uses the}} money collected to pay Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits by way of trust funds. When the program runs a surplus, the excess funds increase {{the value of the}} Trust Fund. At the end of 2014, the Trust Fund contained (or alternatively, was owed) $2.79 trillion, up $25 billion from 2013. The Trust Fund is required by law to be invested in <b>non-marketable</b> <b>securities</b> issued and guaranteed by the [...] "full faith and credit" [...] of the federal government. These securities earn a market rate of interest.|$|E

40|$|Governments may be {{interested}} to develop the retail market for government debt {{for a number of}} reasons - for example, to broaden the investor base for public sector funding, to encourage the habit of saving among the population, or to stimulate the development of financial instruments and markets more generally. There are two main avenues for such retail funding. One is to sell to retail investors those marketable securities which are predominantly bought by wholesale investors. The other is to design <b>non-marketable</b> <b>securities</b> which are specifically targeted at, and possibly limited to, individuals and households. This Handbook discusses the way in which the needs of retail investors may differ from those of wholesale investors, and the particular attributes which may therefore attach to retail instruments, or to procedures for retail investment, in order to attract the small investor. The logistics of selling securities to a potentially large number of small investors are examined. Questions of taxation, marketing and regulation are also briefly reviewed. The experience of different countries, notably the United Kingdom but also some in central and eastern Europe, is drawn upon. This handbook is also available in Russian and Spanish.

50|$|Since {{recommendations}} of the Greenspan Commission were adopted in the early 1980s, Social Security payroll taxes have exceeded benefit payments. In FY2008, Social Security received $180 billion more in payroll taxes and accrued interest than it paid out in benefits. This annual surplus is credited to Social Security trust funds that hold special <b>non-marketable</b> Treasury <b>securities.</b> The Social Security surplus reduces the amount of U.S. Treasury borrowing from the public, as the surplus funds {{may be used for}} other government purposes. The total balance of the trust funds was $2.4 trillion in 2008 and is estimated to reach $3.7 trillion by 2016. At that point, payments will exceed payroll tax revenues, resulting in the gradual reduction of the trust funds balance as the securities are redeemed against other types of government revenues. By 2037, according to some estimates, the trust funds will be exhausted. Under current law, Social Security payouts would be reduced by 24% at that time, as only payroll taxes are authorized to cover benefits.|$|R
5000|$|Social Security has {{collected}} approximately $2.8 trillion more in payroll taxes and interest than {{have been paid}} out since tax collection began in 1937. This surplus {{is referred to as}} the Social Security Trust Fund. However, the government has borrowed and spent these amounts for other purposes. The fund contains <b>non-marketable</b> Treasury <b>securities</b> backed [...] "by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government". The funds borrowed from the program are part of the total national debt of $18.9 trillion as of December 2015. Due to interest, the Trust Fund will continue increasing through the end of 2020, reaching a peak of approximately $2.9 trillion. Social Security has the legal authority to draw amounts from other government revenue sources besides the payroll tax, to fully fund the program, while the Trust Fund exists. However, payouts greater than payroll tax revenue and interest income over time will liquidate the Trust Fund by 2035, meaning that only the ongoing payroll tax collections thereafter will be available to fund the program.|$|R
2500|$|Social Security is {{a social}} {{insurance}} program officially called [...] "Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance" [...] (OASDI), in reference to its three components. It is primarily funded through a dedicated payroll tax of 12.4%. During 2016, total benefits of $910 billion were paid out, versus $882 billion in 2015, an increase of $28 billion or 3%. Social Security's total expenditures have exceeded its non-interest income since 2010. The deficit of non-interest income relative to cost was about $49 billion in 2010, $45 billion in 2011, and $55 billion in 2012. During 2010, an estimated 157 million people paid into the program and 54 million received benefits, roughly 2.91 workers per beneficiary. [...] Since the Greenspan Commission in the early 1980s, Social Security has cumulatively collected far more in payroll taxes dedicated to the program than it has paid out to recipients—nearly $2.6 trillion in 2010. This annual surplus is credited to Social Security trust funds that hold special <b>non-marketable</b> Treasury <b>securities.</b> This surplus amount is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Social Security Trust Fund". The proceeds are paid into the U.S. Treasury where they may be used for other government purposes. Social Security spending will increase sharply over the next decades, largely due to the retirement of the baby boom generation. The number of program recipients is expected to increase from 44 million in 2010 to 73 million in 2030. Program spending is projected to rise from 4.8% of GDP in 2010 to 5.9% of GDP by 2030, where it will stabilize. The Social Security Administration projects that an increase in payroll taxes equivalent to 1.8% of the payroll tax base or 0.6% of GDP would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years. Over an infinite time horizon, these shortfalls average 3.3% of the payroll tax base and 1.2% of GDP. Various reforms have been debated for Social Security. Examples include reducing future annual cost of living adjustments (COLA) provided to recipients, raising the retirement age, and raising the income limit subject to the payroll tax ($118,500 in 2014). Because of the mandatory nature of the program and large accumulated surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund, the Social Security system has the legal authority to compel the government to borrow to pay all promised benefits through 2036, when the Trust Fund is expected to be exhausted. Thereafter, the program under current law will pay approximately 75–78% of promised benefits {{for the remainder of the}} century.|$|R
