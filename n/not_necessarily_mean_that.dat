40|$|In {{an attempt}} to stop the rampant suburbanization, which {{countries}} experienced after World War II, a 'new town' policy was enrolled. As a major objective, and related to its origins, new towns were effective in attracting low and medium income households. Nowadays, cities and municipalities experience an increased accountability in which incentives are provided by 'naming and shaming'. This paper focuses on an issue where both historical and local policy come together: early school leaving. Using an iterative matching analysis, it suggests how to account for differences in population and regional characteristics. In other words, how to compare and interpret early school leaving in new towns in a more `fair' way. The results point out that (statistically) mitigating historical differences is necessary, even though this does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> 'naming' is replaced by 'shaming'.

5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily {{administered the}} lands of Robert d'Oilly, who had previously held Oxford Castle but had defected {{to the side of}} the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of the lands as Stephen giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, but the only evidence for this is that Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of {{the lands of}} William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him.|$|E
5|$|Eorpwald was {{the first}} English king to be killed because of his Christian faith. The {{circumstances}} are not recorded, {{so that it is}} not known whether Ricberht was representative of an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, or if he was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> there was an overt struggle between the worship of the Anglo-Saxon gods and the worship of Christ, but could express a reaction away from Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.|$|E
5|$|Khitan {{marriage}} practices {{differed from}} those of the Han Chinese in several ways. Men from the elite classes tended to marry women from the generation their senior. While this did <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> there would be a large gap in ages between husband and wife, it was often the case. Among the ruling Yelü clan, the average age that boys married was sixteen, while the average age that girls married was between sixteen and twenty-two. Although rare, ages as young as twelve were recorded, for both boys and girls. A special variety of polygamy known as sororate, in which a man would marry two or more women who were sisters, was practiced among the Liao elite. Polygamy was not restricted only to sororate, with some men having three or more wives, only some of whom were sisters. Sororate continued throughout the length of the Liao dynasty, despite laws banning the practice. Over the course of the dynasty, the Liao elite moved away from polygamy and towards the Han Chinese system of having one wife and one or more concubines. This was done largely to smooth over the process of inheritance.|$|E

As can be seen from Table 2, the CDAF technique could detect four of the classes with 100 % accuracy and only has weakness in detection of calcite class (73.33 %). However, it is possible that the field work done by the other people on the class of calcite was not accurate enough and had some misinterpretations involved. For example, it is possible in some region, the siderite abundance was more than calcite but the people collected the samples gave the calcite class. On the other hand, the accuracy of 100 % does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> there are no other material present in the pixel but it could be concluded that the combination of abundance and absorption features of on material has influenced the pixel reflectance to render the shape to look like a particular class.|$|R

5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E

50|$|Another type of {{phenomenon}} {{that is important}} to analyze in this context is the existence of outliers that represent high values of the variable in a given location surrounded by low values in the neighboring locations.

Note however, that the fact that a value is high in comparison with the values in neighboring locations does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> it is an outlier as we need to assess the statistical significance of that relationship. In other words, we may find areas where there seems to be clustering or where there may seem to be clusters but when the statistical procedures are conducted they turn to be non statistically significant clusters or outliers. The procedures employed to assess statistical significance consists on a Monte Carlo simulation of different arrangements of the data and the construction of an empirical distribution of simulated statistics.

40|$|AbstractThe {{hospitality}} {{market has}} {{as a main}} goal to show {{a place that is}} perfect and beautiful. In order to serve the needs of guests, hotels depend on professionals that have much, few, or almost no contact with the guests. For these professionals, things such as good appearance, good diction, perfect hair and nails are required {{in order to meet the}} hotel market standards. Based on this, this work sought to figure out how these organizations react to the insertion of disabled professional in the working place, through the analysis of the Human Resource practices of three hotels Belém, Pará, northern Brazil. This research follows a qualitative approach. Data collection was made through interviews and non-participant observations. Data analysis was made through Content Analysis. The results identified the Human Resource practices set on the insertion of people with disabilities, compared them, and found that only one hotel works with all HR practices studied. In all studied hotels, it was noticed that during the selection the main focus was on the type and severity of the disability, excluding the most severe ones. The absolute criteria is the search for a lighter disability and not the search for the specific skills needed to fulfill a position. This led to the belief that the mere insertion of people living with disabilities in a company does <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> they are really being included, this information should serve as a reflection for companies and future studies on the topic...|$|R
