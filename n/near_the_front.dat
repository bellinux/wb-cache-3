5|$|Frank Woodruff Buckles (born Wood Buckles, February 1, 1901February 27, 2011) was a United States Army {{corporal}} and {{the last}} surviving American military veteran of World War I. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1917 {{at the age of}} 16 and served with a detachment from Fort Riley, driving ambulances and motorcycles <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Quantula striata is {{the only}} known bioluminescent {{terrestrial}} mollusc. Pulses of light are emitted from a gland <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the foot and may have a communicative function, although the adaptive significance is not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|Group 18 Structure 2 is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Its {{earliest}} phase dates to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west. A later construction phase was built over this. It consisted of a rectangular platform that supported a bench. A small pyrite disc was found <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wall. Obsidian prismatic blades were found on top of the platform, together with pieces of a thin earthenware bowl. Burial 69 was found in front of the base of the platform.|$|E

60|$|On {{their arrival}} at the Flemish city--twelve miles <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> than Calais--they found an entirely {{different}} atmosphere. No excitement, no terror was visible anywhere. The people quietly pursued their accustomed avocations and the city was as orderly as in normal times.|$|R
5|$|In contrast, investigative work in 1999 by a British {{team led}} by {{virologist}} John Oxford of St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital identified the major troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples, France, as being {{the center of the}} 1918 flu pandemic. These researchers postulated that a significant precursor virus, harbored in birds, mutated so it could migrate to pigs that were kept <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Carnian {{stage of}} the Late Triassic (228.0 - 216.5 Mya), capitosauroids were joined by the superficially very similar Metoposauridae. Metoposaurids are {{distinguished}} from capitosauroids by the positioning of their eye sockets <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of their skulls. Another group of stereospondyls, the plagiosaurs, had wide heads with external gills, and adapted to life {{at the bottom of}} lakes and rivers. By this time, temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems. Some temnospondyls, such as Cryobatrachus and Kryostega, even inhabited Antarctica, which was covered in temperate forests at the time.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of {{the upper part of}} the mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E

5|$|The M249 is gas {{operated}} and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding bipod is attached <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the gun, though an M192 LGM tripod is available. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like {{those used in}} the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use a rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition {{in the event that}} he runs out of linked rounds.|$|E
5|$|The port of Antwerp was an {{important}} strategic objective because Allied supply lines were heavily stretched and needed a deep-sea port <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines. The British Second Army liberated Antwerp on September 6, {{with help from the}} local resistance. Despite taking control of the city, the port was not accessible until the surrounding waters were safe for cargo ships. The Germans successfully denied access to the port until the Battle of the Scheldt completed in November.|$|E
5|$|Baird and Jackie {{were asked}} to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964. Cynthia Lennon—Lennon's wife at the time—took them both out {{shopping}} in Knightsbridge, buying them expensive clothes. During the same visit, The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria, and the sisters asked {{to be allowed to}} stand <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of the crush. In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane. Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards. Dykins had married again, but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife, and did not attend their father's funeral.|$|E

5|$|Both {{species of}} Knoetschkesuchus {{have only two}} {{distinct}} types of teeth, uniquely among atoposaurids. Other atoposaurids have a third type of leaf-shaped teeth. The first type of teeth, found <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the jaw, are conical, slightly constricted at the base, and curved slightly inwards. A subtype {{is represented by the}} canine-like or pseudocaniniform teeth. They are the fourth and fifth maxillary teeth, and are enlarged (about twice the size of the other maxillary teeth), more pointed, and more constricted at the base. The second type of teeth, which constitutes the rest of the teeth, are shaped like thin lanceheads, with a wide base and a narrower tip; in K. guimarotae all of the tips are sharp, but in K. langenbergensis they gradually become blunter.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara {{began the}} 2013 {{campaign}} with the Tour of Qatar and the Tour of Oman, {{but failed to}} collect any victories. After finishing the aforementioned tours, he raced the Strade Bianche and finished in fourth place. Next, Cancellara raced the Tirreno–Adriatico. He came close to a stage victory in the race's stage seven individual time trial, but missed the win by twelve seconds. Just five days later, Cancellara lined up at the Milan–San Remo, where he was considered by many as a favorite to win the race. The race was marred by poor weather conditions, but Cancellara remained <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and managed to place third overall after losing out in the sprint for the finish line.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Curie {{recognised}} that {{wounded soldiers}} were best served if operated upon {{as soon as}} possible. She saw a need for field radiological centres <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines to assist battlefield surgeons. After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies ("Little Curies"). She became {{the director of the}} Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military doctor and by her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals {{in the first year of}} the war. Later, she began training other women as aides.|$|E

5|$|The {{team had}} a solid showing at the {{traditional}} opener to the French cycling season, the Grand Prix d'Ouverture La Marseillaise. While 's Jérémy Roy easily won the race with a solo breakaway, Gautier rode to sixth place by finishing <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the peloton {{two and a half}} minutes behind. At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, one of the early-season Belgian races, Chavanel also turned in a sixth place, in a large field sprint. That same day, Gautier secured a podium finish at Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche, coming third in a selective 12-rider sprint {{at the front of the}} race. Chavanel rode to eighth place at Le Samyn, coming across the line 11 seconds back of the winner Dominic Klemme in a race decided by a late breakaway.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara {{entered the}} Vuelta a España and helped assist RadioShack-Leopard to a second-place {{finish in the}} race's opening team time trial. He won the stage eleven {{individual}} time trial {{by a margin of}} 37 seconds over reigning world champion Tony Martin. Cancellara then rode in support of team leader and eventual Vuelta winner Chris Horner until the seventeenth stage, after which he left the race in order to focus on the World Championships. Cancellara was seen as a contender for the gold medal in both the men's time trial and road race events at the UCI Road World Championships. Cancellara finished the time trial in third position, 48 seconds behind the winner Tony Martin, earning a bronze medal. Four days after completing the time trial event, Cancellara entered the Elite Men's road race. For most of the race, Cancellara stayed <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of race, before being dropped however on the final climb of the day and fighting his way to tenth place. In late December, RadioShack-Leopard's general manager Luca Guercilena announced that Fabian Cancellara would attempt to break the hour record during the 2014 season.|$|E
5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E

It comprised approximately 200 {{tents and}} was situated near Lake Ostrovo, Macedonia during the First World War {{under the command of}} the Serbian Army.It was often called The America Unit as the money to fund it came from America and except for a few dressing stations, it was <b>the</b> Allied hospital <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short, the interorbital region (between the eyes) {{is broad}} and hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is small. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front {{part of the}} zygomatic arch, is narrow, with poorly developed zygomatic notches at their front, but there is considerable variation in {{the features of the}} plate. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) extend back to between the first molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, the openings behind the bony palate, is very narrow. In the mandible (lower jaw), the masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, extend to <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> margin of the first molar. The capsular process, a raising in the back part of the mandibular bone that accommodates the root of the incisor, is poorly developed. The upper incisors are orthodont (with the chewing edge in the horizontal plane) to slightly opisthodont (with the chewing edge inclined backwards). The molars show some accessory crests and other features, such as the anteroloph on the first upper molar and the mesoloph on the first and second upper molar.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, 1973, an air battle {{took place}} between Syrian and Israeli fighters. It was an {{alarming}} skirmish in which twelve Syrian aircraft were shot down while the Israelis lost only one fighter. Tension ran high between both countries. The Egyptians in particular were very concerned; on April 7, 1967, an air battle between Syria and Israel had escalated the military situation {{and was one of}} the causes of the Six Day War. Aware that war was to be launched only days later, the Syrians chose not to retaliate. The air battle aided the Syrians in concentrating their forces for the war, as the Israelis interpreted it to be a defensive reaction on the part of the Syrians. The Israelis closely monitored this buildup <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> but their intelligence remained adamant that Syria would not go to war without Egypt, which the Israelis believed was currently occupied with internal issues.|$|E
5|$|Orthrozanclus reburrus ("Dawn scythe with bristling hair") was {{discovered}} in 2006 and formally described in 2007. This animal had a soft, unarmored underside, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small shell, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> end; three zones of armor plates, which fitted close to the body and one of which ran all the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines {{on each side of}} the body. The arrangement of Orthrozanclus′ armor plates is very similar to that of its Burgess Shale contemporary Wiwaxia. Its shell is very similar to one of the two Burgess Shale shell types labelled Oikozetetes; the forward shell of halkieriids, most fossils of which are dated to the Early Cambrian; and those of other Early Cambrian fossils such as Ocruranus and Eohalobia. These similarities suggest that Orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between Wiwaxia and the Halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a clade, in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. So Orthrozanclus was also drawn into the complex debate about whether Wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNew crack {{elements}} are proposed for fracture mechanics analysis of two- and three-dimensional elastostatics by the boundary element method (BEM). In the proposed crack elements, arbitrary singularities {{of the stress}} or <b>the</b> traction <b>near</b> <b>the</b> crack <b>front</b> can be taken into account, and the behavior of displacements <b>near</b> <b>the</b> crack <b>front</b> can be simulated in a reasonable manner. Three different kinds of interpolation functions are used for modeling the boundary element geometry and the traction and displacement variations <b>near</b> <b>the</b> crack <b>front,</b> so <b>the</b> nodal points of the crack element are located at their regular positions. An attempt is made to apply the proposed crack elements to the stress-intensity-factor computation of some typical surface-crack problems. Some interesting features inherent to the surface-crack problem are revealed through comparison of the results obtained with other solutions available in the literature...|$|R
