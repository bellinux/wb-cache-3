5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The <b>northern</b> <b>fulmar</b> vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
5|$|Some seabird {{species have}} benefited from fisheries, {{particularly}} from discarded fish and offal. These discards compose 30% of the food of seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some seabird populations. This can have other impacts; for example, {{the spread of the}} <b>northern</b> <b>fulmar</b> through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards. Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins.|$|E

5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the <b>northern</b> <b>fulmar</b> in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids {{are present}} in all the world's oceans {{and most of the}} seas. They are absent from the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, but are present year round or {{seasonally}} in the rest. The seas north of New Zealand are the centre of procellariid biodiversity, with the most species. Among the four groups, the fulmarine petrels have a mostly polar distribution, with most species living around Antarctica and one, the <b>northern</b> <b>fulmar</b> ranging in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The prions are restricted to the Southern Ocean, and the gadfly petrels are found mostly in the tropics with some temperate species. The shearwaters are the most widespread group and breed in most temperate and tropical seas, although by a biogeographical quirk are absent as breeders from the North Pacific.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda is a {{breeding}} ground for many important seabird species. One of the world's largest colonies of northern gannets, totalling 30,000 pairs, amount to 24 percent of the global population. There are 49,000 breeding pairs of Leach's petrels, up to 90 percent of the European population; 136,000 pairs of Atlantic puffins, about 30 percent of the UK total breeding population, and 67,000 <b>northern</b> <b>fulmar</b> pairs, about 13 percent of the UK total. Dùn is home to the largest colony of fulmars in Britain. Prior to 1828, St Kilda was their only UK breeding ground, but they have since spread and established colonies elsewhere, such as Fowlsheugh. The last great auk (Pinguinus impennis) seen in Britain was killed on Stac an Armin in July 1840. Unusual behaviour by St Kilda's bonxies was recorded in 2007 during research into recent falls in the Leach's petrel population. Using night vision gear, ecologists observed the skuas hunting petrels at night, a remarkable strategy for a seabird.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids {{have been}} a {{seasonally}} abundant source of food for people wherever people {{have been a}}ble to reach their colonies. Early records of human exploitation of shearwaters (along with albatrosses and cormorants) come from the remains of hunter-gatherer middens in southern Chile, where sooty shearwaters were taken 5000 years ago. More recently procellariids have been hunted for food by Europeans, particularly the <b>northern</b> <b>fulmar</b> in Europe, and various species by Inuit, and sailors around the world. The hunting pressure on the Bermuda petrel, or cahow, was so intense that the species nearly became extinct and did go missing for 300 years. The name of one species, the providence petrel, is derived from its (seemingly) miraculous arrival on Norfolk Island, where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers; within ten years the providence petrel was extinct on Norfolk. Several species of procellariid have gone extinct in the Pacific since the arrival of man, and their remains have been found in middens dated to that time. More sustainable shearwater harvesting industries developed in Tasmania and New Zealand, where the practice of harvesting what are known as muttonbirds continues today.|$|E
5|$|After {{hatching}} {{the chick}} is brooded by a parent {{until it is}} large enough to thermoregulate efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting fulmars (around 16–20 days) and giant petrels (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the chick. In many species the parent's foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days. The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive pelagic feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for birds, with fledging taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents; although, they will slim down before they leave the nest. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; although, the oldest recorded member was a <b>northern</b> <b>fulmar</b> that was over 50 years.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{sources of}} {{mortality}} are largely reported in anecdotes. On rare occasions, golden eagles {{have been killed}} by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores, including the aforementioned wolverine, snow leopard, cougar, brown bear and white-tailed eagle attacks. Most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other golden eagles. Nestlings and fledglings {{are more likely to be}} killed by another predator than free-flying juveniles and adults. It has been suspected that golden eagle nests may be predated more frequently by other predators (especially birds, which are often the only other large animals that can access a golden eagle nest without the assistance of man-made climbing equipment) in areas where golden eagles are regularly disturbed at the nest by humans. Jeff Watson believed that common raven occasionally eats golden eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt. However, there are no confirmed accounts of predation by other bird species on golden eagle nests. Occasionally, golden eagles may be killed by their prey in self-defense. There is an account of a golden eagle dying from the quills of a North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) it had attempted to hunt. On the Isle of Rùm in Scotland, there are few cases of red deer trampling golden eagles to death, probably the result of a hind having intercepted a bird that was trying to kill a fawn. Although usually well out-matched by the predator, occasionally other large birds can put up a formidable fight against a golden eagle. An attempted capture of a great blue heron by a golden eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight. There is at least one case in Scotland of a golden eagle dying after being “oiled” by a <b>northern</b> <b>fulmar,</b> a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibit the predator's ability to fly. Of natural sources of death, starvation is probably under-reported. 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in Denali National Park had died of starvation. Of 36 deaths of golden eagles in Idaho, 55% were possibly attributable to natural causes, specifically 8 (26%) from unknown trauma, 3 (10%) from disease and 6 (19%) from unknown causes. Of 266 golden eagle deaths in Spain, only 6% were from unknown causes that could not directly attributed to human activities. Avian cholera caused by bacteria (Pasteurella multocida) infects eagles that eat waterfowl that have died from the disease. The protozoan Trichomonas sp. caused the deaths of 4 fledglings in a study of wild golden eagles in Idaho. Several further diseases that contribute to golden eagle deaths have been examined in Japan. A captive eagle died from two malignant tumors – one in the liver and one in the kidney.|$|E
500|$|They {{were once}} {{commonly}} known as goonie birds or gooney birds, particularly those of the North Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the name mollymawk is still well established in some areas, which is a corrupted form of malle-mugge, an old Dutch name for the <b>northern</b> <b>fulmar.</b> The name Diomedea, assigned to the albatrosses by Linnaeus, references the mythical metamorphosis of the companions of the Greek warrior Diomedes into birds. Finally, the name for the order, Procellariiformes, comes from the Latin word procella meaning [...] "a violent wind" [...] or [...] "a storm".|$|E
500|$|About thirty {{species of}} bird are found on Svalbard, {{most of which}} are migratory.

Particularly Bjørnøya, Storfjorden, Nordvest-Spitsbergen and Hopen are important breeding ground for seabirds. The Arctic tern has the furthest migration, all the way to Antarctica. Only two songbirds migrate to Svalbard to breed: the snow bunting and the wheatear. Rock ptarmigan is the only bird to overwinter.

2500|$|Although quantitatively {{outnumbered by}} mammals, birds {{are the most}} diverse class of prey in the golden eagle's diet, as more than 200 species have been {{identified}} at eagle nests. Little analysis has gone into how regularly golden eagles will attack the nestling and fledglings of other birds, {{although it has been}} interpreted that this behavior is not uncommon, although adults {{are more likely to be}} golden eagle prey than immatures. Nestling-aged rock pigeons (Columba livia) have been observed as prey in golden eagle nests. The first record of a golden eagle eating eggs was recorded when a golden eagle was observed consuming Canada goose (Branta canadensis) eggs in eastern Idaho. After galliforms, the next most significant group of prey among birds is the corvid family, making up 4.1% of the diet from around the range. Most prevalent among these are magpies and the large-bodied Corvus (crow and raven) genus. On Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in California, common raven became the most common prey species after feral pigs were eradicated from the latter, making up 24% of a 454 sample size from 14 nests. The raven was also the most prevalent bird prey in central Arizona, in a sampling of 1154 from 119 nests. The black-billed magpie (Pica hudsonia) was an important prey item in Washington state, making up 9.7% of the remains there, and was the most significant avian prey in Montana. In 10 studies in Europe, corvids made up more than 5% of the prey remains, usually represented by carrion crows/hooded crows (Corvus corone/cornix), rooks (Corvus frugilegus), Alpine chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus), ravens or Eurasian magpies (Pica pica). Smaller species such as jays and nutcrackers only occasionally turn up as prey, mainly in North America, though the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) has also been known as prey. The next best represented family of birds are the waterfowl, making up approximately 1.4% of the golden eagle's breeding season diet. Waterfowl of all sizes from green-winged teal (Anas crecca) to trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator), tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and mute swans (Cygnus olor) have been successfully hunted by golden eagles. Full-grown swans can weigh well over [...] and are probably the largest birds habitually hunted by golden eagles. Moderately sized species, including larger Anas ducks such as mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese such as bean goose (Anser fabalis) are perhaps most often recorded. Waterfowl are mostly recorded during the nesting season in Northern Europe, comprising 15.4% of prey in Gotland and 14.4% of prey in Belarus. In some years at Malheur-Harney Lakes Basin in Oregon, Anas ducks can make up to 20% of the prey consumed by the locally nesting eagles. Mostly in the United States, wintering golden eagles may become habitually predators of wintering and migrating groups of waterfowl, with species such as Canada geese, cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii), snow geese (Chen caerulescens), and Ross's geese (Chen rossii). Since geese are found in large concentration when seasonal conditions require it, these species can be hunted with relative ease. Waterfowl are typically hunted using the “contour flight with short glide attack” technique, in order to surprise the prey before it can take flight or dive. In one case, a golden eagle was able to capture a mallard as it took off in flight. Other water birds are generally less frequent prey but may become regular in the diet in marsh-like northern regions and coastal areas. Scotland, being surrounded by coasts and possessing quite a wet climate, often hosts water birds which become prey such as colonies of petrels (largely <b>northern</b> <b>fulmar</b> (Fulmarus glacialis)), making up to 17% of the recorded prey in 26 nests with a 119 sample size in the Outer Hebrides, migrating throngs of sandpipers and plovers (up to 5.9% and 2.8% in 25 nest in the northern Inner Hebrides) and gulls (making up a whopping 23% of prey recorded in 25 nests in the West-Central Highlands). Among shorebirds, usually only larger types such as godwits, curlews, Tringa sp., stone-curlews and oystercatchers turn up as prey, although smaller species are probably also taken as prey since they are agile enough to catch them. Eurasian cranes (Grus grus) are regularly predated in Northern Europe, turning up at 6.8% of nests in Estonia and 5.8% of nests in southern Finland. Hooded cranes (Grus monacha) are reportedly prey for golden eagles in China. Demoiselle cranes (Anthropoides virgo) have been caught in mid-air as they migrate over the Himalayas and both sandhill (Grus canadensis) and whooping cranes (Grus americana) may be hunted in North America. The last known breeding pair of golden eagles in Maine (which did not return after 1999) were reported to hunt an unusually large number of herons, specifically great blue herons (Ardea herodias) and American bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosus). Elsewhere, herons are basically negligible in the diet. Other water birds recorded as prey include cormorants (up to 8.6% of the recorded prey in Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands), auks, grebes and loons.|$|E
