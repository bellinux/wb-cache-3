5000|$|For a time, {{it was not}} {{uncommon}} to find paralegal corporals assigned to the legal assistance branch of a post's staff judge advocate's office, despite often having little or no actual leadership duties. Army Regulation 27-55 <b>Notarial</b> <b>Services</b> conferred (under provisions of 10 U.S.C. §§ 936, 1044a) authority to act as a notary and consul of the United States upon JAG Corps NCOs. Notarisation of powers of attorney and other documents is a [...] "bread-and-butter" [...] task in such offices, which necessitated the presence of either NCOs or state notaries. AR 27-55 was later amended to confer the authority on such paralegal specialists who are so designated by their respective staff judge advocate.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exceptions}} of Louisiana, Puerto Rico, Quebec, whose private law {{is based on}} civil law, and British Columbia, whose notarial tradition stems from scrivener notary practice, a notary public {{in the rest of}} the United States and most of Canada has powers that are far more limited than those of civil-law or other common-law notaries, both of whom are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar: such notaries may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries. Therefore, at common law, <b>notarial</b> <b>service</b> is distinctly different from the practice of law, and giving legal advice and preparing legal instruments is forbidden to lay notaries such as those appointed throughout most of the United States of America.|$|R

Uvidom u objavljenu i većim dijelom neobjavljenu arhivsku građu, koja se čuva u Državnome arhivu u Zadru, u radu se otkrivaju nepoznati podaci iz Perencanova javnog djelovanja i osobnoga života na temelju kojih se upotpunjuje i dijelom revidira njegov životopis. Petar aka Perencan, son of {{the late}} Azon de Lemicetis from Padua, was active as a notary in Zadar {{during the second half}} of the 14 th century. So far, he has not been in the focus of {{specific}} research and his biography consisted of only a few pieces of data. These basic facts were based on Perencan’s preserved corpus related to his activity as a public (1365 – 1392), curial (1366 and 1367), and chapter notary (1380 – 1392), as well as the end of his communal service in the period between 1374 and 1376, under unclarified circumstances. Based on unpublished archival sources preserved at the State Archive in Zadar, the author has discovered various data to be added to Perencan’s biography, namely concerning the end of his service (which has been corrected), some previously unknown documents that have now been included in his <b>notarial</b> corpus, the <b>service</b> of the vice-count’s vicar on the island of Cres, and the procurators of the Cress communities, as well as his cooperation with other notaries, his ownership of a property, his legal status as a habitator – defined by means of analogy to the recorded statuses of his colleagues – his various addresses, his son Azon, and the time of his death. For some of these data, it is difficult to say something in great detail, especially concerning the nature of Perencan’s ownership over houses at four different addresses where he used to live, or the circumstances that brought him to occupy the post of the vicecount’s vicar on the island of Cres. The reason for the scarcity of data, as well as the fact that they are occasionally unrelated to the context of political, legal, social, or economic historical reality, must be sought in the fact that a relatively small amount of notary registers and other types of administrative documents has been preserved when compared to the number of notaries active during the almost thirty years of Perencan’s activity...|$|R
50|$|In time, all {{notarial}} functions (clerical and law officer) were concentrated {{into the}} law-trained nomikos, though the Church would provide <b>notarial</b> <b>services</b> {{in town and}} rural settings. The Church also retained the old separation between symbolaiographos, or notary-draftsman, notarios, or notary-scribe, and the clerical nomikos, or notary lawyer. By the 10th century, secular nomikoi had been organized into a regulatory guild, were attached to the State, appointed by the Emperor, and ranked among the highest of legal officers. The introductory portions of their acts also tended to invoke God, and crosses and Christian insignia were often applied to {{the face of an}} act.

Allerhand were attended also by lawyers Jerzy Sawicki i Stefan Rozmaryn-Kwieciński. In 1932-1933, he announced a two-part commentary on the Code of Civil Procedure; and in 1935, Commentary to the Commercial Code. In 1937 he wrote a review of insolvency law.|$|E

40|$|The notary {{profession}} in Europe is special in its semi-public nature. European notaries perform public tasks while maximising profits. We assess {{the competitiveness of}} this market in the Netherlands and Belgium, applying {{a variation of the}} Bresnahan-Reiss method. We evaluate the impact of a price liberalisation policy in The Netherlands in the late 1990 s by measuring competition before and after liberalisation and by comparing it with the Belgian developments. We find that entry affects conduct. Yet, we find no significant increase in competition since the enforcement of price liberalisation. This is {{explained by the fact that}} although price and establishment were liberalized, the total number of notaries remained fixed until 2003. We also examine the question whether competition affects the quality of the product. We use both subjective and objective measure for the quality of <b>notarial</b> <b>services.</b> Our preliminary and somewhat puzzling finding is that service is negatively affected by competition...|$|E

The result of the research shows that the relationship between a Notary and a Bank is based on contractual relation, a contract which is signed underhandedly which is called “Cooperative Agreement on Notarial Service”.

40|$|The legal {{performance}} of a notary is authorized based on legislative rules. One of a notary’s authorities is to certify proper execution or signing of any sort of authentic documents. Whatcan {{be found in the}} authentic documents, not merely an agreement among parties, but also territorial meanings of philosophical values, that are binding in Indonesian law. Thediscussion of the paperwork is to be started through analyzing the philosophy of regulations in Indonesia in general. The substance of law philosophy in Indonesia will be practiced as aframework of axiological aspect, such as how to act upon legal {{performance of}} a profession as a notary. The next discussion on the writer’s paperwork is to identify what service a notary should present along with their functions and authorities. Lastly, the paperwork contains axiological aspects in the relation of identifying necessary values and characteristics of Indonesian law philosophy in authorizing documents that are to be madeby a legal notary. Through this paperwork, the writer is dealing with a certain methodological research, an analytical descriptive method, in which systematically and factually, the writer is depictingand analyzing the substance of law philosophy based on the ideology of Pancasila-based philosophy of law in accordance to notaries and deeds matters. The writer is employingnormative-juridicial research method, that is an approach towards a method using secondary data or literature research as a core of the writer’s paperwork. The results of the writer’s discussion reveals that the legal {{performance of a}} notary in certifying proper execution or signing of any sort of authentic documents involves, not merelyend-up achievements and agreements among parties executed, but also notifying and paying attention towards axiological aspects in Indonesian philosophy of law, that is Pancasilabased philosophy of law. The legal ideas of Pancasila-based philosophy of law should be characterized as guidance principles and touchstones in the authorities of a notary profession and signing legal documents as a notary’s product. The ignorance towards axiological aspects in Pancasila-based philosophy of law may be considered a disavowal of a notary’s office oath and a violation of an ought-to be-like <b>notarial</b> <b>services</b> one should carryout. On the contrary, the respect towards axiological aspects in Pancasila-based philosophy of law is expected to be cultivated as a custom of law which should always be performed innotaries authorization...|$|E

U drugom se dijelu opisuje uporaba gradiva nastala u privatne svrhe zbog potreba svakidašnjega života građana komune. Using {{exemplary}} {{provisions of}} the statutes originated from few amongst Dalmatian cities (Split, Zadar, Trogir, Šibenik, Skradin, Brač, Hvar, Korčula and Lastovo) {{in the first part}} of this article author presents a way of use and preservation of public archives generated by communal authorities – duke, chamber or community council – i. e. of archives created for the official purposes in those communities. By a number of measures communities were making efforts to protect archives important as evidence of their communal rights. Regarding place for the custody of archives at the beginning it was regularly a coffer or a special book-case, which, by time, developed into separated room, and sometimes even into separated building. Step by step a system of few keys was developed as a system where few different communal officials were in charge of the access to the archives. In the cases where separated rooms existed for the custody of archives the access to those rooms was in principle permitted only with license of communal authorities, mostly that of duke, as an exponent of executive power. Since the communities intended to concentrate archives at one place, special care was taken to insure that communal officials were delivering all the archives back to the community at the end of their mandates or later if they retained them longer. Beginning with 15 th century provisions on obligatory inventorying of the archives are more often. A second type of archives and their use, that of private archives created for the personal needs of communal inhabitants, is described in the second part of the article. Differently from the public archives, which use was charge-free, it was obligatory to pay <b>notarial</b> <b>services</b> when it came to private documents, and costs of putting them together were precisely defined. Regarding their custody or improvement of putting them together, treatment of both types of archives was very similar. Statutes of developed communities, like Split and Zadar, and to a lesser degree, those of Trogir and Šibenik, are rich in details describing use of archives of both types. Every citizen was permitted to use only those archives by which his rights were protected. In some minor communities in which notarial office wasn 2 ̆ 7 t clearly separated from that of chancellery, for example in Lastovo, rigorous protection measures were previewed for use of private archives, and bigger discretionary authority was given to the duke, as an exponent of executive power. The authority of duke increased from 16 th century on, with consolidation of Venetian power in Dalmatian communities, same as that of Dubrovnik in Lastovo, and provisions which regulated and restricted use of archives for private purposes were more and more precise...|$|E
