500|$|Bohr did {{not remain}} at Los Alamos, but paid {{a series of}} {{extended}} visits {{over the course of}} the next two years. Robert Oppenheimer credited Bohr with acting [...] "as a scientific father figure to the younger men", most notably Richard Feynman. Bohr is quoted as saying, [...] "They didn't <b>need</b> <b>my</b> help in making the atom bomb." [...] Oppenheimer gave Bohr credit for an important contribution to the work on modulated neutron initiators. [...] "This device remained a stubborn puzzle," [...] Oppenheimer noted, [...] "but in early February 1945 Niels Bohr clarified what had to be done." ...|$|E

5000|$|Juste {{performed}} No One <b>Needs</b> <b>My</b> Love Today, {{written by}} Phil Phillips, on Top of the Pops on 24 November 1966. This record {{was produced by}} Miki Dallon, the backing music provided by an orchestra conducted by Ken Woodman, {{who had worked with}} Chris Andrews and Sandie Shaw and is best known for Town Talk, which became the theme tune of The Jimmy Young Show when BBC Radio 1 opened in 1967. No One <b>Needs</b> <b>My</b> Love Today was not a hit, but it was featured as a climber by the offshore [...] "pirate" [...] station Radio London in the week beginning 20 November. One critic commented that [...] "any vocal shortcomings on this single are outweighed by her charming delivery". Both No One <b>Needs</b> <b>My</b> Love Today and its [...] "B" [...] side, Pierre Tubbs' If Trees Could Talk, were available on compilation discs and to download 40 years later.|$|R
500|$|In 1912, the Guild of Poets {{published}} {{her book}} of verse Evening (Vecher) – {{the first of}} five in nine years. The small edition of 500 copies quickly sold out and she received around a dozen positive notices in the literary press. She exercised a strong selectivity for the pieces – including only 35 of the 200 poems she had written {{by the end of}} 1911. (She noted that Song of the Last Meeting, dated 29 September 1911, was her 200th poem). The book secured her reputation as a new and striking young writer, the poems Grey-eyed king, In the Forest, Over the Water and I don’t <b>need</b> <b>my</b> legs anymore making her famous. She later wrote [...] "These naïve poems by a frivolous girl for some reason were reprinted thirteen times [...] And they came out in several translations. The girl herself (as far as I recall) did not foresee such a fate for them and used to hide the issues of the journals in which they were first published under the sofa cushions".|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Down Beat magazine found Waters's singing [...] "forced and artificial", writing that Folk Singer {{suffers from a}} major flaw: [...] "He only begins to {{come close to the}} power and unforced intensity of the original numbers and style from time to time, as on 'You Gonna <b>Need</b> <b>My</b> Help' and 'My Home Is in the Delta'". In a retrospective review, Cub Koda, writing for AllMusic was more enthusiastic, deeming the record's sound fresh and vital. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Folk Singer number 280 on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of AllTime", writing that the [...] "unplugged" [...] playing was pioneering and has since been [...] "beloved by blues and folk fans alike". In a 1994 issue of Rolling Stone, a reviewer wrote, [...] "...There aren't too many blues albums that qualify as audiophile recordings, but Muddy Waters Folk Singer surely does. A wonderfully intimate session, it delivers Waters' voice in all its power and subtlety, while rendering his guitar work...with such vivid realism, you would think you were sitting in the studio...." ...|$|E
500|$|The next track, [...] "Skew It On the Bar-B" [...] {{features}} rapper Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan {{and discusses}} the disappointment of the group's debut album not achieving the coveted [...] "five-mic" [...] rating from The Source: [...] "I gotta hit the Source / I <b>need</b> <b>my</b> other half mic / because that Southernplayalisticadillacmusik {{was a classic}} right?". [...] "Skew It On the Bar-B" [...] {{is followed by the}} title track, which has been compared to the music of soul singer Isaac Hayes. Pogue experimented with delays and echos in his production to make the song [...] "dimensional, like you could actually put your hands through the song." [...] "Synthesizer" [...] contains elements of electrofunk and features funk musician George Clinton. Emma Warren of The Guardian called the track [...] "raw and woozy", dubbing it the [...] "weirdest moment of the record". On the seventh track, [...] "Slump", Big Boi is joined by two members of the Dungeon Family as they describe their experiences selling dope. One of the few tracks that doesn’t have Andre on it, since he is the [...] "unique" [...] one of the group, while Big Boi is more of the traditional gangster. On [...] "West Savannah", Big Boi discusses his Southern roots, and references individuals who grew up outside of the South who fail to recognize different regional Southern identities by stating [...] "You might call us country, but we's only Southern".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Cuccinelli stated [...] "homosexuality is wrong." [...] During his 2009 {{campaign}} for attorney general, he stated [...] "My {{view is that}} homosexual acts, not homosexuality, but homosexual acts are wrong. They’re intrinsically wrong. And I think in a natural law based country it’s appropriate to have policies that reflect that. ... They don’t comport with natural law. I happen {{to think that it}} represents (to put it politely; I <b>need</b> <b>my</b> thesaurus to be polite) behavior that is not healthy to an individual and in aggregate is not healthy to society." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{explanation}} is <b>needed,</b> <b>my</b> dear Andrea," [...] replied the old nobleman, abandoning the formalities that had marked his welcoming speech. [...] "How left you my Lord Cardinal?" [...] he asked, {{as he took}} the letter.|$|R

2500|$|La Toya Jackson has a three-octave vocal range which soars {{to a high}} D#6 in her single, [...] "Bet'cha Gonna <b>Need</b> <b>My</b> Lovin'." [...] The Evening Independent {{says that}} she has an [...] "attractive, {{pleasant}} voice that is matured and controlled." [...] Andrew Hamilton of AllMusic describes her voice as a light, wispy [...] "sexy whisper". Like her siblings, Michael and Janet, she is mainly a pop, R and dance music performer but she has also dabbled in rock as heard in her song, [...] "No More Drama" [...] and reggae in her signature song [...] "Heart Don't Lie." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1984 saw {{the release}} of Jackson's {{critically}} acclaimed album Heart Don't Lie. Jackson scored her biggest Billboard Hot 100 hit with the title track, which peaked at number 56. Other singles from this album were [...] "Bet'cha Gonna <b>Need</b> <b>My</b> Lovin'", [...] "Hot Potato", and a cover of Prince's [...] "Private Joy." [...] Jackson and Amir Bayyan co-wrote [...] "Reggae Nights" [...] for Heart Don't Lie but the track {{did not make the}} cut. Jimmy Cliff's recording of the song was a hit and was nominated for a Grammy. Cliff commissioned Jackson to write two more songs: [...] "Brown Eyes" [...] and [...] "American Sweet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hellman shot {{almost the}} entire script as written. The first cut of the film was three-and-a-half hours long. He was his own editor: [...] "I can't look over someone's shoulder. I <b>need</b> <b>my</b> hand on the brake". He had control of the final cut, but was contractually obliged to deliver a film no longer than two hours. The final version ran 105 minutes. In their April 1971 cover story, Esquire {{magazine}} proclaimed Two-Lane Blacktop, [...] "film of the year". Hellman initially thought that the Esquire article would be good publicity for the film, but in hindsight was not, because [...] "I think it raised people's expectations. They couldn't accept the movie for what it was". There {{was a lot of}} advance buzz about the film, but Lew Wasserman, head of the studio saw the film and hated it. He refused to promote it and when it opened in New York City on the Fourth of July weekend, there were no newspaper ads promoting it.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was never}} short-tempered or impatient. He {{was a good}} and loving father, who worked long hours and had no extravagant <b>needs.</b> ... <b>My</b> one {{favourite}} and recent memory is of him singing Baa Baa Black Sheep to my 18-month-old daughter, Nicole Wee.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{makes us}} {{know all the}} new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you a secret. When we {{realised}} in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to be <b>needed,</b> <b>my</b> first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get fit myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that that is quite hopeless," [...] he answered. [...] "I have not the excuse of a country which <b>needs</b> <b>my</b> help, {{although}} I {{have more than one}} relative," [...] he added, with a smile, [...] "whom I should not mind taking by the throat." ...|$|R

5000|$|He {{is buried}} in Deyr ul-Zafaran Monastery. The week before he died, when he saw his last article in the Patriarchal Magazine, he said: “I don’t like death to break my pen, because the Church and our youth still <b>needs</b> <b>my</b> pen, but may God’s will be done”.|$|R
5000|$|Co-founder {{and owner}} of Breitbart, Larry Solov—who, like Andrew Breitbart, is Jewish—writes: One night in Jerusalem, when we were getting ready for dinner, Andrew {{turned to me and}} asked if I would de-partner from the 800-person law firm where I was {{practicing}} and become business partners with him. He said he <b>needed</b> <b>my</b> help to create a media company. He <b>needed</b> <b>my</b> help to [...] "change the world"... We were blown away by the spirit, tenacity, and resourcefulness of the Israeli people on that trip. Andrew could be quite convincing, not to mention inspiring, and I decided right there and then to [...] "throw away" [...] (my Mom's phrase) a perfectly good, successful and safe career in order to start a [...] "new media" [...] company with Andrew Breitbart.|$|R
5000|$|Among Phillips' other songs is [...] "No One <b>Needs</b> <b>My</b> Love Today" [...] (1966), {{which was}} {{recorded}} by Samantha Juste, co-host of BBC TV's Top of the Pops. He also recorded an anti-drug spoken word recording, [...] "The Evil Dope", {{in the late}} 1960s; the single is considered a cult classic.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{must leave}} you," [...] she said, [...] "since <b>my</b> father <b>needs</b> <b>my</b> help. The matter {{has to do}} with the Force that he would let loose tomorrow, and its measurements; also with the {{preparation}} of the robes that we must wear lest it should harm us in its leap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So doubtless {{it seems}} to you. All I {{can say is that}} it was the great effort of my life. Being a {{military}} man, I have had on various occasions to face time enemy. But it was not then I <b>needed</b> <b>my</b> resolution; it was when I left Florence in a post-chaise." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{works as}} a public defender in Manhattan, where he handles 70 to 80 cases at a time.
