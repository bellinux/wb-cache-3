500|$|Justice McHugh drew analogies {{between the}} {{legislation}} {{at issue in}} the case, and previous legislation which had authorised indefinite administrative detention, such as the arrangements under the War Precautions Act 1914. Regulations made under that and other acts allowed the internment of several thousand people, including German Australians during World War I and Japanese Australians during World War II. McHugh noted that those arrangements had been challenged, and upheld, in the High Court (for example in the 1915 case of Lloyd v Wallach), and emphasised that at no time had anyone questioned that detention for protective purposes, as opposed to punitive purposes, would conflict with Chapter III. He concluded that although the situation at hand was [...] "tragic", the courts were <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> question the propriety of decisions made by the Parliament of Australia on moral or human rights grounds, given {{the absence of a}} bill of rights in Australia.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{controversy}} caused by the ban, 300,000ballots were distributed on February 6 to motorists on the skyway, asking whether trucks should be banned. Mayor Hague promised {{to go with the}} majority, which agreed with the ban. The matter was also taken to court, with one of the convicted truck drivers arguing that the ban was an unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce, and that since the federal government contributed money towards the road, Jersey City lacked the power to ban trucks. On August 14, Justice Thomas W. Trenchard of the New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the ban, stating that [...] "the court is <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> substitute its judgment for that of the municipality's as to the best and most feasible manner of curing traffic evils and traffic congestion where such regulation bears a direct relationship to public safety and is reasonable and not arbitrary." [...] The Tonnele Circle Viaduct, a new offramp allowing westbound trucks from the Holland Tunnel to bypass Tonnele Circle to southbound US 1/9 Truck, which now also leads to Interstate 280 (I-280), opened on September 14, 1938. The Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-78) opened in September 1956, allowing trucks to bypass the old surface road, US 1/9 Truck.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was largely}} due to the persuasion and {{influence}} of Lewes that the three Scenes first appeared in John Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. He submitted the first story, The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton, on 6 November 1856. At first it appeared anonymously, at Lewes' insistence. [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> reveal the veil of anonymity – even as regards social position. Be pleased, therefore, to keep the whole secret." [...] Public and professional curiosity was not to be suppressed, however, and on 5 February 1857 the author's 'identity' was revealed to Blackwood's: [...] "Whatever may be the success of my stories, I shall be resolute in preserving my incognito ... and accordingly I subscribe myself, best and most sympathising of editors, Yours very truly George Eliot." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 17, 2013, Shady Records {{producer}} The Alchemist {{appeared on}} RapFix Live, and tweeted to shadygodz (One of the Stan fans aka Sanket Kale Mathers) about Eminem's upcoming album: [...] "That's my boss.

[...] After finding that the name Caligula was already taken, the members {{arbitrarily}} chose [...] "Them Crooked Vultures" [...] as a name with no significance. British music magazine NME reported in July 2009 that the trio had begun recording in Los Angeles. The band performed its first show at the Metro, Chicago on August 9, 2009 at midnight.
