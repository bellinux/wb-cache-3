5|$|It {{was long}} {{believed}} that ceratopsians like Styracosaurus used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> horn thrust injuries causing {{these forms of}} damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes.|$|E
5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, {{appeared to be}} involved in generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, mendelevium(I) was {{reported}} to have been produced by Russian scientists, who obtained it by reducing higher oxidation states of mendelevium with samarium(II). It was found to be stable in neutral water–ethanol solution and be homologous to caesium(I). However, later experiments found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> mendelevium(I) and found that mendelevium behaved like divalent elements when reduced, not like the monovalent alkali metals. Nevertheless, the Russian team conducted further studies on the thermodynamics of cocrystallizing mendelevium with alkali metal chlorides, and concluded that mendelevium(I) had formed and could form mixed crystals with divalent elements, thus cocrystallizing with them. The status of the +1 oxidation state is still tentative.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Eichler calculated that lawrencium's enthalpy of adsorption on metal sources would differ enough depending on its electron configuration that it would be feasible to carry out experiments to exploit this fact to measure lawrencium's electron configuration. The s2p configuration was expected to be more volatile than the s2d configuration, and be more {{similar to that of the}} p-block element lead. <b>No</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> lawrencium being volatile was obtained and the lower limit for the enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on quartz or platinum was significantly higher than the estimated value for the s2p configuration.|$|E

5|$|In local mythology, {{the site}} of Harlech Castle in North Wales is {{associated}} with the legend of Branwen, a Welsh princess, but there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> a native Welsh fortification having been built there. The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of North Wales since the 1070s and the conflict was renewed during the 13th century, leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282. Edward invaded with a huge army, pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. English forces advanced down the Conwy valley and through Dolwyddelan and Castell y Bere, onto Harlech, which Sir Otton de Grandson took with 560 infantry in May.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether a building {{stood on the}} site of the citadel before the 11th century AD. The Ghouta, the wider area in which Damascus is located, has been occupied since at least 9000 BC, but there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> settlement within the area that is today enclosed by the city walls before the 1st millennium BC. The area occupied by the later citadel was most likely outside this first settlement. The presence of a citadel during the Hellenistic period {{is uncertain}}. Damascus certainly had a citadel during the Roman period, but whether it was located {{on the site of}} the present citadel is uncertain and subject to scholarly debate.|$|E

At a May 2002 party in Tufnell Park, Livingstone got into an argument with Beal's friend Robin Hedges, {{a reporter for the}} Evening Standard. Hedges subsequently fell off of a wall, bruised his ribs and ended up in hospital; the press claimed that Livingstone had pushed him, although he insisted that he did not.

5|$|Majungasaurus {{is perhaps}} most {{distinctive}} for its skull ornamentation, including the swollen and fused nasals and the frontal horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures {{are likely to have}} played a role in intraspecific competition, although their exact function within that context is unknown. The hollow cavity inside the frontal horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the ornamentation of Majungasaurus individuals, there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Radar studies {{preceding}} {{and following}} the Lunar Prospector mission demonstrate that the inner walls of Shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some sunlit craters. In particular, the surroundings appear to contain {{a significant number of}} blocks in its ejecta blanket, suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface roughness, and not ice deposits, as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the Clementine mission. This interpretation, however, is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community. Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13cm show <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> water ice deposits.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} William the Lion had a royal castle at Urquhart in the 12th century, though Professor Alcock finds <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> this. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Meic Uilleim (MacWilliams), descendents of Malcolm III, staged {{a series of}} rebellions against David I and his successors. The last of these rebellions was put down in 1229, and to {{maintain}} order Alexander II granted Urquhart to his Hostarius (usher or door-ward), Thomas de Lundin. On de Lundin's death {{a few years later}} it passed to his son Alan Durward. It is considered likely that the original castle was built soon after this time, centred on the motte at the south-west of the site. In 1275, after Alan's death, the king granted Urquhart to John II Comyn, Lord of Badenoch.|$|E

5|$|The Laramide orogeny {{affected}} all {{of western}} North America {{by helping to}} build the American cordillera. The Kaibab Uplift, Monument Upwarp, the Uinta Mountains, San Rafael Swell, and the Rocky Mountains were uplifted, at least in part, by the Laramide orogeny. This major mountain-building event started {{near the end of}} the Mesozoic, around 75million years ago, and continued into the Eocene period of the Cenozoic. It was caused by subduction off the western coast of North America. Major faults that trend north–south and cross the canyon area were reactivated by this uplift. Many of these faults are Precambrian in age and are still active today. Streams draining the Rocky Mountains in early Miocene time terminated in landlocked basins in Utah, Arizona and Nevada but there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> a major river.|$|E
5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered to have begun about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival of Europeans in Indiana. It {{was a period of}} rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which has yet to be explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to attribute the forts to Welsh Indians who supposedly arrived centuries before Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> that theory and believe that the cultural development was engendered by the Mississippian culture.|$|E
5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence {{of at least two}} age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest.

5|$|The first {{city had}} the {{characteristics}} of large urban centers, such as monumental buildings, and {{seems to have been}} ruled by a kinship based assembly, headed by elders. The pre-Akkadian kingdom was decentralized, and the provincial center of Nabada was ruled by a council of elders, next to the king's representative. The Nagarite monarchs had to tour their kingdom regularly in order to assert their political control. During the early Akkadian period, Nagar was administrated by local officials. However, central control was tightened and the number of Akkadian officials increased, following the supposed environmental event that preceded the construction of Naram-Sin's palace. The post-Akkadian Nagar was a city-state kingdom, that gradually lost its political importance during the early second millennium BC, as <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> a king dating to that period exists.|$|E
5|$|The women {{performed}} up to {{six hours}} a day, either singing their own florid repertoire from memory, sight-reading from partbooks, or participating in the balletti as singers and dancers. Thomasin LaMay posits that {{the women of the}} concerti delle donne provided sexual favors for members of the court, but there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>for</b> this, and the circumstances of their marriages and dowries argues against this interpretation. The women were paid salaries and received other benefits, such as dowries and apartments in the ducal palace. Peverara received 300 scudi a year and lodging in the ducal palace for herself, her husband, and her mother - as well as a dowry of 10,000 scudi upon her marriage.|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known {{vertebrae}} of Plesiorycteropus. The animal had {{at least}} seven sacral and five or six lumbar vertebrae.
