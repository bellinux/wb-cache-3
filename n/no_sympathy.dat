Nine media witnesses were allowed to record the actual event. Actor and activist Mike Farrell appeared as a commentator for the American Civil Liberties Union in opposition to the death penalty. Elliott King, the uncle of Charla King, was the sole member of the victim's family to arrive as a witness and expressed that he had <b>no</b> <b>sympathy</b> for Taylor. Sister Helen Prejean, the author of Dead Man Walking, wrote Taylor a letter that was delivered right before his execution.|$|E
5|$|Following the World Cup, against Australia {{during a}} Test match at Perth in 1979–80, Boycott {{became the first}} man to be marooned on 99 not out in a Test when he ran out of partners. England then toured the West Indies. Here, Boycott again faced the West Indies' feared pace attack, but succeeded in scoring centuries off the likes of Holding, Roberts, Colin Croft and Joel Garner, despite having passed the age of 40 the {{previous}} year. Other batsmen, such as David Gower found the attack difficult to cope with, and the later England captain stated that Boycott often had <b>no</b> <b>sympathy.</b> Boycott was the third most successful batsman, behind Gooch and Gower, during a tour where England went down 2–0. He scored 70 in the opening match, the only England player to pass 50.|$|E

25|$|The clearest {{illustration}} of the shift that took place within Anglo-Catholicism from theological to liturgical questions {{is to be found}} in Pusey's attitude towards ritualism.

However, when priests started to be prosecuted and imprisoned as a result of the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874, Pusey was quick to show his support for those who were prosecuted.|$|E

Aureolus was still besieged in Mediolanum and sought reconciliation with the new emperor, but Claudius had <b>no</b> <b>sympathy</b> for a potential rival.

25|$|Pius XI {{continued}} {{the approach of}} Benedict XV {{on the issue of}} {{how to deal with the}} threat of modernism in Catholic theology. The Pope was thoroughly orthodox theologically and had <b>no</b> <b>sympathy</b> with modernist ideas that relativised fundamental Catholic teachings. He condemned modernism in his writings and addresses. However, his opposition to modernist theology was by no means a rejection of new scholarship within the Church, as long as it was developed within the framework of orthodoxy and compatible with the Church's teachings. Pius XI was interested in supporting serious scientific study within the Church, establishing the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences in 1936.|$|E
25|$|However, at the {{beginning}} of 1988 Anita Dobson decided that she wanted to move on after three years playing Angie. She made her final appearance in May that year. Leslie Grantham had also decided that he wanted to move on, but Julia Smith didn't want the programme to suffer the double blow of losing both Den and Angie so close together. The solution to the problem was one of the soap's most complex and creative exercises, that required intricate planning. The idea was to enable Den to stay as an on-screen presence until 1989, while keeping Grantham working for EastEnders only until the autumn of 1988. Tony Holland and writer/editor Bill Lyons came up with a story to put Den in prison for a year, intending that material recorded in a block of intensive filming would then be included in the programme {{for the rest of the}} year. The programme didn't want to make Den into a criminal, however, so he had to be put in prison for doing something that could be justified to the viewing public — otherwise there would be <b>no</b> <b>sympathy</b> for him. The answer lay in a storyline that was running with another character — the rape of Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). After simultaneously getting in way over his head with a criminal organisation (The Firm), Den torched Kathy's rapist's winebar in retaliation, and was then made to take the blame for the deed by the firm. After he refused, went on the run, and was nearly killed by the firm's heavies, Den turned himself into the police and was put on remand at Dickens Hill prison in September 1988. For the next five months he was seen, in the company of a small group of new characters also confined in the prison, on a regular basis in EastEnders. This material was shot in less than a month at Dartmoor Prison, Devon. When these segments were written and recorded, they were done so entirely in isolation and in advance - the production team had no real idea of other material that would have to fit around it.|$|E

500|$|Artists of the 18th and 19th centuries {{striving to}} evoke republican ideals {{commonly}} used representations of Libertas as an allegorical symbol.

In this painting, which commemorates France's Revolution of 1830, a half-clothed Liberty leads an armed mob over {{the bodies of the}} fallen. Laboulaye had <b>no</b> <b>sympathy</b> for revolution, and so Bartholdi's figure would be fully dressed in flowing robes. Instead of the impression of violence in the Delacroix work, Bartholdi wished to give the statue a peaceful appearance and chose a torch, representing progress, for the figure to hold.|$|E

500|$|In Karnick's eyes, {{contemporary}} {{critics have}} failed {{to see how the}} film has affected audiences and subsequently branded the film series as [...] "both irresponsible (for numbing audiences to violence) and puritanical (for showing the murders of sexually active teens)". Quoting director John Carpenter, Karnick emphasized that [...] "teens thus dispatched became victims not as punishment for sexual activity but simply because they were too preoccupied to notice the presence of a murderer". Pointing to Roger Ebert as a prime example of how critics have misunderstood the films (Ebert wrote that during a screening of Friday the 13th Part 2, he noticed that the audience had <b>no</b> <b>sympathy</b> for the victims and cheered during death scenes), Karnick explains that Ebert's remarks show how the film series forces [...] "audiences to experience the very thing that motivates the murders: a lack of compassion". In closing, Karnick suggested that these films were not puritanical, but proved that audiences [...] "could be just as indifferent and callous as the characters in the films".|$|E

Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George was looking towards a Liberal Land Campaign to gain support for a reform of land taxation to introduce a 'Single Tax'. Like Josiah Wedgwood, Outhwaite was {{a strong supporter of}} the 'Single Tax'. The local Liberal Association therefore adopted Outhwaite as candidate to campaign on a 'Single Tax' platform.|$|R
