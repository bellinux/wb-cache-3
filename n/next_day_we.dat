500|$|Officially it {{was called}} a [...] "planned withdrawal" [...] (...). But {{to me it was}} so much bullshit. The <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> heard on the radio, in the 'news from the front' (Wehrmachtbericht) about the [...] "successful front correction" [...] in our Yelnya {{defensive}} lines and the enormous losses we inflicted on the enemy. But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the situation, about the mental and emotional numbness of the German soldiers. In short, it was again a [...] "victory". But we on the front line were running back like rabbits in front of the fox. This metamorphosis of the truth from [...] "all shit" [...] to [...] "it was a victory" [...] baffled me, and those of my comrades who dared to think.|$|E
500|$|Horses {{were used}} {{extensively}} for military trains. [...] They {{were used to}} pull ambulances, carry supplies and [...] [...] At {{the beginning of the}} war, the German army depended upon horses to pull its field kitchens, as well as the ammunition wagons for artillery brigades. The Royal Corps of Signals used horses to pull cable wagons, and the promptness of messengers and dispatch riders depended on their mounts. [...] Horses often drew artillery and steady animals were crucial to artillery effectiveness. The deep mud common {{in some parts of the}} front, caused by damaged drainage systems flooding nearby areas, made horses and mules vital, as they were the only means of getting supplies to the front and guns moved from place to place. After the April 1917 Battle of Vimy Ridge, one Canadian soldier recalled, [...] "the horses were up to their bellies in mud. We'd put them on a picket line between the wagon wheels at night and they'd be sunk in over their fetlocks the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>We</b> had to shoot quite a number." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Volk {{helped lead}} the Colts to another Super Bowl appearance, but were now {{representing}} the AFC following the merger of the two leagues (NFL and AFL) that year. [...] This time, the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V. [...] Volk was responsible for covering Pro Football Hall of Famers Bob Hayes and Mike Ditka in the Super Bowl, and he {{played a key role}} in the Colts' victory. [...] In the fourth quarter, the Colts trailed the Cowboys 136. [...] Volk intercepted a pass by Cowboys quarterback Craig Morton at the Dallas 33-yard line and returned it 30 yards to the 3-yard line to set up the tying touchdown. [...] Baltimore quarterback Earl Morrall later referred to Volk's interception as the play of the game. [...] Interviewed in 2009, Volk cited Super Bowl V as his fondest memory of playing in Baltimore. [...] He recalled team owner Carroll Rosenbloom flying the whole team, families included, to the Bahamas the day after the game: [...] "The <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> all got on the plane and flew over to the Bahamas. He took the whole family – my wife and one kid, at the time. I remember we were on the beach, Tom Mitchell and I, and we got the paper to make sure it was really true - that we did win. Because this was like a dream come true on the sand beaches in the Bahamas." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{story that}} we were sunk was a coward's trick—spreading anxiety and fear among the innocent.... The <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> issued a denial and ... on October 4 we spread panic and chaos in the Norwegian {{shipping}} lanes. Only one thing we regret. We kept looking for the Tirpitz but either she wouldn't or couldn't come out.... Meanwhile the Ranger, still very much afloat, is doing her job." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We got our things {{packed up}} {{and took care of}} the wounded the best we could, and left the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>We</b> could have killed all the men that got into holes on the hill, but they were glad to let us alone, and so we let them alone too. Rain-in-the-Face was with me in the fight. There were twelve hundred of us. Might be no more than one {{thousand}} in the fight. Many of our Indians were out on a hunt." ...|$|E
2500|$|I do {{have the}} {{original}} tape that was running {{at the time we}} ran down [...] "Stairway To Heaven" [...] completely with the band. I'd worked it all out already the night before with John Paul Jones, written down the changes and things. All this time we were all living in a house and keeping pretty regular hours together, so the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> started running it down. There was only one place where there was a slight rerun. For some unknown reason Bonzo couldn't get the timing right on the twelve-string part before the solo. Other than that it flowed very quickly.|$|E

2500|$|We spent {{this winter}} very joyously and of good times, {{due to the}} L'Odre de l Bon Temps that I {{established}} here, which each person finds useful for their health and more beneficial than any sort of medicine {{that we could have}} used. The Order was presented as a Chain of office that we placed with some small ceremony, at the neck of one of our people, charging him that day with going hunting; the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> gave it to another and thus consequently: all who wished to try would do their best and bring the most beautiful hunt: We don't find it half bad , as well as the Indians who were with us.

2500|$|June Juanico [...] "recalls a {{time when}} she stood up to Elvis in front of his band of hangers-on, who even then were {{beginning}} to accompany him everywhere. He grabbed her arm, took her into the bathroom and declared: 'Look, you are so right, I am really sorry.' He kept her there for five minutes, then swaggered out, his image intact." [...] Julie Parrish, Presley's co-star in Paradise Hawaiian Style, relates, [...] "One time on set I had a real pain in my side – a side-effect, I think – and Elvis scooped me up, carried me into his trailer and shut the door. Outside the crew was waiting and wondering, but Elvis was oblivious to the innuendo. He placed his hand over my side and tried to do some healing on me." [...] Playboy star and actress June Wilkinson remembered that she [...] "met Elvis on the set of King Creole. He invited me to dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ... Then Elvis gave me a tour of his suite, sat me on the bed in his bedroom and sang to me for two hours. That was it. The <b>next</b> <b>day</b> ... <b>we</b> had dinner again. He was very sweet, and he was friendly. He had more than sex on his mind. He got me to the airport on time, and our paths never crossed again." ...|$|E

60|$|It rained all the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> and <b>we</b> {{were forced}} to remain in camp, which was dismal business; but we made the best of it, doing some mending of clothes and tackle during the long hours.|$|R

30|$|Finally, driving {{pressure}} was measured at 24  h {{of the beginning}} of the protocol. Ideally, we should consider some average exposition during the whole mechanical ventilation period. In this study, however, similarly to the previous study of Amato et al. [20], the values of {{driving pressure}} measured at day-one were strongly correlated to the levels measured during the <b>next</b> <b>days.</b> <b>We</b> may not exclude, however, that additional adjustments in mechanical ventilation after 24  h of the protocol could also be associated with late pulmonary function and structure.|$|R
60|$|<b>Next</b> <b>day,</b> when <b>we</b> {{were all}} {{assembled}} round the breakfast-table, shivering and {{fresh from the}} morning's chill ablutions, Mrs. Bretton pronounced a decree that nobody, who was not forced by dire necessity, should quit her house that day.|$|R
6000|$|... "I needn't {{remind you}} that you've an {{appointment}} with Horsfield about the smelter, and there's {{a meeting of the}} board <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> If <b>we</b> started now and caught the first steamer across, you wouldn't have much time to spare." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> sighted four {{swordfish}} {{and tried}} {{in vain to}} coax one to bite.|$|E

60|$|It {{was nearly}} dinner-time <b>next</b> <b>day</b> when <b>we</b> {{appeared}} before my aunt. She {{was up in}} my study, Peggotty said: which it was her pride to keep in readiness and order for me. We found her, in her spectacles, sitting by the fire.|$|R
60|$|I was too drowsy {{and cold}} to answer, {{and how we}} got the team into the stables or even found Fairmead I do not remember; but we {{probably}} did it by force of habit, and it was high noon the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> before <b>we</b> awakened.|$|R
60|$|Edward {{went to bed}} {{somewhat}} dispirited; but, quickly falling asleep, {{was visited}} with such a pleasant dream of the sunshine and of his dearest friends that he felt the happier for it all the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> And <b>we</b> hope to find him still happy when we meet again.|$|R

60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> bade {{farewell}} to Glasgow, overwhelmed with kindness to the last, and only oppressed by the thought, how little that was satisfactory {{we were able}} to give in return.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. The <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> got an {{unsigned}} letter. In it Sobber said that, by hook or by crook, {{he intended}} to get possession of the treasure, and for the Rovers to beware," ...|$|E

60|$|As {{this was}} {{an opening in the}} prospect, it was {{arranged}} that Mr. Kenge should see his cousin.
