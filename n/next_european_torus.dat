40|$|The {{corrosion}} fatigue behavior of AISI 316 L (UNS S 31603) stainless steel was tested in concentrated aqueous lithium hydroxide solutions at elevated temperature.

40|$|A {{possible}} {{concept for}} the blanket for next generation fusion devices is the lithium salt blanket, where lithium salt is dissolved {{in an aqueous}} coolant {{in order to provide}} for tritium. Type AISI 316 L stainless steel has been considered as a structural material for such a blanket for NET (<b>Next</b> <b>European</b> <b>Torus),</b> and a systematic study of the corrosion behaviour of 316 L stainless steel has been carried out in a number of lithium salt solutions. The experiments include cyclic potentiodynamic polarization measurement, crevice corrosion, corrosion fatigue and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) tests. This paper presents a part of novel corrosion results concerning the compatibility of 316 L steel and a series of other materials relevant to a fusion blanket environment. No major uniform corrosion problem has been observed, but localized corrosion, particularly corrosion fatigue and SCC, of 316 L stainless steel have been fund so far in a lithium hydroxide solution under some specific potential conditions.

40|$|A {{first wall}} mock-up {{of the design}} for the <b>next</b> <b>European</b> <b>torus</b> (NET) was {{available}} for experiments as a water-cooled steel structure. The mock-up has not been thought to become a thermal fatigue specimen because of its pre-damage by {{a large number of}} thermocouple holes. It was rather used as a prototypical background structure for thermomechanical tests of carbon-based protection tiles and their attachment schemes. In a first series of tests the bare mock-up was thermally loaded by a heat flux to its surface. In this case, the strains measured on its back side verified a corresponding FE model prediction reasonably. In a second series the mock-up was protected by a radiatively cooled tile that was not in close thermal contact with the mock-up; these tests revealed the great importance of appropriately sized gaps that allow the full differential expansion and bowing also during thermal transients. Finally, the mock-up was protected by conductively cooled tiles which, with an intermediate layer of flexible graphite, were pressed {{to the surface of the}} mock-up. The heat transfer characteristics of the compliant layer turned out to be uniform and reliable even after thermal cycles at high temperatures. (orig.) 7 refs.

40|$|Technologies {{developed}} for the <b>Next</b> <b>European</b> <b>Torus</b> (NET) are made available to ITER. During the eleven years of existence of the FZK fusion project major test facilities have been built which constitute a considerable potential to test components and systems relevant for ITER in a technical scale. In particular the ITER model coil test facility TOSKA, the in vessel-handling demonstration facility EDITH, the tritium laboratory TLK and the test arrangement for first wall components FIWATKA shalll be named. One of the important technological missions of ITER will be the qualification of first wall and fuel cycle components, in particular the breeding blankets. Within a European Community wide cooperation FZK elaborates breeding blanket designs for a Demonstration Reactor (DEMO) and conducts the basic r + d to qualify these concepts for implementation as test sections in ITER. Associated to the blanket activities is a programme to develop and qualify structural materials with sufficient lifetimes and reasonable activation properties. The work conducted in this frame necessitates extensive reactor and accelerator irradiations and subsequent hot cell examinations. Reactor irradiations are performed out of site, whereas two cyclotrons combined as Dual Beam Facility provide a unique tool for simulation of irradiation effects and for activation measurements. The safety related part of the fusion project contributes to the component studies (blankets, superconducting magnets) and investigates the risks of severe accidents of fusion installations in nuclear operation.

40|$|Under {{the fusion}} {{technology}} {{program of the}} European community a martensitic CrNiMoVNb-steel (type 1. 4914) potentially serving as structural material for the first wall and blanket was optimized and prepared as a 7 t melt. Thus, a uniform material in various semi-finished product sizes is available to the European partners for conducting their test programs. After a description in a previous paper {{of the results of}} experiments characterizing physical and mechanical properties of the MANET II (Martensit for <b>next</b> <b>european</b> <b>torus)</b> material, this paper reports about comprehensive results obtained in the creep rupture tests. The creep rupture strength and the creep behavior were examined of four single heats including different semi-finished product sizes (metal sheets, rods) in the range of temperatures from 400 - 700 C up to 15000 h time-to-fracture in the reference state (hardened + tempered at 750 C). Likewise, the conditions after heat treatment at 600 and 700 C tempering temperatures, respectively, were studied in the range of temperatures from 450 to 650 C in order to demonstrate the potential inherent in higher creep rupture strengths. In conclusion, it will be shown which influence is exerted by a prior, temporary temperature transient up to 850 C on the subsequent creep and creep rupture behavior at 450 and 500 C test temperatures. The creep rupture strength values up to 10 " 5 hours time-to-fracture and temperatures of 400 to 600 C will be estimated from the numerous data available. (orig.) 16 refs.
