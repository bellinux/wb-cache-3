5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were <b>not</b> <b>hungry)</b> actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.|$|E
25|$|Herod {{asks for}} Salome {{to eat with}} him, drink with him; indolently, she twice refuses, saying she is <b>not</b> <b>hungry</b> or thirsty. Herod then begs Salome to dance for him, Tanz für mich, Salome, though her mother objects. He {{promises}} to reward her with her heart's desire – {{even if it were}} one half of his kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Niki {{grew up in}} {{a strict}} Catholic environment, against which she {{repeatedly}} rebelled. Her mother was temperamental and violent, beating the younger children, and forcing them to eat even if they were <b>not</b> <b>hungry.</b> Both Elizabeth and Richard de Saint Phalle, younger siblings, would later commit suicide as adults. The atmosphere at home was tense; the only place where Niki felt comfortable and warm was in the kitchen, overseen by a black cook. Decades later, Niki would reveal that she had suffered years of sexual abuse from her father, starting at the age of 11.|$|E

25|$|Sheep flight {{behavior}} is cited in one major study in California {{as the major}} stimulus responsible for eliciting predatory behavior in coyotes. Even coyotes that had not previously been exposed to sheep demonstrated predatory behavior when exposed to {{them for the first}} time. Of particular interest was that coyotes with no previous prey-killing experience readily attacked and killed sheep when given the chance. The coyotes were likely to attack sheep that exhibited flight behavior even when these coyotes were <b>not</b> <b>hungry.</b> The same study also determined that dominant coyotes were more likely to attack sheep.|$|E
25|$|That night, Lombard appears {{surprised}} when he finds his gun returned to his room. Blore catches a glimpse of someone leaving the house but loses the trail. He then discovers Armstrong is absent from his room, and the remaining three guests conclude that Armstrong must be the killer. Vera, Blore, and Lombard decide to stay together at all times. In the morning, they unsuccessfully attempt to signal SOS to the mainland from outside by using a mirror and sunlight. Blore then decides {{to return to the}} house for food by himself — the others are <b>not</b> <b>hungry</b> — and is killed by a heavy bear-shaped clock statue that is pushed from Vera's window sill, crushing his skull.|$|E
500|$|Bradley holds {{a number}} of Ivy League career records, {{including}} total and average points (1,253/29.83, respectively), and free throws made and attempted (409/468, 87.4%). Ivy League season records he holds similarly include total and average points (464/33.14, 1964) and most free throws made (153 in 170 attempts, 90.0%, 1962–1963). He also holds the career point record at Princeton and many other school records, including the top ten slots {{in the category of}} total points scored in a game, but likely could have scored many more points if he had not insisted so often on passing the ball, in what his coaches called [...] "Bradley's hope passes", to inferior teammates closer to the basket; he only emphasized his own scoring when Princeton was behind or, as during the Wichita State game, his teammates forced Bradley to shoot by returning passes to him. Van Breda Kolff often encouraged Bradley {{to be more of a}} [...] "one on one" [...] player, stating that [...] "Bill is <b>not</b> <b>hungry.</b> At least ninety percent of the time, when he gets the ball, he is looking for a pass." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Edmund {{reveals that}} he has tuberculosis, Mary refuses to believe it, and {{attempts}} to discredit Dr. Hardy, due to her inability to face the reality and most importantly {{the severity of the}} situation. She accuses Edmund of attempting to get more attention by blowing everything out of proportion. In retaliation, Edmund reminds his mother that her own father died of tuberculosis, and then, before exiting, he adds {{how difficult it is to}} have a [...] "dope fiend for a mother." [...] By herself, Mary admits that she needs more morphine and hopes that someday she will “accidentally” overdose, because she knows that if she did so on purpose, the Virgin would never forgive her. When James comes back with more alcohol he notes that there was evidence that Jamie had attempted to pick the locks to the whiskey cabinet in the cellar, as he has done before. Mary ignores this and bursts out that she is afraid that Edmund is going to die. She also confides to James that Edmund does not love her because of her drug problem. When James attempts to console her, Mary again rues having given birth to Edmund, who appears to have been conceived to replace a baby they had lost before Edmund’s birth. When Cathleen announces dinner, Mary indicates that she is <b>not</b> <b>hungry</b> and is going to bed. James goes in to dinner all alone, knowing that Mary is really going upstairs to get more drugs.|$|E
