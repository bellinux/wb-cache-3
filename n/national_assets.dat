5|$|In {{the wake}} of the fall of Gush Etzion, news of Degania's {{successful}} stand (as well as that of Kfar Darom) provided a morale boost for other Israeli villages. The battle also influenced British opinion on {{the balance of power in}} the war. The success of the Napoleonchik field cannons prompted the Israeli high command to re-use two of them in attempts to capture Latrun. The flight from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, on the other hand, stirred controversy in the young state, fueled by news of the Kfar Etzion massacre just days before, and the Palmach issued a newsletter accusing them of abandoning <b>national</b> <b>assets,</b> among other things. These accusations were subsequently repeated in media and in a play by Yigal Mossensohn, and a campaign was started by the villagers to clear their name.|$|E

Gorbachev also hated my guts and called for my assassination and imprisonment and so forth."

2500|$|In a risk-management {{scenario}} {{similar to}} the Challenger disaster, NASA management failed to recognize the relevance of engineering concerns for safety and suggestions for imaging to inspect possible damage, and {{failed to respond to}} engineers' requests about the status of astronaut inspection of the left wing. Engineers made three separate requests for Department of Defense (DOD) imaging of the shuttle in orbit to determine damage more precisely. While the images were not guaranteed to show the damage, the capability existed for imaging of sufficient resolution to provide meaningful examination. NASA management did not honor the requests and in some cases intervened to stop the DOD from assisting. The CAIB recommended subsequent shuttle flights be imaged while in orbit using ground-based or space-based DOD assets. Details of the DOD's unfulfilled participation with Columbia remain secret; retired NASA official Wayne Hale stated in 2012 that [...] "activity regarding other <b>national</b> <b>assets</b> and agencies remains classified and I cannot comment on that aspect of the Columbia tragedy".|$|E
2500|$|A plan by the Bush {{administration}} [...] "to privatize {{parts of}} the national passenger rail system and spin off other parts to partial state ownership" [...] provoked disagreement within Amtrak's board of directors. Late in 2005 Gunn was fired. Gunn's replacement, Alexander Kummant (2006–08), was committed to operating a national rail network, and, like Gunn, opposed the notion of putting the Northeast Corridor under separate ownership. He said that shedding the system's long-distance routes would amount to selling <b>national</b> <b>assets</b> that are on par with national parks, and that Amtrak's abandonment of these routes would be irreversible. In late 2006, Amtrak unsuccessfully sought annual congressional funding of $1billion for ten years. In early 2007, Amtrak employed 20,000 people in 46 states and served 25 million passengers a year, its highest amount {{since its founding in}} 1970. Politico noted a key problem: [...] "the rail system chronically operates in the red. A pattern has emerged: Congress overrides cutbacks demanded by the White House and appropriates enough funds to keep Amtrak from plunging into insolvency. But, Amtrak advocates say, that is not enough to fix the system's woes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1961 Stevenson {{suffered}} the greatest humiliation of his diplomatic {{career in the}} Bay of Pigs invasion. After hearing rumors that [...] "a lot of refugees {{wanted to go back}} and overthrow Castro", Stevenson voiced his skepticism about an invasion, but [...] "he was kept on the fringes of the operation, receiving...nine days before the invasion, only an unduly vague briefing by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr." [...] and the CIA. [...] Senior CIA official Tracy Barnes told Stevenson and his staff that [...] "there {{was going to be a}} clandestine operation in Cuba...it was strictly a Cuban affair. It would have some American cooperation, but only with the training and financing." [...] According to historian Peter Wyden, Barnes did not tell Stevenson that there would be a large-scale invasion of Cuba, nor did he provide details about the full extent of American support for, and involvement with, the Cuban rebels, nor did he tell Stevenson about the planned air strikes to destroy Castro's air force. Assistant Secretary of State Harlan Cleveland, who attended the briefing, felt that Barnes was [...] "too evasive", that he had been sent to reassure Stevenson that Kennedy [...] "knew what he was doing", and that [...] "evidently Stevenson was not to be told" [...] the full details of the invasion plan. Historian Garry Wills has written that [...] "news of the invasion was leaking out...Castro knew the landings would occur; only Adlai Stevenson was kept in the dark" [...] about the invasion by President Kennedy and his aides. Kennedy, anticipating that Stevenson might be angered at being left out of the discussions over whether to invade Cuba, told Schlesinger that [...] "the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson constitute one of our great <b>national</b> <b>assets.</b> I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that", and he asked Schlesinger to let Stevenson know that the president was shielding him from many of the details to protect him in case the clandestine operation failed. Instead, as Robert Dallek has written, [...] "by leaving him out of the discussion it led to his humiliation." [...] Unaware that the anti-Castro Cuban exiles landing at the Bay of Pigs were being armed and assisted directly by the CIA and US Navy, and that American pilots were participating in bombing raids of Cuban targets, Stevenson unwittingly [...] "repeated a CIA cover story in a speech before the UN General Assembly." [...] He argued that the rebels were not assisted in any way by the U.S. government; when this claim was proven to be false Stevenson complained that [...] "I took this job on the understanding that I would be consulted and kept fully informed on everything. Now my credibility has been compromised and therefore my usefulness." [...] When he told his friend Harlan Cleveland that his own government had [...] "deliberately tricked" [...] him into believing there was no direct American involvement in the invasion, Cleveland replied [...] "I feel as betrayed as you do." [...] Stevenson seriously considered resigning, but was convinced by his friends and President Kennedy to stay.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>National</b> <b>asset</b> {{funds are}} {{introduced}} to use the current transaction surplus, except the official reserves, in {{the most effective way}} possible. It is possible to cite the sources of these funds as commodity and non-commodity sources. The initial practices have been seen in oil-rich Gulf countries as well as Asian nations which have been successful in export activities. There are different <b>national</b> <b>asset</b> funds in a number of countries in the world exhibiting different management styles. The primary goals include ensuring sustainable development, creating sources, conducting development projects and accumulating savings for future generations. In addition, they are also used to deal with possible economic crises. But these funds are being criticized because they are allegedly not transparent and they can be used as independent budget by governments. Currently, the impacts of these funds upon economic growth have been a matter of academic curiosity. The purpsose {{of this paper is to}} analyze the impact of the size of the <b>national</b> <b>asset</b> funds upon economic growth by reliance on a panel analysis of six nations employing asset funds. The findings in the analysis show that increase in the size of the <b>national</b> <b>asset</b> funds has a positive impact upon economic growth of the nations.
