This research used monthly data of : stock index prices, market indexLQ 45, and risk free rate of Indonesia Bank Certificate. The evaluation of performance used 36 monthlydata for initial set and 24 months for holding investment period which started of the first day of January 2006 and hold up to end December 2007. Six hypothesis are in this research: (1) the monthly excess return of stock due to M² 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> and Sharpe 2 ̆ 7 smodel is different; (2) the risk of stock due to M² 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> and Sharpe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> is different; (3) the reward tovariability ratio due to M² 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> and Sharpe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> is different; (4) the M² value due to M² 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> andSharpe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> is different; (5) The monthly actual excess return compared by expected excess return dueto M² 2 ̆ 7 s value is different; (6) The monthly actual excess return compared by expected excess return due toreward to variability ratio is different. The finding of this research show that the number of undervalued stock is 10 stocks and 215 stock due tothe rank of M² 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> and Sharpe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> respectively. which the details result as below:(1) The monthly expected excess return of stock is 0, 076 and 0, 042 due to M² 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> and Sharpe 2 ̆ 7 s modelrespectively. The difference is statistically not significant. (2) The risk of stock is 0, 163 and 0, 245 due to M² 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> and Sharpe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> respectively. The differenceis statistically significant. (3) The reward to variability ratio is 0, 462 and 0, 177 due to M² 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> and Sharpe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> respectively. The difference is statistically significant. (4) The M² value is 0, 0056 and (0, 0127) due to M² 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> and Sharpe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of variance for experiments where the fixed effects or random effects model is appropriate is generally agreed upon with regard to testing procedures and covariance structure. It is only in experiments involving both random and fixed factors, i. e. mixed effects models, that controversy occurs as to the proper analysis. The mixed effect model has been considered by many statisticians, and several techniques {{have been developed for}} explaining its structure and performing its analysis for balanced data sets. The relationship of these techniques have been discussed in several papers as well. The simplest case of the difficulties presented by the mixed effects models occurs in the two-way cross classification model with interaction. The various models for the two-way mixed situation were examined and compared. It was found that Scheffe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> defined the effects in a meaninful way, is completely general, and provides exact tests. In situations where Scheffe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> cannot be applied, it was found that Kempthorne 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> or Graybill 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> should be used since they define effects in a meaningful way and, under certain assumptions, gives exact tests. Searle 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> does not define the effects {{in the same manner as}} the former three models. Searle 2 ̆ 7 s effects are defined more for mathematical appeal and his model is designed for easy application to unbalanced cases. Consequently, his model was not found to be desirable in balanced two-way mixed effect designs. In higher order models, Scheffe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modeling</b> techniques were found not to be practical since his test for fixed effect differences in models with more than two random effects cannot be computed. Kempthorne 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>models</b> and Graybill 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>models</b> both, under certain assumptions, provide straightforward tests for all effects. For this reason, their modeling techniques are recommended for higher order mixed models involving balanced data sets. Searle 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modeling</b> technique was again found unapplicable for balanced data sets in higher order mixed models for the same reasons as those in the two-way case. The results of the investigation recommends Scheffe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> for two-way situations, but Kempthorne 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modeling</b> technique and Graybill 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modeling</b> technique seem the most versatile. Although the task would be very cumbersome, further investigation is suggested in comparing Kempthorne 2 ̆ 7 s procedure and Graybill 2 ̆ 7 s procedure to Scheffe 2 ̆ 7 s procedure for testing fixed effect differences...|$|R

This study explored the effect of various parameters in drilling operations and how they affect the flow rate required for effective cutting transport. Three models, developed following an empirical approach, were employed: Rudi-Shindu 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model,</b> Hopkins 2 ̆ 7, and Tobenna 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model.</b> Rudi-Shindu 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>model</b> needs iteration in the calculation.

Analysis was conducted to examine the feasibility of using Rudi-Shindu 2 ̆ 7 s, Hopkins 2 ̆ 7, and Tobenna 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>models.</b> The result showed that Hopkins 2 ̆ 7 model is limited by cutting size and revolution per minute (RPM).

The alternate use of two or more languages in a single discourse is known as the phenomenon of code-switching. The purpose of the study is to examine the patterns of code-switching in written texts of Bangladeshis. The different functions and reasons for code-switching are investigated. The data is analyzed from a structural and functional perspective. An integrated <b>model</b> of Poplack <b>s</b> (1980) CS <b>model,</b> Muysken <b>s</b> (2000) intra-sentential CS <b>model</b> and Myers-Scotton <b>s</b> (1993) markedness <b>model</b> is used to observe the patterns of CS behavior of interlocutors on Facebook profile pages in Bangladesh. The integrated model helps to cover more diversified CS behavior of bilinguals in a CMC mode. Inspite of typological differences between Bangla and English, this study finds instances of congruent lexicalization in CS behavior. The Study finds from data analysis that Muysken <b>s</b> <b>model</b> better explains intra-sentential CS than intra-sentential CS category of Poplack <b>s</b> <b>model.</b> But Poplack <b>s</b> <b>model</b> captures some aspects of CS, i. e. inter-sentential and tag CS, which can not be explored by Muysken <b>s</b> <b>model.</b> Further- more, the addition of markedness model (Myers-Scotton 1993) enriches the observation of the dominance of Bangla and English among interlocutors.

40|$|Descriptions of soil {{hydraulic}} properties, such as {{the soil}} moisture retention curve, θ (h), and saturated hydraulic conductivities, K s, are a prerequisite for hydrological models. Since the measurement of K s is expensive, it is frequently derived from statistical pedotransfer functions (PTFs). Because it is usually more difficult to describe K s than θ (h) from pedotransfer functions, Pollacco et al.  (2013) developed a physical unimodal model to compute K s solely from hydraulic parameters derived from the Kosugi θ (h). This unimodal K <b>s</b> <b>model,</b> {{which is based on}} a unimodal Kosugi soil pore-size distribution, was developed by combining the approach of Hagen–Poiseuille with Darcy's law and by introducing three tortuosity parameters. We report here on (1)  the suitability of the Pollacco unimodal K <b>s</b> <b>model</b> to predict K s for a range of New Zealand soils from the New Zealand soil database (S-map) and (2)  further adaptations to this model to adapt it to dual-porosity structured soils by computing the soil water flux through a continuous function of an improved bimodal pore-size distribution. The improved bimodal K <b>s</b> <b>model</b> was tested with a New Zealand data set derived from historical measurements of K s and θ (h) for a range of soils derived from sandstone and siltstone. The K s data were collected using a small core size of 10  cm diameter, causing large uncertainty in replicate measurements. Predictions of K s were further improved by distinguishing topsoils from subsoil. Nevertheless, as expected, stratifying the data with soil texture only slightly improved the predictions of the physical K <b>s</b> <b>models</b> because the K <b>s</b> <b>model</b> is based on pore-size distribution and the calibrated parameters were obtained within the physically feasible range. The improvements made to the unimodal K <b>s</b> <b>model</b> by using the new bimodal K <b>s</b> <b>model</b> are modest when compared to the unimodal model, which is explained by the poor accuracy of measured total porosity. Nevertheless, the new bimodal model provides an acceptable fit to the observed data. The study highlights the importance of improving K s measurements with larger cores...|$|R
