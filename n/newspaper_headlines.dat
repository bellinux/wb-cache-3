5|$|The {{disaster}} received nationwide {{coverage in}} the days following, sharing headlines with Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic crossing (though Lindbergh's crossing received much more attention) and eliciting a national outpouring of grief. <b>Newspaper</b> <b>headlines</b> from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles characterized Kehoe as a maniac, madman, and fiend.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by London-based group Shynola and released in 2003. The chaotic, surreal video {{was inspired by the}} collage style of old punk fliers. It features footage of the band, animated <b>newspaper</b> <b>headlines,</b> scrapbook paraphernalia, and scenes of military conflicts. Pitchfork listed the video as the 27th best music video of the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|The event made <b>newspaper</b> <b>headlines</b> in Jamaica and {{was also}} the subject of {{reporting}} in both the United Kingdom and the United States. While voices on social media accused Jones of provoking his killers by cross-dressing in public, the murder was condemned by Jamaican educators and the country's Justice Minister. In {{the wake of the}} attack, both domestic and international organisations devoted to LGBT rights and human rights – among them Human Rights Watch, Jamaicans for Justice, and the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays – asked the Jamaican authorities for a proper investigation and legal recognition of LGBT rights on the island.|$|E

5|$|One famous {{demonstration}} of Dunstan's charismatic style and media savvy came in January 1976. A psychic predicted that, due to Dunstan and the state's social liberalisation—which {{he saw as}} sinful—God would destroy Adelaide with a tsunami caused by an earthquake. This was publicised by the media, prompting a not insignificant number of residents to sell their property and leave; some businesses had clearance sales while many who decided to stay indulged in doomsday parties. Dunstan promised {{to stand on the}} seashore at Glenelg and wait for the imminent destruction. He did so on 20 January, the day of the predicted storm, and nothing happened, although he made <b>newspaper</b> <b>headlines</b> in the United Kingdom for his defiance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Newspaper</b> <b>headlines</b> in most World Cup nations trumpeted the {{shocking}} upset, except ironically in the United States and England. There {{was only one}} American journalist at the World Cup: Dent McSkimming of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; he could not persuade the newspaper {{to pay for the}} trip, and had taken time off work to cover the event. His report of the match was the only one to appear in any major American newspaper. In England, newspapers at the time were generally small, and only had a single page devoted to sports. Because the English cricket team happened to suffer their first-ever defeat by the West Indies the very same day, that was the major story in most publications. Legend has it that in publications that did report the World Cup match, so unexpected was the result that it was presumed that the 1–0 scoreline was a typing error and so it was reported that England had won on a scoreline of 10–0 or 10–1. However, historical newspapers online at The British Newspaper Archive show that the story is a myth.|$|E

Campbell had been named as starting captain for England in a friendly against the United States in May 2005 under Sven-Göran Eriksson, he was replaced with Zat Knight at half-time following an ankle injury.|$|E
25|$|In late December 1957, Tierney, {{from her}} mother's {{apartment}} in Manhattan, stepped onto a ledge 14 stories above ground and remained for about 20 minutes {{in what was}} considered a suicide attempt.

The following year, after treatment for depression, she was released. Afterwards, she worked as a sales girl in a local dress shop with hopes of integrating back into society, but she was recognized by a customer, resulting in sensational <b>newspaper</b> <b>headlines.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{criminal}} gangs carried out {{large numbers of}} bank robberies in the Midwest. They used their superior firepower and fast getaway cars to elude local law enforcement agencies and avoid arrest. Many of these criminals frequently made <b>newspaper</b> <b>headlines</b> across the United States, particularly John Dillinger, who became famous for leaping over bank cages, and repeatedly escaping from jails and police traps. The gangsters enjoyed a level of sympathy in the Midwest, as banks and bankers were widely seen as oppressors of common people during the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|Display type {{refers to}} the use of type at large sizes, perhaps 30 points or larger. Some typefaces are {{considered}} useful solely at display sizes, and are known as display faces. Most effect typefaces are display types. Common features of display type include tighter default letter spacing, finer details and serifs, slightly more condensed letter shapes and larger differences between thick and thin strokes; many of these are most visible in serif designs. Many display typefaces in the past such as those intended for posters and <b>newspaper</b> <b>headlines</b> were also only cut in capitals, since it was assumed lower-case would not be needed, or at least with no italics. This was true of many early sans-serif fonts.|$|E
25|$|Authorities on {{each side}} work to keep out from the other that which is undesirable. For the United States, this mostly {{involves}} drugs and illegal immigrants. For Mexico, this mostly involves struggling against the importation of untaxed goods, especially automobiles. Smuggling people and drugs into the United States is big business in Mexico, but while it affects everyone living on the border, it is generally not seen, except for occasional <b>newspaper</b> <b>headlines,</b> occasional violent crime and religious articles geared {{to those in the}} trade. Illegal crossings taking place through tunnels, hidden cars and trucks or most commonly, simply passing through a gap in the fence, especially in the more remote areas. In 1990, a tunnel linking two warehouses in Agua Prieta and Douglas, AZ was discovered. It was sophisticated with hydraulic equipment and means to move large quantities of goods. At least three corridos have been written about this tunnel.|$|E
25|$|As each {{character}} represents {{a single word}} (or, more precisely, a morpheme), many logograms are required to write all the words of language. The vast array of logograms and the memorization of what they mean are major disadvantages of logographic systems over alphabetic systems. However, since the meaning is inherent to the symbol, the same logographic system can theoretically be used to represent different languages. In practice, {{the ability to communicate}} across languages only works for the closely related varieties of Chinese, as differences in syntax reduce the crosslinguistic portability of a given logographic system. Japanese uses Chinese logograms extensively in its writing systems, with most of the symbols carrying the same or similar meanings. However, the grammatical differences between Japanese and Chinese are significant enough that a long Chinese text is not readily understandable to a Japanese reader without any knowledge of basic Chinese grammar, though short and concise phrases such as those on signs and <b>newspaper</b> <b>headlines</b> are much easier to comprehend.|$|E
