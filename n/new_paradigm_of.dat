25|$|Even though Gadamer's {{interpretation}} of Heidegger has been questioned, {{there is little}} doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a gestalt formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> thinking, and the hermeneutic circle offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.|$|E

Marrett's student at Oxford University, {{as well as}} John Layard on Malakula, Vanuatu (1914–15), and to have Bronislaw Malinowski stationed in Mailu and later the Trobriand Islands during WWI.

500|$|In {{the second}} half of the book, Smith states that the advent of the atomic bomb {{rendered}} industrial warfare obsolete, but that governments clung to the concept throughout the Cold War era—the Cold War itself being the last act of the old-style industrial war. [...] The belief in industrial war tactics and institutions continued into the post-Cold War era, and Smith believes that political and military leaders refused to acknowledge the <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> [...] "war amongst the people", which resulted in significant defeats, such as for France in Algeria, the United States in Vietnam, and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and caused problems for NATO operations in the Balkans, and later for the Western coalitions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Smith also notes that, in the new paradigm, soldiers are frequently being asked to undertake new tasks—such as humanitarian operations—while still equipped and trained for old-paradigm conflicts between massed armies.|$|E
500|$|Sir Adam Roberts, {{professor}} of international relations at the University of Oxford, was more critical in reviewing The Utility of Force for The Independent. Roberts believed that Smith over-stated the transformation into the <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> war by playing down {{the extent to which}} there have always been wars amongst the people, over-emphasised the role of technology in the shift from industrial warfare, and downplayed the continuation of industrial war. By way of example, Roberts points to the Iran–Iraq War and the role of precision bombing used by the United States in its campaigns {{since the end of the}} 20th century. In conclusion, Roberts states that [...] "it is possible to quibble over many details", but that [...] "such quibbles miss the essential point of the book: that involvement in today's crises, in the attempt to stop atrocities and bring wars to an end, requires a capacity for clear thought, a sensitivity to situation, and a talent for acting, that armed forces and their officers have not always possessed – and now badly need".|$|E

500|$|The book {{opens with}} the {{statement}} that [...] "war no longer exists"; that is, war as [...] "battle in a field between men and machinery" [...] or [...] "a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs" [...] is unlikely to happen again. The premise of the book is that the world is experiencing a <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> war in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, which Smith dubs [...] "war amongst the people", in which nebulous, open-ended conflicts have become the norm. Smith believes that Western, industrialised armies struggle to win in [...] "wars amongst the people" [...] because their opponents are not uniformed armies. He uses the term [...] "rhizomatic" [...] to describe terrorist and guerrilla movements; he states his belief that such fighters can adapt much more easily than state institutions, and that they exhibit a greater understanding of the utility of force. Rather than being part of a recognisable army, the fighters are part of the civilian population, and their objectives are more political than military—they seek to [...] "win hearts and minds" [...] rather than take or hold territory. As a consequence, wars are no longer confined to a battlefield, but the theatre of operations is fluid, and commanders now operate inside the theatre.|$|E
500|$|Smith's thesis, and {{the central}} theme of The Utility of Force, {{is that the world}} entered a <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> {{conflict}} {{at the end of the}} 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries, which he calls [...] "war amongst the people", and that Western, industrialised armies are ill-suited to the new style of warfare. The defining characteristics of [...] "war amongst the people" [...] are that conflicts tend to be timeless, more political in nature, and fought between parties that are part of, and in amongst, the civilian population rather than between uniformed armies on a battlefield. To prove his theory, Smith provides a detailed history starting with Napoleon, who invented what Smith calls [...] "industrial warfare"—the paradigm in which the entire resources of the nation were mustered and which culminated in the two world wars. In the second half of the book, Smith states that the advent of nuclear weapons rendered industrial warfare obsolete, but that Western governments and generals refused to acknowledge the new paradigm, which led to several significant defeats in the second half of the 20th century. He provides six themes which characterise modern conflicts and proceeds to analyse each in detail, before dedicating his final chapter to his reflections on his command in Bosnia. He concedes that he did not foresee the Srebenica massacre, but criticises UNPROFOR, believing that it was not in a position to act even had the massacre been foreseen and that it had no strategy for effectively intervening in the war. In his conclusion, Smith argues that military force is only part of the solution in modern conflicts, and that it must be combined with political initiatives which together will subdue but not necessarily end the conflict.|$|E

Ronald Logan, author of „ A <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> Development“ remembers it’s readers that even though auto and air traffic enables us to travel at increasing speeds, bringing great convenience to travelers and commuters, it also brings air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion, accidental deaths, allienation from nature, etc.|$|E

Therefore, these services are [...] often implicitly enforced by the regulator through the license agreements. Another advantage is the standardization that results from such a centralized approach. Such standardization is critical in networked industries, for which [...] the telecommunication industry is a text-book example.
