40|$|Abstract: Application of the {{extended}} Grunwald-Winstein equation to solvolyses of <b>n-propyl</b> <b>chloroformate</b> {{in a variety of}} pure and binary solvents indicates an addition-elimination pathway in the majority of the solvents but an ionization pathway in the solvents of highest ionizing power and lowest nucleophilicity. For methanolysis, a solvent deuterium isotope effect of 2. 17 is compatible with the incorporation of general-base catalysis into the substitution process. Activation parameters are consistent with the duality of mechanism. Very modest positive salt effects are observed on adding chloride or bromide salts to the ethanolysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} {{rates of}} solvolysis of neopentyl chloroformate (1) have been determined in 21 pure and binary solvents at 45. 0 °C. In most solvents the values are essentially {{identical to those}} for ethyl and n-propyl chloroformates. However, in aqueous- 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 -hexafluoro- 2 -propanol mixtures (HFIP) rich in fluoroalcohol, 1 solvolyses appreciably faster {{than the other two}} substrates. Linear free energy relationship (LFER) comparison of the specific rates of solvolysis of 1 with those for phenyl chloroformate and those for <b>n-propyl</b> <b>chloroformate</b> are helpful in the mechanistic considerations, as is also the treatment in terms of the Extended Grunwald-Winstein equation. It is proposed that the faster reaction for 1 in HFIP rich solvents is due to the influence of a 1, 2 -methyl shift, leading to a tertiary alkyl cation, outweighing the only weak nucleophilic solvation of the cation possible in these low nucleophilicity solvents...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the nature of the {{reactions}} of <b>n-propyl</b> and benzyl <b>chloroformates</b> with tetra-n-butylammonium nitrate in actonitrile as a reaction medium. A thermodynamic investigation associated with the enthalpy of formation and vaporization of these chloroformates has also been undertaken. The reaction kinetics were determined at various concentrations of chloroformates and tetra-n-butyl-ammonium nitrate at different temperatures. The reactions have been found to be second-order and to follow pseudo-first-order rate coefficients proportional to the nitrate ion concentration. The changes in entropies, deltaS +/-, ranged from - 59. 5 for n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl to - 14. 5 J mol- 1 deg- 1 for C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOCl, which indicates that the reaction proceeded by a bimolecular SN 2 mechanism. The studies give evidence that the rate-determining step is the initial reaction between the chloroformates and NO- 3 to give nitratocarbonate via a tetrahedral intermediate. The expected products, nitrate ester and carbon dioxide, are obtained in maximum yields of 18 - 20 % and 61 % respectively. Addition of pyridine or tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate, has little effect on the yield of nitrate ester product. The tetra-n-butylammonium chloride product is more reactive towards both <b>n-propyl</b> and benzyl <b>chloroformates</b> than the corresponding nitrate. The enthalpies of solution of <b>n-propyl</b> and benzyl <b>chloroformates</b> in sodium hydroxide (1 mol dm - 3) have been measured over a range of concentrations at 298. 15 K, using a solution reaction calorimeter. The variation with the concentration of the enthalpy of hydrolysis was not significant over the concentration ranges studied deltaHthetaf (C 3 H 7 OCOCl, 1) = - 524. 396 +/- 0. 767 kj mol- 1 for 5791 <n < 19593 and deltaHtheta(C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOCl, 1) = - 375. 244 +/- 1. 088 kJ mol- 1 for 36804 < n < 52495. Enthalpies of vaporization have been obtained from measurements of vapour pressure over the temperature range 293. 13 to 306. 30 K, deltaHthetav (n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl, 298. 15 K) = 40. 676 +/- 0. 450, and 293. 770 to 302. 34 K, deltaHthetav (C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOC 1, 298. 15 K) = 38. 527 +/- 0. 1 10 Kj mol - 1. Enthalpies of vaporization were also obtained using a vaporization calorimeter, giving deltaHthetav (n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl, 298. 15 K) = 40. 742 + 0. 403 kj mol - 1. These values of deltaHthetav, obtained from the vapour pressure measurements, are combined with the enthalpies of formation of deltaHthetaf (1) values to give enthalpies of formation in the gaseous state at 298. 15 K viz., deltaHthetaf (n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl, g) = - 483. 720 +/- 0. 864 kj mol deltaHthetaf (C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOCl, g) = - 336. 717 + 1. 094 kJ mol<p...|$|R
