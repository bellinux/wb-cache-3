5000|$|After the February 1966 {{military}} coup, the {{new leaders}} wanted {{to remove the}} face of Nkrumah from the banknotes. The [...] "new cedi" [...] (1967-2007) was worth 1.2 cedi which made it equal to half of a pound sterling at its introduction. After decades of high inflation had devalued the <b>new</b> <b>cedi,</b> it was gradually phased out in 2007 {{in favor of the}} [...] "Ghana cedi" [...] at an exchange rate of 1:10,000. In 2007 the largest of the <b>new</b> <b>cedi</b> banknotes, the 20,000 note, had a value of about US$2. By removing four digits, the Ghana cedi became the highest-denominated currency unit issued in Africa. It has since lost about 75% of its value.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the rampant {{inflation}} {{in the decades}} before the exchange the second cedi was only worth {{a small fraction of}} its original value. The government decided to [...] "cut" [...] four zeros off the currency by the switch to the third cedi. The new currency was not introduced as the third cedi but is instead officially called the Ghanaian Cedi, in contrast to the second cedi that was officially known as the <b>New</b> <b>Cedi.</b> In the second half of 2007 both the second and third cedi were legal tender as the old currency were being gradually withdrawn. At the end of December 2007 more than 90% of all old coins and notes had been withdrawn. From January 2008 old banknotes could only be exchanged at banks and was no longer legal tender.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{characteristics}} of extremely hot and dry summers in Central Europe {{as well as their}} preceding winter - spring transition seasons are analysed with the aim of identifying potential precursor of extreme summers. Therefor large scale atmospheric circulation regimes and land surface - atmosphere interactions are analysed and discussed in an integrated manner. The analysis is based on in situ as well as satellite based remote sensing observations and re-analysis data. In this thesis extremely hot and dry summers are defined by using solar irradiation in combination with precipitation as a central proxy. The extreme summer seasons (June, July, August - JJA) with regard to solar irradiation excess and precipitation deficit are analysed together with their preceding winter - spring transition season (February, March, April - FMA) in the study area 47 째N - 56 째N; 4 째E - 15 째E (Germany and adjacent areas). The analysis is based on the regional mean accumulated monthly means of FMA and JJA of solar irradiation and precipitation over the study area, {{as well as on the}} seasonal anomaly of geopotential in 850 hPa over the North Atlantic and Europe. The findings of other authors for southern Europe and southeastern Europe could be supported: for the extreme events, a dominance of anticyclonic circulation regimes and the associated excess of solar irradiation and lack of precipitation (compared to the long term average values) is observed also in Central Europe. Two out of three of the most extreme sunny and dry summer seasons in Central Europe in the time period 1958 - 2011 were preconditioned in the preceding FMA seasons with highly extreme positive anomalies in solar irradiation and highly extreme negative anomalies in precipitation amount. For the same years, a preconditioning in the preceding winter - spring transition seasons could be identified in the large-scale atmospheric circulation: a dipole in the atmospheric pressure (geopotential at 850 hPa) was found with a center of negative anomaly over southern Greenland and a center of positive anomaly over the North Sea and Fennoscandia. As a measure of the strength of this dipole, the novel Greenland - North Sea - Dipole - Index (GNDI) is introduced. In the majority of the years with highly extreme sunny and dry summers, the GNDI of the prior FMA season exceeds a value of 20. No interlink could be found between NAO / AO and extreme summers. One of the summers identified as being extremely sunny and dry was not preconditioned. However, in the winter prior to this summer an extremely strong El Nino event occurred. On the other hand, a year with an anomalously sunny and dry FMA season (precondition) occurred, which was followed by a rather wet summer with close to normal solar irradiation. In the preceding winter to that summer an extremely strong La Nina event was observed. This leads to the conclusion that extremely strong ENSO events can affect European climate on the seasonal scale: strong El Nino events can trigger extreme summers. Strong La Nina events can induce signals that have the potential to disturb the connection between a sunny and dry FMA season and the following summer. In the context of extremely hot and dry summers in Central Europe, the results of this thesis indicate that: - In addition to the dominance of anticyclonic systems in the atmospheric circulation and the land surface - atmosphere interactions, ENSO is another important driver of the development of extreme summers in Central Europe. - ENSO-induced effects have the potential to disturb the interlink between the FMA season and the following summer concerning the interplay of atmospheric circulation and land surface - atmosphere interactions, which are responsible for the development of extremely hot and dry summers in Central Europe. These findings are brought together in the newly defined Central European Drought Index (CEDI). Using the CEDI all extremely hot and dry summers of the upper 10 th percentile and one extreme summer of the upper 20 th percentile in central Europe can be hindcast correctly. The results of this thesis contribute to a better understanding of the development of extreme summers in Central Europe and are thus a valuable contribution to the improvement of summer seasonal forecast for this region. The <b>new</b> <b>CEDI</b> is expected to have the potential to contribute to the development of an early warning system for extremely hot and dry summers...|$|E
40|$|Ghana (West Africa) {{underwent}} a currency change in July 2007. This paper explores the {{adaptation to the}} <b>New</b> Ghana <b>Cedi</b> one year post-redenomination using the theoretical framework of the Money Illusion Effect and the relearning-rescaling hypotheses. Study 1 revealed that {{the old and new}} currencies appeared to be valued similarly, based on the ratings of gains and losses in the old and new currencies. This result is consistent with the slogan of the Ghanaian redenomination public education campaign and suggests that people can be inoculated against the Money Illusion Effect through education. In study 2, attributes of the new currency were rated more positively than those of the old currency, suggesting a preference for the <b>New</b> Ghana <b>Cedi.</b> Ghana Africa Money Illusion Effect Currency change Adaptation...|$|R
