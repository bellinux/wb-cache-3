500|$|In March 2006, Liukin placed {{first in}} the {{all-around}} at the American Cup. At the 2006 Pacific Alliance Championships, Liukin tied with teammate Memmel for {{first in the}} all-around, won the uneven bars title and a silver medal on beam, {{and contributed to the}} U.S. team's gold-medal performance. She competed at the 2006 U.S. Classic as the defending all-around champion, but falls on the uneven bars and floor resulted in a fourth-place finish. However, she scored extremely well on the balance beam and was the only competitor in the meet, junior or senior, to earn a score over 16.00 on this event. After that when she was interviewed on ABC television show Dancing with the stars, she said,"After that, I realized that it's <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> winning. It's about the journey." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks {{about someone who}} has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as [...] "so yesterday". According to Duff, the song's lyrics are very {{empowering}} towards breaking up with someone and getting over it. In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that [...] "So Yesterday" [...] was [...] "the ultimate post-breakup anthem". She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. [...] "I don't think there's very much of that out there anymore.", she said. She {{stressed the importance of}} strong songs that are <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> how [...] "a boy broke your heart and you're never going to get on your feet again", saying it was good for girls to hear.|$|E

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{academic literature}} about trade agreements maintains {{that they are}} only about national terms-of-trade manipulation and <b>not</b> at <b>all</b> <b>about</b> purely political concerns. Non-academic economists, commentators, and diplomats by contrast think that trade agreements are <b>all</b> <b>about</b> political concerns. There are two substantive and important distinctions between the two views. i Practitioners maintain that policymakers care virtually <b>not</b> at <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the terms of trade or about trade-tax revenue. ii Practitioners, unlike academics, maintain that trade-agreement negotiations themselves change the underlying political economy. Observation of actual trade policy measures, though not conclusive, suggests that the practitioners are right and that the academics are wrong...|$|R

500|$|The cold opening {{references}} several notable {{bands and}} musicians: the scene consists of Ryan complaining because he recently heard—erroneously—that notable musician Smokey Robinson died. Initially, Ryan refers {{to him as}} only [...] "Smokey", which causes Pam to believe {{he is talking about}} Smokey the Bear. However, Ryan, on the bequest of Pam, is only able to name one song that Robinson sung, [...] "The Tracks of My Tears". Pam, however, is later able to remember that he sang [...] "Tears of a Clown", and Jim references [...] "I Second That Emotion". After Jim proves that Robinson is both still alive and playing at a local venue, Ryan tells him that he will be unable to attend because the opening band is Paul Anka, and that is [...] "not what Smokey would have… does want!" [...] During his pontificating rant, Ryan mentions that popular music is <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Jason Mraz and The Beatles", which shocks Dwight. Dwight lists of [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] and [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] and asks Ryan if he truly does not like those songs.|$|E
500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where I see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E
500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and called it [...] "a {{wonderful}} film." [...] The Hollywood Reporter lauded the film as [...] "Winsome, touching and arguably the funniest Pixar effort ever, this gorgeously rendered, high-flying adventure is a tidy 90-minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it." [...] Although the San Francisco Chronicle noted that the film [...] "contains many boring stretches of mindless freneticism and bland character interaction," [...] it also declared that there are scenes in Up of [...] "such beauty, economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments...to watch Up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout ..." [...] Variety enthused that [...] "Up is an exceptionally refined picture; unlike so many animated films, it's <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> sensory bombardment and volume...Unsurprisingly, no one puts a foot wrong here. Vocal performances...exude a warm enthusiasm, and tech specifications could not be better. Michel Giacchino's full-bodied, traditional score is superlative..." [...] The Globe and Mail stated that Up is [...] "the kind of movie that leaves you asking 'How do people {{come up with this}} stuff?'" [...] along with an overall positive review on the film, despite it being predictable.|$|E

2500|$|The {{condition}} of the salmon deteriorates the longer they remain in fresh water. Once the salmon have spawned, most of them deteriorate rapidly and die. This programmed senescence is [...] "characterized by immunosuppression and organ deterioration." [...] The Pacific salmon is the classic example of a semelparous animal. It lives {{for many years in}} the ocean before swimming to the freshwater stream of its birth, spawning, and then dying. Semelparous animals spawn once only in their lifetime. Semelparity is sometimes called [...] "big bang" [...] reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large and fatal to the spawners. Most Atlantic salmon also die after spawning, but <b>not</b> <b>all.</b> <b>About</b> 5 to 10%, mostly female, return to the ocean where they can recover and spawn again.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{second album}} The Reason was {{released}} in December 2003. The single Out of Control was made available for download on the band's website. Doug Robb said on the band's website: [...] "A {{lot of it is}} about asking questions or questioning all that people see. It's <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> religion. 'Out of Control' is about that and about opening your eyes after being blinded by being devoted to anything." [...] "Same Direction" [...] would reach No.9 on the US Modern Rock chart, No.16 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No.16 on a composite World Modern Rock chart (based on the US, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Australia). A year later, the Let It Out DVD collected the band's videos. [...] "The Reason" [...] was put to a popular music video on Tangle.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{motivation}}s, Ringer responded [...] "Honestly, my number-one motivation is my family". While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, I {{grew up in the}} church, I have a very religious family. I’m <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I never look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E

For {{the following}} 6 months, Jarrett did not appear on TNA television, instead focusing on his role as Vice President of TNA Entertainment. Jarrett, however, temporarily returned to TNA television on the April 12, 2007 episode of Impact!, and aligned himself with Samoa Joe, by helping him defeat A.J. Styles, turning face. On April 15, 2007 at Lockdown, Jarrett, making his in-ring return, and the rest of Team Angle defeated Team Cage in a Lethal Lockdown match. [...] The following episode of Impact!, he delivered his first promo in months, stating it's <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Jeff Jarrett and he returned to give back to the wrestlers and fans, officially completing his face turn. [...] He then entered into a feud with Robert Roode, losing a match to him at Sacrifice. Jarrett was then scheduled to take on Styles with the winner to earn a spot in the King of the Mountain match but could not compete due to [...] "personal issues".
