[...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time <b>Nas</b> <b>did</b> Illmatic, <b>it</b> made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|R

This present article describes the project’s definitions of the quality and the structure of the compilation process used in the NA estimates. The article examines the project results for the compilation process of the NA (in current prices) for the year 2000, which are consistent with the 2002 editions of the ONS Blue Book and the United Kingdom Input – Output Analyses...|$|R

The general plan was simply to replace a part of the NaC 1 in Ringer's solution by NH 4 CI and to compare the composition of a muscle after immersion in this solution with the composition of its mate immersed under similar conditions in Ringer's solution. A few {{experiments were}} tried with other frog tissues, especially liver. The results have shown some tendency for the NHs to become concentrated in the muscles like K, but the inside-to-outside concentration ratios are very different for the two cations.
