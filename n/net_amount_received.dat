40|$|The {{purpose of}} this lesson is to use CERES {{radiation}} data to understand seasonal variations {{in the pattern of}} net energy input to the Earth system. The students will begin to understand how Earth's tilt causes seasonal differences in incoming solar energy. They will use the Live Access Server to investigate the Earth's radiation budget and map locations using latitude and longitude coordinates. Studentw will gain an understanding of how features of the Earth system, such as clouds and deserts, modulate the reflection of energy from the Sun.

40|$|Hedging {{can be a}} {{valuable}} tool to minimize price uncertainty for producers. There {{are two types of}} hedges producers may use, a short hedge and a long hedge. Short hedges are used to lock in a net selling price when prices are expected to fall, while a long hedge is used to lock in a buying price when prices are expected to rise for a commodity that is bought and used as an input. A short hedge is initiated by selling a contract on the futures market. The contract is generally bought back close to the time the contracted commodity is sold in the cash market. If the futures contract value decreases, money is made on the transaction. If the futures contract increases in value as time passes, money is lost on the transaction. The resulting gain/loss on the futures contract transactions offset changes in the cash market due to price changes for the commodity, resulting in the <b>net</b> <b>amount</b> paid or <b>received</b> being close to the expected price. The reason this works in deferring risk is that movements in the cash price generally reflect the futures price, with the difference defined as the basis. If basis behaves in a normal way, the actual payoff or net price received will be the same as the expected price. A long hedge is the reciprocal of the short hedge. A long hedge is initiated to protect the producer from the expectation of rising costs...|$|R

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact {{on state and}} local governments: This measure contains features which could result in both cost increases and savings {{to state and local}} governments. If the measure reduces liability and results in smaller or fewer awards against such entities savings could occur by virtue of reduced court costs, fewer awards and/or a reduction in the amount of such awards. On the other hand, additional costs could be incurred, as for example, when injured parties place greater reliance on governmental programs such as medical or other social service programs. However, based on information available, the fiscal magnitude of these changes and their net fiscal impact cannot be estimated. Therefore, the net fiscal impact on state and local governments is unknown...|$|R
