5|$|The {{proposal}} {{to build a}} wind farm, in {{a joint venture between}} United Utilities and Peel Holdings, was announced in 2003. Shortly afterwards a pressure group, The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt, and would adversely affect common land, open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed development would be out of scale with the landscape, adversely affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The second {{public inquiry}} was {{initially}} scheduled for March 2009, but was postponed {{at the request}} of DBJRG, who had not then had sufficient time to review new noise data supplied by RES. The inquiry took place between July and October 2009, with the appeal being opposed by WDBC, DBJRG, and the Campaign to Protect Rural England. The appeal was once again allowed in December 2009. A number of planning conditions were attached by the inspector, aimed at reducing the likelihood of <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance.</b>|$|E
25|$|When runway {{alternation}} was introduced, aircraft generated {{significantly more}} noise on departure than when landing, so {{a preference for}} westerly operations during daylight was introduced, which continues to this day. In this mode, aircraft depart towards the west and approach from the east over London, thereby minimising the impact of noise on the most densely populated areas. Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby arriving aircraft are allocated to one runway and departing aircraft to the other. To further reduce <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance</b> to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the departure runway due to {{the legacy of the}} now rescinded Cranford Agreement, pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.|$|E

500|$|In 1995 the Government of {{the state}} of Victoria {{published}} a report on problems caused by long-billed corellas, sulphur-crested cockatoos and galahs, three species which, along with the little corella, have large and growing populations, having benefited from anthropogenic changes to the landscape. Subsequent to the findings and publication of the report, these three species were declared unprotected by a Governor in Council Order under certain conditions and are allowed to be destroyed where serious damage is being caused by them to trees, vineyards, orchards, recreational reserves and commercial crops. [...] Damage covered by the report included not only that to cereal crops, fruit and nut orchards and some kinds of vegetable crops but also to houses and communications equipment. The little corella is a declared pest of agriculture in Western Australia, where it is an aviculturally introduced species. The birds damage sorghum, maize, sunflower, chickpeas and other crops. They also defoliate amenity trees in parks and gardens, dig for edible roots and corms on sports grounds and race tracks, as well as chew wiring and household fittings. In South Australia, where flocks can number several thousand birds and the species is listed as unprotected, they are accused of defoliating red gums and other native or ornamental trees used for roosting, damaging tarpaulins on grain bunkers, wiring and flashing on buildings, taking grain from newly seeded paddocks and creating a <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Another {{feature of}} ASHP {{external}} heat exchangers is {{their need to}} stop the fan {{from time to time}} for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the heating mode. After that, the heat pump starts to work again. This part of the work cycle results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan.

2500|$|Legal {{action against}} the park {{by a group of}} seven Milsons Point {{residents}} and one developer began again in April 2005. The claim was of <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance</b> from the amusement rides, particularly those in Maloney's Corner. The case was defeated when legislation was passed by the New South Wales government protecting Luna Park from such claims, although it was later revealed that these laws may have been influenced by court documents leaked to then-Tourism, Sport, and Recreation minister Sandra Nori by two Luna Park executives. The executives were charged with contempt of court in August 2007. A new case began in June 2007, with the residents instead claiming breaches of the Trade Practices Act. Stating that they had been misled as to the types of amusement ride that were located in the Maloney's Corner area, the residents and developer attempted to claim over $20 million in damages, and demanded the relocation or permanent closure of the Ranger and Spider rides. The case was dismissed by the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 6 February 2009, with the supervising Justice ruling that the development applications submitted by the park had not been [...] "misleading or deceptive", as claimed.|$|E

40|$|Best Paper Award in Airline, Airport Operations & Weather & Env. Track, atorgat per Eurocontrol/FAA (2006 - 06 - 28) In {{this work}} it is {{presented}} a framework for a global optimization tool that will take into account air craft dynamics and performances, <b>noise</b> <b>nuisances</b> and RNAV radionavigation requirements {{in order to assess}} an optimum flight depart or approach procedure. This strategy would be used as an optimization process performed by the corresponding authority in charge of the air traffic management of the involved airport or by an on-board optimization algorithm integrated in the Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS). In both cases, the optimization framework is the same and the differences reside in the specific implementation of the optimization algorithms and the availability of the data in real time. In addition, aircraft's dynamic equations are developed in order to compute the flight trajectory from a set of flight guidance control variables and a first glance into a noise optimization criterion is given. Finally, the global optimization problem is properly formulated and the proposed solving utilities are presented. Peer ReviewedAward-winnin...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{aggravating}} antisocial behaviour (ASB) or the {{neighbourhood problem}} in housing, many western governments have given ASB control a central {{place in their}} policy agendas. However, tackling ASB often involves {{a great deal of}} politics. Although ASB and controlling it have attracted much scholarly attention, the focus has almost always been placed on social housing. It is unclear whether this problem does not exist in other types of housing or if it is simply ignored. Drawing on a study of private housing developments in Hong Kong, this article examines the extent and seriousness of ASB as a problem in private housing. It shows that the problem does raise wide concerns among residents, and that many residents complain about <b>noise</b> <b>nuisances</b> and littering in their living places. On the other hand, most residents feel that the efforts of housing management agents in countering the problem are in vain or inadequate. In fact, when reacting to ASB, housing managers inevitably face a number of issues that originate from the joint appointment of managers by all homeowners and the lack of enforcement powers. In particular, controlling some neighbourhood nuisances is difficult and costly. This article concludes with an agenda for empirical research to explain the proliferation of ASB from the transaction-cost perspective...|$|R
40|$|Squealing {{is a major}} {{matter of}} concern for {{environmental}} issues and the raised expectations for superior performances in braking systems. Squealing, {{as well as other}} types of <b>noise</b> <b>nuisances,</b> contributes to <b>noise</b> pollution and leads to additional expenses for phonic isolation. Brake squeal noise, which is defined as noise at frequency higher than 1000 Hz, occurs if the system has very high amplitude of mechanical vibration with sound pressure level above 80 dB. It involves instable vibrations, which are quite well understood as a result of mode couplings between the rubbing parts. These mode couplings are allowed by modal frequency shifts induced by the changes of sliding contact conditions. Nonetheless, the origin of squeal occurrence remains misunderstood as many parameters have to be taken into account, making it virtually impossible to predict when a squeal noise will appear or disappear. The strong coupling between structure and material, the continual change of the materials surfaces (chemistry and morphology), the influence of external parameters (temperature, pressure, hygrometry) all play a role in squealing. As a consequence, research on squealing is empirical by nature. Following this, one of the main goals in braking sciences is to determine the set of conditions on the parameters that provoke the start or the end of a squealing noise...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{due to the}} {{environmental}} concerns and the increase of energy demand, wind power has strongly penetrated the field of electricity generation. Today, {{because of the lack}} of onshore sites and visual and <b>noise</b> <b>nuisances,</b> the development of wind farms turns more and more to offshore and Norway has a great potential of offshore wind power. 	This thesis investigates the impact of the integration of an offshore 1000 MW wind farm on the Norwegian power system. Two different transmissions are used, one HVAC transmission system and one HVDC transmission system. They are installed in four different configurations which represent the possible cases of wind farm integration regarding the distance from the shore. Two different connection points have been chosen regarding the load flow simulations. The first one is situated in the region of Bergen in the West Norway and the other one is situated between Kristiansand and Stavanger in the south Norway. 	In order to investigate the power stability and the behaviour of the system, simulations are performed under both steady-state and dynamic conditions by using PSSTME. Disturbances are applied in different locations on the system both near the connection point and on the offshore wind farm. The results show that the power system with large offshore wind power remains stable after the different faults. The requirements of the Norwegian Transmission System Operator, Statnett, are respected after the integration of a large offshore wind farm in the Norwegian power system. </p...|$|R
