After leaving town, US45 runs northward parallel to the Middle Branch of the Ontonagon River, and the highway crosses the river near a roadside park south of Rockland.

5|$|In the 1927 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways, Route 8 was defined to run along present-day Route 94 from Route 6 (current US 46) at the Delaware Bridge north to Columbia before turning northeast to Route 31 (now U.S. Route 206) in Newton. Past Newton, Route 31 continued northeast to the New York state line (current US 206 <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> was Route S31). In {{the original version}} of the renumbering bill, Route 31 was to reach the border via Sussex, incorporating pre-1927 Route 8 (now Route 284) from Sussex to the state line. However, in the final version, Route 31 ran via Hamburg, using the same alignment as a planned spur of pre-1927 Route 8 from Lafayette to North Church. Route 8 was eventually {{taken over by the}} state. On the other hand, by 1949, only one section of Route 31 north of the Route S31 split had been taken between North Church to Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|M-85 {{starts a}} {{directional}} interchange with I-75 in near Rockwood; traffic {{to or from}} southbound I-75 must use Gibraltar Road instead. M-85 runs north from this interchange to Gibraltar Road as a full freeway; north of that intersection the highway becomes a boulevard. There are many businesses directly adjacent to Fort Street in the Downriver area with residential subdivisions {{on either side of}} them. The trunkline parallels lines of the Norfolk Southern and Canadian National railways. In this area, M-85 is also running parallel to, but inland from, {{the southern part of the}} Detroit River. The highway runs northeasterly through Gibraltar to Trenton, where it turns due north. Fort Street forms the boundary between Riverview and Trenton in the area near the Riverview Landing Shopping Center between King and Silbey Roads; <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> Riverview extends along both sides of the road. At Pennsylvania Road, Fort Street crosses into the city of Southgate and curves to the northeast near the Southgate Tower office building. The highway returns to a due northerly course near Memorial Park and continues along the Southgate–Wyandotte city line. This area is mainly residential neighborhoods that extend in street grids on either side of the Fort Street boulevard.|$|E

The Devil's Path in the Greene County Catskills appears to the north on clear enough days. Some vineyards join the orchards along the road, reflecting a developing local wine industry. The campus of SUNY New Paltz starts to form a distinct skyline to the north, and to the east the ridgeline of Illinois Mountain complements the Shawangunks.|$|E
25|$|PA 33 {{begins at}} a trumpet {{interchange}} with I-78 in southern Northampton County. Just north of this interchange, the route crosses the Lehigh River on the Gene Hartzell Memorial Bridge. After this crossing, the highway briefly {{cuts through the}} southwestern tip {{of the city of}} Easton. PA 33 then bends to the north and shares interchanges with Freemansburg Avenue and William Penn Highway. <b>North</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> the highway intersects its former southern terminus, US 22, at a cloverleaf interchange.|$|E
25|$|Just {{inside of}} Horseheads, NY14 meets exit52 on the Southern Tier Expressway, {{carrying}} I-86 and NY17. <b>North</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> it follows Westinghouse Road {{through the village}} until it reaches a T-intersection with Main Street near an area known locally as the Holding Point. From here, the highway turns north to follow Watkins Road into the Catharine Creek valley and out of Horseheads. As NY14 heads through the less populated valley, it serves Pine Valley, a hamlet situated on the Catlin–Veteran town line, and Millport, a small village {{in the town of}} Veteran, before crossing into Schuyler County.|$|E

25|$|While I-481 {{continues}} northwest from North Syracuse as NY481, I-81 travels north through {{residential areas}} of gradually decreasing density. Just {{north of the}} junction with I-481 and NY481, the freeway passes east of the former Penn-Can Mall, the largest commercial parcel in the area. I-81's first junction north of Syracuse is {{in the town of}} Cicero, where it connects to NY31, another regionally important highway. <b>North</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> US11 begins to closely parallel I-81 once again, rejoining the highway's vicinity after following an erratic alignment through Syracuse. The two roads run across relatively flat and increasingly undeveloped land to Brewerton, a hamlet adjacent to where Oneida Lake empties into the Oneida River. While US11 runs through the community, I-81 bypasses it to the east, offering unobstructed views of the lake as it crosses the lake outlet and enters Oswego County.|$|E
25|$|North of Ruddington, {{and as far}} as Nottingham, {{sections}} of the GCML right of way are used by the Nottingham Express Transit (NET), Nottingham's second generation tramway. The first section is north from Ruddington Lane tram stop as far as the River Trent, used by the 2015-opened line 2 of NET. North of the river the Great Central route was eliminated by housing development in the 1970s, and the tramway uses a different route across the river and north to Nottingham railway station (the former Midland station). The GCML crossed above this on a bridge, and NET uses the same alignment to provide a tram stop at the station before transitioning back to the city streets. <b>North</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> the GCML route is blocked by the Victoria shopping centre, built {{on the site of the}} GCR's Nottingham station.|$|E
25|$|<b>North</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> at the Kraft Foods {{technical}} center, the Tappan Zee Bridge becomes visible. After {{crossing over}} the Thruway and I-87, here concurrent with I-287, and then intersecting with the four-lane NY119, where 119 splits {{off to the}} east, 9 becomes the busy main street of Tarrytown. Christ Episcopal Church, where Irving worshiped, is along the street. Many high quality restaurants and shops are along this main road. This downtown ends at the eastern terminus of NY448, where 9 slopes off to the left, downhill, and two signs indicate that 9 turns left, passing the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, another NHL. The road then enters Sleepy Hollow (formerly North Tarrytown), passing the visitors' center for Kykuit, the National Historic Landmark that was (and partially still is) the Rockefeller family's estate. Route 9 then passes the historic Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, which includes the resting place of Washington Irving and the setting for The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.|$|E

A set of criss-crossing ramps provide access between the collector and express lanes <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> {{referred to as}} [...] "The Basketweave". The highway passes beneath Bloor Street West but does not provide direct access. Instead, it provides ramps to parallel arterial roads; The East Mall and The West Mall run parallel with the freeway from Evans Avenue to Rathburn Road. A full interchange is provided shortly after with Burnhamthorpe Road, southwest of Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute. Across from the college, an offramp provides access from the southbound lanes to Holiday Drive and The West Mall.

Just past the town line, the highway connects to Finger Lakes Regional Airport and passes by a large field that hosts the annual Empire Farm Days exhibition every August. <b>North</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> is the hamlet of Seneca Falls, where the farmlands are replaced by densely populated residential blocks. The highway follows Ovid Street across the CayugaSeneca Canal to the village center, where it intersects US20 and NY5 at Fall Street.
