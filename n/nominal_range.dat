500|$|Until 1961 the {{lighthouse}} was administered as a shore station, and subsequently (after the resident population of Stroma had left) {{as a rock}} station. An electric lamp with a maximum power of 1.1 million cp was installed in 1972, utilising a sealed beam optic mounted on a gearless revolving pedestal. By this time the keepers and their families {{were the only people}} living on Stroma. A helicopter pad was installed to enable supplies and personnel to be flown in. In 1997 the station was converted to automatic operation, utilising a 250 watt metal halide lamp which rotates on a gearless pedestal. A lens system from Sule Skerry lighthouse was refitted in the Stroma lighthouse. The old air-driven fog horn was removed and replaced by an electric fog signal which is installed on the balcony of {{the lighthouse}}. The lighthouse station's power, which was formerly obtained from generators, is now provided by batteries which are charged at regular intervals.

For this reason, we have chosen to express distance in the <b>nominal</b> radio <b>range.</b> Moreover, we will treat node densities by the average node degree. The average node degree, c, is {{the average number of}} nodes per area covered by the <b>nominal</b> radio <b>range,</b> defined as ρπr 2, where ρ is the average node density and r is the <b>nominal</b> radio <b>range.</b> For Poisson distributed nodes in an infinitely large system, the average node degree equals the average expected number of neighbors of a node [19].|$|R

40|$|AbstractDifferential {{pressure}} sensors with silicon diaphragms provide a <b>nominal</b> measuring <b>range</b> of 10  mbar (1  kPa) at a measurement uncertainty of ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 − 3.

To integrate the overload protection at the wafer level, a micromechanical overload protection is needed. Such a micromechanical overload protection for differential {{pressure sensors}} can be produced from heat-treated glass. The functional principle limits the diaphragm deflection. Here, we demonstrate an overload capability reaching 50  bar (5  MPa) for a silicon diaphragm with a <b>nominal</b> measuring <b>range</b> of 10  mbar and a diaphragm thickness of 30  μm...|$|R
