2500|$|The Calusa caught most {{of their}} fish with nets. Nets were woven with a {{standard}} mesh size; nets with different mesh sizes were used seasonally to catch the most abundant and useful fish available. The Calusa made bone and shell gauges that they used in net weaving. Cultivated gourds were used as <b>net</b> <b>floats,</b> and sinkers and net weights were made from mollusk shells. The Calusa also used spears, hooks, and [...] to catch fish. Well-preserved <b>nets,</b> <b>net</b> <b>floats,</b> and hooks were found at Key Marco, in {{the territory of the}} neighboring Muspa tribe.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to find the determinants of the fixed and <b>floating</b> rate <b>debt</b> mix by using a comprehensive dataset of UK non financial firms. The UK provides a particularly valuable for empirical investigation since it has a large and sophisticated corporate sector. Additionally UK firms have become more exposed to different types of risk because of the increasing level of debts commitments, expanding to international operations. Lack of consensus of the economic effects of the fixed and <b>floating</b> rate <b>debt</b> mix decision {{as well as the}} limited research on this issue in the UK intrigued the author and led to this research into whether the UK evidence enhance the theories of capital structure. In this way the thesis contributes to the ongoing debate in the literature and provides a valuable additional case study. The thesis also contributes by giving insights into the determinants of the fixed and <b>floating</b> <b>debt</b> mix across firms {{over a period of time}} (1999 - 2004). One of the main contributions of this study is that the evidence presented suggests that the fixed and <b>floating</b> rate <b>debt</b> are heterogeneous when the determinants of the capital structure is examined. Also firms are mainly hedging when determining the <b>floating</b> rate <b>debt.</b> Firms considering foreign <b>debt</b> and <b>floating</b> rate <b>debt</b> are mainly using foreign currency derivatives to hedge their exchange rate risk. In undertaking this analysis, a systematic empirical approach is taken which employs essentially the econometric methodologies by using the panel data...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{discussion}} {{is the use of}} Interest Rate Derivatives by non-financial firms in the UK. The data of the non-financial firms is gathered from the information available in the financial statements. The objective {{of the study was to}} analyse how firms use <b>floating</b> rate <b>debts</b> or fixed rate debts to hedge their interest rate risk. It is found that bank debts for nonfinancial firms is set on a floating rate, firms with higher cash holdings choose to have more <b>floating</b> rate <b>debt,</b> firms with high leverage prefer to have fixed rate debts, firms manage the volatility in their earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) using <b>floating</b> rate <b>debts</b> and firms with credit ratings usually desire for a fixed rate debt. The findings for these independent variables is found to be consistent with existing literature. However, tests for the effects of firm size, short-term debt and long-term <b>debts</b> on the <b>floating</b> rate <b>debt</b> were futile since they did not yield statistically significant results...|$|R

An important fact is that until 1910, it consists solely of the funded debt held by the public. The <b>floating</b> <b>debts</b> and the internal (or administrative) debts are not considered. However, the resulting bias is negligible because the amounts {{of these kinds of}} debts are, in fact, quite low before 1910.|$|R

25|$|Before any {{concrete}} {{planning to}} regain solvency could be undertaken, an accurate {{accounting of the}} railroad's condition was required. The receivers' report, issued in June 1880, indicated total liabilities of US$145,494,005. Annual carrying charges were just over US$7.5 million, while net revenues were just under US$5.5 million.

50|$|Native Hawaiians made {{a number}} of items from wiliwili wood because of its low density, such as mouo (fishing <b>net</b> <b>floats),</b> ama (outrigger canoe floats, and {{extremely}} long papa hee nalu (surfboards) called olo. Olo, which averaged 18 ft, were exclusively ridden by alii (royalty). The wood was sometimes used for the waa (hull) of outrigger canoes intended to be used near-shore, for recreation, or for training. The shiny orange-red seeds were strung into lei.|$|R
2500|$|Three {{plans of}} {{reorganization}} were put forth {{before the end}} of 1880. The first came from the McCalmont faction; the second from a former vice president of the Reading; and the third from Franklin Gowen. The McCalmont plan would have given preferred protection to senior mortgage bond holders and also would have put a levy upon stockholders, US$15 per share, towards substantially paying down <b>floating</b> <b>debt.</b> The second plan did away with the levy—heavily objected to by American shareholders—but was contingent for success upon the Reading's preferred stock being worth roughly four times its current trading value. The third plan was put forth by Franklin Gowen in the context of known contemplation by the English bondholders of exercising their right of foreclosure against the Reading. Gowen's plan called for receivership to last for five years, for which time he projected increasingly improved business performance, reduction of fixed expenses to a manageable level, and liquidation of <b>floating</b> <b>debt</b> by the selling off of assets and/or conversion into preferred stock. This plan, as put forth to the McCalmonts, was accompanied by Gowen's offer to step aside as receiver. The English faction agreed to a plan very close to Gowen's, but with the stipulation that Gowen should indeed be replaced as receiver by someone not involved in the corporation's management prior to the bankruptcy. Gowen backpedaled vigorously.|$|R
40|$|When a {{corporation}} plans to finance its investment through {{the issuance of}} bonds, the corporate management may choose either fixed or <b>floating</b> interest rate <b>debt.</b> Since the issuing corporation is inevitably subject to default risk, the issued bonds must provide higher yields than the default-free instruments. It has been observed that the required default premium of fixed rate debt is {{higher than that of}} the <b>floating</b> <b>debt</b> for firms with the same credit ratings. In this thesis, the contingent claim approach is employed to investigate the factors which determine the fixed-floating differentials. This thesis extends earlier works by allowing intertemporal default possibilities of the firm and incorporating different classes of interest rate models. It is discovered that the correlation coefficient between the firm value process and the interest rate process has profound impact on the fixed-floating differentials...|$|R

The pricing of <b>floating</b> rate <b>debt</b> and related interest rate options are examined in this paper.

The elimination of large principal repayments, by collateralizing the principal, serves to reduce the debtor country’s incentive to use its default option. ...|$|R

5000|$|Brown's most {{pressing}} issue was the state's skyrocketing debt. In previous decades, Tennessee had accumulated $43 million in bonded debt, mostly {{to pay for}} internal improvements, such as turnpike construction and loans to railroads. Governor William Brownlow exacerbated the problem by issuing more bonds to pay the interest on outstanding bonds in the late 1860s. [...] By the time Brown took office, the state was struggling to pay the interest on this debt. Brown managed to reduce the state's bonded debt to $20 million, and eliminated all of the state's <b>floating</b> <b>debt.</b> [...] His efforts proved futile, however, and the state eventually defaulted following the Panic of 1873.|$|R

We find that frequent issuers maintain close relationship with only three to five underwriters and pay significantly less underwriting fees than infrequent issuers. The findings are consistent with the notion that starting an underwriting relationship requires expenses for information production. We also find that an issuer’s first underwriter has a cost advantage over later-comers in competing for the issuer’s business. As a result, the first underwriter wins a larger share of the issuer’s business.
