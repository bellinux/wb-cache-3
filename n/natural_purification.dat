50|$|Treatment {{facilities}} resembling <b>natural</b> <b>purification</b> processes: {{their application}} requires significant surface area, {{because of the}} slow pace of the biological processes applied. For the same reason they are more suitable for warmer climates, because the rate of the purification process is temperature dependent.

Constructed wetlands are more suitable for applications at on-site or at neighbourhood level, while stabilization ponds could be a viable alternative for decentralized systems at the level of small towns or rural communities.|$|E

50|$|The {{state of}} the Don was {{similarly}} lifeless, but by the 1970s, water quality in the lower Went was slightly improved, {{as a result of}} <b>natural</b> <b>purification</b> of the effluents being added to the river, and a small population of fish re-established itself. Most are thought to have been swept down the Don from still waters much higher up than the mouth of the Went, but they survived the transit downstream to take refuge in the Went. As water quality continued to improve, the fish became self-sustaining by the 1980s, and populations of roach, bream, perch and eels began to spread upstream. While these species were suited to the ponded nature of the river below Sykehouse, the river above there is faster flowing, and more suitable for riverine species of fish such as chub and dace. There was no chance of natural redevelopment of these species, as they had all been eliminated by the pollution.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{ecological}} role of benthic macrofauna on nutrient dynamics and benthic-pelagic coupling in the Baltic Sea with relation to eutrophication. Generally, benthic macrofaunal activities have large effects on sediment biogeochemistry and often with stimulatory effects on processes that counteract eutrophication, i. e., denitrification and increased phosphorus retention of the sediment. The degree of faunal impact on such processes varies depending on faunal density and functional group composition. The effect of macrofaunal activities on sediment nutrient dynamics can also result in a higher nitrogen : phosporus ratio of the sediments efflux compared with sediments without macrofauna. Increased internal nutrient loading during eutrophication-induced anoxia is suggested to be caused both by altered sediment biogeochemical processes and through reduced or lost bioturbating macrofauna and thereby a reduced stimulatory effect from their activities on <b>natural</b> <b>purification</b> processes of the Baltic Sea ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|Treatment in a {{wastewater}} {{stabilization pond}} (WSP) relies on <b>natural</b> <b>purification</b> processes, {{which can be}} sensitive to both location and climate. This study investigated the effects of three environmental factors, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature, on disinfection efficiency in a WSP system consisting of three facultative cells, and operated in a temperate climate region, in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Indicator organism (Escherichia coli (E. coli)) removal in WSP systems is driven {{by a combination of}} different factors. Elevated pH and DO concentrations, which are attributed to the presence of algae, are important factors for effective disinfection. Therefore, the presence of algae in natural wastewater treatment systems can contribute appreciably to disinfection. Consequently, based on algal concentrations, removal efficiencies of pathogenic microorganisms during wastewater treatment {{over the course of a}} year can be highly variable, where higher removal efficiencies would be expected in summer and fall seasons...|$|E
40|$|Purification is a {{powerful}} technique in quantum physics whereby a mixed quantum state is extended to a pure state on a larger system. This process is not unique, and in systems composed of many degrees of freedom, one <b>natural</b> <b>purification</b> is the one with minimal entanglement. Here we study the entropy of the minimally entangled purification, called the entanglement of purification, in three model systems: an Ising spin chain, conformal field theories holographically dual to Einstein gravity, and random stabilizer tensor networks. We conjecture values for the entanglement of purification in all these models, and we support our conjectures {{with a variety of}} numerical and analytical results. We find that such minimally entangled purifications have a number of applications, from enhancing entanglement-based tensor network methods for describing mixed states to elucidating novel aspects of the emergence of geometry from entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence.

40|$|Industrial {{pollution}} emitted to {{the environment}} has created a drastic damage {{to the environment}}. <b>Natural</b> <b>purification</b> processes such as dilution and dispersion are not applicable due to the enormous amounts of discharged wastes, as they exceed the assimilative capacity of the local environment.

Increasing numbers of industries each year has exerted pressure on the environment compelling regulators to further tighten the standards. This has led to modification and improvement in the existing end-of-pipe treatment facilities resulting in higher investment as well as operation and maintenance cost, whereas in recent years, implementation of proactive methods of waste minimization is gaining much attention within industrial sectors. Various waste minimization techniques such as improved housekeeping, change in process technology, change in product, change in input materials, recycling of chemical and raw materials, and recovery of byproducts are discussed in detail.

40|$|In a two-period {{overlapping}} generations model, {{this paper}} {{demonstrates that the}} relationship between environmental taxation and economic activity (output level and output growth) becomes inverted-U shaped when the detrimental impact of pollution on health and the private decision of each working-age agent to improve her health are taken into account. In particular, a tighter environmental tax is more likely to promote (rather than to harm) output-level and -growth when health is very sensitive to pollution, the weight of health in preferences is high, the polluting capacity of the production technology is high and the rate of <b>natural</b> <b>purification</b> of pollutants is low. The inverted-U shaped relationship between environmental tax and economic activity is due to a positive effect arising from the competition for resources between the final output sector and the health-enhancing activities. This offsets the conventional detrimental “drag-down effect” for low values of the environmental tax. We also demonstrate that the link between environmental tax and lifetime welfare is inverted-U shaped as well. Finally, we investigate the social optimum and the determinants of the optimal environmental tax. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{optimal control}} theory {{allows us to}} design a {{wastewater}} treatment system {{in order to control}} marine pollution in any open area of shallow waters (see, for instance, the previous works of the authors [1 - 3]). However, there exist many closed areas (for instance, enclosed bays) which present a serious quality problem caused by domestic and/or industrial contaminants, due to the insufficient seawater exchange. In these areas where the ability of <b>natural</b> <b>purification</b> is very weak, it is necessary to consider a new technique in order to purify polluted waters: the most common strategy consists of promoting seawater exchange by the injection of clear water from the outer sea. This strategy presents a high efficiency to purify polluted closed areas {{in a short period of}} time. In the process of water conveyance the main problem consists, once the injection point is selected by geophysical reasons, of finding the minimum quantity of water which is needed to be injected into the closed area in order to purify it up to a fixed threshold. The aim of this contribution is to determine the minimal quantity of injected water in order to ensure that the contaminant concentration in the protected areas is lower tha...|$|E
