25|$|Under the Ottomans, Palestine's Arab {{population}} mostly {{saw themselves}} as Ottoman subjects. Kimmerling and Migdal consider the revolt in 1834 of the Arabs in Palestine as the first formative event of the Palestinian people. In the 1830s, Palestine was occupied by the Egyptian vassal of the Ottomans, Muhammad Ali and his son Ibrahim Pasha. The revolt was precipitated by popular resistance against heavy demands for conscripts. Peasants were well aware that conscription was <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> death sentence. Starting in May 1834, the rebels took many cities, among them Jerusalem, Hebron and Nablus. In response, Ibrahim Pasha sent in his army, finally defeating the last rebels on 4 August in Hebron. Nevertheless, the Arabs in Palestine remained part of a Pan-Islamist or Pan-Arab national movement.|$|E

25|$|Henrietta Maria {{paused for}} a period at York, where she was entertained in some style by the Earl of Newcastle. Henrietta Maria took the {{opportunity}} to discuss the situation north of the border with Royalist Scots, promoting the plans of Montrose and others for an uprising. She also supported the Earl of Antrim's proposals to settle the rebellion in Ireland and bring forces across the sea to support the King in England. Henrietta Maria continued to vigorously argue for <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> total victory over Charles' enemies, countering proposals for a compromise. She rejected private messages from Pym and Hampden asking her to use her influence over the King to create a peace treaty, and was impeached by Parliament shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, Parliament had voted to destroy her private chapel at Somerset House and arrest the Capuchin friars who maintained it. In March, Henry Marten and John Clotworthy forced their way into the chapel with troops and destroyed the altarpiece by Rubens, smashed many of the statues and made a bonfire of the Queen's religious canvases, books and vestments.|$|E

[...] The document was also notable for its attack on the materialism of National Socialism. In addition, he simultaneously worked on a sermon, Eternal Justice, which reiterated his key beliefs, including reincarnation.|$|E
500|$|Æthelstan is {{regarded}} as the first King of England by modern historians. Although it was Eadred who would achieve the final unification of England by the permanent conquest of Viking York, Æthelstan's campaigns made this success possible. His nephew Edgar called himself King of the English and revived the claim to rule over all the peoples of Britain. Simon Keynes argued that [...] "the consistent usages of Edgar's reign represent <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> determined reaffirmation of the polity created by Æthelstan in the 930s". Historian Charles Insley, however, sees Æthelstan's hegemony as fragile: [...] "The level of overlordship wielded by Æthelstan during the 930s over the rest of Britain was perhaps not attained again by an English king until Edward I."

500|$|Despite its failure, the Chilembwe {{rebellion}} {{has since}} gained an important {{place in the}} modern Malawian cultural memory, with Chilembwe himself gaining [...] "iconic status." [...] The uprising had [...] "local notoriety" [...] {{in the years immediately}} after it, and former rebels were kept under police observation. Over the next three decades, anti-colonial activists idealised Chilembwe and began to see him as a semi-mythical figure. The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) of the 1940s and 1950s used him as a symbolic figurehead, partly because its president, James Chinyama, had a family connection to Filipo Chinyama, who had been believed to be an ally of Chilembwe's. When the NAC announced that it intended to mark 15 February annually as Chilembwe Day, colonial officials were scandalised. One wrote that to [...] "venerate the memory of the fanatic and blood thirsty Chilembwe seems to us to be <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> confession of violent intention." ...|$|E

500|$|In Disney Interactive Studios' 1992 {{computer}} game Stunt Island, users could stage, record, and play back stunts; as Nitsche stated, the game's goal was [...] "not ... {{a high score}} but a spectacle." [...] Released the following year, id Software's Doom included the ability to record gameplay as sequences of events that the game engine could later replay in real-time. Because events and not video frames were saved, the resulting game demo files were small and easily shared among players. A culture of recording gameplay developed, as Henry Lowood of Stanford University called it, [...] "a context for spectatorship.... The result was <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> metamorphosis of the player into a performer." [...] Another important feature of Doom was that it allowed players {{to create their own}} modifications, maps, and software for the game, thus expanding the concept of game authorship. In machinima, there is a dual register of gestures: the trained motions of the player determine the in-game images of expressive motion.|$|E
500|$|After twoyears {{had passed}} with {{no word from}} Franklin, public concern grew and Lady Franklin—as well as members of Parliament and British newspapers—urged the Admiralty to send a search party. In response, the Admiralty {{developed}} a three-pronged plan put into effect {{in the spring of}} 1848 that sent an overland rescue party, led by Sir John Richardson and John Rae, down the MacKenzie River to the Canadian Arctic coast. Two expeditions by sea were also launched, one entering the Canadian Arctic archipelago through Lancaster Sound, and the other entering from the Pacific side. In addition, the Admiralty offered a reward of £20,000 (£ as of [...] ) [...] "to any Party or Parties, of any country, who shall render assistance to the crews of the Discovery Ships under the command of Sir John Franklin". After the three-pronged effort failed, British national concern and interest in the Arctic increased until [...] "finding Franklin became <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> crusade." [...] Ballads such as [...] "Lady Franklin's Lament", commemorating Lady Franklin's search for her lost husband, became popular.|$|E
500|$|Borah {{hoped to}} be elected {{president}} in 1928, but his only chance was a deadlocked Republican convention. He was reluctant to support Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover for president, backing Ohio Senator Frank Willis instead, but after Willis collapsed and died at a campaign rally in late March, Borah began to find Hoover more to his liking. [...] The Idahoan's support for Hoover became more solid as the campaign began to shape as a rural/urban divide. [...] Borah was a strong backer of Prohibition, {{and the fact that}} Hoover was another [...] "dry" [...] influenced Borah in his support; the senator disliked the Democratic candidate, New York Governor Al Smith, an opponent of Prohibition, considering him a creature of Tammany Hall. Though Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh commented on [...] "Borah's recent conversion to Hoover", and some progressives were disheartened, Borah undertook a lengthy campaign tour, warning that he saw [...] "the success of Tammany in national politics as <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> national disaster". Hoover was elected and thanked Borah for [...] "the enormous effect" [...] of his support. He offered to make Borah Secretary of State, though deploring the loss to the Senate, but Borah declined.|$|E

Writing for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Gino DeLa Paz found it [...] "cute but forgettable". Gwen Ihnat, from the entertainment website The A.V. Club, labeled it as [...] "Madonna's best song that never appeared on one of her regular albums [...] a psychedelic pop confection that offered a few of her most indelible hooks". Ihnat also wrote that [...] "although less ethereal than 1998's Ray of Light, [...] is just as dance-floor ready [...] dance flute has never sounded so enticing, and Madonna's voice so sweetly seductive". AllMusic's Jose F. Promis listed the track [...] "as one of the singer's more memorable moments, coupling 1960s go-go rock with 1990s electronica, resulting in <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> true slice of old fashioned rock & roll"; Promis also praised the two Calderone mixes.|$|E
