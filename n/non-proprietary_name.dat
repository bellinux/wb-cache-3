5000|$|Many {{chimeric}} protein drugs are monoclonal antibodies whose specificity for a target molecule was developed using mice and hence were initially [...] "mouse" [...] antibodies. As non-human proteins, mouse antibodies tend to evoke an immune reaction if administered to humans. The chimerization process involves engineering {{the replacement of}} segments of the antibody molecule that distinguish it from a human antibody. For example, human constant domains can be introduced, thereby eliminating most of the potentially immunogenic portions of the drug without altering its specificity for the intended therapeutic target. Antibody nomenclature indicates this type of modification by inserting -xi- into the <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>name</b> (e.g., abci-xi-mab). If parts of the variable domains are also replaced by human portions, humanized antibodies are obtained. Although not conceptually distinct from chimeras, this type is indicated using -zu- such as in dacli-zu-mab. See the list of monoclonal antibodies for more examples.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} an educational intervention on doctors’ knowledge and perceptions towards generic medicines and their generic (international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>name)</b> prescribing practice. Methods: This is a single-cohort pre-/post-intervention pilot study. The {{study was conducted in}} a tertiary care hospital in Perak, Malaysia. All doctors from the internal medicine department were {{invited to participate in the}} educational intervention. The intervention consisted of an interactive lecture, an educational booklet and a drug list. Doctors’ knowledge and perceptions were assessed by using a validated questionnaire, while the international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>name</b> prescribing practice was assessed by screening the prescription before and after the intervention. Results: The intervention was effective in improving doctors’ knowledge towards bioequivalence, similarity of generic medicines and safety standards required for generic medicine registration (p[*]=[*] 0. 034, p[*]=[*] 0. 034 and p[*]=[*] 0. 022, respectively).

The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the medication name designation process, to elucidate properties that may prime the risk of confusion. We analysed the formal and semantic properties of 7, 987 International <b>Non-proprietary</b> <b>Names</b> (INNs), in relation to naming guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) INN programme, and have identified potential for errors. We explored: their linguistic properties, the underlying taxonomy of stems to indicate pharmacological interrelationships, and similarities between INNs. We used Microsoft Excel for analysis, including calculation of Levenshtein edit distance (LED). Compliance with WHO naming guidelines was inconsistent. Since the 1970 s there has been a trend towards compliance in formal properties, such as word length, but longer names published in the 1950 s and 1960 s are still in use. The stems used to show pharmacological interrelationships are not spelled consistently and the guidelines do not impose an unequivocal order on them, making the meanings of INNs difficult to understand. Pairs of INNs sharing a stem (appropriately or not) often have high levels of similarity (< 5 LED), and thus have greater potential for confusion. We have revealed a tension between WHO guidelines stipulating use of stems to denote meaning, and the aim of reducing similarities in nomenclature. To mitigate this tension and reduce the risk of confusion, the stem system should be made clear and well ordered, so as to avoid compounding the risk of confusion at the clinical level. The interplay between the different WHO INN naming principles should be further examined, to better understand their implications for the problem of LASA errors...|$|R

The {{goal is to}} analyse {{the changes in the}} pricing regulations concerning OTC and its impact on prices and utilization of analgesic medicines. Two main hypotheses are tested in the study. H 1 : The changes in the price regulation liberate the market in terms of increase in the analgesics utilization; H 2 : The changes in the regulation lead to the decrease in prices. Regulatory and market analysis were performed focusing on procedures for price settlement and their changes for 4 international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>names</b> (INNs) of analgesics on the local market – methamizole sodium, paracetamol, ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid for the period before and after the changes in the regulation. The descriptive statistic, z-test for proportions, and one way ANOVA analysis were performed to evaluate the statistical significance of the changes in utilization and prices. An increase in the analgesics utilization has been observed in 2006 compared to 2003. Increase in utilization was found to be statistically significant for all INN and thus confirms our first hypothesis. After the changes in the regulatory control we observe the increase in the mean official and market prices of methamizol and paracetamol in 2006 and decrease in 2009. The prices of ibuprofen decrease in 2006, but in 2009 the officially registered price increased while the market one remains lowest. For acetylsalicylic acid the mean prices decreased slowly in 2003 and then increased in 2009. All changes in the prices were not statistically significant even when we compare the prices in 2009 with the ones in 2003. Thus our second hypothesis is not confirmed.

40|$|Understanding the {{medication}} and supplement use of aging people {{is critical to}} ensuring that health service providers in primary care can optimise use of these agents. An {{increasing number of people}} with different levels of intellectual disability (ID) are living in the community and becoming for the first time substantial users of primary health care services.

This research aligned participants of 50 years and over who lived in the community from two nationally representative cohorts of older people; those with ID from the Intellectual Disability Supplement (n = 238) and those without ID (n = 8, 081) from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Data showed that both medication and supplement use in the two groups was prevalent but that those with ID received more of both medications and supplements (e. g. polypharmacy was 39. 0 % in ID vs. 18. 1 % in non-ID cohort). Moreover, based on an analysis of the therapeutic groups and medications used that treatment was more intense in the ID cohort (95. 8 vs. 7. 0 International <b>Non-proprietary</b> <b>Names</b> per 100 participants). Supplement use was almost twice as prevalent in the ID group but substantially less diverse with only 10 types of supplements reported.

40|$|Introduction: Adverse drug {{reactions}} {{can cause}} increased morbidity and mortality, and therefore information {{needs to be}} studied systematically. Little {{is known about the}} adverse drug reactions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapy. The goal {{of this study is to}} assess the expectedness, seriousness and severity of adverse drug reactions during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapy based on their reporting in the national pharmacovigilance system. Methods: This was a prospective, observational, 1 -year, real-life study about the pharmacotherapy of a sample of 390 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Prescribed medicines were systematized and national pharmacovigilance databases were searched for reported adverse drug reactions. The expectedness was evaluated through the review of the summary of product characteristics, the seriousness was evaluated by the clinicians based on the life threatening nature of the adverse drug reactions, and the severity was evaluated through Hartwig’s Severity Assessment Scale. Descriptive statistics of the reported adverse drug reactions was performed and the relative risk of developing an adverse drug reaction with all international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>names</b> included in the analysis was calculated. Results: Results confirm that the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a disease with high appearance of adverse drug reactions, and causes many additional costs to the healthcare system. Unexpected and severe adverse drug reactions are frequent. A total of 4. 8 % of adverse drug reactions were evaluated as life threatening. Majority of adverse drug reactions are classified in Levels 1 (32. 6 %), 2 (26. 4 %) and 3 (19 %) according to Hartwig’s Severity Assessment Scale. Approximately 22 % of reported adverse drug reactions affect people’s everyday life to a greater extent and require additional therapy which might further increase the risk. The relative risk of developing an adverse drug reaction was highest for novphyllin (relative risk[*]=[*] 0. 65), followed by aclidinium bromide (relative risk[*]=[*] 0. 09). Both indacaterol and salbutamol are with a relative risk of 0. 07. Conclusion: In conclusion, the medicines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cause many serious adverse drug reactions, most of them were unexpected, lacking in the short product characteristics. Appropriate reporting of adverse drug reactions is necessary to decrease the risk of patients and healthcare system...|$|R

The objective of this review is to appraise {{the influence of the}} various measures on subsequent utilization patterns and expenditure in high-volume classes to provide guidance. This review is principally a narrative review of published studies. The authors' found supply-side measures resulted in generic prices as low as 3 % of pre-patent loss prices.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although {{medicinal}} cannabis {{has been}} used for many centuries, the therapeutic potential of delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta 9 -THC; international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>name</b> = dronabinol) in current pain management remains unclear. Several pharmaceutical products with defined natural or synthesized Delta 9 -THC content have been developed, resulting in increasing numbers of clinical trials investigating the analgesic efficacy of dronabinol in various pain conditions. Different underlying pain mechanisms, including sensitization of nociceptive sensory pathways and alterations in cognitive and autonomic processing, might explain the varying analgesic effects of dronabinol in chronic pain states. AREAS COVERED: The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of action of products with a defined dronabinol content are summarized. Additionally, randomized clinical trials investigating the analgesic efficacy of pharmaceutical cannabis based products are reviewed for the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain. EXPERT OPINION: We suggest a mechanism-based approach beyond measurement of subjective pain relief to evaluate the therapeutic potential of dronabinol in chronic pain management. Development of objective mechanistic diagnostic biomarkers reflecting altered sensory and cognitive processing in the brain is essential to evaluate dronabinol induced analgesia, and to permit identification of responders and/or non-responders to dronabinol treatment...|$|E

They derive from a/nbiological source (a typical example being insulin) and those which are ex-patent, together with their copies –which are called “biosimilar medicines”-, conform the ex-patent biological medicines market. /nThe study of such a market reveals two issues: First, that although market shares of the main players of the industry do not show a problematic level of concentration (when looking at the aggregate of all medicines), high concentration levels do appear when subdividing the market for each drug.

40|$|International <b>Non-proprietary</b> <b>Name</b> (INN) {{prescribing}} {{is the use}} of {{the name}} of the active ingredient(s) instead of the brand name for prescribing. In Belgium, INN prescribing began in 2005 and a major policy change occurred in 2012. The aim was to explore the opinions of Dutch-speaking general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists. An electronic questionnaire with 39 five-point Likert scale statements and one open question was administered in 2013. Multivariate analysis was performed with multiple linear regression on a sum score for benefit statements and for drawback statements. Answers to the open question were qualitatively analysed. We received 745 valid responses with a representable sample for both subgroups. Participants perceived the motives to introduce INN prescribing as purely economic (to reduce pharmaceutical expenditures for the government and the patient). Participants accepted the concept of INN prescribing, but 88 % stressed the importance of guaranteed treatment continuity, especially in older, chronic patients, to prevent patient confusion, medication non-adherence and erroneous drug use. In conclusion, the current way in which INN prescribing is applied in Belgium leads to many concerns among primary health professionals about patient confusion and medication adherence. Slightly adapting the current concept of INN prescribing to these concerns can turn INN prescribing into one of the major policies in Belgium to reduce pharmaceutical expenditures and to stimulate rational drug prescribing...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to assess causality in drug-induced liver injury but none have been tested {{in the specific context}} of acute liver failure leading to transplantation (ALFT). OBJECTIVE: We took advantage of the Study of Acute Liver Transplant (SALT), a European case-population study of ALFT, to test different causality scales. METHODS: Causality was assessed by experts in SALT, a 7 -country case-population study from 2005 to 2007 of adult otherwise unexplained ALFT, for all drugs found within 30  days prior to the date of initial symptoms of liver disease (index date), using information content, causality scales, and data circuit determined from a pilot study, Salome. RESULTS: The consensus points from Salome were to provide full data on drugs including international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>name</b> (INN) and doses except for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and to use the World Health Organization (WHO) causality scale. In SALT, among the 9, 479 identified patients, 600 (6. 3  %) were cases of ALFT, of which 187 had been exposed to drugs within 30  days, without overdose. In 130 (69. 5  %) of these the causality score was possible, probable, or highly probable. CONCLUSION: In ALFT cases, once other clinical causes have been excluded and drug exposure established within 30  days, the main discriminant characteristic for causality will be previous knowledge of possible hepatotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study aims {{to conduct}} a {{descriptive}} analysis of the policy environment surrounding the generic medicines retail market in Portugal. The policy analysis focuses on supply-side measures (i. e. market access, pricing, reference-pricing and reimbursement of generic medicines) and demand-side measures (i. e. incentives for physicians to prescribe, for pharmacists to dispense and for patients to use generic medicines). Methods: The policy analysis {{was based on an}} international literature review. Also, a simulation exercise was carried out to compute potential savings from substituting generic for originator medicines in Portugal using IMS Health data. Results: Portugal has developed a successful generic medicines market by increasing reimbursement of generic medicines (until October 2005), by introducing a reference-pricing system, by encouraging physicians to prescribe by international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>name</b> (INN), and by allowing generic substitution by pharmacists. However, the development of the generic medicines market has been hindered by the existence of copies, pricing regulation, certain features of the reference-pricing system, weak incentives for physicians to prescribe generic medicines and a financial disincentive for pharmacists to dispense generic medicines. Increased generic substitution would be expected to reduce public expenditure on originator medicines by 45 %. Conclusions: The development of the Portuguese generic medicines market has mainly been fuelled by supply-side measures. To support the further expansion of the market, policy makers need to strengthen demand-side measures inciting physicians to prescribe, pharmacists to dispense and patients to use generic medicines...|$|E
40|$|INN prescribing: {{advantages}} and limitations Although permitted by Belgian law and accepted for reimbursement since 2005, international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>name</b> (INN) prescriptions currently represent only 3 % of all prescriptions. THis {{in spite of}} the widely recognized advantages, such as easier prescribing, an increased familiarity witch scientific nomenclature, more rational expenditures on drugs and an easier access to therapy. The main reason for this low percentage is probably the lack of a good methodology for INN prescribing. From any INN prescription, it should be clear what exactly the pharmacist's dispensing options are. For this purpose, a system of INN clusters has been developed, designed in parallel with existing data models used abroad. Each INN cluster consists of medicinal product packages containing the same active compound(s), in equal doses, and with comparable application (systemic vs non-systemic) and aministration route. These features are defined as major specifications. Minor specifications such as galenic form, (un) desired additives or reimbursement requirements can be added to an INN prescription on an obligatory or optional basis. There are situations where INN prescribing is not recommended, e. g. because of of the complexity of prescribing, such as for multicompound medicines or dermal preparations. Other reasons include the nature of certain drugs (e. g., narrow therapeutic margin, biological origin, [...] .) or specific patient characteristics. In all other cases, there are no pharmacological arguments against INN prescribing, and it must be hoped that the current INN cluster project will fill the gap between theory and practice...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: To {{describe}} pharmaceutical {{pricing and}} reimbursement systems in 29 European countries {{with regard to}} medicines, particularly generics, and their possible impact on generics uptake. Method: Data collection on pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement policies with the staff of competent authorities. Results: In most European countries the prices of medicines are controlled at the stage of manufacture (ex-factory price) or wholesale. Usually, price control systems target reimbursable medicines, and the prices of reimbursable generics are regulated. Sixteen of the 29 countries surveyed in this study apply a policy of generic price linkage, i. e. setting {{the price of the}} generic medicines at a specific percentage lower than that of the originator. Twenty-two of the surveyed countries run a reference price system, i. e. a reimbursement policy based on clusters of identical or similar medicines for which a fixed amount of reimbursement is granted. Most countries cluster medicines with the same active ingredient, and only a few countries have opted for broader reference groups, thus allowing more interchangeability between choice of medicines and higher savings on costs. Demand-side measures such as generics substitution and/or prescribing by the international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>name</b> are in place in nearly all the countries surveyed. These are usually not mandatory for the stakeholders concerned. Conclusion: As many pharmaceutical policies tend to address reimbursable medicines, generics fall under the scope of these measures. European countries apply a mix of specific measures to promote generics uptake. There appears to be room for improvement regarding the enforcement of some policies...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{quantity}} and nature of prescribed medicines with potential for misuse returned to community pharmacies and general practice surgeries. Setting Community pharmacies (n = 51, 85 % total) and general practice surgeries (n = 42, 69 %) {{within the boundaries of}} Eastern Birmingham Primary Care Trust, UK. Method Medicines returned spontaneously by patients to participating sites were collected over eight weeks in May and June 2003. Data were recorded for each medicinal item including: patient sex, recommended International <b>Non-proprietary</b> <b>Name</b> (rINN), strength, form, legal classification, quantity and number of doses per day. Medicines were categorised into BWF therapeutic groups. A 'medicinal item' was defined as the total number of dose units of a medicine of the same form, strength and date of issue, returned for a given patient. Key findings Medicines were returned from 910 patients comprising 3765 medicinal items (2782 (73. 9 %) prescription-only medicines and 356 (9. 5 %) controlled drugs). Substantial amounts of unused, prescribed medicines with potential to cause harm or for misuse were returned, with analgesics, psychoactive and antiepileptic agents comprising 19. 4 % of returned medicinal items. Medicines of note that were returned included paracetamol-containing medicines (16 630 tablets), morphine (56 g), diamorphine (4. 3 g), tramadol (2840 tablets and capsules), benzodiazepines (677 tablets) and tricyclic antidepressants (2831 tablets). Conclusions Substantial quantities of prescribed medicines with potential to cause harm or be misused are routinely present in the community. The management of these unused medicines, and in particular controlled drugs, Is currently inadequate and further work is required to identify the legislative and patient-centred processes required to minimise the potential for these medicines to be misused or cause harm. © 2007 The Authors...|$|E
40|$|Introduction {{and study}} objectives: Resource {{pressures}} {{will continue to}} grow. Consequently, health authorities and health insurance agencies need {{to take full advantage}} of the availability of generics in order to continue funding comprehensive health care particularly in Europe. Generic clopidogrel provides such an opportunity in view of appreciable worldwide sales of the originator. However, early formulations contained different salts and only limited indications. Consequently, there is a need to assess responses by the authorities to the early availability of generic clopidogrel including potential reasons preventing them from taking full advantage of the situation. In addition, it is necessary to determine the extent of initial price reductions obtained in practice to guide future activities. Methods: Feedback from health authorities and health insurance personnel involved with the reforms surrounding generic clopidogrel was principally used to assess authority responses as there is limited information in the public domain. Abu Dhabi has been included as a representative of the Middle East since it has introduced compulsory international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>name</b> (INN) prescribing except for limited situations. Generic clopidogrel is not one of these – providing direction to other health authorities alongside, e. g. Lithuania. Australia has also been included in view of the high court ruling in favour of generic clopidogrel. Results: Authorities from across Australia, Europe and the Middle East typically adopted a pragmatic approach to the availability of generic clopidogrel to enhance its prescribing and dispensing once approved by regulatory agencies such as EMA. This included guidance to enhance its utilisation such as academic publications, co-payment incentives and compulsory INN prescribing. However, this was not always possible with challenges to the availability of generics in some countries. Again, there was appreciable variation in the initial price reductions for generic clopidogrel versus the originator. Conclusion: Authorities can take full advantage of the early availability of generics despite different formulations and indications. Pharmaceutical companies need to accept this in order to help fund new premium price products as resource pressures grow...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ships {{should carry}} {{mandatory}} given amounts of medicinal products and basic first aid items, collectively {{known as the}} ship's medicine chest. Type and quantities of these products/items are suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and regulated by individual flag states. In countries that lack national legislation, {{it is assumed that}} ships should follow WHO indications. An objective difficulty mainly involving vessels of international long-haul routes could be to recognise medicinal compounds obtained in other countries for replacing products used or expired. Language barrier may complicate, if not make it impossible to interpret the name of the medicinal product and/or of the active principle as indicated in a box printed in a completely different language. Handling of the ship's pharmacy may be difficult in case of purchasing of drugs abroad due to language barriers. Medicinal products are identified by the international <b>non-proprietary</b> <b>name</b> of the active principle and/or by their chemical or invented (branded) names. This may make the identification of a medicinal product difficult, primarily if it is purchased abroad and the box and instructions are written {{in the language of the}} country where it is marketed. Therefore, there is a simpler classification system of the medicinal compounds the ATC (ATC: Anatomy, Therapeutic properties, Chemical, pharmacological properties). This paper has reviewed the list of medicinal products recommended by WHO and assigned to each one the ATC code as a solution to the problem of medicinal compounds organisation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two researchers independently examined the list of medicinal compounds indicated in the third edition of the International Medical Guide for Ships and attributed to each compound the ATC code according to the 2013 Guidelines for ATC classification and Defined Daily Dose (DDD) assignment. RESULTS: The ATC code was attributed to the medicinal compounds indicated in the third edition of the International Medical Guide for Ships. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of an objective system to identify medicinal products is required for ships, which will contribute in making the identification of items purchased simpler, making it easier to understand which drug seafarers need to be administer, and consequently reduce possible therapeutic mistakes...|$|E
