5|$|MacArthur's {{primary concern}} was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at Clark Field, which were {{required}} to support future operations. He urged his commanders on. On 25 January 1945, he moved his advanced headquarters forward to Hacienda Luisita, closer to the front than Krueger's. He ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. It reached the northern outskirts of Manila on 3 February, but, unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi had decided to defend Manila to the death. The Battle of Manila raged for the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> To spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes, but thousands of civilians died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres. He also refused to restrict the traffic of civilians who clogged the roads {{in and out of}} Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except in emergencies. For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E

Johnston saw that the Union army was split in half by the rain-swollen Chickahominy River and hoped to defeat it in detail at Seven Pines and Fair Oaks. McClellan was unable to command the army personally because of a recurrence of malarial fever, but his subordinates were able to repel the attacks. Nevertheless, McClellan received criticism from Washington for not counterattacking, which some believed could have opened the city of Richmond to capture. Johnston {{was wounded in the}} battle, and General Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia. McClellan spent the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> repositioning his troops and waiting for promised reinforcements, losing valuable time as Lee continued to strengthen Richmond's defenses.|$|E

At 03:00 on 23 September, the brigade leading the 5th Cavalry Division left Afule for Haifa and Acre. The advance was unopposed until 10:00 that day when the Mysore Lancers reached the village of Beled Esh Sheikh where the leading squadron was shelled from Mount Carmel and came under small-arms fire from the region of the village.

5|$|Harvey {{began his}} final tour to England in 1961, and Benaud's regular {{absences}} {{due to a}} shoulder injury allowed him to lead Australia for {{a third of the}} tour matches. This included most of the first month of the tour; Benaud hurt his shoulder in the first match against Worcestershire, and spent most of the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> either not bowling or travelling to London away from his men for specialist treatment. At one stage, Australia were left with only 10 men on the field when Benaud excused himself and his replacement succumbed to illness, requiring an Englishman to stand in. Harvey scored 474 runs at 47.40 in eight matches leading up to the Tests, including centuries against Lancashire and Glamorgan. It seemed that Harvey would captain Australia in a Test {{for the first time with}} Benaud's shoulder still problematic, but the captain declared himself fit. Harvey then made 114 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston. This helped Australia take a 321-run first innings lead and put them in control of the match, but the hosts batted for the remainder of the match to stave off defeat; Benaud's shoulder prevented him from bowling more than nine overs.|$|E

5|$|In March 1814, {{following}} {{with the}} collapse of the First French Empire, Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlanticâthe myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codesâhad been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from conservatives in the general population and the hierarchy of the Spanish Catholic Church; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> to nine months, depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain.|$|E

The second season continued with similar success and on 1 February 1930 he became the first Ballymena player to be capped at international level when he played in a 7-0 win over Wales.

5|$|Meanwhile, the Viet Cong {{began their}} third general {{offensive}} {{for the year}} on 17 August 1968, attacking dozens of towns and military installations throughout South Vietnam with rockets and mortars, including Saigon. As part of the allied response the Australians were deployed to defend Ba Ria, the provincial capital, while during 20â23 August, B and C Company, 1 RAR with a troop of Centurion tanks were involved in intense urban fighting while supporting South Vietnamese forces to clear a company-sized force from D445 VC Battalion occupying Long Dien. At least 17 Viet Cong were killed during the fighting, while Australian casualties included six wounded. During the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> all three Australian battalions were deployed on search-and-destroy operations, yet the Viet Cong successfully eluded them. Continuing until 30 September, the renewed offensive lacked {{the scale of the}} previous attacks and again resulted in heavy communist casualties, failing to produce lasting military gains and contributing to an overall decline in Viet Cong and North Vietnamese combat power in the south. Yet such failures were neither final nor decisive and Hanoi seemed to increasingly hold the upper hand. The war continued regardless, while allied military strategic objectives were increasingly coming into question. In late-1968 1 ATF was again deployed outside its base in Phouc Tuy, operating against suspected communist bases in the May Tao and Hat Dich areas as part of Operation Goodwood. The operation led to sustained fighting during a 78-day sweep between December 1968 and February 1969 and later became known as the Battle of Hat Dich.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 January, at Wandumi, the main Japanese thrust fell upon the 70-man strong 'A' Company, 2/6th Infantry Battalion. Throughout the day the company fought desperately to hold the Japanese while {{reinforcements}} from the 2/5th were brought up from Wau; in the mid-afternoon, as it looked like they would be overrun, a desperate bayonet charge temporarily bought the Australians some relief and they eventually withdrew about a mile to the south-west, back towards the Bulolo River where they formed a night defensive position, having successfully delayed the Japanese advance and inflicted over 75 killed upon them. Throughout the following day, as poor weather hampered efforts to fly in the 2/7th Infantry Battalion, {{a large group of}} about 500 Japanese bypassed 'A' Company's position and continued on towards Wau. In response two companies of the 2/5th were moved to the airstrip, reaching there early on 29 January just before Japanese mortars began firing on it. By mid-morning, however, the weather cleared and Allied aircraft soon began arriving at the airfield, disgorging men from the 2/7th who were quickly thrown into the line. That night several counterattacks were fought off and the following day, as a section of guns from the 2/1st Field Regiment arrived, the 17th Brigade went on the offensive. A company of machine guns from the 7th Machine Gun Battalion was also flown in. By 5 February the Japanese began withdrawing from the area. Significant fighting occurred on 9 February, and {{over the course of the}} <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> further clashes took place as the Australians followed up the retreating Japanese. The last actions came around Buibaining and Waipali and by 26 February the withdrawal was complete with the Japanese establishing themselves around Guadagasal and Mubo.|$|E

5|$|Pointing {{out that}} Cleveland already had three quarterbacks, Browns {{president}} Mike Holmgren said McCoy would likely not play {{his first season}} with the team {{in order to develop}} him as an NFL quarterback. However, due to injuries to starting quarterback Jake Delhomme and back-up Seneca Wallace, McCoy made his first career start against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 6. McCoy completed 23 of 33 passes for 281 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions in the Browns' loss. He also scrambled four times for 22 yards. McCoy started the following week against the New Orleans Saints and contributed to the surprising victory over the defending Super Bowl champions 30-17 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. On November 7, McCoy made his third consecutive start and led the Browns to another upset victory, this time against the New England Patriots 34-14. He then started again on November 14 against the New York Jets; however the Browns lost in overtime with McCoy throwing for 205 yards and a touchdown. McCoy injured his ankle in week 11 against the Jacksonville Jaguars and missed the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> before returning to start under center against the Cincinnati Bengals in week 15.
