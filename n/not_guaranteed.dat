5|$|By {{finishing}} in 16th in MLS last season, United were <b>not</b> <b>guaranteed</b> an MLS {{berth in}} the 2011 edition of the U.S. Open Cup. Therefore, {{they will have to}} qualify for one of two spots against teams that finished in 7th place or below in MLS last season.|$|E
5|$|While a {{defendant}} {{is entitled to}} a fair cross section in the venire, the defendant is <b>not</b> <b>guaranteed</b> a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury. Yet, the equal protection clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges {{in the selection of}} the petit jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges.|$|E
5|$|A fifth-place {{finish in}} the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were <b>not</b> <b>guaranteed</b> entry into the Champions League, and faced the {{prospect}} {{of not being able}} to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face a team from England in the group stages. This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.|$|E

5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is <b>not</b> <b>guaranteed</b> to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E

Bell {{appeared}} in a supporting role in the science-fiction comedy Safety <b>Not</b> <b>Guaranteed</b> (2012). She starred in the drama film The Lifeguard, {{written and directed by}} Liz W. Garcia, which began filming in July 2012, and was released in August 2013. She also voiced Anna in Frozen, which was released on November 22, 2013. In 2013, for multiple episodes, Bell played Ingrid de Forest, an Eagleton City Councilwoman, on Parks and Recreation.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are <b>not</b> <b>guaranteed</b> to be globally optimal. The primary {{problem is}} that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E

5|$|Early {{polls showed}} that Beshear and Henry led the Democratic field in name recognition, but both trailed Fletcher and his Republican primary rival Anne Northup in that area. Early in the campaign, Beshear {{attempted}} to set himself {{apart from the}} other candidates by supporting a constitutional amendment that would allow expanded casino gambling in the state, which he claimed could generate $500 million in new revenue without the need to raise taxes. Observers noted that this strategy was remarkably {{similar to the one}} used by Wallace Wilkinson who, in his 1987 primary victory over Beshear and others, trumpeted the revenue a state lottery would generate. Initially, all of the Democratic candidates except Hensley endorsed a casino amendment, but as Beshear made it the centerpiece of his campaign, support from other candidates began to waver; Richards officially changed his position to oppose the amendment, while several other candidates charged that Beshear was staking too much of his platform on a proposal that was <b>not</b> <b>guaranteed</b> to pass.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{its history}} the National Register has been {{administered}} by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, coordinate, identify, and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of the property is <b>not</b> <b>guaranteed.</b> During the nomination process, the property is evaluated {{in terms of the}} four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria {{has been the subject of}} criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} in the league as Liverpool finished in fifth place outside the UEFA Champions League qualification places. They were eliminated from the FA Cup third round by Burnley. The club reached {{the final of the}} League Cup, but lost 3–2 to Chelsea. Liverpool also reached the final of the UEFA Champions League and it appeared the club would lose their second final of the season when they were 3–0 down to Italian team Milan at half-time, but three goals in six minutes allowed Liverpool to draw level at 3–3. No goals in extra time meant the match went to a penalty shoot-out, which they won 3–2. A fifth-place finish in the Premier League meant Liverpool were <b>not</b> <b>guaranteed</b> entry into the Champions League and faced the prospect {{of not being able to}} defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round. They were eliminated in the first knockout round by Portuguese team Benfica. In the 2005–06 season they finished in third place. They also reached the 2006 FA Cup Final where they faced West Ham United. Liverpool won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out after the match finished 3–3.|$|E
