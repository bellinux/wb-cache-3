40|$|Nation-level Ecological Footprint {{accounts}} are currently produced {{for more than}} 150 nations, with multiple calculations available for some nations.

Global Footprint Network's National Footprint Accounts, supported and used by more than 70 major organizations worldwide, contain the most widely used national accounting methodology today. The National Footprint Accounts calculations are undergoing continuous improvement as better data becomes available and new methodologies are developed. In this paper, a community of active Ecological Footprint practitioners and users propose key research priorities for improving <b>national</b> <b>Ecological</b> Footprint accounting. For each of the proposed improvements, we briefly review relevant literature, summarize the current state of debate, and suggest approaches for further development.

Freshwater Science, 34 (1), 377 - 385. doi: 10. 1086 / 679446 The current and future {{direction}} of aquatic ecological research leans toward addressing questions that cover multiple scales and levels of complexity. Historically, {{the ability to do}} comparative aquatic research across large spatial and temporal scales has been impeded by a lack of comparable measurements, standard methods, and a well organized data management and retrieval system. The <b>National</b> <b>Ecological</b> Observatory Network (NEON) is the first continental-scale ecological observation system designed to collect and provide freely available data on the drivers and responses of ecological change. In this paper, we describe past and present attempts to work across multiple scales in aquatic ecology, and the potential use of NEON aquatics data and infrastructure by researchers to integrate and expand ecological research programs and address novel ecological questions. © 2015 by The Society for Freshwater Science...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{corridors}} are {{a fundamental}} {{element in the}} <b>National</b> <b>ecological</b> network approved by the Grenelle environmental agreement {{in order to reduce}} ecosystem damage caused by fragmentation of the natural habitat zones of species. How can their effectiveness be evaluated? This article sums up current knowledge on their pros and cons. Fragmentation of natural habitats {{is considered one of the}} main causes of biodiversity loss. One of the proposed solutions to limit the effects of fragmentation is to restore ecological connectivity by creating ecological corridors between zones containing natural habitats. The concept remains controversial among scientists, but now serves as the basis for one of the operational projects of the Grenelle environmental agreements in the form of the <b>National</b> <b>ecological</b> network. After examining the ecological concepts justifying the political goal and presenting the various ecological roles of corridors, we briefly discuss their overall advantages and disadvantages. Then, we look closely at the methodological difficulties in detecting a corridor effect. Finally, we recommend a close partnership between research and policy to design biodiversity monitoring and evaluation systems in the different land-management plans...|$|R

The impact of state roads on protected areas in Vojvodina was reviewed in this article, based on the orientation values of habitat loss and secondary negative effects originating from traffic functioning. Results of the assessment indicate that the use of existing roads constructed on habitats within the <b>national</b> <b>ecological</b> network exceeded the capacity of individual PA-protected areas (e. g., in case of Straža Natural Monument). Recorded capacity overflow on other PAs occurs solely as a consequence of overlapping between protected areas and areas of influence of roads routed along the borders of protected areas (which is the case with Slano Kopovo Special Nature Reserve and Selevenjske pustare Special Nature Reserve). The aim {{of this article is to}} show that even with the smallest values of the parameters related to the width of roads and critical distance from the habitat, the vulnerability of certain core areas of the <b>national</b> <b>ecological</b> network is evident...|$|R
