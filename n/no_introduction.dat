5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had <b>no</b> <b>introduction</b> or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E

500|$|Yarrell broadly {{follows the}} lead of Bewick in {{describing}} each species in a separate section, with essentially <b>no</b> <b>introduction.</b> The first bird, the Egyptian vulture, is preceded by {{nothing more than the}} Index (there is no table of contents) and the heading [...] "British Birds", though there is an introductory paragraph on page 2, inside the Egyptian vulture article. Like Bewick, Yarrell's sections begin with a large wood engraving, depicting the species against a more or less realistic background: that of the Egyptian vulture shows a pyramid and a pair of laden camels. An immediate difference from Bewick is the list of Latin names that follows, with Vultur percnopterus (Bewick), Neophron [...] percnopterus (Selby, Jenyns, Eyton, and Gould), and Cathartes [...] percnopterus (Temminck). This care reflects both the rapidly advancing state of ornithology in the early nineteenth century, and Yarrell's more scientific approach.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} his original in 1817, Schubert made six subsequent autographs. These differing versions {{were not necessarily}} an attempt to improve a work, with some later versions being written from memory with only minor variations; Newbould considers that Schubert's close replication was a [...] "feat of musicianship... and a sign that Schubert spoke the language of music with the naturalness of conversation." [...] The differences between the autographs are small: according to Reed, they [...] "are concerned... with the tempo indication and the prelude – postlude." [...] The first version, marked Mässig, has <b>no</b> <b>introduction,</b> although [...] "the shape of the familiar introduction is already adumbrated in a seven-bar postlude". The draft is undated, although is from 1817 and is kept in the Stadler, Ebner and Schindler collection in Lund. A second copy, written in May or June 1817, was for Franz Sales Kandler's album: this version was marked Nicht zu geschwind (not too fast).|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} {{convention}} in Cincinnati, Tilden remained ambiguous about his intentions. [...] George Gray, Delaware's attorney general, placed Bayard's name in nomination, calling the senator [...] "a veteran, covered in scars of many a hard-fought battle, where the principles of constitutional liberty have been at stake... Bayard is a statesman who will need <b>no</b> <b>introduction</b> to the American people." [...] When {{the convention}} took its first ballot on June 23, Bayard placed second with 153½ votes, trailing only Hancock, who had 171. [...] On the second ballot, the delegates broke for Hancock, and he was nominated. [...] The Southern delegates, whom Bayard thought would be most loyal to him, {{were among the first}} to desert him. [...] The convention nominated William Hayden English of Indiana, a Bayard supporter and hard-money man, for vice president, and then closed. [...] Bayard's supporters were disappointed, but he supported the ticket as usual, in the interest of party unity. [...] Hancock and English fought to a near-draw in the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote to James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur by 214 to 155.|$|E

50|$|The TV special {{was unlike}} most musical {{programs}} of its time, {{with the numbers}} performed outdoors on locations {{instead of the usual}} stage-bound production filmed before a live audience. Sinatra sang while driving down the highway, strolling in the California countryside, and aloft in a hot-air balloon. She performed duets with the guest stars she encountered along the way, with <b>no</b> <b>introductions</b> or interstitial dialog. The general effect was of a dream-like fantasy that flows from one location to the next, with segments resembling the later format of music videos.|$|R

2500|$|A telling {{indication}} {{of the position of}} the Porcellian in the Boston establishment is given by an historian of Boston's Trinity Church, Porcellian member H. H. Richardson's architectural masterpiece. In speculating as to why Richardson was chosen, he writes, [...] "The thirty-four-year-old possessed one great advantage over the other candidates: as a popular Harvard undergraduate he {{had been a member of}} several clubs, including the prestigious Porcellian; thus he needed <b>no</b> <b>introduction</b> to the rector, Phillips Brooks, or five of the eleven-man building committeethey were all fellow Porcellian members." ...|$|E

[...] 1UP.com's Cocke felt that more {{could have been done}} to differentiate Thongs of Virtue from its predecessor. He commended Hothead Games for releasing the sequel so quickly, but felt [...] "that [...] has obviously {{come at the expense of}} any big improvements over the first one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Disciples and brothers: [...] {{states that}} Paul knew that Jesus had 12 disciples, and {{considers}} Peter {{as one of}} them. [...] further indicates that Peter was known in Corinth before the writing of 1 Corinthians, for it assumes that they were familiar with Cephas/Peter. The statement in 1 Corinthians 15:5 indicates that [...] "the twelve" [...] as {{a reference to the}} twelve apostles was a generally known notion within the early Christian Church in Corinth and required no further explanation from Paul. [...] further states that Paul personally knew Peter and stayed with him in Jerusalem for fifteen days, about three years after his conversion. It also implies that Peter was already known to the Galatians and required <b>no</b> <b>introduction.</b> [...] and [...] state that Jesus had brothers, one being called James, whom Paul met or [...] "saw." [...] James was claimed by early Christian writers as Origen and Eusebius to have been the leader of the followers of Jesus, after his brother's death, and to have been the first bishop, or bishop of bishops in Jerusalem.|$|E

2500|$|The Conservatives {{now had a}} clear {{majority}} in the House of Commons and could govern for five years before holding a general election, but Baldwin felt bound by Bonar Law's pledge at the previous election {{that there would be}} <b>no</b> <b>introduction</b> of tariffs without a further election. Thus Baldwin turned towards a degree of protectionism which would remain a key party message during his lifetime. With the country facing growing unemployment in the wake of free trade imports driving down prices and profits, Baldwin decided to call an early general election in December 1923 to seek a mandate to introduce protectionist tariffs which, he hoped, would drive down unemployment and spur an economic recovery. He expected to unite his party but he divided it, for protectionism proved a divisive issue. [...] The election was inconclusive: the Conservatives elected 258 MPs, Labour 191 and the reunited Liberals 159. Whilst the Conservatives retained a plurality in the House of Commons, they had been clearly defeated on the central issue: tariffs. Baldwin remained Prime Minister until the opening session of the new Parliament in January 1924, at which time the government was defeated in a motion of confidence vote. He resigned immediately.|$|E
