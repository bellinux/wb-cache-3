5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for Alzheimer's disease; {{available}} treatments offer {{relatively small}} symptomatic benefit but remain palliative in nature. Current treatments {{can be divided}} into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving.|$|E
5|$|Since Alzheimer's has <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> and it {{gradually}} renders people incapable of tending {{for their own}} needs, caregiving is essentially the treatment and must be carefully managed {{over the course of}} the disease.|$|E
5|$|There is {{currently}} <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> or effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) which slows {{progression of the}} disease. As of 2010 more than 6.6million people were taking them in low and middle income countries. Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections.|$|E

5|$|Sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes wakes from a coma {{discovering}} a world overrun by zombies. After befriending Morgan Jones, whom he becomes separated from, Rick travels to Atlanta {{to find his}} wife Lori, his son, Carl, and his police partner, Shane Walsh, encountering other survivors. The group travels to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), but find from the sole remaining CDC member that <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> exists for the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The onion eelworm (Ditylenchus dipsaci), a tiny {{parasitic}} soil-living nematode, causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young {{plants are}} killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. <b>No</b> <b>cure</b> is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site {{should not be}} used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots, parsnips, and beans, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for polio. The {{focus of}} modern {{treatment}} {{has been on}} providing relief of symptoms, speeding recovery and preventing complications. Supportive measures include antibiotics to prevent infections in weakened muscles, analgesics for pain, moderate exercise and a nutritious diet. Treatment of polio often requires long-term rehabilitation, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, braces, corrective shoes and, in some cases, orthopedic surgery.|$|E
50|$|There are <b>no</b> <b>cures</b> for FHS. Close {{monitoring}} {{of growth in}} the first few years is essential, as well as annual general health screening and tests listed below. An FHS diagnosis will affect the individual and those there to support them.|$|R

5|$|Ajax kidnaps her {{and takes}} {{her to a}} {{decommissioned}} helicarrier in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him rescue Vanessa. While Colossus and Negasonic battle Angel and several soldiers, Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa from the falling ship, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again, but reveals that there is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> after Deadpool overpowers him. Despite Colossus's pleading, Deadpool kills Ajax, though he promises to try and be more heroic moving forward. Though Vanessa is angry at Wilson for leaving her, she reconciles with him.|$|E
5|$|At the Greene farm, Hershel {{reveals that}} Carl needs major surgery to live, {{and that he}} will need a respirator. Otis {{suggests}} that they might find supplies at a nearby high school—where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a trailer—although the place is likely overrun with walkers. Otis and Shane decide to get the supplies, while Maggie retrieves Lori from the group and brings her to the Greene home. Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic; Rick believes there is <b>no</b> <b>cure,</b> while Hershel has faith that there could be one.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality. While treatment can slow worsening, there is <b>no</b> <b>cure.</b> COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed.|$|E

5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for the disorder at present.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is <b>no</b> <b>cure.</b> Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for Tourette's and no {{medication}} that works universally {{for all individuals}} without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders. The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, behavioral and psychological therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.|$|E

5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} {{can help}} control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 {{percent of cases}} can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. <b>No</b> <b>cure</b> {{for the common}} cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. <b>No</b> <b>cure</b> for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} train, Sinclair's group are arrested by {{soldiers}} armed with archaic weapons and armor. They {{are taken to}} a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is <b>no</b> <b>cure,</b> only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, {{the rest of the}} group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for HD, {{but there}} are {{treatments}} available to reduce the severity {{of some of its}} symptoms. For many of these treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete. As the disease progresses the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed multidisciplinary caregiving becomes increasingly necessary. Although there have been relatively few studies of exercises and therapies that help rehabilitate cognitive symptoms of HD, there is some evidence for the usefulness of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. An association between caffeine intake and earlier age of onset in Huntington's disease has been found but, since this finding was based on retrospective questionnaire data rather than a blinded, randomized trial or case-control study, this work is a poor basis for guiding lifestyle decisions.|$|E
