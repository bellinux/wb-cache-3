5|$|Like Usmar Ismail, Djajakusuma was {{influenced}} by realism. However, while Ismail preferred to focus on national-level themes, Djajakusuma was more drawn to simple, locally relevant storylines with educational messages. This realism carried over into Djajakusuma's work in wayang. The settings, traditionally drawn, were instead created as three-dimensional sets, including representations of trees, rocks, and water. According to Soemardjono, who often edited Djajakusuma's films, the director enjoyed experimenting with <b>new</b> <b>techniques</b> to better convey his intentions.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{existing}} techniques for calculating dynamic loads for flexible airplanes and presents a <b>new</b> <b>technique.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> involves the summation-of-forces method of writing dynamic loads equations. Until now {{this form of}} the dynamic loads equations has been formulated in the frequency domain. The <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> uses s-plane approximation methods (previously applied only to the equations of motion) to transform the dynamic loads equations from a second-order frequency-domain formulation with frequency-dependent coefficients into a linear-time-invariant state-space formulation. Several numerical examples demonstrate the usefulfness of the <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> and the high quality of the results. In addition, a convergence investigation establishes that the summation-of-forces method converges more quickly (that is, with fewer modes) than does the mode displacement method...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a relatively <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> for {{the identification of}} multiple power quality disturbances recorded in industrial power systems in Malaysia.

40|$|Abstract- A <b>new</b> {{adaptive}} signal-preserving <b>technique</b> for {{noise suppression}} in functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data is proposed based on spectrum subtraction. The proposed technique estimates a model for the power spectrum of random noise from the acquired data. This model is used to estimate a noise-suppressed power spectrum for any given pixel time course by simple subtraction of power spectra. The <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> is tested using computer simulations and real data for event-related fMRI experiments. The results show the potential of the <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> in suppressing noise while preserving the other deterministic components. Moreover, further analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) shows a significant improvement in both convergence and clarity of results when the <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> is used. This suggests the value of the <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> as a useful preprocessing step for this type of signals...|$|R
40|$|A <b>new</b> {{computational}} <b>technique</b> for distortion {{analysis of}} nonlinear circuits is presented. The <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> is {{applicable to the}} same class of circuits, namely, weakly nonlinear and time-varying circuits, as the periodic Volterra series.

Moreover, the <b>new</b> <b>technique</b> naturally allows computing and characterizing the contributions of individual circuit components to the overall circuit distortion. This paper presents the theory of the <b>new</b> <b>technique,</b> a discussion of the numerical aspects, and numerical results...|$|R
