[...] "Yamato" [...] is <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> but rather a codename assigned to him {{for the purposes of}} joining Team Kakashi. Unlike Kakashi, who was his senior in the ANBU and referred to him as , Yamato believes ninja should be able to look after themselves to the point of leaving behind any he sees as a hindrance. During his childhood, Yamato was abducted by Orochimaru and experimented upon in an attempt to replicate Hashirama's Wood Style. In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato's memories as he was taken in by Danzo to serve as a Root operative under the code name [...] But after meeting Kakashi, Kinoe eventually left Root and joined the Anbu as Tenzo.|$|E
500|$|Sergeant Reckless was {{chestnut}} colored with a blaze {{and three}} white stockings. Her {{date of birth}} and parentage are unconfirmed, but she {{was estimated to be}} around three or four years old when she was purchased by members of the United States Marine Corps in October 1952. She was sold to the Marines by her owner, a young Korean stableboy called Kim Huk Moon, though that was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>real</b> <b>name.</b> The horse was originally named [...] in Korean, which translates to [...] "Morning Flame" [...] or [...] "Flame-of-the-Morning", also reputed to be the name of her dam, a racehorse at the track in Seoul. Moon sold the horse, whom he had nicknamed [...] "Flame", to Lieutenant Eric Pedersen for $250 in order to buy a leg prosthesis for his sister, who had stepped on a land mine. The horse's breeding was thought to be primarily Mongolian though she did have some features, particularly the shape of her head, that were similar to horses of Thoroughbred lineage. She was small, standing only [...] and weighing [...]|$|E
500|$|M. C. Gainey {{first met}} Lost {{producer}} Carlton Cuse {{while working on}} The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. The {{opportunity to work with}} Cuse again was motivation enough to take the part of Tom, even without a script or description of the character. Gainey watches every episode of the series, but admits to not knowing what is happening much of the time. In his first appearance, in the season one finale [...] "Exodus: Part 2", Gainey was credited as [...] "bearded man", and was lovingly called [...] "Gay Tom" [...] in season 4. then in his season two appearances as [...] "Mr. Friendly". In the Official Lost Podcast, Damon Lindelof confirmed Mr. Friendly is <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> but is how the producers refer to him internally, because [...] "he's so friendly"; however, his surname was later suggested to actually be Friendly during Comic-Con 2009. He is nicknamed [...] "Zeke" [...] by Sawyer in [...] "The Hunting Party", which led to some critics using this name for him. In the season two finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", his name is revealed to be Tom. On his character's death, Gainey noted that [...] "just because they kill you on this show, don't mean they don't need you anymore 'cause everybody's got a past." ...|$|E

Although he claims this was not true, he prefers Duck to Montague and now that is what everyone calls him.|$|R

In his analysis, Jayaratha (1150–1200 AD) – who was Abhinavagupta's most important commentator – also reveals three more meanings: [...] "being ever vigilant", [...] "being present everywhere" [...] and [...] "protected by praises". Raniero Gnoli, the only Sanskrit scholar who completed {{a translation of}} Tantrāloka in a European language, mentions that [...] "Abhinava" [...] also means [...] "new", as {{a reference to the}} ever-new creative force of his mystical experience.|$|E

60|$|But Judge Webb {{assures us}} that Shakespeare himself informs {{us in the}} sonnets that 'Shakespeare was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> but the noted weed in which he kept invention.'

6000|$|The {{mention of}} that name which he enjoyed {{in common with the}} actor made Verrian furious, for when the actor first {{appeared}} with it in New York Verrian had been at the pains to find out that it was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> and that he had merely taken it because of the weak quality of romance in it, which Verrian himself had always disliked.

6000|$|The lines capitalised {{are thus}} {{explained}} by the Judge: 'Here the author certainly intimates that Shakespeare is <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> {{and that he was}} fearful lest his real name should be discovered.' The author says nothing about Shakespeare not being his real name, nor about his fear lest his real name should be discovered. He even 'quibbles on his own Christian name,' WILL, as Mr. Phillipps and everyone else have noted. What he means is: 'Why am I so monotonous that every word almost tells my name?' 'To keep invention in a noted weed' means, of course, to present his genius always in the same well-known attire. There is nothing about disguise of a name, or of anything else, in the sonnet.* ...|$|E

When I remember the departed, it is not always easy to bear the thought. I keep it at the bottom of my heart; but this visit to-day has too terribly revived every thing. It is well that you only are here to witness my suffering, but you will not have to witness it again, for we will never again speak of these matters." ...|$|E
6000|$|Notwithstanding these foibles, {{and various}} others needless to mention--but {{by no means}} of a refined or {{elevating}} character--how pretty she was! How charming she looked, when she came down on a sunny Sunday morning, well-dressed and well-humoured, robed in pale lilac silk, and with her fair long curls reposing on her white shoulders. Sunday was a holiday which she always passed with friends resident in town; and amongst these friends she speedily gave me to understand was one who would fain become something more. By glimpses and hints it was shown me, and by the general buoyancy of her look and manner it was ere long proved, that ardent admiration--perhaps genuine love--was at her command. She called her suitor [...] "Isidore:" [...] this, however, she intimated was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> but one by which it pleased her to baptize him--his own, she hinted, not being [...] "very pretty." [...] Once, {{when she had been}} bragging about the vehemence of [...] "Isidore's" [...] attachment, I asked if she loved him in return.|$|E

Nothing {{is known}} of the {{personality}} of either Eraclius or Theophilus, but what may be collected from their works; amounting, in the first case, to {{the facts of the}} author's [...] "language being barbarous, his credulity exceptionable, and his knowledge superficial," [...] together with his written description as [...] "vir sapientissimus;" [...] while all that is positively known of Theophilus is that he was a monk, and that Theophilus was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>real</b> <b>name.</b> The character, however, of which the assumed name is truly expressive, deserves from us no unrespectful attention; we shall best possess our readers of it by laying before them one or two passages from the preface. We shall make some use of Mr. Hendrie's translation; it is evidently the work of a tasteful man, and in most cases renders the feeling of the original faithfully; but the Latin, monkish though it be, deserved a more accurate following, and many of Mr. Hendrie's deviations bear traces of unsound scholarship.

60|$|For this he {{diligently}} practised with bow {{and arrow}} when alone, or only with Piers, and learnt all the feats of arms that Simon Runce or Giles Spearman could teach him. Spearman was evidently an accomplished knight or esquire; he had fought in France {{as well as in}} the home wars, and knew all the refinements of warfare in an age when the extreme weight of the armour rendered training and skill doubly necessary. Spearman was evidently <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>real</b> <b>name,</b> and it was evident that he had some knowledge of Hal's real rank, though he never hazarded mention of other name or title. The great drawback was the want of horses. The little mountain ponies did not adequately represent the warhorses trained to charge under an enormous load, and the buff jerkins and steel breast-plates of the outlaws were equally far from showing how to move under 'mail and plates of Milan steel.' Nor would Sir Lancelot Threlkeld lend or give what was needful. Indeed, he was more cautious than ever, and seemed really alarmed as well as surprised to see how tall and manly his step-son was growing, and how like his father. He would not hear of a visit to Threlkeld under any disguise, though Lady Clifford was in failing health, nor would he do anything to forward the young lord's knightly training. In effect, he only wanted to keep as quiet and unobserved as possible, for everything was in a most unsettled and dangerous condition, and there was no knowing what course was the safest for one by no means prepared to lose life or lands in any cause.|$|E
