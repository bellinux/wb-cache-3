5|$|DAB {{has also}} been marketed as having two major {{advantages}} over analogue radio broadcasting in that using MPEG-1 Audio Layer II lossy audio compression technology and more recently DAB+ using High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding, parts of the audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as multiplexing technology, allows a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} uncoded {{transmission}} of a bivariate Gaussian source over a two-user symmetric Gaussian broadcast channel with a unit-delay noiseless feedback (GBCF), assuming that each (uncoded) source sample is transmitted using a finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> uses, {{and that the}} transmission scheme is linear. We consider three transmission schemes: The scheme of Ardestanizadeh et al., {{which is based on}} linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control theory, the scheme of Ozarow and Leung (OL), and a novel scheme derived in this work designed using a dynamic programing (DP) approach. For the LQG scheme we characterize the minimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> uses needed to achieve a specified mean-square error (MSE). For the OL scheme we present lower and upper bounds on the minimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> uses needed to achieve a specified MSE, which become tight when the signal-to-noise ratio approaches zero. Finally, we show that for any fixed and finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> uses, the proposed DP scheme achieves MSE lower than the MSE achieved by either the LQG or the OL schemes.

5|$|The first {{television}} signal broadcast in Croatia occurred in 1939 during the Zagreb Fair, where Philips showcased its television system. The first regular broadcasts started in 1956, when Television Zagreb was established {{as the first}} TV station in the Yugoslav Radio Television system. Color broadcasts began in 1975. Coverage and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> grew steadily, and by the 2000s there were four channels with nationwide coverage in Croatia. DVB-T signal broadcasts began in 2002, and in 2010 a full digital switchover was completed. During that period the IPTV, cable and satellite television markets grew considerably, and by 2011 only 60.7 percent of households received DVB-T television only; the remainder were subscribed to IPTV, cable and satellite TV in addition, or as the sole source of TV reception. As of January 2012 DVB-T is broadcast in three multiplexes, while the territory of Croatia is divided into nine main allotment regions and smaller local allotments corresponding to major cities. High-definition television (HDTV) is broadcast only through IPTV, although HDTV DVB-T test programming was broadcast from 2007 to 2011. A DVB-T2 test broadcast was conducted in 2011.|$|E

30|$|Another trend we {{can observe}} from Figure  11 {{is that the}} {{throughput}} increases significantly with the lifting <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>channels</b> and the average energy consumption decrease monotonically. Further, with the increase <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>channels,</b> the system will approach the ideal case of zero propagation delay and achieve better throughput and energy efficiency. For example, when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>channels</b> is 4, the throughput gap between the actual system and the ideal system is 1.1 kbps. When the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>channels</b> increases to 32, this gap is reduced to 0.2 kbps.

25|$|On March 4, 1996 EchoStar {{introduced}} Digital Sky Highway (Dish Network) {{using the}} EchoStar 1 satellite. EchoStar launched a second satellite in September 1996 {{to increase the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> available on Dish Network to 170. These systems provided better pictures and stereo sound on 150-200 video and audio channels, and allowed small dishes to be used. This greatly reduced the popularity of TVRO systems.

25|$|The {{amount of}} data that can be {{transmitted}} (and therefore the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels)</b> is directly affected by channel capacity and the modulation method of the channel. The modulation method in DVB-T is COFDM with either 64 or 16-state Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). In general, a 64QAM channel is capable of transmitting a greater bit rate, but is more susceptible to interference. 16 and 64QAM constellations can be combined in a single multiplex, providing a controllable degradation for more important program streams. This is called hierarchical modulation.|$|E
25|$|Later {{compression}} technology, {{implemented in}} codecs like MPEG4, H.264 or VC-1, can enable {{a substantial increase}} in either quality or capacity due to their increased efficiency, but use of such technologies would again require most viewers to purchase new reception equipment, since the vast majority of standard set-top boxes support only the older MPEG2 encoding. BSkyB were the first to suggest such a move to increase the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> available within their own share of space using MPEG4 on a subscription service. However, BSkyB's proposals were ultimately shelved following regulatory delays.|$|E
40|$|Transmitting data {{reliably}} over noisy communication <b>channels</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} important applications of information theory, and is well understood for channels modelled by classical physics.

In fact, entanglement across channel uses can even increase the coherent information from zero to non-zero. Here we study the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> uses necessary to detect positive coherent information. In all previous known examples, two channel uses already sufficed.
