50|$|Signaling {{from the}} ZLI {{cooperating}} with thalamic and prethalamic markers ensures {{the migration of}} post-mitotic (neural progenitor) cells to the mantle zone where the cells assemble into nuclei characteristic of the thalamus. These nuclei are the mechanism of the relay of information from the thalamus to the cortex. The thalamus itself is highly diverse, with each nucleus having distinct morphologies and physiologies according to {{the region of the}} brain to which it is connected. These differences are thought to originate in differential gene expression in the thalamus and prethalamus, which allows for a single structure with multiple different and separate functions once the two have merged and completed growth and differentiation. So an functional interplay between Shh from the ZLI and the bHLH factor Her6 (homolog to HES1) determines the <b>neuronal</b> <b>identity</b> within the thalamus: Her6 positive cells in the prethalamus and rostral thalamus differentiate into GABAergic inhibitory neurons, whereas her negative cells become glutamatergic relay neurons.

In this study, we demonstrate that the PcG-like genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, sop- 2 and sor- 3, regulate {{the formation of}} dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons and several other neuronal properties. sor- 3 encodes a novel protein containing an MBT repeat, a domain that contains histone-binding activity and is present in PcG proteins SCM and Sfmbt in other organisms. We further show that mutations in sor- 3 lead to ectopic expression of Hox genes and cause homeotic transformations. Specification of certain <b>neuronal</b> <b>identities</b> by these PcG-like genes appears to involve regulation of non-Hox gene targets.

40|$|SummaryCell {{diversity}} and {{organization in the}} neural tube depend on the integration of extrinsic signals acting along orthogonal axes. These are believed to specify distinct cellular identities by triggering all-or-none changes in expression of combinations of transcription factors [1]. Under the influence of a common dorsoventral signal, sonic hedgehog, and distinct anterior-posterior (A-P) inductive signals [2, 3], two topographically related progenitor pools that share a common transcriptional code produce serotonergic and V 3 neurons in the hindbrain and spinal cord, respectively [4 – 7]. These neurons have different physiological properties, functions, and connectivity [8, 9]. Serotonergic involvement in neuropsychiatric diseases has prompted greater characterization of their postmitotic repertoire of fate determinants, which include Gata 2, Lmx 1 b, and Pet 1 [10], whereas V 3 neurons express Sim 1 [4]. How distinct serotonergic and V 3 <b>neuronal</b> <b>identities</b> emerge from progenitors that share a common transcriptional code is not understood. Here, we show that changes in retinoid activity in these two progenitor pools determine their fates. Retinoids, via Notch signaling, control the expression level in progenitors of the transcription factor Ascl 1, which selects serotonergic and V 3 <b>neuronal</b> <b>identities</b> in a dose-dependent manner.

NeuroD, Ngns, Mash, ‘’Olig’’ and other proneural gene families have a crucial role in cell fate decision during corticogenesis and different combinations of them regulate the choice and the timing of differentiation into a neuron, an astrocyte or an oligodendrocyte.High levels of Ngn1 and Ngn2 are required to specify <b>neuronal</b> <b>identity</b> of cortical progenitors only in early stages of neocortex development.Particularly, ngn2 is also important to regulate the transition of cortical progenitors from the ventricular zone to the subventricular zone.

Cooperation between ngn2 and mash1 proneural genes regulate the transition of cortical progenitors from apical to basal cell compartments. The specification of different neuronal subtypes depends on the group of proneural genes involved. Low levels of proneural transcripts in ventricular zone are expressed when progenitor’s specification occurs and an increase in their expression results in the beginning of neurogenesis.

Transcription factor Zbtb 20 {{has been shown}} to play a role for hippocampal development but whether it is implicated in mammalian neocortical morphogenesis remains unknown. RESULTS: Here, we report that during embyogenesis transcription factor Zbtb 20 has a dynamic spatio-temporal expression pattern in mitotic cortical progenitors through which it modulates the sequential generation of cortical <b>neuronal</b> layer <b>identities.</b> Zbtb 20 knock out mice exhibited enhanced populations of early born L 6 -L 4 neuronal subtypes and a dramatic reduction of the late born L 3 /L 2 neurons. This defect was due to a temporal misbalance in the production of earlier versus later born neurons, leading to a progressive diminishing of the progenitor pool for the generation of L 3 -L 2 neurons. Zbtb 20 implements these temporal effects in part by binding to promoter of the orphan nuclear receptor CoupTF 1 /Nr 2 f 1. In addition to its effects exerted in cortical progenitors, the postmitotic expression of Zbtb 20 in L 3 /L 2 neurons starting at birth may contribute to their proper differentiation and migration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal Zbtb 20 as a novel temporal regulator for the generation of layer-specific <b>neuronal</b> <b>identities...</b>|$|R

However, how the mechanisms that confer <b>neuronal</b> <b>identity</b> are integrated with upstream regional specification networks is still mysterious. Expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), is required for hypothalamic specification and is later downregulated by Tbx 3 {{to allow for the}} differentiation of the tubero-mamillary region. In this region, the mamillary body (MBO), is a large neuronal aggregate essential for memory formation. To clarify how MBO identity is acquired after regional specification, we investigated Lhx 5, a transcription factor with restricted MBO expression. We first generated a hypomorph allele of Lhx 5 —in homozygotes, the MBO disappears after initial specification. Intriguingly, in these mutants, Tbx 3 was downregulated and the Shh expression domain abnormally extended. Microarray analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that Lhx 5 appears to be involved in Shh downregulation through Tbx 3 and activates several MBO-specific regulator and effector genes. Finally, by tracing the caudal hypothalamic cell lineage we show that, in the Lhx 5 mutant, at least some MBO cells are present but lack characteristic marker expression.

Consistent with this hypothesis, Ngn 2 enhancer activity {{is dependent on the}} function of Pax 6, a homeodomain factor involved in specifying the identity of ventral spinal cord progenitors. Moreover, we show that Ngn 2 is required for the correct expression of Pax 6 and several homeodomain proteins expressed in defined neuronal populations.

40|$|SummaryNeuron {{identity}} transformations occur upon {{removal of}} specific regulatory factors {{in many different}} cellular contexts, thereby revealing the fundamental principle of alternative cell identity choices made during nervous system development. One common molecular interpretation of such homeotic cell identity transformations is that a regulatory factor has a dual function in activating genes defining one cellular identity and repressing genes that define an alternative identity. We provide evidence for an alternative, competition-based mechanism. We show that the MEC- 3 LIM homeodomain protein can outcompete the execution of a neuropeptidergic differentiation program by direct interaction with the UNC- 86 /Brn 3 POU homeodomain protein. MEC- 3 thereby prevents UNC- 86 from collaborating with the Zn finger transcription factor PAG- 3 /Gfi to induce peptidergic neuron identity and directs UNC- 86 to induce an alternative differentiation program toward a glutamatergic <b>neuronal</b> <b>identity.</b> Homeotic control of <b>neuronal</b> <b>identity</b> programs has implications {{for the evolution of}} neuronal cell types...|$|E

In Gdf 7 -null mutant embryos, the generation of D 1 A neurons is eliminated but D 1 B neurons and other identified dorsal interneurons are unaffected. These findings show that GDF 7 is an inductive signal from the roof plate required for the specification of <b>neuronal</b> <b>identity</b> in the dorsal spinal cord and that GDF 7 and other BMP family members expressed by the roof plate have non-redundant functions in vivo.

All C. elegans Otx genes and rat Otx 1 can substitute for ceh- 37 and ceh- 36, but only ceh- 37 functionally substitutes for ttx- 1. Functional substitution in the AWB neurons is mediated by activation of the same downstream target lim- 4 by different Otx genes.

Increasing Shh in vivo enhances PCD in dorsal DRG, while inducing greater proliferation ventrally. In such animals, markers characteristic of ventral sensory neurons are expanded to more dorsal positions. Conversely, reducing Shh function results in decreased proliferation of progenitors in the ventral region and decreased expression of the ventral marker trkC. Later arising trkA+ afferents make significant pathfinding errors in animals with reduced Shh function, suggesting that accurate navigation of later arising growth cones requires either Shh itself or early arising, Shh-dependent afferents.

Previously, we showed that treatment of neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) with bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) leads to an induction of MASH 1 expression and consequent autonomic neuronal differentiation. We now show that BMP 2 also induces expression of the paired homeodomain transcription factor Phox 2 a, and the GDNF/NTN signalling receptor tyrosine kinase c-RET. Constitutive expression of MASH 1 in NCSCs from a retroviral vector, {{in the absence of}} exogenous BMP 2, induces expression of both Phox 2 a and c-RET in a large fraction of infected colonies, and also promotes morphological neuronal differentiation and expression of pan-neuronal markers. In vivo, expression of Phox 2 a in autonomic ganglia is strongly reduced in Mash 1 -/- embryos. These loss- and gain-of-function data suggest that MASH 1 positively regulates expression of Phox 2 a, either directly or indirectly. Constitutive expression of Phox 2 a, by contrast to MASH 1, fails to induce expression of neuronal markers or a neuronal morphology, but does induce expression of c-RET.

We have challenged this prevailing notion by showing that angiogenesis in the mouse telencephalon progresses in an orderly, ventral-to-dorsal gradient regulated in a cell-autonomous manner by compartment-specific homeobox transcription factors. These are the same transcription factors that confer compartmental identities on telencephalic neurons and progenitor populations. Thus, the same cell-autonomous, regional patterning signals that regulate development of telencephalic neuronal networks also regulate development of telencephalic vascular networks, underscoring shared mechanisms in CNS vascular and neuronal development. These novel concepts represent a new twist in the intriguing tale of CNS angiogenesis and offer new perspectives on telencephalic regionalization and histogenesis principles...|$|R
