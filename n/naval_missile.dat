While the doctors remove her organs for donation, she suddenly comes {{back from the dead}} and yells highly classified <b>naval</b> <b>missile</b> codes. Fringe Division arrives to investigate, along with a naval officer; he tells them the codes are tied to a missing sailor called Andrew Rusk (Chazz Menendez). Lisa is unaware of the numbers or Rusk, but suddenly starts speaking Russian while Olivia (Anna Torv), Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter (John Noble) question her. The naval officer informs them that Rusk is fluent in the language.|$|E
25|$|Studies of the rocket-ramjet and solid-fueled ramjet {{concepts}} {{began at}} the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Missile Test Center– later the <b>Naval</b> <b>Missile</b> Center– at Point Mugu, California in 1956, {{with the intent of}} increasing the range of small air-to-air missiles through using the combined ramjet and rocket propulsion system with solid fuels only. Following extensive ground testing, the concept was considered promising enough for a flight-test vehicle to be constructed to fully evaluate the new engine.|$|E
