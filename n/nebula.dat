The center of Corvus {{is home to}} a planetary <b>nebula,</b> NGC 4361. The <b>nebula</b> itself resembles a small elliptical galaxy and has a magnitude of 10.3, but the magnitude 13 star at its centre gives away its true nature.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball <b>Nebula,</b> known by its catalogue designation of NGC 1514. This planetary <b>nebula</b> is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the <b>nebula</b> that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this <b>nebula</b> to deduce that the <b>nebula</b> is a luminous gas, rather than stars.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the border}} with Circinus is the unusual {{planetary}} <b>nebula</b> NGC 5189, estimated to be around 1750light-years away from Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are distorted by the presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved Hourglass <b>Nebula</b> (MyCn18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta's west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish planetary <b>nebula</b> of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 light-years away from Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is NGC 4071, a large, diffuse planetary <b>nebula</b> of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 light-years away from Earth. The Coalsack <b>Nebula</b> is a dark <b>nebula</b> located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into Musca. NGC 4463 is an open cluster located on its southwestern border. Around five light-years across, it is located around 3400 light-years away.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. High quality {{spectrophotometric}} {{observations of}} 30 Planetary <b>Nebulae</b> in the Galactic Bulge have been made. Accurate reddenings, plasma parameters, and abundances of He, O, N, S, Ar, Cl are derived. We find the abundances of O, S, Ar in the Planetary <b>Nebulae</b> in the Galactic Bulge to be comparable with the abundances of the Planetary <b>Nebulae</b> in the Disk, high abundances being maybe slightly more frequent in the Bulge. The {{distribution of the}} N/O ratio does not present in the Galactic Bulge Planetary <b>Nebulae</b> the extension to high values that it presents in the Disk Planetary <b>Nebulae.</b> We interpret this as a signature of the greater age of Bulge Planetary <b>Nebulae.</b> We thus find the Bulge Planetary <b>Nebulae</b> {{to be an old}} population, slightly more metal-rich than the Disk Planetary <b>Nebulae.</b> The population of the Bulge Planetary <b>Nebulae</b> shows hence the same characteristics than the Bulge stellar population...|$|R
40|$|We have {{produced}} simulated images of 110 planetary <b>nebulae</b> using the ellipsoidal shell model. This process has {{allowed us to}} remove the projection effects from the morphological classification of planetary <b>nebulae</b> and has provided quantitative measures of the intrinsic asymmetries of the <b>nebulae.</b> It is shown that the morphology of most planetary <b>nebulae</b> can be reproduced with pole-to-equator density ratios of 0. 1 - 1. Many planetary <b>nebulae</b> also show a modest departure from axial symmetry. Contrary to previous findings by Khromov & Kohoutek, the sky orientation of planetary <b>nebulae</b> in this sample {{is consistent with a}} purely random distribution. Extremely bipolar <b>nebulae</b> (e. g., those of butterfly shape) point to a steep density profile in the AGB envelope {{and are more likely to}} be type I (high helium and/or nitrogen abundance) <b>nebulae.</b> We found evidence that these <b>nebulae</b> are likely to have more massive progenitors and are at a more advanced stage of dynamical evolution. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Nicknamed the spare-tyre <b>nebula,</b> IC 5148 is a {{planetary}} <b>nebula</b> located around 1 degree west of Lambda Gruis. Around 3000 light-years distant, it is expanding at 50 kilometres a second, {{one of the}} fastest rates of expansion of all planetary nebulae.|$|E
5|$|Sakurai's Object is {{surrounded}} by a planetary <b>nebula</b> created following the star's red giant phase around 8300 years ago. It has been determined that the <b>nebula</b> has a diameter of 44 arcseconds and expansion velocity of roughly 32km/s.|$|E
5|$|The known {{expansion}} {{rate of the}} Homunculus <b>Nebula</b> provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the <b>nebula</b> are symmetrical, the projection of the <b>nebula</b> onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250 and 2,300parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and Eta Carinae is clearly at the same distance.|$|E
40|$|Through a {{high-resolution}} spectroscopic survey, we {{analyze the}} velocity field of 16 planetary <b>nebulae</b> with [WC]- or wels-type nuclei {{in comparison with}} 8 <b>nebulae</b> having other central star types. We found spectral evidence for finite turbulent velocities in [WC]-type planetary <b>nebulae</b> superimposed on an essentially constant expansion velocity pattern. The <b>nebulae</b> around O-type stars show no evidences for significant turbulence while their expansion velocity is found to increase outwards. Both types of <b>nebulae</b> show the same mean expansion velocity. Our results support the earlier suggestions that <b>nebulae</b> surrounding [WC] central stars are likely related to long-lasting momentum-driven phase bubbles. Turbulence in the <b>nebulae</b> can be either triggered, or enhanced, by stellar wind inhomogeneities that appear ubiquitous in Wolf-Rayet nuclei...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Monoceros R 2 {{region was}} first {{recognized}} as a chain of reflection <b>nebulae</b> illuminated by A- and B-type stars. These <b>nebulae</b> {{are associated with a}} giant molecular cloud {{that is one of the}} closest massive star forming regions to the Sun. This chapter reviews the properties of the Mon R 2 region, including the namesake reflection <b>nebulae,</b> the large scale molecular cloud, global star formation activity, and properties of prominent star forming regions in the cloud. 1. The Mon R 2 Reflection <b>Nebulae</b> The Monoceros R 2 region is distinguished by a chain of reflection <b>nebulae</b> that extend over 2 ◦ on the sky.

5|$|The {{planetary}} <b>nebula</b> NGC 5315 has {{a magnitude}} of 9.8 around a central star of magnitude 14.2, located 5.2degrees west-southwest of Alpha Circini.

The dark <b>nebula</b> component is easily visible in a large amateur telescope, and it measures 12by5arcminutes. The smaller reflection <b>nebula</b> component requires a larger instrument and averted vision to be seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the bright portion of the <b>nebula</b> is primarily caused by the interaction of a fast stellar wind being emitted by the central PNN with the visible material ejected during {{the formation of the}} <b>nebula.</b> This interaction causes the emission of X-rays discussed above. The stellar wind, blowing with the velocity as high as , has 'hollowed out' the inner bubble of the <b>nebula,</b> and appears to have burst the bubble at both ends.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several anthologies {{collecting}} Nebula-winning short fiction.

The sales of these anthologies were intended to pay for presenting the awards themselves. The anthology The Best of the Nebulas (1989), edited by Ben Bova, collected winners of <b>Nebula</b> awards from 1966 through 1986 officially selected by SFWA members. The unofficial anthology <b>Nebula</b> Award Winning Novellas (1994), edited by Martin H. Greenberg, contained ten stories which had won the novella award between 1970 and 1989.|$|E
5000|$|Herschel {{published}} his discoveries as three catalogues: Catalogue of One Thousand New <b>Nebulae</b> and Clusters of Stars (1786), Catalogue of a Second Thousand New <b>Nebulae</b> and Clusters of Stars (1789) and the previously cited Catalogue of 500 New <b>Nebulae</b> ... (1802). He arranged his discoveries under eight [...] "classes": (I) bright <b>nebulae,</b> (II) faint <b>nebulae,</b> (III) very faint <b>nebulae,</b> (IV) planetary <b>nebulae,</b> (V) very large <b>nebulae,</b> (VI) very compressed and rich clusters of stars, (VII) compressed clusters {{of small and}} large and bright stars, and (VIII) coarsely scattered clusters of stars. Herschel's discoveries were supplemented by those of Caroline Herschel (11 objects) and his son John Herschel (1754 objects) and published by him as General Catalogue of <b>Nebulae</b> and Clusters in 1864. This catalogue was later edited by John Dreyer, supplemented with discoveries by many other 19th century astronomers, and published in 1888 as the New General Catalogue (abbreviated NGC) of 7840 deep sky objects. The NGC numbering {{is still the most}} commonly used identifying label for these celestial landmarks.|$|R

5|$|A {{degree to}} the {{northwest}} of ζ Tauri is the Crab <b>Nebula</b> (M1), a supernova remnant. This expanding <b>nebula</b> was created by a Type II supernova explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the <b>nebula</b> is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe. North American peoples also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the <b>nebula</b> spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the <b>nebula</b> condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting <b>nebula</b> to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E
50|$|The <b>nebula's</b> color {{depends on}} its {{chemical}} composition and degree of ionization. Due to the prevalence of hydrogen in interstellar gas, and its relatively low energy of ionization, many emission <b>nebulae</b> appear red due to the strong emissions of the Balmer series. If more energy is available, other elements will be ionized and green and blue <b>nebulae</b> become possible. By examining the spectra of <b>nebulae,</b> astronomers infer their chemical content. Most emission <b>nebulae</b> are about 90% hydrogen, with the remaining helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements.|$|R
