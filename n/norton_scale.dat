40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aims of {{this study}} were to examine and compare the {{predictive}} validity of 4 risk assessment scales used for the prediction of pressure ulcer (PrU) development and to identify risk factors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: A general hospital in Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (all aged ≥ 18 years) admitted to medical, surgical, orthopedic, oncology, and rehabilitation wards. Of 412 patients available, a total of 346 patients participated in the study. METHOD: Data were collected using the Swedish version of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel minimum data set as well as the Norton, Modified Norton, Braden, and Risk Assessment Pressure Sore (Ulcer) (RAPS) scales. The predictive validity was estimated by measuring sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors associated with PrUs. RESULTS: The RAPS scale reached best balance between sensitivity and specificity at the recommended cutoff level of ≤ 29, followed by the Braden scale and the <b>Norton</b> <b>scale</b> at recommended cutoff levels ≤ 18 versus ≤ 16, respectively. The modified <b>Norton</b> <b>scale</b> also reached an acceptable balance between sensitivity and specificity but at the cutoff level of ≤ 23, which is a higher cutoff level than recommended. General physical condition, physical activity, moisture, friction, and shear emerged as significant risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The results support that the recommended cutoff levels of the RAPS, Norton, and Braden scales are valid in a general hospital setting. However, the recommended cutoff level of the modified <b>Norton</b> <b>scale</b> (≤ 20) has to be increased when used in this care context...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{test the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the COMHON (Conscious level, Mobility, Haemodynamics, Oxygenation, Nutrition) Index. Background Pressure injury risk assessment is a crucial aspect in determining the relative risk of patients and the need for preventative intervention. In the intensive care setting there are few risk assessment scales that have been developed specifically for critically ill patients. Design Instrument development. Methods A convenience sample of 26 intensive care patients was used. Data were collected in December 2012. Five intensive care nurses scored each patient with all four scales. Intraclass correlation coefficients and standard errors of measurement were used to assess inter-rater reliability and agreement of the sum, risk category and item scores. Convergent validity of the COMHON Index was investigated by examining correlations between the sum scores and similar constructs of the scales. Results Inter-rater reliability of the COMHON Index was higher than the other scales and strong correlations were found between it and the Braden and <b>Norton</b> <b>scales</b> but not the Waterlow score. Two items common to all scales (mobility; neurological status) demonstrated significant correlations between the COMHON, Braden and <b>Norton</b> <b>scales</b> but not the Waterlow score. One item (nutrition) was significantly correlated between the COMHON and Braden scales. Conclusion Inter-rater reliability and agreement of the COMHON Index were the highest of the four <b>scales,</b> with the <b>Norton</b> and Braden performing similarly and the Waterlow score the least well. The strong and significant associations between the Braden, COMHON and <b>Norton</b> <b>scales</b> suggest they are measuring similar constructs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{modified}} Braden scale, to evaluate its predictive validity, and to identify a more valid pressure ulcer risk calculator for application in acute care hospitals in Mainland China among the modified Braden, Braden, and <b>Norton</b> <b>scales.</b> The initial modified Braden scale, with the addition of skin type and body build for height, was proposed in this study. Four hundred twenty-nine subjects who were admitted to two acute care hospitals in Mainland China within 24 hr and free of pressure ulcers upon admission were assessed with the initial modified Braden, Braden, and <b>Norton</b> <b>scales</b> by three nurse assessors. This was followed by a daily skin assessment to note any pressure ulcer by a nurse assessor. Nine subjects had pressure ulcers detected at Stages I (89 %) and II (11 %) after an average stay of 11 days. The descriptive analysis of each subscale scoring item in the initial modified Braden scale indicated that skin type and body build for height were the most distinct predictive factors whereas nutrition was the least distinct factor for predicting pressure ulcer development. Based on these findings, the modified Braden scale was further developed with the addition of skin type and body build for height and by exclusion of nutrition. The predictive validity test reported that the modified Braden scale demonstrated a better balance of sensitivity (89 %) and specificity (75 %) at a cutoff score of 16, with a higher positive predictive value (7 %), than the Braden and <b>Norton</b> <b>scales.</b> This finding revealed that for this sample, the modified Braden scale is more effective in pressure ulcer risk prediction than the other two scales. Because the modified Braden scale is not 100 % sensitive and specific, to increase clinical efficacy in the prevention of pressure ulcer, it is recommended that it be adopted combined with nursing judgment to predict pressure ulcer development in acute care settings in Mainland China.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{undergoing}} cardiovascular surgery are at {{high risk}} for sores because of impaired perfusion, the time spent on the operating room table, and restricted mobility in the immediate postoperative period. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for sores. METHODS: In a 900 -bed teaching hospital, 163 patients who underwent cardiovascular interventions were enrolled. Risk measurement included skin assessment, Braden and <b>Norton</b> <b>scales,</b> physic and biologic data and specific risk factors. The development of the most severe stages of pressure sores was followed (Stages II and III). RESULTS: Forty-eight (29. 5 %) patients totalized 75 pressure sores. In univariate analyses, Norton and Braden scores, hemoglobin concentration, presence of ulcers at admission, use of antihypertensive drugs, systemic use of corticosteroids, nosocomial infection, re-intervention and readmission in intensive care units were associated with sores. In a logistic regression model, hemoglobin concentration at admission (p= 0. 0007), postoperative Braden score (p= 0. 0002), and postoperative steroid therapy (p= 0. 020) were the only predictors of sores. Total length of stay was 6 days higher (p= 0. 03) for patients with pressure sores. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of risks is recommended during the entire stay. Identification of patients at risk is required to provide preventive resources appropriately, which can lessen the incidence of pressure sores and reduce patient discomfort, length and costs of hospital stay...|$|R

Patients and methods: Prospective cohort study in ICCU setting. Patients admitted for AMI: patients mean age 67. 5 ± 11. 5 years (n= 165). <b>Norton</b> <b>Scale,</b> Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), demographic, clinical and biochemical data collected at the time of ICCU admission have been tested in a logistic model to assess the odds ratios (ORs) of PI risk development. The jackknifed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the decision curve analysis have been employed to assess the additive predictive value of a factor. Results: Twenty-seven (16. 3 %) patients developed PIs. An increased PI risk was associated with advanced age (OR = 2. 5 every 10 -year increase; 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 5. 7), while probability of PI development was reduced in patients with higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (OR = 0. 4 every 5 % increase; 95 % CI = 0. 24 – 0. 66), MNA score (OR = 0. 65 every unit change; 95 % CI = 0. 44 – 0. 95) and <b>Norton</b> <b>Scale</b> score (OR = 0. 7 every unit change; 95 % CI = 0. 57 – 0. 88). The AUC and the decision curve analysis showed that LVEF inclusion improved the discrimination power and the clinical net benefit of the final model. Conclusion: Age, LVEF, <b>Norton</b> <b>Scale</b> and MNA scores have a strong and independent clinical value as predictors of in-hospital PI development in patients with AMI.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} whether risk assessment scales {{can be used}} to identify patients who are likely to get pressure ulcers. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Two large hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants 1229 patients admitted to the surgical, internal, neurological, or geriatric wards between January 1999 and June 2000. Main outcome measure Occurrence of a pressure ulcer of grade 2 or worse while in hospital. Results 135 patients developed pressure ulcers during four weeks after admission. The weekly incidence of patients with pressure ulcers was 6. 2 % (95 % confidence interval 5. 2 % to 7. 2 %). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0. 56 (0. 51 to 0. 61) for the <b>Norton</b> <b>scale,</b> 0. 55 (0. 49 to 0. 60) for the Braden scale, and 0. 61 (0. 56 to 0. 66) for the Waterlow scale; the areas for the subpopulation, excluding patients who received preventive measures without developing pressure ulcers and excluding surgical patients, were 0. 71 (0. 65 to 0. 77), 0. 71 (0. 64 to 0. 78), and 0. 68 (0. 61 to 0. 74), respectively. In this subpopulation, using the recommended cut­off points, the positive predictive value was 7. 0 % for the Norton, 7. 8 % for the Braden, and 5. 3 % for the Waterlow scale. Conclusion Although risk assessment scales predict the occurrence of pressure ulcers to some extent, routine use of these scales leads to inefficient use of preventive measures. An accurate risk assessment scale based on prospectively gathered data should be developed...|$|E
40|$|Background methods: Appearance of decubitus is a main {{indicator}} of therapeutic and nursing care quality and is monitored carefully. However, they supervence in despite of high-quality and professional care of nursing staff, {{because there are}} factors, which we cannot influence while decubitus emergence. The main purpose of research was to map the preventative and nursing care of clients with the risk of decubitus and with it, {{find out if the}} care is in high-quality and possibly debunk absences and deduce a treatment for work experience. Methodics: The research was done by quantitative method, by technique of secondary analysis of data. Analytic studies check if there is a relation among the watched features. The data was received from verified and enclosed nursing documentation of Home for senior citizens in Milevsko from years 2010 and 2011. Procured data was afterwards elaborated by descriptive statistics by Microsoft Excel and SPSS program. Validity of hypotheses was tested via Chí quadrate test. Research aggregate created nursing documentation of Home for senior citizens in Milevsko. This establishment has 36 beds and during the year 2010 and 2011, 85 clients were accomodated here. Consistent with the first research purpose "To map the high-risk factors, which increases the probability of decubitus emergence. " was evaluated nursing documentation of 85 clients. Consistent with the second research purpose "To find out, the precautionary measures belittling the risk of decubitus emergence of vulnerability client group. " was evaluated by nursing documentation of 54 clients. Consistent with the third research purpose "To map the nursing intervention of clients with decubitus. " was evaluated by nursing documentation of 10 clients. Results: From the research, results arose that there was the risk of decubitus emergence at every client of Home for senior citizens in Milevsko according to directory evaluative <b>Norton</b> <b>scale.</b> The final results demonstrated a high percentage 63, 4 % clients who were endangered by the decubitus emergence. After one month, a checking evaluation of the risk of decubitus emergence was made according to directory evaluative <b>Norton</b> <b>scale.</b> The results demonstrated the strong depression of the number of clients with the risk of decubitus emergence or at least the depression of risk. The last part of research was focused on watching the nursing intervention of the client group with decubitus and finding the fruitfulness of the decubitus treatment. The result demonstrated that the treatment was in most cases succesfull and that 80 % of clients were healed in four month. Conclusion: The important finding for the nursing staff was the assertion that the provided nursing care in Home for senior citizens in Milevsko has a good standard. Simultaneously, some absences were found like deficient resource of nutritive accessoires, damp healing of wounds, and utilities against decubitus in standard goings. The solving of these absences is to increase accessibility and awareness of professional doctors for resource of the necessary amount of nutritive accessoires, damp healing of wounds, and not to let clients with deficient financial resources to be entirely dependent on out of date medical advancement. Also, not to corrupt treatment and precautionary measures. The next important step is to motivate family members and imply them {{to take care of their}} relatives.

40|$|Abstract This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} nursing documentation in electronic and paper forms. Nursing documentation {{is a part}} of medical documentation and it is regulated by the same rules. It consists of records about nursing activities performed in respect to the patient. It also contains nursing case history, evaluation of the care of the patient, records about the patient´s condition, discharge and relocation reports and other documents, such as pain scales, Barthel index, Glasgow coma scale, records on bedsores, intake and excretion of liquids, monitoring of vital functions, <b>Norton</b> <b>scale</b> or records about wound treatment. To ensure a quality care of a patient {{it is very important to}} keep uniform nursing documentation. The bachelor thesis had four objectives. The first objective was to survey nurses´ opinions of individual types of nursing documentation. The second objective was to find out which type of nursing documentation is preferred by nurses and whether they prefer nursing documentation in paper or electronic form. The third objective was to define the form of nursing documentation used by the surveyed medical facilities. The last objective was to identify problems encountered in the course of introduction of electronic nursing documentation. To achieve those objectives I approached respondents from two medical facilities. Seven respondents answered questions in one-to-one interviews in the retirement home Máj in České Budějovice and the same number of respondents answered questions in one-to-one interviews in the Hospital České Budějovice a. s. The collection of qualitative data consisted in the individual nature of the interviews with the respondents. After the processing the data have shown that respondents from the retirement home Máj expressed their complete satisfaction with the nursing documentation in electronic form. The respondents from the Hospital in České Budějovice preferred nursing documentation on paper, however, they believed that the documentation should be modified. Some of them were interested in trying nursing documentation in electronic form. The results of the bachelor thesis have shown different opinions of the nursing documentation among the respondents. The conclusions from the research may play a key role in decision-making about the introduction of a new documentation or improvement of the already well-established nursing documentation in medical facilities...|$|E
40|$|Displaced femoral neck {{fractures}} comprise {{more than}} a third of all hip fractures. There is controversy as to the optimal treatment. Despite attempts to improve the methods for internal fixation, complication rates have been almost unchanged: 20 - 40 % non-union and late segmental collapse in another 10 - 20 %. Internal fixation has been the preferred treatment in Scandinavia, whereas primary hemi- or total arthroplasty have been more prevalent in the rest of Europe and North America. In this study, patients 75 years or older, including those with mental impairment, were randomized to either internal fixation or cemented primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). A total of 146 hips in 143 patients were followed for two years. After one year 23 % had died, and after two years 29 %. Mortality was about the same in both groups. The accumulated mortality was pronounced among the mentally impaired patients. In the internal fixation group, 44 % underwent further surgery. In the THA group, 18 % dislocated. The dislocation rate was higher for the mentally impaired patients. The Harris hip scores were higher in the THA group, whereas pain was more common in the internal fixation group. The first 50 patients in each treatment group were studied concerning heterotopic ossification (HO), a well-known complication after THA. The incidence of HO in the THA group was similar to what is found after THA due to osteoarthritis. However, only 1 / 39 developed severe symptoms. A subgroup of 100 patients was included in a study concerning nutritional status and functional capacity using the Modified <b>Norton</b> <b>scale,</b> Katz index of ADL and a questionnaire measuring instrumental activities of daily living. The THA group fared better concerning weight change over time, locomotion and pain. The nutritional intervention did not show any measurable effects. All patients were followed until two years postoperatively and all fracturerelated hospital costs, including reoperations, were calculated. We found no difference in total costs between the treatment groups. Costs to the municipality were calculated comparing the baseline cost before surgery with the average cost per month during the first postoperative year. No difference was found between the treatment groups. On the basis of our results, we recommend arthroplasty for patients in this age group with normal mental function and high functional demands...|$|E
40|$|The major {{interest}} of this dissertation {{was to investigate}} if, in accord with propositions made both by economists (Knight, Leibenstein, Kirzner) and students of the entrepreneur in the management literature (Shapiro, Timmons), entrepreneurs had a higher tolerance of ambiguity than managers. ^ Sample data (52 entrepreneurs, 49 managers), using the Budner scale (1961) did corroborate that indeed entrepreneurs had a higher tolerance of ambiguity than managers, whether the latter belonged to the top or middle levels of the organizational hierarchy. More specifically, {{it was found that}} it is the complexity and novelty dimensions which set the two groups apart. Furthermore, differentiation of the managerial group into budding versus non-budding entrepreneurs did show also that the budding entrepreneurs had a mean tolerance of ambiguity score that lay in between those of the entrepreneurs and of the managers. When a narrower definition of budding entrepreneur was used, {{it was found that the}} mean AT score of the 2 ̆ 2 true 2 ̆ 2 budding entrepreneurs moved close to the mean score of the entrepreneurial group. These findings about the two kinds of budding entrepreneurs do suggest that high ambiguity tolerance may very well be a trait of the entrepreneur. ^ Administration of the <b>Norton</b> <b>scale</b> (1975) to the same sample of individuals did not produce any statistically significant results. However, it must be noted that almost all of the relationships observed with the Budner scale did hold, i. e. they were nearly all in the expected direction. ^ Two other research interests were pursued in this dissertation: the locus of control of real entrepreneurs versus real managers; the needs of the entrepreneurs, using Steer 2 ̆ 7 s and Braunstein 2 ̆ 7 s non-ipsative objective scale (Manifest Needs Questionnaire, 1976). On locus of control, Borland 2 ̆ 7 s findings (1975) were not confirmed by the sample data, except on the Powerful Others Control dimension. On the latter dimension, managers were found to be more fearful of Powerful Others than any other group included in the study. On needs 2 ̆ 7 strength, entrepreneurs were found to be higher on n Ach, n Aut, n Dom than the managers and lower on n Aff. However, both entrepreneurs and top managers had similar high need for Dominance. In most instances, the scores of the budding entrepreneurs were almost identical with those of the entrepreneurs. ^ Finally, a discriminant analysis was conducted and it was found that ambiguity tolerance (Budner 2 ̆ 7 s scale), n Ach, and n Aut were the best predictors for allocating sample individuals to either the entrepreneurial or managerial groups. ...|$|E
40|$|Current situation: Even at {{the present}} time of the 21 st century, decubitus is still {{considered}} to be a serious health complication which attacks all age groups of patients and reduce their quality of life (Boughen, 2012). Aims: The main aim of the research was {{to find out if the}} nursing treatment of patients who are at risk of pressure ulcer development or patients suffering bedsores in the Czech Republic is comparable to the treatment provided to similarly ill patients in Germany. Procedure: In order to find out necessary data, the quantitative research method was selected, during which an anonymous questionnaire both in Czech and German languages was issued and consequently submitted to general stuff nurses working at standard hospital departments. Research area: During the research survey, the general stuff nurses working in internal, surgery and rehabilitation departments in three Czech hospitals and two German hospitals. Results: The survey results showed that in the Czech Republic the <b>Norton</b> <b>Scale</b> for predicting the pressure ulcer risk is used most often, while in Germany the Braden Scale is most frequent method. The respondents, however, are equally convinced that regular inspections of skin as well as active searching for causation factors are far more suitable and helpful. Moreover, the survey revealed that the German colleagues determine the risk of developing bedsores by using the scale more frequently compared to the nurses in the Czech Republic. Significant differences in statistics were obvious in the frequency of the individual treatment interventions, especially in the areas of turning and repositioning the patient according to Bobath concept, self-dependence training, the skin assessment, as well as in the area of education. The research results showed the fact that Czech nurses statistically far more often use antiducubitus tools and materials, which are considered unsuitable or are not recommended by foreign guidelines. It was as well obvious from the research survey that the Czech nurses use compensational tools and devices when treating their patients more often compared to German hospitals. The survey results further showed that the choice of local therapeutic material used in particular working places vary considerably. While there is a more numerous utilization of materials containing silver and Tender Wet hydro-active super absorb cushions in the Czech Republic, stuff nurses in Germany prefer transparent polyurethane covers, secondary absorbing covers and polyurethane foams. Conclusions and suggestions for the practice: As far as the material availability is concerned, we are still far behind the advanced countries. However, we excel in quality as well as in the professional qualification of the nursing stuff. Prevention measures in the area of pressure ulcers are on the same level. Suggested changes and recommendations are: Suitable choice of the equipment, tools and devices. Immediately start with the self-dependence training within the rehabilitation treatment exercises and to use suitable compensational aids and utilities. It is as well advisable to create an individual body movement plan. To engage the whole multi-discipline team in the treating process for the patient. To educate the patient correctly. To ensure precise treatment documentation. Not to focus only on the assessment scale for prediction pressure ulcer risk but to carry out regular inspections of skin and search for the causation factors actively. To carry out the fading hyperaemia test in practice. Not to confuse sitting in a wheelchair and mobilisation. Verify and legalise the recommended procedures with the support of audits on pressure ulcer prevention and treatment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{providing}} antidecubital care and observes the fulfilment of nursing interventions in the care about non-self sufficient patients. During performing her duties, every nurse encounters the issue of decubitus ulcers formation and with this related antidecubital care. Thus, it can be stated that the occurrence of decubitous ulcers serves also as the indicator of the quality of provided nursing care. A {{lot of people think that}} the problem develops particularly in elders, but young people who are bedridden after injuries and accidents are also affected and this complication degrades the quality of their life. The thesis is divided into theoretical and empirical parts. The theoretical part describes the anatomy of skin and its function, decubitus and classification of decubitus ulcers are defined, their localization with characteristics of predilection sites are specified, outlining complications in decubitus ulcers. The theoretical part pursues antidecubital care with the division into subheads on positioning, antidecubital aids, nursing interventions, and the mission of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel is described. The separate chapter includes the risk assessment of decubitus ulcers formations, as is e. g. <b>Norton</b> <b>scale,</b> etc. The last chapter embraces the specification of conservative and surgical treatment of pressure sores. The aim of the research examination was to determine whether the nurses perceived antidecubital care as a nursing problem and to map the opinions of the nurses relating to antidecubital care. Three research questions were set to achieve the objectives: first, what the pitfalls of nursing care were on the part of the nurses, secondly, what areas within antidecubital care were neglected and finally, how antidecubital care at selected inpatient wards was provided. The research was implemented at the chosen inpatient wards in České Budějovice Hospital, PLC, from the period of February to April 2014. The research file consisted of the general nurses and the medical assistants. A hidden participant observation was conducted and then questionnaires with 15 questions that were closed or semi-closed were distributed to the nurses. 45 questionnaires were handed out, 31 handed back and all 31 questionnaires could be processed. Thus, the total return of the questionnaires was 69 %. Questions in the questionnaire were based on the observation criteria. The hidden participant observation was processed and plotted on the observation sheet and then classified according to the given criteria. After delivery, the returned questionnaires were checked and evaluated graphically. All results were processed using Misrocoft Office Excel program, were plotted in graphs with keys and descriptions. By processing and comparing the results, we ascertained that in some fields the opinion of the nurses was different from the practice that was really performed. It could be also caused by the fact that antidecubital care is very time-consuming, demanding and comprises a lot of nursing interventions. Sufficient number of aids with which the ward is equipped is relevant as well, be it preventive aids or medical ones. And last but not least the organization of the care. At present, the time spent on completing documentation is increasing and the time that can be used by nurses for contacting a patient and satisfy his/her needs is decreasing. Nevertheless, the patient´s state and his/her contentment reflect and demonstrate our care. After previous arrangement, the results of our research examination will be communicated to the ward sisters at the selected inpatient wards where the research examination was performed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Patients with femoral neck {{fractures}} (FNFs) {{constitute an}} increasing health care problem which affect patient’s daily living after the trauma, reduce self-care possibilities, and increases mortality. Treatment {{of these patients}} is associated with increasing costs. Prospective systematic audit and national registers have been suggested {{as one of the}} best approaches to measuring and improving outcomes. Previously neither detailed audit of patients with hip fracture nor further analysis of data was conducted in Lithuania Aim of the research project – to estimate factors affecting outcome in patients with FNF and to audit patients’ care, assessing importance to the outcome results, comparing FNF patients treated in Lithuania and Sweden. Tasks of the research project: 1. 	To identify factors affecting functional outcome and quality of life in femoral neck fracture patients at four months follow-up. 2. 	To estimate the changes in functional outcome and quality of life in fe-moral neck fracture patients at four months and at one year follow-up. 3. 	To compare hip fracture patients care in Kaunas Clinics and Lund University Hospital and identify differences during patients’ trans¬por-tation, preoperative, and postoperative time periods. 4. 	To compare functional and quality of life outcome in femoral neck fracture patients treated in Kaunas Clinics and Lund University Hos-pital. Patients and methods To achieve the aims of the research project, three consequential stu¬dies were conducted. The first study investigated patients with FNF treated in Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kaunas Clinics (Kaunas Clinics, KC) from 1 st January, 2008 to 31 st May, 2010. The following forms and questionnaires were used: Standardized Hip Fracture Register Form No 1, Mini Mental State Examination questionnaire, Mini Nutritional Assess¬ment questionnaire. Patients’ risk of pressure ulcers assessment was done by nurses at the admission to the department using <b>Norton</b> <b>Scale.</b> The pain in fractured hip before and after the surgery was evaluated using self-reported numeric pain measurement scale. Confusion Assessment Method was used for recognition of postoperative delirium. The patients had been investigated at four months and at one year after the fracture for hip joint function and health related quality of life (HRQL). The factors affecting patients’ hip functional status and HRQL were identified. In the second study we performed an audit of care for patients with hip fracture in Kaunas Clinics from 2 nd January, 2009 to 31 st December, 2009. The information about the following procedures applied during hip fracture patients’ transportation to the hospital and their stay in Acute and Emergency department was collected: pain and use of analgesics, infusion therapy, oxygen therapy, blood test sampling, and immobilization. Similarly the information about the procedures applied during the patients stay in the orthopaedic ward before and after the surgery was collected. The information about mean time period from admission to health care institution to surgery, length of stay in the orthopaedic de-partment, incidence of pressure ulcers, and information about discharge location was collected. The audit results were compared to hip fracture care in LUH In the third study we compared FNF patients, treated in Kaunas Clinics from 1 st January, 2008 to 31 st August, 2010 and Lund University Hospital, treated from 1 st March, 2009 to 1 st March, 2010, in respect to their functional outcome and HRQL at four months follow-up. All patients included into the study were investigated prospectively according to the National Swedish Hip Fracture Register model and the same study protocol was applied for patients in Kaunas and Lund. Four months after the injury additionally Euro Qol- 5 D questionnaire was used for analysis. Results The first study results. There were 145 FNF patients from Kaunas Clinics included into the study. Hip joint function and HRQL results were analysed for 97 patients. At four months follow-up patients were using more walking aids (p< 0. 001), and mobility function was worse (p= 0. 001) than before the fracture. In regression analysis patients with higher ASA grade (p= 0. 008) and those, who were living alone (p= 0. 049) before the fracture, rated significantly worse their ability to perform usual activities in daily living according HOOS questionnaire. Regression analysis of EQ- 5 D showed that worse mobility, use of more walking aids before the fracture, living alone, and higher ASA grade significantly correlated all five dimensions at four months follow-up. At one year follow-up hip joint function and HRQL was evaluated for 86 patients. Patients’ mobility remained significantly worse than before the fracture (p< 0. 001). The hip related quality of life subscale from HOOS patients evaluated significantly better at one year follow-up (p= 0. 02). Comparison analysis of EQ- 5 D mobility dimension showed the significant improvement (p= 0. 03) in mobility when compared four months and one year after the fracture follow-up. The EQ- 5 D VAS analysis did not revealed statistically significant changes (p= 0. 6) in patients self-reported health status assessment at four months (56. 9; SD – 22) and one year (55. 8; SD – 23) follow-up after FNF. The second study results. During patients’ transportation to Kaunas Clinics, immobilization and pain relief drugs were used occasionally dur¬ing patients’ care. No oxygen therapy and no blood sample and ECG were taken before admission to Kaunas Clinics. That was not the case in LUH, where all these interventions were performed. At postoperative period the main differences in patient care were found in pressure ulcers prophylactic and nutritional state evaluation and correction. The mean time period from admission to surgery in Kaunas Clinics was 67 hours (CI 47 – 87) as compared to 25 hours (CI 22 – 28) in LUH. The third study results. Functional and quality of life outcome at four months of 99 FNF patients treated with arthroplasty in Kaunas and 117 in Lund was investigated. The patients in Kaunas were more mobile (p< 0. 001) and were using less walking aids (p< 0. 001) before trauma and at four moths follow-up. According EQ- 5 D questionnaire results at 4 months, patients in Lund reported significantly better self-care (p< 0. 001), felt less pain and discomfort (0. 007), and had less anxiety and depression symptoms (p= 0. 01). Worse mobility in EQ- 5 D was related to worse mo¬bility before fracture (p< 0. 001) and higher ASA grade (p= 0. 008). Sweden as country of residence (p< 0. 001), better mobility before and after the trauma (p= 0. 001), and lower ASA grade (p< 0. 001) significantly affected better patients self care from EQ- 5 D. Better rates of usual activities from EQ- 5 D were significantly related to Sweden as country of residence (p< 0. 001), younger age (p= 0. 004), and better mobility before and after the trauma (p< 0. 001). Better rating of pain/discomfort dimension from EQ- 5 D significantly related to Sweden as country of residence (p< 0. 001) and usage of less walking aids at follow-up (0. 001). Better rating of anxiety/ depression from EQ- 5 D was significantly related to country of residence (Sweden) (p< 0. 001) and better mobility at follow up (p< 0. 001). Conclusions 1. 	Patients’ with higher preoperative physical status classification grade and living alone had worse functional results at four months follow-up. Walking aids usage before fracture, greater physical status clas¬sification grade, worse mobility before fracture, and living alone nega¬tively affected femoral neck fracture patients’ health related quality of life. 2. 	The main improvement in femoral neck fracture patients’ hip function occurred during first four months postoperatively. No significant positive changes in patients’ hip function assessed by self-report were found during period from four months to one year after trauma; but significant improvement of health related quality of life was observed. 3. 	The major differences observed during patients transportation to the hospital and management after admission until the surgery may have a negative effect on the outcome. Based on these differences a new patients care algorithm was introduced in Kaunas Clinics. 4. 	Femoral neck fracture patients in Kaunas Clinics were more mobile before fracture and at four months follow-up as compared to Lund University Hospital; however patients in Lund were rating their health related quality of life higher at one year follow-up after the treatment. Šlaunikaulio kaklo (ŠK) lūžis - trauma, stipriai įtakojanti ir pakeičianti kiekvieno paciento tolimesnį gyvenimą, kadangi mažina savarankiškumą, skatina negalią po lūžio, didina mirštamumo riziką. Šiuolaikinei sveikatos priežiūros sistemai tai didelis ekonominis iššūkis, susijęs su pacientų gydymu, reabilitacija, priežiūra bei poreikiais pirmaisiais metais po lūžio Tyrimo tikslas – nustatyti veiksnius, turinčius įtakos šlaunikaulio kaklo lūžius patyrusių pacientų gydymo rezultatams, įvertinant pacientų priežiūrą iki patekimo į gydymo įstaigą ir hospitalizacijos laikotarpiais, lyginant rezultatus su Lundo universitetine ligonine. Tyrimo uždaviniai: 1.

Nustatyti klubo sąnario funkcijos ir su sveikata susijusios gyvenimo kokybės pokyčius nuo keturių mėnesių iki vienerių metų po traumos. 3. 	Palyginti šlaunikaulio lūžius patyrusių pacientų priežiūrą Kauno klinikose ir Lundo universitetinėje ligoninėje, įvertinant skirtumus pacientų transportavimo į gydymo įstaigą, priešoperaciniu ir pooperaciniu laikotarpiais. 4. 	Palyginti klubo sąnario funkciją ir su sveikata susijusią gyvenimo kokybę tarp pacientų, gydytų Kauno klinikose ir Lundo universitetinėje ligoninėje, praėjus keturiems mėnesiams po traumos. Tyrimo metodika Tyrimas vykdytas Lietuvos Sveikatos mokslų universiteto Kauno Klinikose (KK) ir Lundo Universitetinėje ligoninėje (LUL, Švedija). Iškeltiems uždaviniams įgyvendinti, tyrimas suskirstytas į tris dalis. Pirmoje darbo dalyje ištyrėme pacientus, patyrusius ŠK lūžį ir gydytus KK nuo 2008 01 01 iki 2009 12 31. Įvertinome pacientų klubo sąnario funkcijos ir su sveikatas susijusios gyvenimo kokybės (SSGK) rezultatus, praėjus keturiems mėnesiams ir vieneriems metams po traumos, bei nustatėme veiksnius, turinčius įtakos šiems rezultatams. Visi pacientai, 55 metų ir vyresni, patyrę ŠK lūžį ir hospitalizuoti KK, įtraukti į tyrimą. Paciento stacionarizacijos laikotarpiu naudoti šie klausimynai ir anketos: Standartizuota Šlaunikaulio lūžio registracijos anketa (Forma Nr. 1), Protinės būklės trumpasis tyrimas (MMSE); Mitybos mini anketa (MNA). Pacientai dėl pragulų išsivystymo rizikos vertinti tik atvykus į skyrių pagal Nortono pragulų rizikos išsivystymo vertinimo skalę. Skausmas vertintas skaitmenine skausmo skale. Delyro atpažinimui naudotas Suglumimo įvertinimo metodo diagnostikos algoritmas (CAM). Keturių mėnesių ir vienerių metų pacientų stebėjimo duomenys rinkti naudojant šiuos klausimynus: standartizuota Šlaunikaulio lūžio registracijos anketa (Forma Nr. 2), Sveikatos būklės anketa EuroQol- 5 D, Klubo sąnario disfunkcijos ir osteoartrito pasekmių klausimynas (HOOS). Antroje darbo dalyje atlikome proksimalinės šlaunikaulio dalies lūžius patyrusių pacientų, gydytų KK, priežiūros etapų ir procedūrų auditą nuo 2009 01 02 iki 2009 12 31. Duomenys, surinkti iš medicininės dokumentacijos, pildytos paciento transportavimo ir stacionarizacijos metu. Paciento transportavimo į gydymo įstaigą ir priežiūros SPS metu rinkta informacija apie atliktas procedūras: nuskausminimą, infuzinės terapijos, deguonies terapijos naudojimą, traumuotos galūnės imobilizaciją, kraujo tyrimų atlikimą. Paciento priežiūros perioperaciniu laikotarpiu metu registruotos šios procedūros bei intervencijos: nuskausminimas, pragulų rizikos išsivystymą mažinančių čiužinių naudojimas, infuzinės ir degunies terapijos skyrimas, laiko periodas nuo stacionarizacijos iki operacijos, paciento gulėjimo stacionare laikas. Duomenys apie LUL gydytus pacientus gauti iš Švedijos šlaunikaulio lūžių registro duomenų bazės. Atlikta nagrinėtų etapų palyginamoji analizė tarp dviejų ligoninių. Trečioje dalyje atliktome KK (2008 01 01 – 2010 08 31) ir LUL (2009 03 01 – 2010 03 01) gydytų pacientų, patyrusių |ŠK lūžius, funkcinių bei su SSGK rezultatų palyginamąją analizę, praėjus keturiems mėnesiams po traumos. Duomenys KK ir LUL rinkti naudojantis vienoda metodika. Duomenų rinkimui naudotos Švedijos šlaunikaulio lūžių regsitro formos, ir EQ- 5 D klausimynas. Svarbiausi rezultatai Pirma dalis. Tyrime dalyvavo 145 pacientai. Pacientų amžiaus vidurkis 76, 8 metai (SN 9, 7) : vyrų - 71, 6 metai (SN 11), moterų - 78, 7 metai (SN 8, 6), p= 0, 001. 55, 9 proc. pacientų nustatya I-II ASA klasė, 44, 1 proc. pacientų III-IV ASA klasė. Vertinant tyrime dalyvaujančių pacientų pažintinę funkciją, nustatyta, kad 37, 9 proc, pacientų buvo nustatytas lengvas ar vidutinis pažintinių funkcijų sutrikimas ir 11, 7 proc. – ryškus sutrikimas. Pooperaciniu laikotarpiu 42 pacientai (29 proc.) patyrė ankstyvasias komplikacijas. Pooperacinis delyras (16, 6 proc.) ir pragulos (11, 7 proc.) sudarė didžiąją dalį visų registruotų komplikacijų. Vidutinė pacientų, patyriusių komplikacijas gulėjimo ligoninėje trukmė siekė 15 dienų (SN 10), o pacientų, kuriems pooperaciniu laikotarpiu komplikacijos neišsivystė - 10 dienų (SN 5), p< 0, 001. Praėjus keturiems mėnesiams po traumos klubo sąnario funkcijos ir SSGK rodiklių analizei naudoti 97 pacientų duomenys. Pacientai blogiau vakščiojo (p= 0, 001) ir naudojo daugiau pagalbinių priemonių vaikščiodami (p< 0, 001) nei laikotarpiu iki traumos. Regresijos analizė pagal HOOS klausimyną parodė, kad aukštesnė ASA klasė ir paciento gyvenimas savarankiškai iki traumos reikšmingai įtakojo blogesnį kasdieninės veiklos vertinimą. Atlikus regresinę analizę pagal EQ- 5 D klausimyno duomenis, nustatyta kad sunkumai vaikštant, didesnis naudojamų pagabinių priemonių skaičius, gyvenimas vieniems iki traumos, ir aukštesnė ASA klasė reikšmingai įtakojo visas sritis pagal EQ- 5 D klausimyną. Funkcija ir SSGK praėjus vieneriems metams po traumos įvertinta 86 pacientams. Panašiai, kaip ir lyginant rezultatus prieš operaciją ir praėjus keturiems mėnesiams po traumos, po vienerių metų pacientų vaikščiojimo galimybės liko reikšmingai blogesnės nei iki traumos (p< 0, 001), pacientai naudojo statistiškai reikšmingai daugiau pagalbinių priemonių (p= 0, 004). Lyginant mobilumo pokyčius nuo keturių mėnesių iki vienerių metų nustatyta, kad ši funkcija reikšminagi pagerėjo (p< 0. 001). HOOS klausimyno rezultatų palyginamoji analizė neparodė reikšmingus teigiamus pokyčius stebėjimo laikotarpiu tik gyvenimo kokybės srityje (p= 0, 02). Pagal EQ- 5 D klausimyną, nuo keturių mėnesių iki vienerių metų reikšminagi pagerėjo tik mobilumo funkcija (p= 0, 03), Antra dalis. Į tyrimą įtraukti duomenys 64 pacientų gydytų KK ir 90 pacientų, gydytų LUL. Svarbius skirtumus priežiūroje radome pacientų transportavimo į gydymo įstaigą laikotarpiu ir nuo stacionarizacijos iki paciento operacinio gydymo. Transportavimo metu į KK, skirtingai nei į LUL, pacientams nebuvo skiriamas deguonis, infuzinė terapija, neimobilizuojama lūžusi galūnė. KK pacientai skubios pagalbos skyriuje (SPS) praleido vidutiniškai 2 valandas 10 minučių. Pacientai atvykę į LUL aplenkdami SPS tiesiogiai transportuojami į Rentgeno diagnostikos skyrių ir po tyrimo – į ortopedinę palatą. Lyginant laiką, kurį pacientai, patyrę proksimalinės šlaunikaulio dalies lūžius, praleido nuo atvykimo į gydymo įstaigą iki operacijos, apskaičiuota, kad KK vidurkis siekė 67 valandas (PI 47 - 87), tuo tarpu LUL, šis laikotarpis buvo 25 valandos (PI 22 - 28). Trečia dalis. Tyrime dalyvavo 161 pacientas gydytas KK ir 248 pacientai gydyti LUL. Lyginant pacientų bendrąsias charakteristikas, nustatyta, kad KK gydyti jaunesni nei LUL pacientai (< 0, 001). 89, 4 proc. pacientų nustatyta antra ir trečia ASA klasė ir 91, 3 proc. pacientų gydyti atliekant klubo sąnario endoprotezavimo operacijas. LUL 91, 1 proc. pacientų nustatyta antra ir trečia ASA klasė ir endoprotezuojant gydyti 67, 4 proc pacientų. Kauno klinikose 90, 7 proc. pacientų diagnozuoti dislokuoti šlaunikaulio kaklo lūžiai, LUL - 73, 0 procentai (< 0, 001). KK gydytų pacientų amžiaus vidurkis buvo reikšmingai mažesnis (78 (SN 9)) nei LUL (83 (SN 8)), (p=< 0, 001), didesnei pacientų daliai nustatyta žemesnė ASA klasė (p= 0, 007). Statsistiškai reikšmingai skyrėsi gydymui naudotų endoprotezų tipai (p=< 0. 001). Kauno klinikose visiems pacientams atliktas klubo sąnario endoprotezavimas totaliniu endoprotezu, LUL totalinis sąnario endoprotezavimas naudotas 15, 6 % pacientų. Lyginant pacientų vaikščiojimo galimybes ir pokyčius tarp institucijų, nustatyta, kad KK gydyti pacientai praėjus keturiems mėnesiams po traumos geriau vaikščiojo (p< 0, 001), ir vaikščiodami naudojo mažiau pagalbinių priemonių (p< 0, 001). Pagal EQ- 5 D klausimyną mažiau problemų savęs priežiūros veikloje (p< 0. 001), skausmo/savijautos vertinimo srityje (p= 0, 007) turėjo LUL pacientai. Vertinant nerimo/depresijos sritį LUL pacientai jautėsi mažiau sunerimę ar prislėgti (p= 0, 01). Analizuojant SSGK pagal EQ VAS skalę, nustatyta, jog pacientai gydyti KK statistiškai reikšmingai (p< 0, 001) blogiau vertino savo sveikatos būklę praėjus keturiems mėnesiams po traumos. Rgeresijos anlaizė parodė, jog blogesnis mobilumas buvo susijęs su blogesniu mobilumu iki traumos (p< 0, 001) ir aukštesne ASA klase (p= 0, 008). Švedija, kaip šalis (p< 0, 001), geresnis mobilumas iki ir po traumas (p= 0, 001) ir žemesnė ASA klasė (p< 0, 001) turėjo reikšmingos įtakos geresniam pacientų savęs priežiūros srities vertinimui. Gerenis kasdieninės veiklos sritis reikšmingai siejosi su šalimi (Švedija) (p< 0, 001), jaunesniu pacientų amžiumi (p= 0, 004) ir geresne mobilumo funkcija iki ir po traumos (p< 0, 001). Mažesnis skausmas/diskomfortas siejosi su šalimi (Švedija) (p< 0, 001) ir mažiau naudojamų pagalbinių priemonių po keturių mėnesių skaičiumi(p= 0, 001). Pacientų jaučiamas mažesnis nerimas/depresija reikšmingai siejos su šalimi (Švedija (p< 0, 001) ir geresne mobilumo funkcija po keturių mėnesių. Išvados 1. 	Vyresnio amžiaus žmonėms, kurie gyveno vieni iki traumos bei prieš operaciją nustatyta aukštesnė fizinės būklės klasė, praėjus keturiems mėnesiams po traumos nustatyti blogesni funkciniai klubo sąnario rezultatai...|$|E
