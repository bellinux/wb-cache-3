5|$|Caedmon's Call {{was formed}} in 1993 with four {{original}} members (three of whom still remain), Cliff Young, Danielle Glenn, Todd Bragg, and Aaron Tate. Aaron Tate, however, <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> tour with the band, and was included in a songwriting capacity only, sharing those duties with Derek Webb who also played lead guitar.|$|E
5|$|He {{was quoted}} by Rangers radio {{broadcasters}} {{as saying that}} he <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> physically harm Lefebvre but did {{want to speak to}} him; Daniels said he was upset that someone he didn't know was judging him.|$|E

5|$|On June 13, 2017, Frusciante, {{under the}} alias of Trickfinger, {{announced}} that he would be releasing the Trickfinger II EP on September 8, 2017 on the label Acid Test. The six songs, which were <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be released, were originally recorded in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Architects who {{push the}} {{boundaries}} of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed {{the expectations of the}} public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really follies, deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be practical.|$|E
5|$|As the plenary {{legislative}} {{powers of}} the Parliament were sufficient to grant extraterritorial legislative powers to the Parliament, the Court declined to pronounce whether Article 73(a) was an empowering provision. However, it indicated on an obiter basis that had it been necessary to do so, it would have accepted the Attorney-General's alternate submission that Article 73(a) of the Malaysian Constitution was <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be an empowering provision.|$|E

5|$|Bakshi {{served as}} head of the studio for eight months before Paramount closed its {{animation}} division on December 1, 1967. He learned that his position was always intended to be temporary and that Paramount <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> pick up his pitches. Although Hampft was prepared to offer Bakshi a severance package, Bakshi immediately ripped up the contract.|$|E
5|$|In a {{manuscript}} {{he wrote in}} 1704 (<b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be published) he mentions the date of 2060, {{but it is not}} given as a date for the end of days. It has been falsely reported as a prediction. The passage is clear, when you read the date in context. He was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this would put Christianity into disrepute.|$|E
5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E

5|$|DiCaprio {{appeared}} in the mostly improvised short film called Don's Plum, {{as a favor to}} aspiring director R. D. Robb. When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> make it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom. The film eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where it was well received by critics. DiCaprio's last film of the year 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, a biographical film about Jim Carroll.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded {{its own version of}} the Simpsons theme, and released it as a single. Zimmer turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be put into the film. Zimmer also had to write foreign-language lyrics for the 32 dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. He found translating the song into Spanish the hardest to write. The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the foreign-language dubs.|$|E
5|$|The Model 8-A, {{the export}} {{model of the}} Northrop Attack Bomber series was <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> {{serve as the basis}} of a {{floatplane}} and had to be redesigned to meet the requirements of the Norwegian order. The new N-3PB was the first product of Northrop Aircraft, which had reformed in 1939, and was a low-winged cantilever monoplane fitted with twin floats. First intended for a lower powered engine, the N-3PB was ultimately powered by a Wright Cyclone radial engine, of the same type specified for the Douglas 8A-5N bombers and Curtiss Hawk 75A-8s ordered by Norway at the same time, simplifying the eventual maintenance and operation requirements for the entire Norwegian military aircraft fleets.|$|E

"Encouraged by {{all these}} benefits, Vostri <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> comply to the Sultan or make {{contracts}} and pay him annual tribute, as did other neighbors Illyrians (as author called Albanians) and Tribals (as author called Serbs), nor to subordinate themselves {{to him in}} any way.".|$|R
50|$|More {{traditional}} lyrics in {{the realm}} of positive relationships and religion were aided with clean in-line production. The band also noted that while they felt pressured at times, it was a welcome change of pace, and that they <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> leave their roots; only expand them.|$|R
50|$|An example {{might be}} tapping someone's secured {{wireless}} LAN or public utility line (which could also amount to theft of services). Another example might {{be taking a}} joy ride in a car, <b>never</b> <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> keep it from the owner. Some have redefined such conduct as {{a specific type of}} theft.|$|R
5|$|Despite Australian fears, the Japanese <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> {{invade the}} Australian mainland. While an {{invasion}} was {{considered by the}} Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in February 1942, it was judged to be beyond the Japanese military's capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken. Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia. This plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway. While these battles ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943.|$|E

Yet this plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway. While these battles ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943. A series of Japanese air raids against northern Australia occurred during 1942 and 1943, and while the main defence was provided by RAAF and Allied fighters, a number of Australian Army anti-aircraft batteries were also involved in dealing with this threat.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{sent the}} first {{shipments}} of rifles up to Bechuanaland in January and February 1889, sending 250 each month, and instructed Jameson, Dr Frederick Rutherfoord Harris and a Shoshong trader, George Musson, to convey them to Bulawayo. Lobengula {{had so far}} accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession (and continued {{to do so for}} years afterwards), but when the guns arrived in early April, he refused to take them. Jameson placed the weapons under a canvas cover in Maguire's camp, stayed at the kraal for ten days, and then went back south with Maguire in tow, leaving the rifles behind. A few weeks later, Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen—he said he had <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> sign away mineral rights and that he and his izinDuna revoked their recognition of the document.|$|E

50|$|Collins {{began his}} career in {{entertainment}} as a stand-up comic whilst still working part-time as a double-glazing window demonstrator. He won the best New Comedy Act award at the Glastonbury Festival in 1997 and reached the finals of the BBC New Comedy Awards at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival the same year. Collins gave up stand-up comedy in 2002 to concentrate on TV and radio presenting, stating that he <b>never</b> <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> return to the profession.|$|R
50|$|Instead of declaring openly that {{invasion}} of North Vietnam {{was out of}} the question for the purpose of relaxing the Soviet Union and China, the U.S. should have constantly threatened Hanoi with amphibious invasion while <b>never</b> <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> actually carry it out. Also, small scale raids into North Vietnam for one purpose or another would not be ruled out.|$|R
5|$|The Australian 4th Armoured Brigade {{was formed}} in January 1943 to provide {{armoured}} support for Australian Army units operating in the South West Pacific Area. The brigade was <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> serve as a single formation, rather its role {{was to provide a}} pool of armoured units from which units and sub-units could be provided to augment infantry forces. The brigade was also responsible for developing doctrine and specialised armoured vehicles for armoured warfare in tropical terrain. In keeping with the brigade's task of providing armoured units to other formations, its armoured regiments were organised into self-supporting regimental groups and the brigade did not possess the reconnaissance, infantry and other supporting elements which were common in World War II-era armoured brigades. Elements of the brigade saw action in the Huon Peninsula campaign of 1943–44 and attached to the Australian 6th Division during the Aitape–Wewak campaign from October 1944 {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the new Knights Companions were knighted by the King and invested with their ribands and badges on 27 May 1725. Although the statutes set out the full medieval ceremony {{which was to be}} used for creating knights, this was not performed, and indeed was possibly <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be, as the original statutes contained a provision allowing the Great Master to dispense Knights Companion from these requirements. The original knights were dispensed from all the medieval ceremonies {{with the exception of the}} Installation, which was performed in the Order's Chapel, the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey, on 17 June. This precedent was followed until 1812, after which the Installation was also dispensed with, until its revival in the twentieth century. The ceremonies however remained part of the Statutes until 1847.|$|E
5|$|De la Ferté {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the Air Ministry's attitude to his service. In 1937 several exercises were carried out by Coastal Command in co-operation with submarines against the Home Fleet to judge the surface fleet's defence against submarine and air attack. However, despite the experiences of the First World War, no attention was paid to the problem of attacking submarines from the air as part of trade protection measures. Owing to misplaced faith in the imperfect ASDIC invention which was <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> detect surface-running submarines, it appeared the Royal Navy no longer considered U-boats a threat to Britain's sea lanes. The Air Ministry, keen to concentrate on strategic air forces, did not dispute the Admiralty's conclusions and Coastal Command did not receive any guidance from the Air Ministry. The saving grace for both services was the construction of the Combined Headquarters which enabled rapid collaboration in maritime operations. This {{was one of the few}} successes in organisation and preparation made before the outbreak of war.|$|E

Although {{they are in}} love with each other, Clio, who is obsessed with her plans for revenge, <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> marry a rich and {{powerful}} man to prove that she {{is as good as}} her father's family. Clint, a gambler, who <b>never</b> <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> marry, is out for revenge against the railroaders who ruined his father in Texas.|$|R
60|$|Had she {{known her}} sister sought to tear her from such {{prospects}} and such realities as these, {{what would have}} been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's <b>never</b> <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> go there himself.|$|R
