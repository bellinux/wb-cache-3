The participants were 113 elementary school teachers in Chungcheongnam-Do. Twenty items were adapted from the Environmental Education <b>Needs</b> <b>test,</b> and the {{teachers were asked to}} respond to each item on a 5 -point Likert scale. For the items of the subcategory of EE training, teachers ' preferences between the on-site and the online training were also asked. Although the teachers showed relatively strong needs for most items of both the subcategories of EE service and EE training, they exhibited stronger needs for the items related to the services and/or the content of training readily appli-cable to EE classes. Teachers preferred the online training to the on-site training in most items whereas their preferences to the on-site training tended to be relatively high in the items such as the use of local nonformal EE site, the development and th...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a macro-simulation and {{forecasting}} model, called PASSIM, essentially markovian, of the working of the Quebec system of Public Assistance. It {{has to do with}} both the numbers of persons involved and with the expenditures. It became fully operational in the summer of 1972 albeit it still contains a number of important imperfections. The model relies on a linear programming procedure to estimate probability transition matrices. This seems to represent one of the original features of the model. The basic philosophy of the Quebec Public Assistance is simple: a modified version of a guaranteed income program. This <b>needs</b> <b>test</b> is simply used to constitute the submodel for the determination of allowances. Transition matrices are three dimensional; transition probabilities may change over time due to changes in various exogeneous variables.

30|$|The {{argument}} in Section  2.4. 3, ‘Unsustainable industry’, has some validity in the in-between areas, but not it seems in outermost rural areas. Osland et al. [1] {{found that only}} four municipalities out of 430 had lost their taxi service in the period analysed and no direct support for the connection between these {{and the introduction of}} competitive tendering. As illustrated in Fig.  4 b, however, in some areas there has been a significant loss of service resulting from the taxi service industry losing tenders to the minibus industry. This has affected the supply of taxis not just in the contract market, but in adjacent market segments, too. Also, as the allocation of taxi licences is subject to a <b>needs</b> <b>test,</b> and tenders require that capacity be documented when a bid is submitted, there is a significant likelihood that the taxi service will be permanently reduced in response to the loss of tendered contracts to the minibus industry. The main factor limiting competition between taxis from different dispatchers is geographical distance and the cost associated with empty kilometres [6].|$|E
40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the evaluation of}} alternative test methods to identify the presence of polymer modifiers in performance-graded binders {{for the purpose of}} quality assurance. A method of identification is presented in AASHTO T 302, Polymer Content of Polymer-Modified Emulsions and Asphalt Binders, that uses Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to evaluate the constituent elements in binders or emulsions. With proper calibration, output from FTIR can be used to determine the presence and approximate content of polymers in an asphalt binder. AASHTO T 301, Elastic Recovery Test of Bituminous Materials by Means of a Ductilometer, offers an alternative method to determine the presence of polymer by evaluating the elasticity of the binder. Samples of binder were collected from contractor tanks and tested in accordance with AASHTO T 301 and AASHTO T 302. The performance grade was verified in accordance with AASHTO M 320. Test results were evaluated to identify calibration <b>needs,</b> <b>test</b> variability, and choice of preferred methodologies for adoption into the quality assurance program. Results of the study identified the use of either FTIR analysis or elastic recovery as a timesaving alternative to full-fledged performance grading in the initial investigation of concerns about the presence of polymer. Both methods identified binders containing varying polymer contents with no instances of false positive identification. However, {{based on the results of}} this study, neither method is suitable to determine binder grade...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper was aimed at establishing whether there is significant difference in the levels of creativity, intelligence and anxiety among the students with excellent, very good and good academic achievements. The sample included 132 elementary - school students of the seventh and eighth grades among which 26 (19. 7 %) students had good academic scores, 40 (30. 3 %) very good, while 66 (50 %) students were excellent. For measuring the main research variables the following instruments were used: the Different <b>Needs</b> <b>Test</b> (Gilhooly et al., 2007; Đorđević, 2005), as a prototype test of divergent thinking, the Preconscious Activity Scale (Holland & Baird, 1968) as a measure of the disposition to originality, COG 3 Intelligence Test Battery (Wolf i sar., 1992), and Spielberger's (Spielberger et al., 1983) Inventory of Anxiety as a state and a trait, i. e. instantaneous and general anxiety (STAI-S and STAI- T). The results show that excellent students are more creative and have higher levels of not only general intellectual capabilities but also perceptive, verbal and spatial abilities, compared to very good and good students and, at the same time, a lower level of anxiety. There was no difference between the students with different achievements regarding the levels of disposition to originality and general anxiety.

This change was {{initiated by the}} Sachsen government who lobbied {{for a change in}} the required € 250.000 investment and the requirement to create 5 jobs. They argued that the German economy, particularly the Sachsen region, needed small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) and that the admission policy required more regional flexibility (Strunden & Pasenow, 2011). The new legislation introduced entry policy for two types of entrepreneurs, business owners (selbständige Tätigkeit) or professionals (freiberufliche Tätigkeit), also translated as freelancers. 16 There is no national policy targeting startups. An economic <b>needs</b> <b>test</b> related to a general economic interest or to a regional need is applied on applicants of a business permit. 17 The activities should be expected to have a ‘positive impact on the economy’ and the activities should be financed out of equity or a loan or credit facility. The assessment of economic interest is based on the sustainability of the underlying business idea, the entrepreneurial experience of the TCN, the amount of invested capital, the impact on job creation and training opportunities and the contribution to innovation and research. 18 If the entrepreneur is older than 45  years he or she needs to provide proof of having sufficient old-age insurance, this goes for the professionals too. 19 Professionals are for instance dentists, midwives, massage therapists, accountants, consultants, architects, journalists, artists, writers and more. If applicable they first need to have the necessary permit to practice their profession or show they have applied for it (Vollmer, 2014, p. 27).|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} explore the regulatory and socio-cultural responses to retail foreign direct investment (FDI) in a third-wave, transition country- Vietnam. A combined qualitative and quantitative methodology together with documentary research was utilised to collect {{a wide range of}} secondary data from governmental and industry sources, much of which has not been utilised in western academic research in the field given the challenges of access to such information and of translating source material into English. This was supplemented by primary survey data from consumers and key stakeholders in the supply chain of two products, namely morning glory and fish sauce in three supermarket chains: Metro, Big C and lntimex, and used to analyse the transformation of the retail structure in Vietnam. Research findings suggest that the process of change in the Vietnamese food retail sector has been affected by the slow but progressive penetration of market liberalisation in which, as late as 2008, a foreign partner could hold no more than 49 % of capital in a joint venture. While the Vietnamese retail market has transformed radically since the 1990 s, with this shift has emerged a consumer society that is usually more discerning and demanding than before. Changing societal composition plays a crucial role in consumers becoming more conscious and conspicuous. The findings also reveal a complex layering of regulations, some of which are a hangover from the pre- 2007 period and some of which have occurred since the accession of the World Trade Organization, {{in the form of the}} controversial economic <b>needs</b> <b>test</b> (ENT) ...|$|E
40|$|NASA's next {{generation}} space suit system will place new {{demands on the}} fan used to circulate breathing gas through the ventilation loop of the portable life support system. Long duration missions with frequent extravehicular activities (EVAs), the requirement for significant increases in reliability and durability, and a mission profile that imposes strict limits on weight, volume and power create {{the basis for a}} set of requirements that demand more performance than is available from existing fan designs. This paper describes {{the development of a new}} fan to meet these needs. A centrifugal fan was designed with a normal operating speed of approximately 39, 400 rpm to meet the ventilation flow requirements while also meeting the aggressive minimal packaging, weight and power requirements. The prototype fan also operates at 56, 000 rpm to satisfy a second operating condition associated with a single fan providing ventilation flow to two spacesuits connected in series. This fan incorporates a novel nonmetallic "can" to keep the oxygen flow separate from the motor electronics, thus eliminating ignition potential. The nonmetallic can enables a small package size and low power consumption. To keep cost and schedule within project bounds a commercial motor controller was used. The fan design has been detailed and implemented using materials and approaches selected to address anticipated mission <b>needs.</b> <b>Test</b> data is presented to show how this fan performs relative to anticipated ventilation requirements for the EVA portable life support system. Additionally, data is presented to show tolerance to anticipated environmental factors such as acoustics, shock, and vibration.

40|$|This paper {{comments}} on the contributions to this special issue on item banking. An historical frame-work for viewing the papers is provided by brief re-views of the literature {{in the areas of}} item response theory, item banking, and computerized testing. In general, the eight papers are viewed as contributing valuable technical knowledge for implementing testing programs with the aid of item banks. As noted by van der Linden (1986), measure-ment models and testing practices have undergone some major changes in the last 20 years. One im-portant change is the shift from the nearly exclusive use of classical test models and standardized tests to the use of newer test models derived from item response theory (iRT) and customized tests (i. e., tests that have been constructed to match user <b>needs).</b> <b>Test</b> administration procedures have also changed: Group-administered paper-and-pencil tests are sometimes replaced by tests administered adap-tively at computer terminals. There has also been a major shift in emphasis from norm-referenced to criterion-referenced test score interpretation and a concomitant desire in the testing field to tie testing and instruction more closely together. There are signs of change throughout the testing industry. Large-scale testing programs such as Ed-ucational Testing Service’s Scholastic Aptitude Tests use IRT models to equate test forms. Major test publishers such as CTB/McGraw-Hill and The Psy-chological Corporation are using IRT models to de-velop tests and to equate test scores. They are also using IRT models to help produce customized stan-dardized achievement tests. Departments of edu-cation in states such as California and Maryland are using IRT models in their state assessment pro-grams in reporting scores and addressing item bias. The College Board’s popular Degrees of Reading Power, which links test results to reading instruc-tional levels, uses IRT as the measurement model to accomplish its goals.

40|$|This {{brochure}} {{summarizes the}} test protocols {{used in the}} NREL Hydrogen Sensor Test Laboratory for the quantitative assessment of critical analytical performance specifications for hydrogen sensors. Researchers at the NREL Hydrogen Safety Sensor Test Laboratory developed a variety of test protocols to quantitatively assess critical analytical performance specifications for hydrogen sensors. Many are similar to, but typically more rigorous than, the test procedures mandated by ISO Standard 26142 (Hydrogen Detector for Stationary Applications). Specific protocols were developed for linear range, short-term stability, {{and the impact of}} fluctuations in temperature (T), pressure (P), relative humidity (RH), and chemical environment. Specialized tests (e. g., oxygen requirement) may also be performed. Hydrogen safety sensors selected for evaluation are subjected to a thorough regimen of test protocols, as described. Sensor testing is performed at NREL on custom-built sensor test fixtures. Environmental parameters such as T, P, RH, and gas composition are rigorously controlled and monitored. The NREL evaluations are performed on commercial hydrogen detectors, on emerging sensing technologies, and for end users to validate sensor performance for specific application <b>needs.</b> <b>Test</b> results and data are shared with the manufacturer or client via summary reports, teleconference phone calls, and, when appropriate, site visits to manufacturer facilities. Client representatives may also monitor NREL's operation while their technologies are being tested. Manufacturers may use test data to illustrate the analytical capability of their technologies and, more importantly, to guide future developments. NREL uses the data to assess technology gaps and deployment considerations. Per NREL Sensor Testing Laboratory policy, test results are treated as proprietary and are not shared with other manufacturers or other entities without permission. The data may be used by NREL in open publications (journal articles, presentations, outreach support, and other reports), but will not be attributed to a specific vendor...|$|E
