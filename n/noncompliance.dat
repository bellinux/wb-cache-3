5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or <b>noncompliance</b> differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and <b>noncompliance</b> alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E
5|$|Bjarni was {{sentence}}d to 6 months in prison by the District Court of Reykjavik for major tax <b>noncompliance.</b> His sentence was suspended and he was additionally ordered to repay nearly 36 million ISK of unpaid tax. The Supreme Court of Iceland increased his suspended sentence to 8 months.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{currency}} devaluations and oil crises in the 1970s led most countries to float their currencies. The world economy became increasingly financially integrated in the 1980s and 1990s due to capital account liberalization and financial deregulation. A series of financial crises in Europe, Asia, and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile capital flows. The global financial crisis, which {{originated in the}} United States in 2007, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide Great Recession. A market adjustment to Greece's <b>noncompliance</b> with its monetary union in 2009 ignited a sovereign debt crisis among European nations known as the Eurozone crisis.|$|E
5|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law {{less than a year later}} amid widespread <b>noncompliance.</b> Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, <b>noncompliance,</b> stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E
5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of compliance and <b>noncompliance</b> for the subject {{when compared to the}} normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable {{than it would have been}} were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E

25|$|On a semiannual basis, the Attorney General shall {{inform the}} Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate of {{incidents}} of <b>noncompliance</b> with a directive {{issued by the}} Attorney General or the DNI, incidents of <b>noncompliance</b> with FISA Court-approved procedures by the Intelligence Community, {{and the number of}} certifications and directives issued during the reporting period.|$|E
25|$|Policies and {{procedures}} {{with regard to}} (1) certain employment transitions to avoid conflicts of interest, (2) the processing of complaints regarding NRSRO <b>noncompliance,</b> and (3) notification to users of identified significant errors are required.|$|E
25|$|In Mexico, right {{turns on}} red are {{generally}} allowed unless a sign indicates otherwise. Mexico City has implemented a new transit law which prohibits right turns and motorists can be issued a citation for <b>noncompliance.</b>|$|E
25|$|For FY 2007, Mexico {{demonstrated}} {{patterns of}} <b>noncompliance.</b> Many of the systemic problems mentioned in previous compliance reports persist. Locating children or taking parents in Mexico {{continues to be}} a serious impediment for Convention applicants, and often takes years.|$|E
25|$|By 1904, {{the city}} had {{obtained}} permission to issue bonds to replace {{the rest of the}} swing bridges on the Chicago River. Ericson sent the Scherzer Company and the Sanitary District specifications for the bridge in 1905. A design by John W. Page, the inventor of a bascule bridge over the Sanitary and Ship Canal, was rejected in March 1905 due to <b>noncompliance</b> to specifications. The Scherzer Company waited until the bidding deadline to submit two separate designs; both of these were also rejected due to <b>noncompliance.</b> Two contracts were bid out for the trunnion style bascule bridge that Ericson had pioneered; one contract for $81,369 (1905) went to the Jackson and Corbett Company for the substructure, and one for $111,983 (1905) went to the Roemheld and Gallery Company for superstructure work.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{evidence}} from Pakistan, Libya, and multiple confessions from North Korea itself, the United States accused North Korea of <b>noncompliance</b> and halted oil shipments; North Korea later claimed its public {{confession of guilt}} had been deliberately misconstrued. By the end of 2002, the Agreed Framework was officially abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans for}} the moving of Star Trek: The Experience stalled when Neonopolis lost the license due to <b>noncompliance</b> with {{the terms of the}} {{contract}} caused by a lack of funding. CBS released a statement that they were still 100% behind the reopening, but it would be more like 2012.|$|E
25|$|The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association {{announced}} plans to expel 850 factories from its membership due to <b>noncompliance</b> with safety and labor standards. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives have also urged the U.S. Trade Representative's office to complete its review of Bangladesh's compliance with eligibility requirements for the Generalized System of Preferences.|$|E
25|$|The Obama {{administration}} has increased {{scrutiny of the}} provision of credit to poor and African American neighbourhoods. Lenders have come under investigation for not operating in such areas, whether they have halted service there or have never operated in them before. Former Atlantic associate editor Daniel Indiviglio attributes increasing <b>noncompliance</b> with the CRA to the tightening of lending requirements.|$|E
25|$|However, Moscow under Luzhkov invited several {{restrictions}} to this rule, partially {{keeping the}} old system. Each non-resident, who {{arrives in the}} city, must register with the local police department within 90 days of their arrival. The fine for <b>noncompliance</b> is 2500 rubles of penalty, {{and he or she}} would have trouble getting legal employment. Moscow police frequently ask for people's identification to check whether they have a propiska.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, July 6, 2015, Mayweather was {{stripped}} of his WBO Welterweight Champion (147 lbs) title for <b>noncompliance</b> with the regulations of the organization. Mayweather won the WBO Welterweight title when he beat Manny Pacquiao in the May 2 bout. However, the WBO rules say that boxers cannot hold world titles in multiple weight classes, and Mayweather already held two junior middleweight championship titles {{when he won the}} welterweight title.|$|E
25|$|The Department also {{continues}} to note patterns of <b>noncompliance</b> in Mexico’s judicial system. Abuses of the Amparo appeal system during this reporting period often led to excessive delays in Convention cases and further increased the legal costs incurred by the left-behind parent. In the few successful cases {{that led to}} the return of the child to the United States, the left-behind parent turned to a private attorney who better understood the principles of the Convention.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was {{not able}} to send {{investigators}} {{to the scene of the}} incident due to the U.S federal government shutdown. After the agency reopened, the NHTSA began gathering data of the incident. On 24 October 2013, the agency announced it will not open a formal investigation into the Model S fire incident, saying that they had not found evidence that the fire was caused by a vehicle defect or <b>noncompliance.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{consideration}} of Mexico's history of <b>noncompliance,</b> as documented extensively {{over the past}} 11 years in the US State Department's annual compliance reports, Texas courts made a landmark decision finding Mexico's legal system ineffective and lacking legal mechanisms for the immediate and effective enforcement of child custody orders and, furthermore stating, Mexico posed a risk to children's physical health and safety due to human rights violations committed against children, including child labor {{and a lack of}} child abuse laws.|$|E
25|$|Another {{expressed}} {{concern was that}} the banks might lobby the IFC to weaken its standards on which the Principles are based. The banks point out that IFC revised and strengthened its policies in 2006 and that the banks correspondingly strengthened the Equator Principles in the same year. Other criticisms include alleged lack of enforcement and accountability, free-riders, and that {{the scope of the}} principles is limited to project finance only. Several banks have sought to address these concerns by publishing summaries of their Equator Principles screening, including the number of projects they turned down for <b>noncompliance.</b>|$|E
25|$|North Korea's {{nuclear weapons}} program {{dates back to the}} 1980s. Focusing on {{practical}} uses of nuclear energy and the completion of a nuclear weapon development system, North Korea began to operate facilities for uranium fabrication and conversion, and conducted high-explosive detonation tests. In 1985 North Korea ratified the NPT but did not include the required safeguards agreement with the IAEA until 1992. In early 1993, while verifying North Korea's initial declaration, the IAEA concluded that there was strong evidence this declaration was incomplete. When North Korea refused the requested special inspection, the IAEA reported its <b>noncompliance</b> to the UN Security Council. In 1993, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT, but suspended that withdrawal before it took effect.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, {{the revelation}} of Iran's clandestine uranium {{enrichment}} program raised concerns {{that it might be}} intended for non-peaceful uses. The IAEA launched an investigation in 2003 after an Iranian dissident group revealed undeclared nuclear activities carried out by Iran. In 2006, because of Iran's <b>noncompliance</b> with its NPT obligations, the United Nations Security Council demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs. In 2007, the United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) stated that Iran halted an alleged active nuclear weapons program in fall 2003. In November 2011, the IAEA reported credible evidence that Iran had been conducting experiments aimed at designing a nuclear bomb until 2003, and that research may have continued on a smaller scale after that time.|$|E
25|$|MEXICO: In view of {{the large}} number of {{unresolved}} applications for return of children from Mexico, 33 of the 56, the Department considers Mexico to have demonstrated a pattern of <b>noncompliance</b> with the obligations of the Convention. Ongoing efforts by the Department of State to address Mexicos lack of compliance include: a meeting of the Director of the Office of Childrens Issues and the Mexican Central Authority in May 1997; attendance in January 1998 of a representative of the U.S. Central Authority at a binational meeting on child abduction organized by California's Attorney General's office and the Mexican Consulate in San Diego; a November 1998 meeting involving a representative of the United States Central Authority, the Mexican Central Authority and Mexican Foreign Ministry officials.|$|E
25|$|A {{regional}} technical commission harmonizes {{mechanisms for}} accreditation across member nations, and resolves any situation not {{be covered by}} the equivalency table. This commission includes delegations from the ministries of education of each member nation, and meets whenever at least two member states think it necessary. Meeting sites are established on a rotating basis. Any disputes among member states as a result of application, construction, or <b>noncompliance</b> regarding provisions related to education are initially resolved by direct diplomatic negotiations. Should the countries not reach an accord or only partially resolve the dispute, they resort to procedures set out in the dispute resolution system. Should the member nations enter into a bilateral convention or accord with provisions more favorable to their students, the member states in question can apply whichever provisions they consider most advantageous.|$|E
25|$|Another {{focus of}} Indjejikian's {{research}} is the responsibilities and compensation of CEOs and CFOs {{of public and private}} corporations. Several of his papers have examined how firms design their bonus plans for the CFO and CEO and contrast those plans to decision making. The research of these papers was through surveys of members of the American Institute of CPA's. The main findings of these papers were that bonuses are based on the length of executive tenure, size of the firm, and length of the product development and life cycle. The papers also found public companies, relative to private companies have reduced the percentage of bonus based on financial reporting {{to the extent that the}} Sarbanes-Oxley Act has made firms much more concerned about the integrity of their financial reports and increased the costs of <b>noncompliance.</b>|$|E
25|$|On June 22 (18 {{days after}} {{publication}} of Snowden's NSA documents began), officials revoked his U.S. passport. On June 23, Snowden boarded the commercial Aeroflot flight SU213 to Moscow, accompanied by Sarah Harrison of WikiLeaks. Hong Kong authorities said that Snowden {{had not been}} detained for the U.S. because the request had not fully complied with Hong Kong law, {{and there was no}} legal basis to prevent Snowden from leaving. On June 24, a U.S. State Department spokesman rejected the explanation of technical <b>noncompliance,</b> accusing the Hong Kong government of deliberately releasing a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant and after having sufficient time to prohibit his travel. That same day, Julian Assange said that WikiLeaks had paid for Snowden's lodging in Hong Kong and his flight out.|$|E
25|$|Section 954 of Dodd–Frank {{deals with}} {{clawback}} of compensation policies, which work {{to ensure that}} executives do not profit from inaccurate financial reporting. These provisions require the SEC to create regulations that must be adopted by national stock exchanges, which in turn require publicly traded companies who wish to be listed on the exchange to have clawback policies. These policies require executives to return inappropriately awarded compensation, as set forth in section 953 regarding pay for performance, {{in the case of}} an accounting restatement due to <b>noncompliance</b> with reporting requirements. If an accounting restatement is made then the company must recover any compensation paid to current or former executives associated with the company the three years prior to the restatement. The SEC proposed regulations dealing with clawback of compensation in July 2015.|$|E
25|$|Mayor Ed Koch too {{explored}} {{possibilities for}} {{a ban on}} private cars in 1979, only permitting mass transit, delivery, and emergency vehicles. The city's transportation commissioner said that limited bans on two streets in midtown Manhattan had been successful. The next year, Koch's office sought to ban single-occupancy cars from the East River bridges during weekday morning rush hour, but the State Supreme Court ruled that the City did not have that authority. Other actions, such as bicycle and bus lanes, reduction in parking spaces, and automobile inspections, were left in place. In 1981, the national administration deemed New York City {{in compliance with the}} federal air pollution regulations after a decade of <b>noncompliance.</b> Carbon monoxide levels decreased over the decade with improvements in car emissions. The number of cars inbound to Manhattan continued to rise and vehicle exhaust remained the top source of pollution in New York City.|$|E
25|$|After {{the demise}} of Commodus, Roman emperor, in 192 A.D, the rivalry between his generals, Pescennius Niger and Septimius Severus, arose; and Vologases V, Parthian emperor, decided to support Niger against Severus. According to Herodian's History, the Parthian emperor only managed to request his local {{following}} governors to send troops to aid Niger; as Vologases V did not possess a great army. Eventually in 194, Severus won the quest for power in Rome; he invaded Western Mesopotamia in order to retake the lost regions; the accurate details of the invasion is not known, but Osroene and Nusaybin were retaken anyway. Then Severus returned to Rome due to Clodius Albinus's rebellion; during Severus's return from Mesopotamia, {{the status of the}} Parthian Empire was very disrupted. In 197, Severus initiated hostilities with the Parthians. Meanwhile, Vologases suppressed a rebellion in east of the Empire; Narses, governor of Adiabene (a region to the west of current Lake Urmia), disobeyed to accompany Vologases to invade the East to suppress the rebellion; the <b>noncompliance</b> and also Narses's friendly relations with Rome caused Vologases' attack to Adiabene and destroying multiple cities of it and also killing Narses.|$|E
25|$|It is Tobias’s friend Harry (and his wife, Edna) {{who bring}} the play to its conclusion, forcing Tobias {{to define what}} {{friendship}} is all about. In the end, Tobias proclaims that friendship is not about wants but rather about rights. Tobias’s friend Harry {{has the right to}} move into Tobias’s house even if that is not what Tobias, or the rest of his family, wants. Contradicting this conclusion is the story concerning his cat that Tobias tells {{in the middle of the}} play. In this case, the cat wanted to be left alone. Tobias was uncomfortable with the cat’s <b>noncompliance,</b> and eventually he hits the cat and then has the cat euthanised. But disregarding the cat, Tobias seems true to his definition of friendship. He has, after all, allowed his sister-in-law to live off him. He allows his thirty-something daughter to continually move in and out of his house, and he tolerates his wife. He also tolerates his friend Harry’s moving into his house uninvited. At the end of the play, Tobias questions Harry’s efforts at friendship and honesty. Then he apologizes. Albee admits that the character of Tobias is based on his adopted father.|$|E
500|$|For an offer, such as [...] "you may use my car {{whenever}} you like", {{the consequence of}} compliance [...] "represents a situation which is preferred to the norm". <b>Noncompliance,</b> that is, not taking up the offer {{of the use of}} the car, is identical to the norm, and so neither more nor less preferable. Threats, on the other hand, are characterised by compliance that leads to an outcome less preferable to the norm, with <b>noncompliance</b> leading to an outcome less desirable still. For instance, if someone is threatened with [...] "your money or your life", compliance would lead to them losing their money, while <b>noncompliance</b> would lead to them losing their life. Both are less desirable than the norm (that is, not being threatened at all), but, for the subject of the threat, losing money is more desirable than being killed. A throffer is a third kind of intervention. It differs from both a threat and an offer, as compliance is preferable to the norm, while <b>noncompliance</b> is less preferable than the norm.|$|E
500|$|Responding to Steiner, Robert Stevens {{provides}} {{examples of}} what he categorises variously as offers, threats and throffers that fail to meet Steiner's definitions. He gives {{an example of an}} intervention he considers a throffer, as opposed to a threat, but in which both compliance and <b>noncompliance</b> are less preferable to the norm. The example is that of someone who makes the demand [...] "either you accept my offer of a handful of beans for your cow, or I kill you". For the subject, keeping the cow is preferred to both compliance and <b>noncompliance</b> with the throffer. Using this and other examples, Stevens argued that Steiner's account of differentiating the three kinds of interventions is incorrect.|$|E
500|$|In its place, Stevens {{suggests}} that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends {{not on the}} desirability of compliance and <b>noncompliance</b> {{when compared to the}} norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or <b>noncompliance</b> when compared with what their desirability would have been were no intervention made. He proposes that a throffer is made if P attempts to encourage Q to do A by increasing [...] "the desirability to Q of Q doing A relative to what it would have been if P made no proposal and decrease the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A relative to what it would have been if P made no proposal". An offer, by contrast, increases the desirability to Q of Q doing A compared to how it would have been without P's intervention, leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A as it would have been. A threat decreases the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A compared to what it would have been without P's intervention, while leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing A as it would have been.|$|E
