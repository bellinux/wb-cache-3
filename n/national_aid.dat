5|$|After Babs {{passed the}} hardest hit areas, workers were {{initially}} unable to distribute food and medicine due to ferry service being halted. Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by <b>national</b> <b>aid</b> workers. The Department of Public Works and Highways worked quickly to clear the landslides and reopen closed roads. The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000sacks of rice to storm victims, and the country planned to import 300,000tonnes of rice to overcome the lost crops. The Philippine Red Cross deployed search and rescue teams, as well as distributing food and coffee to 35,500people. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement launched a global request for assistance worth about $2.2million to help 240,000people.|$|E

500|$|Supply {{distribution}} centers {{were established}} in Ormoc, providing residents with food, water, and materials, by November11. People were given a can of sardines and 1kg (2.2lb) of rice at these centers. These centers were only able to operate in daylight though {{due to a lack}} of fuel and transportation. Water was supplied in limited quantities from Cebu. Medical and sanitation teams were deployed throughout the province, with many coming from surrounding areas. Residents searched through debris for lumber to construct makeshift coffins while others stacked bodies to be picked up by wheelbarrows or trucks. Officials had difficulty determining how to best deal with mass casualties as bodies lay across the Ormoc region. Many were found in the coastal barangays of Linao, Camp Downes, and Bantigue as well as the Ormoc pier. In order to prevent the spread of disease, mass graves were dug, with 700bodies buried on November8. Dump trucks were used to transport the dead to these sites as quickly as possible. As decomposition set in, residents stated that [...] " [...] putrid smell was unbearable." [...] Even months after the storm, bodies were occasionally discovered, some found in drainage systems. By November10, four navy vessels were searching debris in the waters near Ormoc for bodies; 16 were recovered that day with more believed to be submerged in the bay. Roads surrounding the city were finally cleared by November12; however, electricity remained out. With the deployment of medical teams from Japan, hospitals in the region returned to full capacity. By November22, electricity and water had been 70percent and 60percent restored, respectively. The emergency phase of assistance ended on November29 and coordination of disaster relief was returned to the Philippines. By that time, <b>national</b> <b>aid</b> to Ormoc reached $1.1million, with more than half coming from a presidential grant.|$|E
