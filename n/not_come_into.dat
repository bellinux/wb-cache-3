5|$|Even {{though the}} miners {{were able to}} reach a {{settlement}} in early 1990, the case of the UMWA vs. Pittston Coal Company did not end in 1990. The fines, over $60 million, did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> bargaining until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges. However, since the case was now in the court system, many courts wanted the UMWA to be responsible for all of the fines. The UMWA appealed all fines against them and the case remained undecided for many years.|$|E
5000|$|We feel sadness by {{the fact}} that somewhere people <b>came</b> <b>into</b> {{existence}} and suffer, and we feel no sadness {{by the fact}} that somewhere people <b>not</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> existence and in this place there is no happy people. When we know that somewhere people <b>came</b> <b>into</b> existence and suffering, we feel compassion. The fact that on some deserted island or planet, people <b>not</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> existence and <b>not</b> suffer is good. This is because the absence of pain is good even when there is someone who is experiencing this good. On the other hand, we do not feel sadness {{by the fact that}} on some deserted island or planet people <b>not</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> existence and are not happy. This is because the absence of pleasure is bad only when there is someone who is deprived of this good.|$|R

5|$|The port's modern name did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> {{widespread}} use until 1925; the current port {{was constructed in}} 1932 under the governorship of Franklin D.

5|$|Jackals, or Kig-Yar, (from {{the moon}} of Eayn, {{orbiting}} Chu'ot) carry energy shields or ranged weaponry. Shield or armor colors denotes {{the rank of}} each caste. In some cases, such as with the Jackals, the overall design was honed once the enemy's role was clearly defined. They look like bird-like creatures or raptors. This particular species did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the Covenant {{in the same way}} as other species. They work as mercenaries, as their culture is based on piracy and do not follow the religious beliefs like the other species. In the Halo book, Halo: Contact Harvest, it was revealed that Jackals were the first species in the Covenant to encounter humanity. The resulting events initiated the start of the Human-Covenant War.|$|E

5|$|Laces, straps, or rivets {{were used}} to affix the crest to the helm, with the join being covered by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet {{in the case of}} {{high-ranking}} nobles. Torses did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> regular use in Britain until the 15th century, and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a chapeau, as in the royal crest of England.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{to hold an}} inter-continental {{sporting}} event between Asia and Africa was initiated in April 1983, with New Delhi as the proposed venue. However, for unknown circumstances, the venue was shifted to Kuwait and the Games were proposed {{to be held in}} 1985. Political instability led to the cancellation of the Games. In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games. The Games were then scheduled for 1991. The plans went wrong due to inefficient communication between the members, and so could <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> force.|$|E
5|$|After impressing against Conference National club York City in a FA Cup fourth {{qualifying}} round tie, Brodie trialled {{with the}} club and played in their reserve team, whilst also being allowed to play for Benfield in the FA Vase. He signed for York on transfer deadline day, 31 January 2007, on a contract {{until the end of}} 2006–07 for a nominal fee. He scored two minutes into his York debut with the third goal in a 4–0 victory away to Altrincham on 10 February 2007, having entered the match as a 64th-minute substitute. He was sent off during a North Riding Cup match for York's reserves against Scarborough in February 2007, but a suspension did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> place until 14 days later, meaning he was able to play league-leaders Dagenham & Redbridge. York ranked fourth in the Conference National and Brodie played in both legs of the play-off semi-final defeat to Morecambe, losing 2–1 on aggregate, and finished the season with 14 appearances and one goal. In May 2007, York exercised their option to extend his contract for 2007–08.|$|E

5|$|Like Sweden, John II Casimir {{was also}} looking for allies to break the {{deadlock}} of the war. On 1 December 1656, he signed an alliance with Ferdinand III of Habsburg in Vienna, essentially a declaration of Ferdinand III's intend to mediate a peace rather than provide military aid, which did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> effect until Ferdinand's death on 2 April 1657. The treaty was however renewed and amended on 27 May by Ferdinand's successor Leopold I of Habsburg, who agreed in Vienna to provide John II Casimir with 12,000 troops maintained at Polish expense; in return, Leopold received Kraków and Posen in pawn. Receiving the news, Frederick III of Denmark promptly declared war on Sweden, and by June the Austrian army entered the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the south, immediately stabilizing the situation in southern Poland, while Denmark attacked Swedish Bremen-Verden and turned to Jämtland and Västergötland in July.|$|E
5|$|Premier League chief {{executive}} Rick Parry and chairman Sir John Quinton were assigned {{the task of}} finding suitors. Parry initially favoured working with ITV, led by Greg Dyke, but wanted the network to pay in excess of £30 million for live football. In the meantime BSkyB – a company formed by the merger of Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television, and British Satellite Broadcasting – looked into the possibility of obtaining live rights to the Premier League. BSkyB {{chief executive}} Sam Chisholm attempted to make a joint offer with ITV which did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> fruition, so he formed an alliance with the BBC, aware the corporation wanted a highlights package. Although Chisholm was against Parry's idea of a football-only channel, he built a rapport with the Premier League and his company invited Parry to its facilities in Livingston, where he spoke to Murdoch in person.|$|E
5|$|Self-incompatible, Acacia pycnantha cannot {{fertilise}} {{itself and}} requires cross-pollination between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries {{are located on}} phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing nectar that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of honeyeater, including the white-naped, yellow-faced, New Holland, and occasionally white-plumed and crescent honeyeaters, and Eastern spinebills have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the silvereye, striated, buff-rumped and brown thornbills. As well as eating nectar, birds often pick off insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally do <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact with the flowers during this activity. The presence of Acacia pycnantha is positively correlated with numbers of swift parrots overwintering in box–ironbark forest in central Victoria, {{though it is not}} clear whether the parrots are feeding on them or some other factor is at play.|$|E

5|$|The above {{procedures}} {{are not sufficient}} to cause an Act of Tynwald to come into full force of law. By ancient custom, an Act did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> force until it had been promulgated at an open-air sitting of the Tynwald, historically held on Tynwald Hill at St John's on St John's Day (24 June), but, since {{the adoption of the}} Gregorian calendar in 1753, on 5 July (or on the following Monday if 5 July is a Saturday or Sunday). Promulgation originally consisted of the reading of the Act in English and Manx; but after 1865 the reading of the title of the Act and a summary of each section was sufficient. This was reduced in 1895 to the titles and a memorandum of the object and purport of the Act, and since 1988 only the short title and a summary of the long title have been read.|$|E
5|$|She {{was still}} {{assigned}} to the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet in Scapa Flow {{at the start of}} World War I. On 15 December the ship was badly damaged due to severe weather in the Pentland Firth as she sortied to intercept German ships bombarding ports in Yorkshire and had to return to port for repairs. Blanche was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron, joining her sister ship, , in January 1916. On 28 February, she was one of three cruisers dispatched to patrol off the Norwegian coast during the hunt for the German raider SMS Greif, although she did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact with the German ship before she was sunk. Captain John Casement relieved Hyde on 21 May. During the Battle of Jutland, she was assigned to a position {{at the rear of the}} squadron during the battle and did not fire her guns. By January 1917, Blanche was detached from the Grand Fleet, presumably to be converted into a minelayer and Casement was relieved by Captain The Honourable Reginald Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax on 15 January. The ship had been {{assigned to the}} 5th Battle Squadron by April. Blanche laid mines at the entrance to the Kattegat on the nights of 18/19 and 24/25 February 1918, part of her total of 1,238 mines laid during 16 sorties during the war. Captain Francis Buller assumed command in lieu of Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax on 5 April 1918. He, in turn, was relieved by Captain Charles Wrightson on 7 January 1919. The ship was still assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron in February, but had been assigned to the Nore Reserve by 1 May, together with Blonde. The sisters were listed for sale by 18 March 1920 and Blanche was sold to Fryer for scrap on 27 July 1921 and broken up at Sunderland.|$|E
