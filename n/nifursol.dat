40|$|Six {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effect of added <b>nifursol</b> on growth and feed utilization in turkeys and its efficacy against histomoniasis. Data from these experiments indicate or suggest that <b>nifursol</b> tends to stimulate growth, is not toxic at levels of 50 to 1600 ppm, and has good efficacy against histomoniasis at relatively low levels. Three growth studies were conducted in which <b>nifursol</b> levels of 50 to 1600 ppm, were fed in a practical-type, corn-soybean diet (28 percent protein). Turkeys fed from day old to four weeks of age were used in these studies. None of the <b>nifursol</b> levels depressed body weight gain or increased mortality {{as compared to the}} unsupplemented basal diet. <b>Nifursol,</b> when fed continuously to male and female turkeys from day-old to 24 weeks of age at levels of 0, 50, 75, 100, and 200 ppm., tended to increase or had no effect on body weight gain. Survival and body weight data indicated that <b>nifursol</b> at the levels used was not toxic over extended feeding periods. Two histomoniasis exposure {{experiments were}} conducted with poults 33 - 71 ad 78 - 121 days of age. Mortality and morbidity due to histomoniasis were significantly reduced (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the medicated, exposed poults as compared to the unmedicated, exposed poults. The data indicated that the level of <b>nifursol</b> added to diets of older birds may be reduced below the level necessary for protection in younger birds, due to the increased feed and/or drug intake of older turkeys. The most effective protection against mortality and morbidity due to histomoniasis in both experiments was observed with the addition of 75 ppm of <b>nifursol</b> in the diets. Advisor: Thomas W.

40|$|<b>Nifursol</b> has {{recently}} been prohibited {{for use as a}} feed additive. Considering the similarity in structure between <b>nifursol</b> and the other nitrofurans, an analogous metabolism could be expected. To study the formation of tissue-bound residues in poultry, broilers were treated orally with <b>nifursol</b> during a period of 7 consecutive days, via medicated feed at a dosage of 50 mg/kg feed. Muscle, kidney, liver, bile and plasma samples were collected at the day of cessation of medication (day 0) and at days 3, 7, 14 and 21 after the end of medication. Samples were analysed for <b>nifursol</b> and the acid-hydrolysable side-chain of <b>nifursol</b> (DNSH; 3, 5 -dinitro salicylhydrazide). Samples were also analysed for the ratio between free (solvent-extractable) metabolites and tissue-bound (non-extractable) metabolites. The results obtained clearly indicate the formation of tissue-bound residues in poultry. Concentrations of non-extractable residue at zero withdrawal time averaged to 900 µg/kg in liver tissue, 2000 µg/kg in kidney tissue, 225 µg/kg in muscle tissue, 1000 µg/kg in bile and 1000 µg/kg in plasma. Taking into account an LoD of 1 µg/kg, non-extractable residues of DNSH can be detected for at least 3 weeks after administration in liver, kidney, bile and plasma and for up to 2 weeks in muscle tissue. The amounts of extractable residues were relatively low, in many instances less than 10 % of the total amount of residue. In general terms the depletion data obtained show a similar behaviour of <b>nifursol</b> in broilers as previously found for furazolidone and furaltadone in broilers...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} novel immunoconjugates were designed, {{synthesized}} and {{then used to}} develop a rapid, specific and sensitive indirect ELISA method to directly detect residues of 3, 5 -dinitrosalicyclic acid hydrazide (DNSH), a toxic metabolite of <b>nifursol</b> present in chicken tissues. The hapten DNSHA was first designed and used to covalently couple to BSA to form an immunogen which was immunized to rabbits to produce a polyclonal antibody against DNSH. Furthermore, a novel 3, 5 -dinitrosalicylic acidovalbumin (DNSA-OVA) immunoconjugate structurally different from DNSHA-OVA was designed and used as a Ã¢Â€Âœsubstructural coating antigenÃ¢Â€Â to improve the sensitivity of an indirect ELISA analysis for a direct DNSH detection. Based on the Ã¢Â€Âœsubstructural coating antigenÃ¢Â€Â concept, an optimized indirect ELISA method was established that exhibited good specificity and high sensitivity for detecting DNSH, with a cross-reactivity of less than 0. 1 % (excluding the parent compound <b>nifursol),</b> IC 50 of 0. 217 nmol/mL and detection limit of 0. 018 nmol/mL. Finally, a simple and efficient analysis of DNSH samples in chicken tissues showed that the average recovery rate of the indirect ELISA analysis was 82. 3 %, with the average coefficient of variation 15. 9 %. Thus, the developed indirect ELISA method exhibited {{the potential for a}} rapid detection of DNSH residues in tissue...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the identification and}} quantitative determination of 3, 5 -dinitrosalicylic acid hydrazide (DSH), the marker residue of <b>nifursol</b> metabolites in poultry (turkey, broiler) muscle and liver tissue. The method {{is based on the}} acid-catalysed hydrolysis of tissue-bound metabolites to free DSH and in situ derivatisation with 2 -nitrobenzaldehyde to the corresponding nitrophenyl derivative NPDSH. A structural analogue of DSH, 4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 - dinitrobenzoic acid hydrazide (HBH) was synthesised to serve as an internal standard. The analytes were isolated from the matrix by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Determination was performed by LC-MS/MS with negative electrospray ionisation. The [M - H]+ ions of NPDSH and NPHBH at m/z 374 were fragmented by collision induced dissociation (CID) producing transition ions at m/z 182, 183 and 226. The transition ions at m/z 182 and 226 were selected for monitoring of NPDSH while the transition ion at m/z 183 was selected for NPHBH. The method has been validated according to the EU criteria of Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC at 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 μg kg- 1 in muscle and liver tissue. A decision limit (CCα) was obtained of 0. 04 and 0. 025 μg kg- 1 in muscle and liver, respectively. Similarly a detection capability (CCβ) was obtained of 0. 10 and 0. 05 μg kg- 1 in muscle and liver, respectively. The introduction of HBH as an internal standard did not lead to a significant improvement of the quantitative performance of the method. In fact for liver better performance characteristics were obtained when the IS was not taken into account. Nevertheless, as a qualitative marker for recovery, HBH could still be very useful in the analysis of unknown samples. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005...|$|E
