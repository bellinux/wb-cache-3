The findings do, however, support the shamanist origin of the engravings because food remains from the site proved to be bones of small antelope, rock dassie and even lizards rather than the large species depicted.|$|E

5|$|The CFM56-4 {{series was}} a {{proposed}} improved {{version of the}} CFM56-2 designed for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. Competing with the RJ500 engine being developed by Rolls-Royce, the -4 series was designed to produce 25,000lbf (110kN) and was to feature a new 68in (1.73m) fan, a new low-pressure compressor and a full authority digital engine controller (FADEC). Soon after the upgrade project was launched in 1984, International Aero Engines offered their new V2500 engine for the A320. CFMI realized that the CFM56-4 did <b>not</b> <b>compare</b> favorably with the new engine and scrapped the project to begin working on the CFM56-5 series.|$|E

5|$|The Caroline period saw {{a decline}} in {{prosperity}} for Gray's Inn. Although there were many notable members of the Inn, both legal (Sir Dudley Digges, Thomas Bedingfield and Francis Bacon, for example) and non-legal (including William Juxon, the Archbishop of Canterbury), the list could <b>not</b> <b>compare</b> {{to that of the}} Elizabethan period.

5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, but it does <b>not</b> <b>compare</b> favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} the Millennium Monument was {{the starting point of}} the Peristyle appearance in Chicago. To this day, it is said to <b>not</b> <b>compare</b> to the once “commanding presence” that once stood in its place, before being demolished and replaced with an underground parking garage. The new monument was downsized by approximately 15% to accommodate a wheel-chair ramp for the disabled in a tight space. It also includes a “classical” take on the original, incorporating a fountain {{at the base of the}} limestone, Doric, column monument. The monument, despite being relatively small in comparison to the rest of Grant Park, makes its presence known as the central focus to shape Wrigley Square and the surrounding landscape. Wrigley Square is unique for its fountain that, unlike Buckingham Fountain, which is fenced off, remains open with a circular ledge to allow park-goers the freedom to sit next to the open water to enjoy the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Wilder's colleague, {{paediatrician}} Mynie Peterman, later formulated {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did <b>not</b> <b>compare</b> as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely {{to benefit from the}} diet, {{and the use of the}} ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E
5|$|After Hurricane Fay caused {{extensive}} {{power outages}} {{on the island}} just days before, residents of Bermuda were forced to complete preparations for Gonzalo in haste. Banks, businesses, schools, and government offices closed {{in advance of the}} storm, while the Royal Navy ship HMS Argyll left its post in the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance. The cyclone gradually weakened before crossing directly over central Bermuda at Category 2 strength around 00:30 UTC on October 18. Gonzalo battered the island with wind gusts as high as , downing hundreds of trees and creating widespread roof damage. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 total electricity customers were without power; service was not fully restored until early November. Many roads were impassable immediately following the hurricane, and in many cases the damage done by Gonzalo was indistinguishable from that of Fay. Bermuda Regiment soldiers and sailors from the Argyll took part in initial cleanup and repairs on the territory, and preliminary assessments revealed that the storm did <b>not</b> <b>compare</b> to the devastation of Hurricane Fabian in 2003. Catastrophe modelling firms estimated that Bermuda suffered up to $400million in losses, and despite the heavy disruptions, no deaths or serious injuries were reported there.|$|E

30|$|Previously, {{numerical}} {{studies of}} three-phase separators mostly used the Eulerian–Eulerian method. Vilagines and Akhras (2010) used the CFD model {{to evaluate the}} effect of new internals on the efficiency of a three-phase separator. They used the shear stress transport turbulence model and three-phase Eulerian model to simulate the multiphase flow. In that study, {{the results of the}} CFD simulation and the experimental data were <b>not</b> <b>compared.</b> Kharoua et al. (2012) used a CFD model to modify a production separator. The well-known k–ε turbulence model and the Eulerian–Eulerian multiphase approach were used to study the three-phase separation phenomena. Again, in that study, the numerical calculation results were <b>not</b> <b>compared</b> with the experimental data.|$|R
