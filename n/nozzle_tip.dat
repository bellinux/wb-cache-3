It {{is important}} to understand these factors as spray droplet size affects both drift and efficacy of pesticides, which is a main concern with pesticide application. A laser particle analyzer was used to determine the spray droplet size and distributions of a range of formulations sprayed through several types of <b>nozzle</b> <b>tips.</b> <b>Nozzles</b> included were extended range flat fan sizes 11003 and 11005 (Spraying Systems XR), air induction flat fan sizes 11005 and 11004 (AI) air induction extended range flat fan size 11005 (AIXR), preorifice flat fan size 11005 (TT), and a second preorifice flat fan size 2. 5 (TF). Several deposition/ retention adjuvants were studied, including Array, Interlock, In-Place, and Thrust. Another study looked at diflufenzopyr + dicamba (Status, BASF) in combination with several adjuvants. Also, three fungicides were evaluated at differing spray volumes.

A circular ring protruding at the exit of a conical <b>nozzle</b> forms the <b>tip</b> ring <b>nozzle.</b> The innovative ESTS lobed nozzle comprising of four elliptic lobes with sharp tips that do not protrude deep into the core supersonic flow is produced by a novel yet simple methodology. A comparative experimental study is conducted between a conical nozzle, an ESTS lobed <b>nozzle</b> and a <b>tip</b> ring <b>nozzle</b> with exit Mach number of 2. 3. For the first time, the three dimensional flow structure from ESTS lobed <b>nozzle</b> and <b>tip</b> ring <b>nozzle</b> is revealed from laser scattering flow visualization experiments on the free jet. A doubling of jet spreading rate is observed in the ESTS lobed nozzle. When applied to a supersonic ejector, both nozzles achieve a 30 % increase in entrainment of secondary flow. The loss of compression ratio is 15 % for the ESTS lobed nozzle while it is 50 % for the <b>tip</b> ring <b>nozzle.</b> Further, the behavior of wall static pressure profile corroborates mixing enhancement.

A spray pyrolysis system was specially designed and built for this study. The influence of <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size on {{the properties of the}} produced powder was examined. When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size was 1 mm, the particle size distribution was more uniform than when other <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> sizes were used and the average particle size of the powder was about 15 nm. When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size increases to 2 mm, the average particle size increases to roughly 20 nm, and the particle size distribution becomes more uneven. When the tip size increases to 3 mm, particles with an average size of 25 nm and equal to or less than 10 nm coexist and the particle size distribution becomes much more uneven. When the tip size increases to 5 mm, large particles with average size of 50 nm partially exist, mostly consisting of minute particles with average sizes in the range of 15 ~ 25 nm. When the tip size increases from 1 mm to 2 mm, the XRD peak intensities greatly increase while the specific surface area decreases.

Biodiesel, derived from pongamia seeds through transesterification process, blended with diesel was used as fuel in this work. The experiments were designed using a statistical tool known as Design of Experiments (DoE) based on response surface methodology (RSM). The resultant models of the response surface methodology were helpful to predict the response parameters such as Brake Specific Energy Consumption (BSEC), Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Carbon monoxide (CO), Hydrocarbon (HC), smoke opacity and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and further to identify the significant interactions between the input factors on the responses.

The main objective of this thesis to perform a computational study of pure gasoline fuel sprays structure development where it covers to parts; to determine the pure gasoline fuel spray angle and spray penetration depth characteristics using sing-hole port fuel injector (PFI) and to determine the impact of different injection pressure on the spray structure of pure gasoline fuel. The spray simulations are done completely by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) ANSYS CFX software with three <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> diameter; 0. 2 mm, 0. 3 mm and 0. 4 mm. The Computational Aided Design (CAD) model for each nozzle was drawn using the SolidWorks software, the nozzle is attached with 110 mm bore and 125 mm stroke combustion chamber. In the ANSYS CFX software, the ready CAD model is imported into the design modeler and under goes meshing process with fine relevance center, 4 m min size, 4 m max face size and 8 m max size. There are three types of boundary conditions applied to the meshed geometry model, the first is inlet boundary condition with various injection pressure of 100 bar, 150 bar, 200 bar and 250 bar. Opening boundary condition is then place at the combustion chamber with atmospheric pressure value that is 101325 Pa and the third boundary condition is wall. The iteration calculation is solved until the convergence approached to the desired residual value {{and the result is}} obtained and analyzed. The first comparison made is between penetration depth versus injection pressure and the other is between spray angle versus injection pressure, the results are then compared between nozzle diameter for each injection pressure. The results show that as the injection pressure increased, the penetration depth is also increased as well as the spray angle. The conclusion has shown that the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> diameter is also effecting the overall spray structure because wider <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> diameter will released more fuel quantity compared to the smaller <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> diameter...|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} has been developed to simulate the compressible jets flow from the top-blown lance with multi-nozzles in converter to a free surrounding domain. The variations of fluid density and viscosity, high temperature, and Mach number were taken into consideration in this model which was validated against the physical modeling results. More specifically, computations were obtained to compare the widely used realizable k-epsilon turbulence model against the standard k-omega turbulence model, which shows that the latter one is superior to calculate diverse turbulent conditions within the multiple jets. Moreover, the coalescence pattern of the multiple jets has been illustrated by their Mach number distribution, and each individual jet proceeds in a curve course, bending to the lance center and tending to unite. The effects of the inclination angles on the jets coalescence were also investigated, which indicates that the lower the inclination angle is, the stronger the interfering extent between the multiple jets is. With the help of this model, the dynamic power of the multiple jets to support the cavity formation was demonstrated, and additionally, a mathematical model concerning the effective penetration radius and digressing path of the multiple jets was proposed by taking the inclination angle and the axial distance from the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tips</b> as arguments...|$|R

Our MEA consists of 96 identical 10 -nozzle emitters in a circular array on a 3 -inch silicon chip. The geometry and configuration of the emitters, the dimension and number of the nozzles, and the micropillar arrays embedded in the main channel, can be systematically and precisely controlled during the microfabrication process. Combining electrostatic simulation and experimental testing, we demonstrated that sharpened-end geometry at the stem of the individual multinozzle emitter significantly enhanced the electric fields at its protruding <b>nozzle</b> <b>tips,</b> enabling sequential nanoelectrospray for the high-density emitter array. We showed that electrospray current of the multinozzle emitter at a given total flow rate was approximately proportional to the square root {{of the number of}} its spraying-nozzles, suggesting the capability of high MS sensitivity for multinozzle emitters. Using a conventional Z-spray mass spectrometer, we demonstrated reproducible MS detection of peptides and proteins for serial MEA emitters, achieving sensitivity and stability comparable to the commercial capillary emitters.

However, further research is neces-sary to optimize the use of CSC for many applications, particularly in patients with darker skin types, and in procedures with deep-targeted chromophores. Study Design/Materials and Methods: With the objec-tive to enhance cryogen spray atomization and introduce a passive mass deposition control, stainless steel wire meshes of various sizes were positioned in the spray path of two nozzles of different diameters (0. 7 and 1. 4 mm). A temperature sensor placed at a fixed distance below the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tips</b> measured variations in temperature {{as a function of}} time. Calculations for heat flux (q), and overall heat extraction (Q) were done through an inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP) algorithm. Results: The use of wire meshes reduced maximum q and thus cooling efficiency for both nozzles. However, for the larger diameter nozzle (1. 4 mm), cooling duration was prolonged significantly when compared to the case without mesh, which led to an increase in Q. Conclusions: Wire meshes, within the range of wire diameters used, are not desirable for use with the smaller diameter nozzle because they reduce cooling efficiency. For the larger diameter nozzle, however, the prolonged cooling duration and increase in Q may be beneficial for laser dermatological procedures directed towards deeper tar-geted chromophores, such as hair removal.

Vegetable oil has cetane number about 35 to 40 depending upon the composition where as diesel fuel have a cetane number around 45. certain functional groups and poor volatility isresponsible of their comparatively low cetane number. Vegetable oil and diesel differs greatly in other properties. Their kinematic viscosity is several times greater than for diesel oil the high viscosity of vegetable oils lead to pumping and atomization problems in the normal diesel fuel injection system, which creates filterplugging and cold starting high carbon residue causes heavy smoke emission and carbon deposition on the injection <b>nozzle</b> <b>tips</b> and in the combustion chamber.

Another purpose is to increase the cutting speed and minimize gas consumption under high pressure cutting conditions. The behavior of the exit jet under the condition of stagnation gas pressure ranging from 4 ∼ 16 bar are investigated by means of a computer simulation test. The results of theoretical analysis and of the simulation test show that for a supersonic jet, each sectional diameter and curve contour of the supersonic nozzle must be designed strictly according to the theory of gas dynamics.
