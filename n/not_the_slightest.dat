His powers of observation were blinded and his reasoning faculties so blunted by his prejudice in favor of anything psychic or occult that he could not, or would not, resist the influence.|$|E
25|$|The {{remarkable}} {{part about}} the finish of this game was that Hassett and his fellow-Australians left the ground in complete silence. There was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> evidence of jubilation at Australia's second victory of the rubber. Everybody, it seemed, wanted England to win.|$|E
25|$|The {{race of the}} Hellenes {{has been}} wiped out in Europe. Physical beauty, {{intellectual}} brilliance, innate harmony and simplicity, art, competition, city, village, the splendour of column and temple — indeed, even the name has disappeared {{from the surface of}} the Greek continent.... <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> drop of undiluted Hellenic blood flows in the veins of the Christian population of present-day Greece.|$|E

25|$|On {{the early}} hours of Good Friday, Lancaster landed his troops on the beach who {{surrounded}} Recife on both land and sea so that the Portuguese would be confused as to where the main attack was to come from. After a preliminary naval bombardment the English attacked on all sides and the Portuguese resistance although strong to start with soon petered out; Fort São Jorge was overwhelmed and the spit of land was taken with only minor loss and consequently the town itself was taken with little resistance. The garrison fled to Olinda almost three miles away who then took refuge and Lancaster with only ten casualties permitted <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> disorder after the place was taken.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his star}} {{students}} was Rabbi Shlomo Wahrman, a tremendous Torah scholar {{who came from}} Leipzig for fifteen years {{and went on to}} becoming principal and Rosh Yeshiva of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Rabbi Wahrman attributes his success to Rabbi Silver’s insistence and encouragement to hone his writing skills and record his copious chidushei Torah. Rabbi Wahrman writes in the short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times he screamed at me for lack of understanding-however, even then I sensed his great love and concern for me and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> hint of hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose very essence was giving to others-his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) knew no bounds…he saw every Jew as an extension of himself.|$|E
500|$|Burnett {{supported}} fellow Kentuckian John C. Breckinridge {{for president}} in the 1860 presidential election, but Breckinridge lost to Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln had campaigned against the expansion of slavery beyond the states in which it already existed. His victory in the election resulted in seven Southern states declaring their secession from the Union. Despite this, most Americans believed the Union could still be saved. Burnett, however, disagreed. In the January 7, 1861 issue of Paducah's Tri-Weekly Herald, he declared, [...] "There is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> hope of any settlement or adjustment of existing troubles." [...] Despite his pessimism, Burnett endorsed the ill-fated Peace Conference of 1861.|$|E

500|$|The Russian staffs, {{according}} to Polish Colonel Mieczysław Ścieżyński, [...] "had <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> hesitation about sending {{any and all}} messages of an operational nature by means of radiotelegraphy; there were periods during the war when, for purposes of operational communications and for purposes of command by higher staffs, no other means of communication whatever were used, messages being transmitted either entirely ("in clear," [...] or plaintext) or encrypted by means of such an incredibly uncomplicated system that for our trained specialists reading the messages was child's play. The same held for the chitchat of personnel at radiotelegraphic stations, where discipline was disastrously lax." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{church was}} consecrated on 21 December 1911 as the [...] "Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Holy Virgin Mary". It soon {{obtained}} {{the status of}} a chapel in the Peter and Paul parish. The consecration received extensive coverage in the Russian and Polish press. The Moscow newspaper, Russkoye Slovo, wrote: In the filthy, wretched Malaya Gruzinskaya (Little Georgian) Street, forsaken by God and the city, there rose the wonderful, highly artistic solidity of the new Roman Catholic church, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of Holy Virgin Mary. Tremendous in magnitude and height,... with a plenty of conning turrets and towers with crosses. The new cathedral makes a deep impression... looks impressive and eminent: <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> stylistic flaw could be seen or detected.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the fire the Office of Woods and Forests issued a report {{outlining}} the damage, stating that [...] "the strictest enquiry is in progress as {{to the cause of}} this calamity, but there is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> reason to suppose that it has arisen from any other than accidental causes." [...] The Times reported on some of the possible causes of the fire, but indicated that it was likely that the burning of the Exchequer tallies was to blame. The same day the cabinet ministers who were in London met for an emergency cabinet meeting; they ordered a list of witnesses to be drawn up, and on 22 October a committee of the Privy Council sat to investigate the fire.|$|E

500|$|Snodgrass was {{convinced}} that Poe died from alcoholism and did {{a great deal to}} popularize this idea. He was a supporter of the temperance movement and found Poe a useful example in his temperance work. However, Snodgrass's writings on the topic have been proven untrustworthy. Moran contradicted Snodgrass by stating in his own 1885 account that Poe did not die under the effect of any intoxicant. Moran claimed that Poe [...] "had <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> odor of liquor upon his breath or person". Even so, some newspapers at the time reported Poe's death as [...] "congestion of the brain" [...] or [...] "cerebral inflammation", euphemisms for deaths from disgraceful causes such as alcoholism. In a study of Poe, a psychologist suggested that Poe had dipsomania.|$|E
500|$|The American {{journalist}} George Thayer, who {{met with}} Tyndall in the 1960s, described him as being [...] "blonde and balding", with [...] "cold, evasive eyes". Thayer stated that Tyndall [...] "had <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> spark of humour. He was suspicious, nervous, and excitable, and moved with all the stiffness of a Prussian in Court." [...] In {{his study of the}} National Front, the journalist Martin Walker described Tyndall as giving off [...] "an impression of absolute, if brittle, self control". Nigel Fielding, another to have studied the NF, described Tyndall as [...] "a rather small man with a hard, unlined face and pale blue eyes. His movements are abrupt and energetic, and he speaks in a loud voice with a clipped inflection." [...] Walker described him as having a [...] "keen political mind", with a [...] "concern for organisation [...] meticulous planning".|$|E
500|$|Ibis, {{reviewing}} the Memoir of Thomas Bewick, written by himself in 1862, compares {{the effect of}} Bewick and Gilbert White, writing [...] "It was the pages of Gilbert White and the woodcuts of Bewick which first beguiled the English schoolboy to the observation of our feathered friends", and [...] "how few of our living naturalists but must gratefully acknowledge their early debt to White's 'History' and to the life-like woodcuts of Bewick!" [...] The reviewer judges that [...] "Probably we shall not wrong the cultivated annalist of Selborne by giving {{the first place to}} Bewick." [...] However, comparing them as people, [...] "Bewick has <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> claim to rank with Gilbert White as a naturalist. White was what Bewick never was, a man of science; but, if no naturalist, Bewick was a lover of nature, a careful observer, and a faithful copier of her ever-varying forms. In this, and in this alone, lies his charm." ...|$|E

500|$|The scholar Bernard B. Fall {{stated that}} [...] "there is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> {{doubt that this}} {{plebiscite}} was only a shade more fraudulent than most electoral tests under a dictatorship". The American journalist Stanley Karnow cited the dubious plebiscite as evidence of Diệm's [...] "mandarin mentality". Chapman wrote that [...] "...no amount of unilateral campaigning, anti-Bảo Đại sentiment, or Confucian political restraint could explain Diệm's 98 percent margin of victory in a politically heterogeneous South Vietnam. Corruption and intimidation must have played a significant role." [...] Buttinger {{said that while the}} monarchy was [...] "another rotten relic of Vietnam's past" [...] and Bảo Đại [...] "its last, unworthy representative", fraud and intimidation were unnecessary as Diệm would have won easily in any event. Historian David Anderson said the victory [...] "was not a true representation of Diệm's power or popularity. The emperor's weakness, the disarray of the political opposition, and other such factors explain his triumph".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 22, 1910. It states: [...] "May Brandon is a young woman of the present day who finds that the course of true love can sometimes run too smooth. She is engaged to the man of her choice, but no one objects. In fact, there is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> opposition to her marriage in any quarter. And, being a woman, she does not like it. Perhaps {{she would have been}} married in the orthodox way {{had it not been for}} a dream that she had. In her sleep she found herself a beautiful young woman, persecuted because she was loyal to the knight she had selected. Her father was obdurate, and finally practically made her a prisoner in his gloomy old castle. Her sweetheart called with a rope ladder. They escaped, and after a number of thrilling adventures were married, and presumably lived happy forever afterwards. When May awoke, she was more discontented than ever. She flouted her fiancé, and returned his ring and swore she would never marry him. But finally she told him of her dream, and he won forgiveness by promising to run away with her like the knight of her dreams. Being a man of his word, he did. But the romance all faded out of it. The adventures they passed through were not to the woman's liking, and her experience convinced her that swashbuckling knights are as much out of date as are stagecoaches." ...|$|E
500|$|A coach from Manchester {{eventually}} arrived bearing four surgeons, led by William Robert Whatton. By {{this time}} Huskisson was suffering severe spasms, and those present were having {{to hold his}} arms and legs down to stop him falling off the sofa. Whatton assessed that Huskisson was suffering from severe haemorrhaging from the initial wound and subsequent blood loss, and that amputation was necessary to prevent a fatal loss of blood. However, in Huskisson's agitated condition Whatton felt that traumatic surgery would likely prove fatal. Whatton and his colleagues applied warm water to Huskisson's chest, feet and hands, and gave him warm cordials and further laudanum in an effort to calm him enough to withstand the shock of surgery. At around 3.00pm the party heard the sound of cannon fire from the west. Told that the cannons were probably being fired to mark the arrival of the Prime Minister in Manchester, Huskisson said [...] "I hope to God the Duke may get safe through the day". At around 4.00pm Huskisson had regained enough strength to dictate to William Wainewright, his secretary, a brief amendment to his will ensuring that Emily Huskisson would inherit all his property, and shakily signed it. He then requested the sacrament, which was performed by the Rev Blackburne, and read the Lord's Prayer with Wilton. When Huskisson came to the line [...] "and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us", he said [...] "That I do most heartily; and I declare to God that I have <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> feeling of ill-will towards any human being." ...|$|E

Following Australia's narrow victory in the second Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2007–08, Roebuck accused the Australians of [...] "bad sportsmanship and triumphalism", describing the Australian team as a [...] "pack of wild dogs" [...] and writing that Ponting has [...] "shown <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> interest in {{the well-being of the}} game, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> sign of diplomatic skills, not a single mark of respect for his accomplished and widely admired opponents." ...|$|E
