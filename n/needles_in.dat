5|$|In January 2003, Canadian Brent Moffat set the World Record {{for most}} body piercings in one session (700 piercings with 18g {{surgical}} <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> 1 session of 7 hours, using play piercing where {{the skin is}} pierced and sometimes jewellery is inserted, which is worn temporarily). In December of the same year, Moffat had 900 piercings in 4½ hours. On 4 March 2006, the record was overturned by Kam Ma, who had 1,015 temporary metal rings inserted in 7 hours and 55 minutes. The record for most body piercings with surgical needles was set on 29 May 2008, when Robert Jesus Rubio allowed 900 18-gauge, -long surgical needles to be inserted into his body.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E

40|$|Background: Pneumothorax is a {{very rare}} but serious {{complication}} associated with acupuncture and dry needling around the thoracic region. Physiotherapists and other health practitioners {{should be aware of}} the risks associated with <b>needling</b> <b>in</b> this region and should take care to minimize the possibility of an iatrogenic pneumothorax. Findings: An awareness of the signs and symptoms of a pneumothorax is necessary for practitioners using acupuncture and dry <b>needling</b> <b>in</b> the thoracic region. Understanding the normal anatomy and its variants can minimize risk associated with <b>needling</b> practices <b>in</b> this region. Various technique modifications are suggested so that the pleura or lungs are avoided while using acupuncture or dry <b>needling</b> <b>in</b> the thoracic region. Discussion/Conclusion: Acupuncture and dry <b>needling</b> <b>in</b> this region administered by well-trained physiotherapists and other health practitioners is very safe; however, to maximize safety therapists should consider the relevant anatomy and not practise using advanced acupuncture and dry needling techniques without adequate competency-based training.

25|$|Needle {{exchange}} programmes are not {{a strategy}} officially sanctioned by the Ministry of Public Security since such strategies {{give the appearance of}} condoning drug use. Thus, when this strategy was first introduced, it was called needle social marketing – increasing the commercial availability and accessibility of <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> combination with health education about safe injecting practices and, in some cases, provision of free needles. Since 2001, the State Council has officially advocated needle social marketing as an HIV prevention measure. Evidence from research and study tours to countries such as Australia, which runs successful needle exchange programmes, prompted the Ministry of Health to support the first such programme in Yunnan province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1999. In 2000–02, a larger intervention trial of needle exchange programmes was done in four counties of Guangdong province and Guangxi, funded by the World AIDS Foundation. Cross-sectional data gathered at follow-up indicated that participants in intervention communities were almost three times less likely to have shared <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> the past month than those in control communities (odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.25–0.52). Furthermore, rates of infection with hepatitis C virus were significantly lower in the intervention arm than in the control arm (51.1% vs 83.6%, p=0.001) and HIV rates were lower in the intervention arm; however, this was significant only in Guangdong (p=0.011) and not in Guangxi (p=0.2) nor overall (18.1% vs 23.6%, p=0.391).|$|E

He returned to London soon after, and was able to exhibit a telegraph with three <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> January 1837. Feeling his want of scientific knowledge, he consulted Michael Faraday and Peter Mark Roget (then secretary of the Royal Society), the latter of whom sent him to Wheatstone.|$|E

30|$|The {{bread and}} butter of {{screening}} tests {{is the ability to}} diagnose in binary terms the existence of a “disease” based on positive versus negative test results. Such an approach, common and grounded in psychometric measurements, is limited when searching for a <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> haystack.

25|$|Fraser {{recorded}} {{the development of}} a single white spruce tree from 1926 to 1961. Apical growth of the stem was slow from 1926 through 1936 when the tree was competing with herbs and shrubs and probably shaded by larger trees. Lateral branches began to show reduced growth and some were no longer in evidence on the 36-year-old tree. Apical growth totalling about 340 m, 370 m, 420 m, 450 m, 500 m, 600 m, and 600 m was made by the tree in the years 1955 through 1961, respectively. The total number of needles of all ages present on the 36-year-old tree in 1961 was 5.25 million weighing 14.25kg. In 1961, needles as old as 13 years remained on the tree.The ash weight of needles increased progressively with age from about 4% in first-year <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> 1961 to about 8% in needles 10 years old. In discussing the data obtained from the one 11 m tall white spruce, Fraser et al. (1964) speculated that if the photosynthate used in making apical growth in 1961 was manufactured the previous year, then the 4 million needles that were produced up to 1960 manufactured food for about 600,000mm of apical growth or 730 g dry weight, over 12 million mm3 of wood for the 1961 annual ring, plus 1 million new <b>needles,</b> <b>in</b> addition to new tissue in branches, bark, and roots in 1960. Added to this would be the photosynthate to produce energy to sustain respiration over this period, an mount estimated to be about 10% of the total annual photosynthate production of a young healthy tree. On this basis, one needle produced food for about 0.19mg dry weight of apical growth, 3mm3 wood, one-quarter of a new needle, plus an unknown amount of branch wood, bark and roots.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{mechanism}} of stimulation of acupuncture points employs {{penetration of the}} skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture). Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel, making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking. Needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination. Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications. Needles vary in length between , with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> areas with thicker tissues; needle diameters vary from 0 to 0, with thicker needles used on more robust patients. Thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion. The tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage, although blunt needles cause more pain.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} obvious {{differences}} is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two <b>needles.</b> <b>In</b> most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being Tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously. Dropped stitches, which can unravel a fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet. In knitting, each stitch {{is supported by the}} corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it. If a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.|$|E

25|$|James Horsfall was a {{wire drawer}} from Digbeth who invented {{high tensile steel}} wire. He moved to Hay Mill, a disused blade and sword factory at a water mill on the River Cole, {{rebuilding}} it as a steam-driven mill. The mill originally belonged to Hay Hall in Tyseley. In 1855 his company merged with Joseph Webster's of Penn Mill, Sutton Coldfield. He was a major manufacturer and exporter of the piano wire to Europe in 1824. In 1853 Horsfall had patented a heat treatment process which strengthened the wire. This led to improved piano wire (giving a near monopoly), wire for making <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> Redditch, fishhooks, and umbrella frames. The firm made the armoured wire for first successful transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866, using 30,000 miles of wire (1600 tons), made by 250 workers over 11 months. The strengthened wire also made possible the construction of aeroplanes and automobiles. The company today also makes springs.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{much of its}} history, certain {{attributes}} of the sport have garnered criticism.
