The genotypes identified as drought tolerant germplasm by the RPR method in both years were significantly correlated. In both 1988 and 1 989, RPR was directly related to maximum root length, root number, and root dry weight. Root dry weight (RWT) had the highest correlation with RPR in both 1988 (r= 0. 82 **) and 1989 (r= 0. 46 * *).

25|$|As {{development}} {{began on}} the nail, there were three major causes of failure to be overcome. These were having the nail — head and all — rip through the sheathing, having the entire <b>nail</b> <b>pull</b> out of the frame, and having the nail's midsection snap under stress. Early research showed that the larger the head, the less chance there was of the nail being ripped through the sheathing. However, the difficult task was increasing the nail's head while still making it compatible with popular nail gun models. After finding the ideal nail head size, the next task to conquer was preventing the entire <b>nail</b> from <b>pulling</b> out of the frame. This was overcome by adding barbed ring shanks around the lower portion of the nail. During the testing of the shanks, {{it was noted that}} above a certain point the shanks no longer strengthened the nail but instead weakened the nail by making it more susceptible to shearing. The final touch to the original prototype was a special high-carbon alloy designed by a metallurgist that had the perfect combination of stiffness and pliability, giving it the highest possible strength.|$|R

This study assessed trait relationships among 196 common bean genotypes exposed to stresses for drought and field infestation of bean fly or bean stem maggot (BSM). The study {{was carried out}} at two locations and data was analyzed with linear correlation, path coefficient and genotype×trait biplot analyses. Multiple trait data related to mechanisms of drought and bean fly tolerance were collected on 196 genotypes grown under i) water deficit at mid-pod fill, or ii) unprotected against bean fly; iii) irrigated, well watered conditions, or iv) bean fly protection with chemicals. Seed yield exhibited positive and significant correlations with leaf chlorophyll content, vertical root <b>pulling</b> <b>resistance,</b> pod harvest index, pods per plant and seeds per pod at both phenotypic and genotypic levels under stress and non-stress conditions. Genotypic correlations of traits with seed yield were greater than their respective phenotypic correlations across environments indicating the greater contribution of genotypic factors to the trait correlation. Pods per plant and seeds per pod had high positive direct effects on seed yield both under stress and non-stress whereas pods per plant had the highest indirect effect on seed yield through pod harvest index under stress. In general, our results suggest that vertical root <b>pulling</b> <b>resistance</b> and pod harvest index are important selection objectives for improving seed yield in common beans under non-stress and stress conditions, and particularly useful for drought and BSM tolerance evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Rice lodging {{is still}} a problem in many {{countries}}, as all rice-growing countries have some varieties that get lodged. Direct evaluation of lodging resistance requires visual estimates in plots, but is not feasible in early generations of breeding programs, where genetic variability is too high. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare two methods for indi-rect evaluation of lodging resistance, especially in field conditions: the recovery ability after bending (measured as the tiller angle difference before and after bending); and, to test the sturdiness of the lower part of the plant, we have measured its <b>resistance</b> to <b>pulling.</b> Sixteen rice varieties and two F 5 breeding lines were grown in plots and rows; 20 additional F 5 breeding lines were only tested in rows. Visual estimates of plot lodging were significantly correlated with their tiller angle difference (r = 0. 56 *), but not with plant height or <b>pulling</b> <b>resistance,</b> although the latter was also correlated with visual lodging when only susceptible accessions were considered (r = – 0. 72 *).

40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{difficult}} for plants to grow in mudstone area due to the fierce geologic and climatic condition. The relationship between plants and environment must be studied {{in order to improve}} the situation of continuing exposedness and advance the work of vegetation establishment. Usually, we can get the information about the plant living and adapting to fierce environment by investigating into its roots. The root distribution, <b>pulling</b> <b>resistance,</b> xylem pressure potential, and daily changes of physiology of Clerodendron inerme and Pluchea indica were collected to infer the adaptation of these plants to mudstone area’s environment and apply them as vegetation materials in mudstone area. After surveying and caculating the root distribution, we suggested that Clerodendron inerme and Pluchea indica belong to M-type and R-type with shallow roots. It would be helpful for Clerodendron inerme to grow and expand with lots underground and creeping stems. The roots of Pluchea indica are more and dense which will increase the absorption of water. From the results of root mechanical experiment, we got the regression equations of <b>pulling</b> <b>resistance</b> on maximum of basal diameter shown as (1),the regression equations of <b>pulling</b> <b>resistance</b> on stems weight shown as (2),and the regression equations of root tensile strength on root diameter are shown as (3). The maximum value of net photosynthesis of Clerodendron inerme appeared at pm 12 : 00,and that of Pluchea indica appeared at pm 1 : 00. The minimum value of xylem pressure potential of both plants appeared at pm 1 : 00. The transpiration rate was influenced and changed constantly by the daily environment changes. The area between the base of steep slopeland and the deposition zone are suitable for the tested plants to grow up. Finally, we can recognized that Pluchea indica and Clerodendron inerme are pioneer plants at the base of slopland.

The authors posit that only the resistance produced in plywood should be considered to clarify the influence of the grain direction of plywood. Some studies have conducted embedment tests on plywood specimens [18, 26, 27], and Kamada [28] showed the experimental data of the two grain directions (i.e., the grain direction of surface veneer was parallel or perpendicular to the load direction) using 3 -ply plywood made of larch. According to his data, the higher stiffness was observed when the grain direction of surface veneer was parallel to the loading direction, whereas almost same maximum load was observed in the two. In this study, an embedment test was conducted on plywood specimens with grain directions of surface veneers that are parallel and perpendicular to the load direction. Moreover, to understand the resisting mechanism of plywood precisely, the method for calculating the resistance–deformation relationship exhibited by individual parallel and perpendicular veneers was proposed.|$|R
