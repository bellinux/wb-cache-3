5000|$|Inorganic {{polymers}} are polymers with a skeletal {{structure that}} does not include carbon atoms in the backbone. Polymers containing inorganic and organic components are sometimes called hybrid polymers, and most so-called inorganic polymers are hybrid polymers. One of the best known examples is polydimethylsiloxane, otherwise known commonly as silicone rubber. Inorganic polymers offer some properties not found in organic materials including low temperature flexibility, electrical conductivity, and <b>nonflammability.</b> [...] Inorganic polymers focus on 1-dimensional polymers, not heavily crosslinked materials such as silicate minerals. Inorganic polymers with tunable or responsive properties are sometimes called smart inorganic polymers. A special class of inorganic polymers are geopolymers, which may be anthropogenic or naturally occurring.|$|E

Fluorocarbon-based greases are used in demanding applications. Representative products include Fomblin and Krytox, manufactured by Solvay Solexis and DuPont, respectively. Certain firearm lubricants such as [...] "Tetra Gun" [...] contain fluorocarbons. Capitalizing on their <b>nonflammability,</b> fluorocarbons are used in fire fighting foam. Organofluorine compounds are components of liquid crystal displays. The polymeric analogue of triflic acid, nafion is a solid acid that is used as the membrane in most low temperature fuel cells. The bifunctional monomer 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone is a precursor to PEEK-class polymers.|$|E
50|$|The inert {{nature of}} many halons, {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFC), and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), particularly CFC-11 and CFC-12, made them preferred choices among refrigerants {{for many years}} because of their <b>nonflammability</b> and nontoxicity. However, their stability in the atmosphere and their corresponding global warming potential and ozone depletion potential raised concerns about their usage. This led to their replacement with HFCs and PFCs, especially HFC-134a, which are not-ozone depleting, and have lesser global warming potentials. However, these refrigerants still have global warming potentials thousands of times greater than CO2. Therefore, they are now being replaced in markets where leaks are likely, by using a third generation of refrigerants, most prominently HFO-1234yf, which have global warming potentials much closer to that of CO2.|$|E
50|$|A {{prototype}} zinc-polyiodide {{flow battery}} {{has been demonstrated}} with an energy density of 167 Wh/l (watt-hours per liter). Older zinc-bromide cells reach 70 Wh/l. For comparison, lithium iron phosphate batteries store 233 Wh/l. The zinc-polyiodide battery is claimed to be safer than other flow batteries given its absence of acidic electrolytes, <b>nonflammability</b> and operating range of -4 to 122 F that does not require extensive cooling circuitry, which would add weight and occupy space. One unresolved issue is zinc build-up on the negative electrode that permeated the membrane, reducing efficiency. Because of the Zn dendrite formation, the Zn-halide batteries cannot operate at high current density (> 20 mA/cm2) and thus have limited power density. Adding alcohol to the electrolyte of the ZnI battery can slightly control the problem.|$|E
5000|$|Organofluorine {{chemistry}} {{began in}} the 1800s {{with the development of}} organic chemistry. [...] The first organofluorine compounds were prepared using antimony trifluoride as the F− source. The <b>nonflammability</b> and nontoxicity of the chlorofluorocarbons CCl3F and CCl2F2 attracted industrial attention in the 1920s. In the 1930s, scientists at duPont discovered polytetrafluoroethylene. [...] Subsequent major developments, especially in the US, benefited from expertise gained in the production of uranium hexafluoride. Starting in the late 1940s, a series of electrophilic fluorinating methodologies were introduced, beginning with CoF3. About this time, electrochemical fluorination ("electrofluorination") was announced, having been developed in the 1930s with the goal of generating highly stable perfluorinated materials compatible with uranium hexafluoride. [...] These new methodologies allowed the synthesis of C-F bonds without using elemental fluorine and without relying on metathetical methods. In 1957, the anticancer activity of 5-fluorouracil was described. This report provided one of the first examples of rational design of drugs. [...] This discovery sparked a surge of interest in fluorinated pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. The discovery of the noble gas compounds, e.g. XeF4, provided a host of new reagents starting in the early 1960s. In the 1970s, fluorodeoxyglucose was established as a useful reagent in 18F positron emission tomography. In Nobel Prize-winning work, CFC's were shown to contribute to the depletion of atmospheric ozone. This discovery alerted the world to the negative consequences of organofluorine compounds and motivated the development of new routes to organofluorine compounds. In 2002, the first C-F bond-forming enzyme, fluorinase, was reported.|$|E

40|$|Aerogel {{composites}} {{that are}} both nonflammable and hydrophobic {{have been developed for}} use as lightweight thermal- insulation materials for cryogenic systems. Aerogels are well known in the industry for their effectiveness as thermal insulators under cryogenic conditions, but the treatments used heretofore to render them hydrophobic also make them flammable. <b>Nonflammability</b> would make it safer to use aerogel insulation, especially in oxygen-rich environments and on cryogenic systems that contain liquid oxygen. A composite of this type is a silica aerogel reinforced with fibers. In comparison with unreinforced aerogels, the aerogel composite is about ten times as stiff and strong, better able to withstand handling, and more amenable to machining to required shapes. The composite can be made hydrophobic and nonflammable by appropriate design of a sol-gel process used to synthesize the aerogel component. In addition to very low thermal conductivity needed for insulation, aerogel composites of this type have been found to exhibit high resistance to moisture and <b>nonflammability</b> in oxygen-rich atmospheres: Samples floating on water for months gained no weight and showed no signs of deterioration.

40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) are a {{group of}} {{interesting}} compounds that have been known {{for more than a}} century, attracting major attention within the last two decades.

40|$|ABSTRACT: PIR foams {{are known}} for their {{outstanding}} fire properties and for their good insulation performances. The fire behavior {{can be attributed to the}} aromatic structure of the isocyanurate ring and to the <b>nonflammability</b> of the blowing agent that is used nowadays. For environmental reasons, HCFC- 141 b will have to be phased out as of 01. 01. 2003 for the production of PIR laminates boards, in Europe and in the United States. This evolution represents a challenge for the producers as they need to find a high performance alternative in a relatively short period of time. As a major requirement, this alternative will have to maintain the properties of the PIR foams, notably the fire behavior and the k-value at a high quality level. Several blowing agent alternatives have been presented, and some of them have already been implemented in production plants.

Silicon detector substrates must be continuously operated between 0 and − 7 °C {{in the high}} radiation environment near the circulating beams at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This requirement imposes unusual constraints on the cooling system and {{has led to the}} choice of perfluoro-n-propane (C 3 F 8) refrigerant, which combines good chemical stability under ionizing radiation with high dielectric strength and <b>nonflammability.</b> Since the silicon detectors must also be of extremely light construction to minimize undesirable physics background, coolant tubes are of thin (200 μm) aluminum wall, while evaporative operation allows a very low circulating coolant mass-flow (1 – 3 g · s− 1 / 100 W to evacuate). The assembled detector arrays will undergo qualification tests at room temperature before installation in the ATLAS spectrometer.

This strategy is based on integration of a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) matrix with a plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE, 1 M lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimide in succinonitrile). In comparison to conventional carbonate-based electrolytes, salient benefits of the PCE are the thermal stability and <b>nonflammability,</b> which show promising potential as a safer electrolyte. The semi-IPN matrix in the PCCE is composed of a UV (ultraviolet) -crosslinked ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate polymer network and polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (as a linear polymer). Solid electrolyte properties of the PCCE are investigated in terms of plastic crystal behavior, mechanical bendability, and ionic transport. Owing {{to the presence of}} the anomalous semi-IPN matrix, the PCCE exhibits unprecedented improvement in bendability, along with affording high ionic conductivity. Based on this understanding of the PCCE characteristics, feasibility of applying the PCCE to solid electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries is explored.

The interest in these surfactants stems from their potential as ‘green compounds ’ because of chemical and thermal stability, <b>nonflammability,</b> high ionic conductivity, and a wide electrochemical potential window, which makes them as good inhibitors. A significant decrease in the corrosion rate was observed in presence of the investigated inhibitor. The polarization curves showed that, the inhibitor behaves as mixed type but the cathodic effect is more pronounced. The surface tension at 298 K was measured; the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and some surface active parameters were calculated. The inhibition efficiency (η %) of this surfactant has been studied by both chemical and electrochemical techniques at 25 ◦C. It was shown that an excess of cationic and anionic surfactant resulted {{in the formation of}} nanostructures.

30|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts that {{typically}} consist of bulky, asymmetric organic cations, and inorganic symmetric anions. Room-temperature ILs {{are defined as}} salts with melting points below or equal to room temperature [4, 5]. ILs have attracted widespread interest in polymer science due to their versatile properties, such as negligible saturated vapor pressure, wide liquid-state temperature range, <b>nonflammability,</b> incombustibility, high electrical conductivity, and good stability to oxidation [6 – 10]. They have progressively been used as solvents and catalysts for polymerization reactions [10] as well as additives {{in the design of}} polymer materials [11]. Their peculiar structure enables easy separation, recovery, and recycling of the catalyst from the reaction mixtures. In the case of membrane processes, ILs are being used in the design and modification of advanced materials that enable performance levels not typical of conventional materials [12]. Another application of ILs consists of their use as effective and reusable porogens in vinylic networks [13]. When ILs are used as porogenic solvents, during the in situ formation of polymer networks, chemically induced phase separation occurs. To act as efficient porogens, ILs have to possess: (i) high boiling temperature to avoid any premature evaporation, (ii) high thermal stability to remain unchanged up to the complete curing of the polymer networks, and (iii) easy extractability to be readily removed from the cured networks, thus affording porous thermosetting materials.|$|E

The ILs are environmentally friendly solvents with unique physicochemical properties, such as negligible vapor pressure, high chemical and thermal stabilities, <b>nonflammability,</b> and recyclability. These properties together with high affinity for sulfur-containing compounds, especially aromatic sulfur components, and immiscibility with fuels make ILs desirable extractants for desulfurization of liquid fuels (Wang et al. 2007; Kedra-Krolik et al. 2011). However, although ILs are highly effective for the extraction of some aromatic sulfur components, that is, they can lower the concentrations to desirable low levels (especially thiophenic compounds), they do not provide adequate efficiency for decreasing the total sulfur concentration to acceptable levels for many gasoline samples. Activated Raney nickel adsorbent combined with IL extraction is regarded as a promising strategy to achieve very low sulfur levels and is currently receiving increasing attention because it avoids the use of hydrogen and allows the process to be conducted at ambient conditions. This process is also appealing because the sulfur contaminants that are most resistant to HDS, such as thiophenic compounds, are the most reactive components under ambient conditions.|$|E

Initially, ionic liquids were used as self-templating carbon sources for the generation of unusual carbon materials in which homogeneous heteroatom doping (e. g., N, B, S) can be accomplished fairly easily. Later, ionic liquids were recognized as suitable for use in the conversion of biomass into porous carbon materials, acting as both reaction media and porosity-directing regulator. Such applications open the door towards the synthesis and accurate tuning of carbon nanostructures, for example, pore structure, morphology, heteroatom doping, and surface functionality. In addition, the hybridization of ionic liquids and nanocarbons enables the development of composites by combining the properties of the ionic liquid (e. g., ionic conductivity or catalytic activity) and those of a host (e. g., chemical or mechanical stability). Currently, although the research of this topic is rapidly expanding, the rational design and synthesis of carbon-based materials, particularly their applications in energy storage and transformation, is still in its infancy. In this review, we focus on several aspects of ionic liquid derived carbons with the aim of shedding light on this new topic: 1) Ionic liquids as an advanced medium for carbon synthesis, 2) ionogels derived from nanocarbon, 3) ionic liquids as fluid precursors for functional carbons, and 4) ionic liquid derived carbons for heterogeneous catalysis...|$|E
40|$|Bismaleimide (BMI) resins are an {{attractive}} new addition to world-wide composite applications. This type of thermosetting polyimide provides several unique {{characteristics such as}} excellent physical property retention at elevated temperatures and in wet environments, constant electrical properties over {{a vast array of}} temperature settings, and <b>nonflammability</b> properties as well. This makes BMI a popular choice in advance composites and electronics applications [I]. Bismaleimide- 2 (BMI- 2) resin was used to infuse intermediate modulus 7 (IM 7) based carbon fiber. Two panel configurations consisting of 4 plies with [+ 45 deg, 90 deg] 2 and [0 deg] 4 orientations were fabricated. For tensile testing, a [90 deg] 4 configuration was tested by rotating the [0 deg] 4 configirration to lie orthogonal with the load direction of the test fixture. Curing of the BMI- 2 /IM 7 system utilized an optimal infusion process which focused on the integration of the manufacturer-recommended ramp rates,. hold times, and cure temperatures. Completion of the cure cycle for the BMI- 2 /IM 7 composite yielded a product with multiple surface voids determined through visual and metallographic observation. Although the curing cycle was the same for the three panellayups, the surface voids that remained within the material post-cure were different in abundance, shape, and size. For tensile testing, the [0 deg] 4 layup had a 19. 9 % and 21. 7 % greater average tensile strain performance compared to the [90 deg] 4 and [+ 45 deg, 90 deg, 90 deg,- 45 degg] layups, respectively, at failure. For tensile stress performance, the [0 deg] 4 layup had a 5. 8 % and 34. 0 % greater average performance% than the [90 deg] 4 and [+ 45 deg, 90 deg, 90 deg,- 45 deg] layups...|$|E
40|$|Poster presentado en: New Materials for a Better life! 2017 Workshop, 27 / 10 / 2017, Facultad de Ciencia y Tecnología, Universidad del País VascoThe {{development}} of polymer membranes with tailored micro-morphology and wettability are a {{demand in the}} areas of filtration, sensors or tissue engineering, among others. Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) is a thermoplastic copolymer {{and one of the most}} interesting polymers to be used in these areas due to its good mechanical and thermal properties, biocompatibility and low density. The control of the morphology on this material is crucial for its performance. However, for the moment this is a complicated task and is mostly restricted to the use of solvent evaporation (SE) and non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) techniques. In this way, this work consists in a systematic study of the use of ionic liquids in the control of these membranes properties. Ionic liquids are molten salts with melting points lower than 100 °C, which stand out for their good properties, such as high good thermal stability, low vapor pressure, <b>nonflammability</b> and their ability to act as solvents of various materials and they have already been studied for the control of morphology in certain materials. In this work, the production and the characterization of PVDF-HFP@ionic liquid composite membranes using different ionic liquids (Diethylmethylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate, 1 -Methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide and 1 -Methylimidazolium chloride) and methodologies (solvent evaporation temperature) are described in detail. The results demonstrate how aspects such as morphology, wettability or mechanical properties change depending on the production methodology employed and on the type of used ionic liquid. In view of the results, it is concluded that the morphology of a polymer composite can be tuned by use ILs and this control of the morphology could open up new possibilities for their use in different applications. “Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad” (MAT 2016 - 76739 -R(AEI/FEDER, UE)). “Gobierno Vasco” (KK- 2016 / 00095 -LISOL, program Elkartek) ...|$|E
