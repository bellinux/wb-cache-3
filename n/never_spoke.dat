5|$|For unknown reasons, Tréhot stopped {{modeling}} for Renoir after 1872; it {{was said}} that she <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> to or saw him again. Although Tréhot was an important part of Renoir's early career, he never mentioned her in any published interviews, memoirs, or biographies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Kertész {{secretly}} married a French portrait photographer {{by the name}} of Rosza Klein (she used the name Rogi André). The marriage was short-lived and he <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> about it.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> {{more than}} cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} {{such a thing}} would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.|$|E
50|$|As of June 2017, Bíró <b>never</b> once <b>spoke</b> at a {{plenary session}} of the parliament.|$|R
50|$|Barkley {{suddenly}} and inexplicably left the duo in May 1986, and {{within two weeks}} was named the morning radio personality at KJOI. He <b>never</b> again <b>spoke</b> with Lohman.|$|R
50|$|From 1787-96 {{and again}} from 1802-18, FitzRoy was member of Parliament for Bury St Edmunds (though <b>never</b> {{actually}} <b>spoke</b> in the house). He supported Pitt and favoured abolitionism and Catholic Emancipation.|$|R
5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> about others' orientation.|$|E
5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> of the incident, {{and refused to}} discuss {{whether or not it}} was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E
5|$|Del Valle {{was born}} in Jalisco, Mexico. His father, Antonio del Valle, was {{a soldier in the}} Spanish army who came to California in 1819 and was mayordomo (administrator and/or foreman) of Mission San Fernando Rey de España. Ygnacio joined the army as a cadet in 1825 at the Presidio of Santa Barbara. In 1828 he was {{promoted}} to second lieutenant and transferred to the Presidio of San Diego. In 1832, his commander became involved in a power struggle with the commandant of the Presidio of Monterey, where Antonio served. Ygnacio's side won the conflict on the battlefield, causing a rift between father and son, and they <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> again.|$|E
5000|$|Authorities viewed this as {{a suicide}} note signed by Bern. To the police, and before a grand jury, Harlow's only {{statement}} was that she [...] "knew nothing". Harlow <b>never</b> publicly <b>spoke</b> on the matter. She died in 1937.|$|R
60|$|But Hereward it was; and {{regardless}} of all beholders, she lay upon his neck, and <b>never</b> stirred nor <b>spoke.</b>|$|R
60|$|The door of {{the office}} was partly open. Her father was still there. Asleep? Yes, for he had {{apparently}} sunk forward before the cold hearth. But the hands that {{he had always been}} trying to warm were colder than the hearth or ashes, and he himself <b>never</b> again <b>spoke</b> nor stirred.|$|R
5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones {{for the first}} time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which was well {{received}} critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them and the two <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> again.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when {{she arrived at the}} arena that day, she was surprised to find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took a cab to the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> to Moolah again.|$|E
5|$|She married Russell Brand on October 23, 2010, in a {{traditional}} Hindu ceremony near the Ranthambhore tiger sanctuary in Rajasthan. Brand announced on December 30, 2011, that they were divorcing after 14 months of marriage. Perry later stated that conflicting career schedules and his desire to have children before she was ready led {{to the end of}} their marriage, and that he <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> to her again after sending a text message that he was divorcing her while Brand asserted that he divorced her due to her commercial success and reluctance to engage in activism. She was initially distraught over their divorce, and said that she contemplated suicide. After the marriage ended in 2012, Perry began a relationship with singer John Mayer that August.|$|E
60|$|But {{of wolves}} {{other than the}} timber-wolf, and fiercer still into whose hands the Duke might fall in America, he <b>spoke</b> <b>never</b> a word.|$|R
60|$|It {{was half}} an hour or more before she came down, and at once we left the house, letting {{ourselves}} out. All the way home my mother <b>never</b> once <b>spoke,</b> but walked as one in a dream with eyes that saw not. With her hand upon the lock of our gate she came back to life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait for rain," [...] {{concluded}} Yaqui, {{and now as}} <b>never</b> {{before he}} <b>spoke</b> as one with authority. [...] "If no rain--" [...] Silently he lifted his hand.|$|R
5|$|Some {{historians are}} {{convinced}} that by 1964 Mikoyan believed that Khrushchev {{had turned into a}} liability to the Party, and that he was involved in the October 1964 coup that brought Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin to power. However, William Taubman disputes this, as Mikoyan was {{the only member of the}} Presidium (the name for the Politburo at this time) to defend Khrushchev. Mikoyan, however, did vote to force Khrushchev's retirement (so as, in traditional Soviet style, to make the vote unanimous). Alone among Khrushchev's colleagues, Mikoyan wished the former leader well in his retirement, though he <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> to him again. Mikoyan laid a wreath and sent a letter of condolence at Khrushchev's funeral in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The Member {{became a}} close {{associate}} and political {{friend of the}} Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. After Pitt's death in 1806, Ferguson did not so easily retain his seat in Parliament. In the elections of 1806, he retained the seat by just two votes, and his opponent General Alexander Hay demanded he be investigated for bribery and corruption. Ferguson again beat Hay in the contest for the seat in June 1807, but {{this time with a}} more convincing majority of 54 to 39 votes. Ferguson was unopposed in the next three elections. Some records indicate that Ferguson <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> in the Commons except to complain about a broken window behind his seat causing a draught. He is actually recorded as speaking on at least five occasions over the years.|$|E
5|$|Washington was not {{a member}} of any {{political}} party and hoped {{that they would not be}} formed, fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism. His closest advisors formed two factions, setting the framework for the future First Party System. Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit and to build a financially powerful nation, and he formed the basis of the Federalist Party. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was the founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans, and he strenuously opposed Hamilton's agenda. Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson, and it was Hamilton's agenda that went into effect. Jefferson's political actions, his support of Philip Freneau's National Gazette, and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led George Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet, though he ultimately left the cabinet voluntarily. Washington never forgave him and <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> to him again.|$|E
60|$|She stood irresolute for a while, {{listening}} to the beating of her own heart, and then her eye caught his once more, timidly, but she <b>spoke</b> <b>never</b> a syllable.|$|R
6000|$|She made us {{one of her}} grand curtsies smiling, {{and called}} us [...] "the young people." [...] She was older, paler, and more majestic than in the year before; her mother seemed the {{youngest}} of the two. She <b>never</b> once <b>spoke</b> of her grief, Lady Castlewood told Esmond, or alluded, save by a quiet word or two, to the death of her hopes.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} we <b>spoke</b> <b>never</b> a word, but walked on together, slowly and sorrowfully, {{reluctant}} to turn about towards our parting. When at last we did, she broke silence again.|$|R
5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> of this with his comrades again.|$|E
5|$|Further {{social changes}} {{brought about by}} the {{presence}} of American military personnel were exemplified in the storm's wake. The use of currency as a means for obtaining goods was first seen in Ulithi in 1956, four years before the typhoon. However, despite the total destruction of markets by Ophelia they were quickly rebuilt, depicting the quick entrenchment of currency in native culture. The reconstruction also accelerated a desire for new goods from trading. Store owners requested a wider range of material to have in stock than seen previously. From a societal standpoint, Ophelia prompted great advances in the Ulithian culture. Women, previously limited to agriculture, housework, and eventually shopping, were found to be doing heavy work (i.e. carpentry, chopping, digging, and lifting) in the immediate wake of the typhoon. A shift in government took place as well, with authority of King Malefich waning to greater power among younger individuals. Malefich also displayed great ineptitude during the storm and was subsequently disposed of as King following Ophelia's passage. The changes in authority occurred due to spontaneous leadership during the storm by the younger persons in order to protect others. Prior to the typhoon, younger members of tribes <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> during council meetings; however, by 1961 they made their presence known in such meetings.|$|E
25|$|Connolly Sr {{returned}} from the war, a stranger to his children, shortly after the move to Partick. He <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> to them about their mother's departure.|$|E
25|$|Her brother {{says the}} report of him {{catching}} her with his girlfriend is completely fabricated and that he <b>never</b> even <b>spoke</b> with the detective who wrote it. Similarly, Lieberman says the couple never fought at the courthouse after her arraignment. The police, they believe, were extrapolating from what little they could find {{in an effort to}} make up for their early inattention to the case.|$|R
500|$|Carice van Houten as Nina Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg: von Stauffenberg's wife. The filmmakers were {{impressed}} by her performance in Black Book, and argued she could give a strong performance with minimal dialogue. Screenwriter Nathan Alexander spoke to von Stauffenberg's relatives and noted that, although Nina and Claus <b>never</b> directly <b>spoke</b> about the plot, [...] "in a sense it was all they talked about".|$|R

25|$|We can {{construct}} {{a story of}} backdoor illicit liaisons and front door respectability from these fragments and others— Rydberg would hardly be the first, if it were true— but he <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> openly about his private life at any time, and our best guess would still be guesswork.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, he was repackaged as The Sultan, a masked wrestler who <b>never</b> <b>spoke,</b> ostensibly {{because his}} tongue was cut out. He was managed by The Iron Sheik and Bob Backlund. He unsuccessfully {{challenged}} Rocky Maivia for the WWF Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania 13. The Sultan vanished in 1998, when Fatu left to train at Dory Funk's Funking Conservatory wrestling school.|$|E

50|$|That morning, he had mailed two suicide notes, one to Dorothy (who at a coroner's inquest {{testified that}} he had given his reasons) and one to his friend and boss, Playboy editor-publisher Hugh Hefner.

Dorothy <b>never</b> again <b>spoke</b> with her late husband's family nor with Hefner, and remarried approximately a year later.|$|R
