5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20thcentury, the {{difficulty}} of navigating the Columbia was seen as an impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades. The dredging and dam building that followed would permanently alter the river, disrupting its natural flow but also providing electricity, irrigation, <b>navigability</b> and other benefits to the region.|$|E
5|$|After {{escaping}} the Machias men, the Margaretta {{was forced to}} jibe into brisk winds, {{which resulted in the}} main boom and gaff breaking away, crippling its <b>navigability.</b> Once Moore was in Holmes Bay he captured a sloop and took its spar and gaff to replace the Margaretta's. Moore also took its pilot, Robert Avery, captive. The Unity crew of about 30 Machias men elected Jeremiah O'Brien as their captain and sailed out to chase down the Margaretta. Since the Unity was a much faster sailing vessel, O'Brien's crew quickly caught up to the crippled Margaretta, while the Falmouth Packet lagged behind.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the BWB decided after {{a meeting}} with local councils that the Forth and Clyde Canal, {{fragmented}} by various developments, was to have its remaining <b>navigability</b> preserved by building new bridges with sufficient headroom for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks. Restoration of sea-to-sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time, but {{there were to be}} no further restrictions on its use. A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation, and sought the opinions of twenty interested parties to present the Forth and Clyde Local (Subject) Plan in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Ski orienteering {{is a form}} of {{cross-country}} skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard orienteering maps are used, but with special green overprinting of trails and tracks to indicate their <b>navigability</b> in snow; other symbols indicate whether any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four orienteering disciplines recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.|$|E
5|$|In 1831 the Ardrossan Railway opened; it too was a horse-operated line using stone block sleepers, but {{passenger}} {{operation was}} {{a major part of}} its objective. It was conceived as a means of developing Ardrossan Harbour as the sea port for Glasgow. However the promoters were unable to raise sufficient money to build the whole of their line; moreover recent improvements to the <b>navigability</b> of the River Clyde enabled sea-going ships to reach the City. Accordingly, the line was truncated, and only reached a terminal at Kilwinning and collieries east of that town. Nonetheless it was a considerable commercial success, carrying passengers and in enabling coal, particularly from the pits belonging to the Earl of Eglinton to be exported at Ardrossan, and it further emphasised the viability of railways.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 1795, White was {{appointed}} by United States President George Washington to serve {{as one of the}} three commissioners responsible for supervising the raising of funds, planning, design, and acquisition of property and the erection of public buildings in the city of Washington and the federal district. White had been selected to replace Daniel Carroll on the board following Carroll's resignation. While on the board, White was paid a salary of $1,600 per year for his services; White continued to serve on the board until May 1, 1802, when it was abolished. He concurrently served as one of the directors of the Potomac Company, which made improvements to the Potomac River and improved its <b>navigability</b> for commerce.|$|E
5|$|Pope {{was born}} in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Nathaniel Pope, a {{prominent}} Federal judge in early Illinois Territory {{and a friend of}} lawyer Abraham Lincoln. He was the brother-in-law of Manning Force, and a distant cousin married the sister of Mary Todd Lincoln. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. He served in Florida and then helped survey the northeastern border between the United States and Canada. He fought under Zachary Taylor in the Battle of Monterrey and Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican-American War, for which he was appointed a brevet first lieutenant and captain, respectively. After the war Pope worked as a surveyor in Minnesota. In 1850 he demonstrated the <b>navigability</b> of the Red River. He served as the chief engineer of the Department of New Mexico from 1851 to 1853 and spent the remainder of the antebellum years surveying a route for the Pacific Railroad.|$|E
25|$|In October, 1910, the Morning Oregonian, once {{a proponent}} of the project, criticized the lock and dam for not having brought <b>navigability</b> to the Yamhill river.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{claim that}} the Three Sisters {{represent}} the farthest navigable point on the Potomac River, although other sources claim that <b>navigability</b> extends farther north to Little Falls Branch.|$|E
25|$|Congress had {{recently}} appropriated $34,000 for improvements to navigation on the Cowlitz and Lewis rivers, {{but there was}} not much hope that dredging would make any different before a natural rise in stream flow restored <b>navigability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The atoll {{has several}} {{passages}} {{with varying degrees}} of <b>navigability</b> that lead into the lagoon. The passes are listed clockwise, starting south of Fongafale islet. The first two clearly separate the southern part of Funafuti Atoll from the rest.|$|E
25|$|<b>Navigability</b> of {{the river}} Neris is very limited and no regular water routes exist, {{although}} it was used for navigation in the past. The river rises in Belarus, connecting Vilnius and Kernavė, and becomes a tributary of Nemunas river in Kaunas.|$|E
25|$|By 1914, {{neglect and}} lack of use due to {{diversion}} of freight traffic to railroad lines resulted in the Red River becoming unnavigable. In 1994, the United States Army Corps of Engineers restored <b>navigability</b> by completion {{of a series of}} lock-and-dam structures and a navigation channel. Today, Shreveport-Bossier City is being re-developed as a port and shipping center.|$|E
25|$|The Chera kingdom owed its {{importance}} {{to trade with}} West Asia, Greece and Rome. Its geographical advantages, like the abundance of exotic spices, the <b>navigability</b> of the rivers connecting the Ghat mountains with the Arabian sea, and the discovery of favourable Monsoon winds which carried sailing ships directly from the Arabian coast to Chera kingdom, combined to produce a veritable boom in the Chera foreign trade.|$|E
25|$|The Chera kingdom owed its {{importance}} {{to trade with}} the Middle East, North Africa, Greece, Rome and China. Its geographical advantages, like the <b>navigability</b> of the rivers connecting the Ghat mountains with the Arabian sea, the favourable Monsoon winds which carried sailing ships directly from the Arabian coast to Chera kingdom {{as well as the}} abundance of exotic spices combined to make the Chera empire a major power in foreign trade.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, New Deal {{programs}} greatly improved {{the educational system}} {{in the state and}} led to the construction and improvement of a great deal of infrastructure. The creation of roads, construction of telephone lines, and rural electrification were significant developments for the state. The creation of the Kentucky Dam and its hydroelectric power plant greatly improved the lives of Western Kentuckians. Both the Cumberland River and the Mississippi River saw extensive improvements in <b>navigability</b> and flood control.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of its belief that it was an {{extension}} of Hokkaido, both geographically and culturally, Japan again proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island (as well as the Kuril Islands chain) in 1845, in the face of competing claims from Russia. In 1849, however, the Russian navigator Gennady Nevelskoy recorded the existence and <b>navigability</b> of the strait later given his name, and — in defiance of the Qing and Japanese claims — Russian settlers began establishing coal mines, administration facilities, schools, and churches on the island.|$|E
25|$|In recent times, Inland Waterways Authority of India has {{declared}} {{the stretch of}} river Ganges between Allahabad and Haldia National Inland Waterway and has taken steps to restore and maintain its <b>navigability.</b> The National Waterway-1, the longest Waterway in India, stretches 1620km in the River Ganga from Allahabad to Haldia via Varanasi, Munger, Bhagalpur passes through Patna. This National Waterways has fixed terminal at Patna. In September 2014, a luxury cruise called ‘MV Rajmahal’ from Patna to Varanasi was launched by the state-based Assam Bengal Navigation Company (ABN).|$|E
25|$|After the American Revolutionary War, George Washington was {{the chief}} {{advocate}} of using waterways to connect the Eastern Seaboard to the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. In 1785, Washington founded the Potowmack Company to improve the <b>navigability</b> of the Potomac River. His company built five skirting canals around the major falls: Little Falls (later incorporated in the C Canal), Great Falls in Virginia, Seneca Falls (opposite Violette's lock), Payne's Falls of the Shenendoah, and House's Falls near Harpers Ferry. These canals allowed an easy downstream float; upstream journeys, propelled by pole, were harder.|$|E
25|$|The Mekong {{expedition}} of 1866–1868, {{conceived and}} promoted {{by a group}} of French colonial officers and launched under the leadership of captain Ernest Doudard de Lagrée, was a naval exploration and scientific expedition of the Mekong River on behalf of the French colonial authorities of Cochinchina. Its primary objective, besides scientific documentation, mapping, and the mission civilatrice, was an assessment of the river's <b>navigability</b> in order to link the delta region and the port of Saigon with the riches of southern China and upper Siam (modern day Thailand). Ambitions were to turn Saigon into a successful commercial center such as British controlled Shanghai {{at the mouth of the}} Yangtze River.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Roman {{victories}} at sea, the Roman Republic lost countless {{ships and}} crews during the war, due to both storms and battles. On {{at least two}} occasions (255 and 253 BC) whole fleets were destroyed in bad weather; the disaster off Camarina in 255 BC counted two hundred seventy ships and over one hundred thousand men lost, the greatest single loss in history. One {{theory is that the}} weight of the corvus on the prows of the ships made the ships unstable and caused them to sink in bad weather. Later, as Roman experience in naval warfare grew, the corvus device was made attachable and detachable due to its impact on the <b>navigability</b> of the war vessels.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{news of the}} {{discovery}} of gold in Coloma, California on January 24, 1848, Burnett and his family moved south to participate in the rush. After modest success in getting gold, Burnett envisioned a career in law in San Francisco, a rapidly growing boomtown thanks largely to the Gold Rush. On the way to the Bay Area, Burnett met John Augustus Sutter, Jr., son of German-born Swiss pioneer John Sutter. Selling his father's deeded lands in the near vicinity of Sutter's Fort, the younger Sutter offered Burnett a job in selling land plots for the new town of Sacramento. Over the next year, Burnett made nearly US$50,000 in land sales in Sacramento, a city ideally suited due to its closeness to the Sierra Nevada and the neighboring Sacramento River's <b>navigability</b> for large ships.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{concerns}} regarding the detrimental effects of warming in the Arctic, some potential opportunities have gained attention. The melting {{of the ice}} is making the Northwest Passage, the shipping routes through the northernmost latitudes, more navigable, raising {{the possibility that the}} Arctic region will become a prime trade route. One harbinger of the opening <b>navigability</b> of the Arctic took place in the summer of 2016 when the Crystal Serenity successfully navigated the Northwest Passage, a first for a large cruise ship. In addition, it is believed that the Arctic seabed may contain substantial oil fields which may become accessible if the ice covering them melts. These factors have led to recent international debates as to which nations can claim sovereignty or ownership over the waters of the Arctic.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} results {{which were}} {{expected from the}} exploration of the Mekong may be summed up in a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the <b>navigability</b> of the river tried, it being our hope that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the Meïnam and the Mekong? To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was {{the first part of the}} programme the commission had to carry out.|$|E
25|$|Part of European {{trade was}} by sea along the Atlantic coast. The English, then the Dutch and Scandinavians from their demand for wine, created a craze for {{planting}} between Bordeaux and La Rochelle. Little {{dry white wine}} was produced for export from La Rochelle while Bordeaux exported mainly wines from the hinterland received via the Garonne. When wine production was introduced {{on the banks of}} the Charente in the 17th century, Charente white wines were introduced as cognac. At the same time, the dry white wine popular with the Dutch was produced to the north, around the port of Nantes from the current areas of Muscadet AOC and Gros-plant AOVDQS in the Loire Valley. Vineyards in the Loire Valley and the South-west had their sales network thanks to the <b>navigability</b> of the Loire and the Garonne.|$|E
25|$|River {{trade was}} of great {{importance}} {{in the development of}} vineyards. The Germanic countries benefited from the <b>navigability</b> of the Rhine and the Danube so they could export their production. Charlemagne contributed to this growth by enacting his Capitulare de villis which included a set of rules on the cultivation of the vine in all areas. It was an era of great development of the culture of white wine in Germany and Austria. The Central European vineyards reached 100,000 hectares which was three and a half times the area in the 1990s. From the 13th century traders distinguished vinum hunicum (wine of the Huns), which was drunk by the people, from vinum francium (Wine of the Franks) which was the wine for the wealthy aristocracy. There was recognition of varieties of Riesling and Sylvaner from the late Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|In 1700 {{the port}} of Nantes {{numbered}} more inland waterway craft than any other port in France, testifying to the historic importance of navigation on France’s longest river. Shallow-draught gabares and other river craft continued to transport goods into the industrial era, including coal from Saint-Étienne loaded on to barges in Orléans. However, the hazardous free-flow navigation and limited tonnages meant that railways rapidly killed off the surviving traffic from the 1850s. In 1894 a company {{was set up to}} promote improvements to the navigation from Nantes to Briare. The works were authorised in 1904 and carried out in two phases from Angers to the limit of tides at Oudon. These works, with groynes and submersible embankments, survive and contribute to the limited <b>navigability</b> under present-day conditions. A dam across the Loire at Saint-Léger-des-Vignes provides navigable conditions to cross from the Canal du Nivernais to the Canal latéral à la Loire.|$|E
25|$|In June 1824, {{following}} {{the merger of}} the North West Company and the HBC, McMillan accompanied HBC Governor George Simpson from York Factory far west to the lower Columbia River, arriving at Fort George on November 8 of that year. Simpson described McMillan as a “Staunch & Manly Friend and Fellow Traveller”. Ten days later, Simpson assigned McMillan with commanding an expedition to survey {{the mouth of the}} Fraser River and assess it for <b>navigability,</b> settlement potential and agricultural suitability. He led an exploration party of 40 men from Fort George to Puget Sound and on to Mud Bay, just east of present-day Point Roberts. On local advice of a shortcut, McMillan's party proceeded east up the Nicomekl River through what is now South Surrey, British Columbia where they then portaged to the Fraser River. The expedition traveled and surveyed up the Fraser River as far as Hatzic Slough, before returning to Fort George.|$|E
25|$|To {{save the}} British {{from what he}} thought was a {{disastrous}} action and to stop the war from a possible escalation, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester B. Pearson proposed the creation of the first United Nations peacekeeping force to ensure access to the canal for all and an Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. On 4 November 1956, a majority at the United Nations voted for Pearson's peacekeeping resolution, which mandated the UN peacekeepers to stay in Sinai unless both Egypt and Israel agreed to their withdrawal. The United States backed this proposal by putting pressure on the British government through the selling of sterling, which would cause it to depreciate. Britain then called a ceasefire, and later agreed to withdraw its troops by the end of the year. Pearson was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. As a result of damage and ships sunk under orders from Nasser the canal was closed until April 1957, when it was cleared with UN assistance. A UN force (UNEF) was established to maintain the free <b>navigability</b> of the canal, and peace in the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E
500|$|In early 1859, Raynolds {{was charged}} with leading an {{expedition}} into the Yellowstone region of Montana and Wyoming to determine, [...] "as far as practicable, everything relating to... the Indians of the country, its agricultural and mineralogical resources... the <b>navigability</b> of its streams, its topographical features, and the facilities or obstacles which the latter present {{to the construction of}} rail or common roads...". The expedition was carried out by a handful of technicians, including photographer and topographer James D. Hutton, artist and mapmaker Anton Schönborn, and geologist and naturalist Ferdinand V. Hayden, who led several later expeditions to the Yellowstone region. Raynolds's second-in-command was lieutenant [...] Henry E. Maynadier. The expedition was supported by a small infantry detachment of 30 and was federally funded with $60,000. Experienced mountain man Jim Bridger was hired to guide the expedition.|$|E
500|$|In 1850, Seacole's {{half-brother}} Edward [...] {{moved to}} Cruces, Panama, {{which was then}} part of New Granada. There, approximately [...] up the Chagres River from the coast, he followed the family trade by establishing the Independent Hotel to accommodate the many travellers between the eastern and western coasts of the United States (the number of travellers had increased enormously, {{as part of the}} 1849 California Gold Rush). Cruces was the limit of <b>navigability</b> of the Chagres River during the rainy season, which lasts from June to December. Travellers would ride on donkeys approximately [...] along the Las Cruces trail from Panama City on the Pacific Ocean coast to Cruces, and then [...] down-river to the Atlantic Ocean at Chagres (or vice versa). In the dry season, the river subsided, and travellers would switch from land to the river a few miles farther downstream, at Gorgona Most of these settlements have now been submerged by Gatun Lake, formed as part of the Panama Canal.|$|E
2500|$|Myrtle was a {{steamboat}} {{built in}} 1909 for {{service on the}} Coquille River and its tributaries, in Oregon. [...] The ability of this small vessel to reach remote locations on the river system was cited many years later as {{evidence in support of}} the important legal concept of <b>navigability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Army Corps of Engineers has {{maintained}} a system of locks and dams along the Black Warrior River {{for over a century}} to allow <b>navigability</b> {{all the way up to}} Birmingham. Barge traffic thus routinely runs through Tuscaloosa to the Alabama State Docks at Mobile, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. [...] Via the Tenn-Tom Waterway, the city is connected to the Ohio River valley and beyond.|$|E
2500|$|The nearby Rogue River is {{monitored}} for flooding at the Gold Ray Dam, a decommissioned hydroelectric dam built in 1906 near Gold Hill. [...] The National Weather Service identifies [...] as the flood level. [...] At this depth, <b>navigability</b> between the Pacific Ocean and the Rogue Valley is limited. Even a small [...] "handysize" [...] freighter {{is unable to}} make the trip, and any ship hauling cargo to Medford {{would have to have}} a much smaller draw. [...] Therefore, Medford does not have a nearby maritime port.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact that}} climate and water <b>navigability</b> have on {{economic}} growth and GDP per capita was studied by notable scholars including Paul Krugman, Jared Diamond, and Jeffrey Sachs. By using variables to measure environmental determinism, such as climate, land composition, latitude, {{and the presence of}} infectious disease, they account for trends in worldwide economic development on local, regional and global scales. To do so, they measure economic growth with GDP per capita adjusted to purchasing power parity (PPP), while also taking into consideration population density and labor productivity [...]|$|E
2500|$|On February 14, 1862, the Iowans {{arrived at}} Fort Donelson. [...] There, the 2nd Iowa would become legendary {{in one of}} the most crucial battles of the war. [...] Strategically, the capture of Fort Donelson meant <b>navigability</b> for steamers along the Cumberland River, a direct path to the rear of Confederate forces in Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as a hold on {{valuable}} supply and communications lines. [...] After the defeat at Fort Donelson, confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston wrote, “The blow was disastrous and almost without remedy.” ...|$|E
