50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} with two swing spans. One was {{located on the}} American side of the main channel {{of the river and}} provided a <b>navigable</b> <b>opening</b> of 160 ft width. The second was located over Black Rock Harbor and provided a <b>navigable</b> <b>opening</b> of 90 ft width. Both were operated by steam and could open or close in approximately fifty seconds. The portion of the bridge from Unity Island to the US Mainland was constructed for two tracks. The longer portion from Unity Island to Canada was built as only a single track. Both sections had a common sidewalk on one side.|$|E
50|$|Wroxham Broad {{is an area}} of {{open water}} {{alongside}} the River Bure near the village of Wroxham in Norfolk, England within The Broads National Park. The Norfolk Broads were formed by the flooding of ancient peat workings. Wroxham Broad has an area of 34.4 hectares (85 acres) and a mean depth of 1.3 metres. It lies {{to the west of the}} Bure, with two <b>navigable</b> <b>openings</b> between river and broad. The village and broad lie in an area of fairly intensive agriculture, with areas of wet woodland adjoining the broad and river.|$|R
50|$|Wroxham Broad {{lies about}} one mile {{downstream}} from Wroxham Bridge. The broad has {{an area of}} 34.4 hectares and a mean depth of 1.3 metres. It lies {{to the west of}} the Bure, with two <b>navigable</b> <b>openings</b> between river and broad. The broad is popular for sailing and is the home of the Norfolk Broads Yacht Club. It is also an important habitat for broadland flora and fauna. Between 2000 and 2005 the island between the two channels linking Wroxham Broad to the Bure underwent restoration to stop erosion and improve the island's ecology, which had become degraded. The project was a joint initiative involving the Broads Authority, Norfolk Broads Yacht Club and the local landowner, Trafford Estates. Scrub was cleared and a stretch of piling installed, allowing sedge, reed and rush to grow back. By 2005 it was reported that more birds, including kingfishers, were nesting on the island and the rare Cetti's warbler was often spotted. Greater numbers of ducks including pochard and tufted ducks now wintered nearby and there was a greater profusion of wild flowers and marsh flora including orchids. During the course of the work, in 2004, volunteers came across an unexploded Second World War hand grenade in the dredgings, which had to be exploded by an army bomb disposal team.|$|R
5|$|Significant {{quantities}} of cotton {{began to be}} used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton fustians, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance. The Irwell and Mersey were made <b>navigable</b> by 1736, <b>opening</b> a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The Bridgewater Canal, Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at Worsley to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton. Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns. A commodities exchange, opened in 1729, and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce. In 1780, Richard Arkwright began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill. In the early 1800s, John Dalton formulated his atomic theory in Manchester.|$|R
