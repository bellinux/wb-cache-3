40|$|Plasticin-L 1 (GLVNGLLSSVLGGGQGGGGLLGGIL) is a conformationally {{flexible}} glycine/leucine-rich peptide originally {{isolated from}} norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the South-American Santa Fe <b>frog</b> <b>Leptodactylus</b> <b>laticeps</b> (Leptodactylidae). A nuclear magnetic resonance/molecular dynamics characterization of plasticin-L 1 {{in the presence}} of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) and DPC/sodium dodecylsulphate micelles as membrane-mimetic models showed that the peptide has affinity for both neutral and anionic membranes. The peptide adopts a stable helical conformation at the N-terminal region and a more disordered helix at the C-terminal region, separated by an unstructured loop wherein the highest number of glycines is localized. In both micelle environments, plasticin-L 1 slowly inserts between the detergent head groups but always remains localized at the micelle/water interface. Plasticin-L 1 lacks direct antimicrobial activity but stimulates cytokine production by macrophages. Incubation with plasticin-L 1 (20 μg/mL) significantly (P < 0. 05) increased the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β, IL- 12, IL- 23, and TNF-α from unstimulated peritoneal macrophages from both C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/C mice. The peptide also increased IL- 6 production by unstimulated (P < 0. 01) and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated (P < 0. 01) macrophages, whereas the effects on production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 were not significant. These findings suggest that plasticin-L 1 may play an immunomodulatory role in vivo by stimulating cytokine production from frog skin macrophages in response to microbial pathogens. This peptide may represent a template for the design of peptides with therapeutic applications as immunostimulatory agent...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Neotropical</b> <b>frog</b> <b>Leptodactylus</b> insularum {{exhibits}} a rare combination of social behaviors—maternal care and tadpole schooling. Previous studies speculated on the adaptive function of maternal care, {{but had not}} examined it in detail. I performed field observations and predation trials to determine the benefit of maternal care {{and the cost of}} schooling on tadpole anti-predator behavior. Females of the Panamanian <b>frog</b> <b>Leptodactylus</b> insularum guard their nests and schools of tadpoles, communicate with their schools using body-pumping movements, lead them around the swamps, and aggressively defend their offspring against predators. Attending mothers improved tadpole survival; attended schools survived almost twice as long as deserted schools. Out of 66 schools monitored in two seasons, only eight schools survived until metamorphosis, and all received maternal care. The presence of an attending female had no effect on the speed of tadpole development or growth rates, however. Females {{do not appear to be}} leading schools to new foraging patches. Instead, females may be leading tadpoles in order to avoid rare, but potentially devastating moments, such as vertebrate predation or desiccation. Tadpoles develop in ephemeral environments and are susceptible to desiccation. In response, they actively forage throughout development and achieve metamorphosis in only 16 days. However, the activity of tadpoles within the school is very conspicuous and may increase vulnerability to predation. To determine if schooling tadpoles are more vulnerable to predation, I compared predator encounter rates, escape speeds, and spatial avoidance of predators by two schooling and solitary species of tadpoles (L. insularum and Physalaemus pustulosus, respectively) that develop in ephemeral ponds. Individual L. insularum tadpoles were more active, encountered more predators, and experienced higher mortality rates than did tadpoles of P. pustulosus. However, vulnerability due to activity was predator-specific; higher activity rates were associated with increased mortality only in the presence of aeschnids, which rely on movement for hunting. ...|$|R
40|$|During last decades, {{more and}} more {{microorganisms}} resistant to conventional antibiotics were isolated while few new antimicrobial drugs were developed. The urgent need for novel efficient antibiotics led a great attention on cationic host defense peptides (HDP) since their discovery in 1980 s. The role of these molecules {{in the defense of}} organism against pathogens attack, together with their high selectivity for bacterial cells over the eukaryotic ones, made them attractive candidates {{for the development of a}} new class of antimicrobial drugs. At present, a vast range of both natural and synthetic HDPs sequences are reported in the literature but they still present remarkable limitations to an effective applicability in vivo, such as the high sensitivity to proteases and strong activity reduction in the presence of physiological electrolytes concentration. A lot of effort have been put into improving their pharmacokinetics in order to develop new antimicrobial drugs based on their sequences. The present Ph. D. work is focused on the elucidation of the structure-to-function relationships of three different peptides, chosen as representative of different HDP categories. Esculentin- 1 b(1 - 18) is the ‘classic’ natural antimicrobial peptide (AMP), Plasticin-L 1, is an immunomodulatory peptide devoid of direct bactericidal activity, and a group of four synthetic peptide analogues based on a semi-synthetic dendrimeric and lipidated peptide called SB 056. The latter, in particular, represent an innovative class of peptides, whose structural features, three-dimensional folding and mode of action are absolutely peculiar and almost completely unknown before this project started. The interesting and multidisciplinary field of HDPs is presented in the first chapter. The origins, the structural features and the modes of action proposed for these compounds in the literature are briefly summarized. A brief excursus on the limits of their applicability in the clinical practice and the strategies adopted to overcome this issue is also included. In the second chapter, all the materials, the methods and experimental protocols are described, going from typical biological assays to biophysical methods [...] The main technique used to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of the peptides, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), is described in more detail. The computational tools used in concert with the NMR data are also described. The chapters 3, 4 and 5 are devoted to the results and discussion of the studies performed on the three aforementioned peptides. Esculentin- 1 b(1 - 18) is the 18 -mer Nterminal fragment of the peptide esculentin- 1 b, which was isolated from the granular skin secretions of the European frog Pelophylax lessonae/ridibundus. It is presented in the Chapter 3. The next chapter is dedicated to the studies performed on Plasticin-L 1, a 25 amino acid residue peptide isolated from the skin secretions of the South-American Santa Fe <b>frog</b> <b>Leptodactylus</b> <b>laticeps</b> (Leptodactylidae). In Chapter 5 the extensive and challenging work on the four SB 056 analogs is reported. Among various scientific collaborations, it has to be emphasized that part of the study on the SB 056 peptides was performed in the prof. A. S. Ulrich’s labs at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, where I personally spent a 6 months stage.
