40|$|Abstract Through the {{in-depth}} analysis {{of the features of}} Huabei rural industrialization, the unique factory regime in Baigou, Hebei, and the resulting special workers, this paper reveals two dilemmas the migrant workers in Baigou and larger Hubei area face: Because of the interpersonal network of labor market, personalized trade, familial labor process, and patrimonial management, the workers are unable to become either industrial working class or citizens. Facing this special group of workers, we still believe in their power of self-liberation. Drawing on Touraine’s action sociology and sociological intervention, and Burawoy’s public sociology and praxis-oriented research, we modify “sociological intervention ” according to the reality of Chinese society and propose the methodology of “strong sociological intervention ” whose vehicle is “Baigou Migrant Worker Night School. ” The night school provided workers with courses of labor law, English, and computer based on their actual needs. Labor law is the core to evoke the self-consciousness of the workers. Through communications in the night school and workers ’ real living circumstances, we collected their true information and treated it as the source of sociological knowledge. After three sessions of night school training, workers showed changes in skills, social, and psychological aspects, laying a foundation for the growth of self-consciousness. Keywords Factory regime. Publics. Social action. Sociological intervention It was the night of October 15 th, 2005 when I entered my classroom and saw all my students already there waiting for me.

40|$|This article {{examines}} representations of trauma in Lúcia Murat’s Que bom te ver viva (How <b>Nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> Alive, 1989), a semi-documentary {{focusing on the}} experiences of former political militants who, like the director herself, were arrested and tortured under Brazil’s military dictatorship. Despite having limited distribution {{at the time of}} release, the film has since gained status {{as one of the most}} significant representations of State-sanctioned violence during the 1960 s and 1970 s. It has received renewed attention more recently as Brazil enters a new period of reckoning with human rights crimes committed during the military regime. I first consider elements of trauma theory and their potential for better understanding the ways in which the film establishes connections between individual suffering and the wider socio-political realm. Essential to the film’s understanding of historical trauma are processes of ‘acting out’ and ‘working through’ which I explore along with the need, partially fulfilled in Que bom te ver viva, to create a witness to traumatic events. This is combined with an examination of stylistic strategies. I argue that the film’s flexible and unconventional aesthetics is a crucial means through which it can represent certain experiences associated with trauma and perform a radical re-envisioning of history...|$|R

Pautando-se por uma perspectiva que se baseia no cruzamento dos estudos de memória com o pensamento feminista, procura-se perceber o filme como manifestação da memória, verificando de que modo os paradoxos e tensões presentes articulam-se na narração da sobrevivência após um período traumático. Os estudos de gênero são pontos de apoio para observar de que forma as convenções de feminilidade são (re) construídas. Diante disso, notou-se a ênfase dada pelo filme às questões subjetivas que ficaram silenciadas nos anos de militância, caracterizadas principalmente nas discussões sobre violência e sexualidade – temas caros ao feminismo.

Our perspective is based on the intersection of memory studies with feminist thought, and we try to understand this film as a manifestation of memory. By doing so, it is possible to identify the paradoxes and tensions present in this movie and how they help build this narrative of survival after a traumatic period. The gender studies perspective is relevant to our observation of how the conventions of femininity are (re) built, and one is able to notice the emphasis on the subjective issues that were silenced in the years of militancy, present mainly in the debates on violence and sexuality – important topics to feminism. able to notice the emphasis on the subjective issues that were silenced in the years of militancy, present mainly in the debates on violence and sexuality – important topics to feminism...|$|R

I didn’t do anything I had planned to. Was {{going to get}} all my Christmas cards addressed but maybe I’ll get that done tomorrow. Honestly, I just can’t understand where the day went. Whenever I’m home the day goes so much faster. Tomorrow I have an appointment for the doctor’s but I’m going to call him 2 ̆ 6 see if I can make it Wednesday instead. Golly, honey, I hope all this week will go as fast as today did. It’s wonderful how fast they [sic] days go. I’ll have to stay home from work more often—Hah— Just talked to Charlotte 2 ̆ 6 Bobbie. Gee, honey, I miss you so much. You’re so wonderful and it’s so hard to be away from you. I love you so. You’re a bad boy. Why didn’t you buy your own Christmas presents? Calling Bobby up 2 ̆ 6 getting her to do it. Fine thing. Honey, {{what do you want to}} do this weekend? Ace may be home on Saturday. He has a chance of getting three planes. I wish you were coming home for seven days now, honey. That would be marvelous. Well, we really did have a lot of time, I guess. I[t] doesn’t seem as though we did but I guess we were pretty lucky. Gee, honey, I love you so. It’s so lonesome without you. How many times have I said that 2 ̆ 6 that I love you—I wonder. Millions probably. Woody should call any minute now 2 ̆ 6 let me know how she made out in school today. She was really tired. I was too but I slept until nine today. It was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> lie in bed and not have to worry about getting up. Eileen Billet announced her engagement this weekend—we beat her to it. I’ll have to read it again and see when they’re getting married. I wish we were getting married Christmas but I suppose everything happens for the best. Honey, do you think we’ll be able to go south for our honeymoon? I hope that you’re stationed down there 2 ̆ 6 we’ll be able to get there that way. Have your orders come through from Maxwell Field yet? I’ll be praying that they do before Friday. Today was a horrible day. Looked as though it would rain or snow any second. How was it up at Stewart? Did you fly today? I wish that you’d get those couple of hours in and be able to come home early for Christmas. Honey, I wish you were here now. Gee, we could have a fire in the fireplace 2 ̆ 6 lie in front of it. Just you and I and grandmaw—nice and cozy like. Vaughn Monroe is playing “The Love I Longed For. ” All we did this weekend was ride in taxis. Gee, I love you so. Honey, please get some sleep this week; you were so tired this weekend. Do your ears still ring? Gee, honey, I can’t consentrate [sic] on anything but you. I love you so. It’s getting worse 2 ̆ 6 worse—I can’t even read or write anyone but you. The letters I write are all about you or to you. Do you want to go to the Meadowbrook this weekend? Should I call 2 ̆ 6 make reservations? How do you make them[?] Just ask them for a table for four? I’ve never had to but I imagined that’s the way. Gee, I’ve been sitting here 2 ̆ 6 looking at my ring. It[‘s] so beautiful, honey. Gee, I love you so. It will be so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> for a few days, I hope, this Christmas. I wish we never had to be separated. Hon, this war seems endless. It’s just been going on for so long that it doesn’t ever want to stop. Golly, I’ll be the happiest person in the world when this war ends 2 ̆ 6 we can be together forever. Won’t it be marvelous not to watch [the] clock 2 ̆ 6 rush to catch trains 2 ̆ 6 being able to be together whenever we want to be. Have to call your mother now. Be back in a while. I love you so, honey. Well, hon, I’m back again. I love you so. Think I’ll go to the city tomorrow 2 ̆ 6 do a little Christmas shopping. That should be a nice job for a commando. The stores are really mobbed at this time of year. <b>You</b> should <b>see</b> the millions of people in one store, all after the same thing—It’s murder. Honey, if you’re home after Christmas on Tuesday, we should go 2 ̆ 6 look at wedding rings. We won’t have time to do it in March. You[‘ll] want to get married the day you get home won’t you or would you rather wait a few days 2 ̆ 6 get rested from the trip? Woody was real tired and said she’d write Steve tonight. Gee, honey, I wish you were going to be home all this week 2 ̆ 6 next week and the week after that 2 ̆ 6 every week. Anyway, I wish we could be together forever. Honey, I wish I could decide what to get Nanny 2 ̆ 6 Mom. I guess maybe if I go 2 ̆ 6 look around I might find something. Gee, hon, I love you so. I’ll never be able to tell you how much. There just aren’t words enough. I’ll have to spend the rest of my life trying to. What a wonderful way to spend a lifetime. Steve 2 ̆ 6 Woody seem to be getting along rather well. Really in the groove or are they more in a rut. Just found out that I started to make a list of people to send Christmas cards to on this paper. What a dope I am. It wouldn’t erase very well so please just ignore it. Gee, honey, this weekend went so darned fast. This was worse than any of them because we couldn’t be out late Saturday night. That wasn’t fair at all. Can’t write much more because I haven’t any more paper around. I was a good girl today and stayed off my ankle almost all day. I should get a good conduct ribbon for that. Honey, when I’m with you I’m so happy. Everything is wonderful as long as we can be together. Wonder what you did today, honey? The only thing that I did well was miss you so much. That scribbling is the remains of that list. [Referring to a large area of scribbling in the right margin] Well, my darling, good nigh[t]. I love you. All my love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|R
