25|$|The {{first of}} United's {{last two games}} was at home to West Ham United at midday on Saturday, 3 May. Needing the win, United {{got off to a}} great start, as Ronaldo put them ahead in the third minute with a {{deflected}} shot. 20 minutes later, he got his second of the game and 30th league goal of the season. West Ham failed to deal with Owen Hargreaves' left-footed cross, which dropped onto Ronaldo's thigh and bounced over the line. Former West Ham player Carlos Tevez made it 3–0 in the 26th minute, rifling a 25-yard shot over Robert Green in the Hammers goal. However, Dean Ashton pulled one back for West Ham with an audacious bicycle kick after Wes Brown's clearing header only went straight upwards. Just before half-time, as West Ham were looking to be settling into a rhythm, an altercation between Lucas Neill and Nani resulted in the Portuguese international headbutting the Australian, before going to ground himself, only to find a red card waiting for him when he got back to his feet. This left United a man down, with a whole half left to play. Nevertheless, despite the man advantage, West Ham were unable to capitalise, and ended up going 4–1 down in the 59th minute. Michael Carrick picked the ball up in midfield off a poor West Ham clearance, before letting rip from 30yards. His shot took a large deflection off Lucas Neill, wrong-footing Robert Green, and the ball <b>nestled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom-left corner of the net. Darren Fletcher also came close to scoring late in the game, after coming on as a substitute, but his shot deflected back off the inside of the post. The match finished 4–1 to United, but Chelsea's win against Newcastle United two days later kept the two teams level on points, meaning that the title race would go to {{the last day of the}} season for the first time since 1999.|$|E

500|$|Leaving Oldbridge, the Way {{follows the}} road for {{approximately}} [...] before turning onto a boreen. To {{the left of the}} boreen is Wart Stone Field, so called on account of a bullaun stone that lies in the field, water from which is said to cure warts. The boreen ends at Brusher Gap, reputed to be a place where locals left food and supplies for Michael Dwyer and his followers when they went on the run after the 1798 Rebellion. The Way enters Drummin forest, a sitka spruce plantation, where it passes an Adirondack shelter, constructed by Mountain , a volunteer group dedicated to trail preservation that has upgraded various sections of the Wicklow Way over the years. The trail climbs Paddock Hill before descending into a plantation of larch trees. The forest floor here is a habitat for spurges, heath bedstraw and fly agaric toadstools. The trail crosses the Military Road, near Laragh, and then a wooden footbridge across the Glenmacnass River. A dense spread of granite boulders litters the riverbed, glacial erratics deposited by melting glaciers {{at the end of the}} last ice age. This stretch of the trail follows an old mass path through a woodland of many native Irish tree species, including oak, rowan, silver birch and willow, carpeted with a forest floor of bilberry, bluebell and hard fern. The Way continues along forest tracks over the shoulder of Brockagh Mountain. At the highest point there is a vista over the Vale of Glendalough with the two lakes <b>nestled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shelter of Camaderry and Derrybawn Mountains. Exiting the forest, the Way reaches the R756 road and the Glendalough visitor centre.
