5|$|Because <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> {{had been}} {{recalled}} for {{service in the}} Vietnam War her modernization differed from her sisters {{for a number of}} reasons. When reactivated in 1967 <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> had her 20mm Oerlikon and 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns removed, and received improved electronic warfare capabilities. This alteration helped reduce the time it took get <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> recommissioned: since she was not in her World War II format the only major physical alteration to <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> involved the removal of four of her ten 5inch gun mounts {{to make room for the}} Armored Box Launchers. In addition to saving time, this also made <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> cheaper to reactivate since the cost needed to modernize the battleship only included the addition of missile and gun system mounts, electronic warfare suites, and improved radar and gun spotter technology.|$|E

5|$|Casinos {{and race}} tracks were closed because {{official}} monitors from the <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Casino Control Commission and the <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Racing Commission, respectively, {{were categorized as}} non-essential. At the time, <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight. Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later. The casinos attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were not paid by the state but by the casinos themselves, but the appeal was rejected at the <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Supreme Court; therefore {{they were forced to}} close.|$|E

5|$|Corzine {{has been}} the only <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> {{governor}} in recent memory to make any headway in addressing the crisis of municipal funding. While not directly touching the third rail of <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> governance – property taxes – Corzine's reform of the school funding formula (passed and signed in January 2008) resulted in significant relief to many <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> towns with outsize school costs but limited tax base. The plan survived a legal challenge and was declared constitutional by the <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Supreme Court on May 28, 2009.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> were {{announced}} by the New York Port Authority. Since the Central Railroad of <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> became a <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and <b>New</b> <b>Jersey.</b> Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> and other companies.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> portion in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers began to use the alignment of Route31 as a toll-free alternative to the <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Turnpike. On July 16, 1999, oversize trucks were banned from using Route31 {{as part of a}} larger statewide ban imposed on <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> roads not a part of the National Highway System by then-governor Christine Todd Whitman. The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Turnpike instead. In themid-2000s, the portion of Route31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and Clinton that widened the road to four lanes.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the state}} {{legislature}} began to reform the laws that governed the production of alcoholic beverages. With {{the passing of the}} <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Farm Winery Act in 1981, and laws providing for licenses for brewpubs and microbreweries in the 1990s, these two industries have grown significantly and the number of wineries and breweries have steadily increased. In February 2013, <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> issued the first new distillery license since before Prohibition, and legislation has been proposed {{to make it easier to}} establish craft distilleries in <b>New</b> <b>Jersey.</b> , <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> currently has 48 wineries, 28 breweries, and 2 distilleries.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, The New York Times {{reported}} that Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration had been considering an extension to Hoboken and to Secaucus Junction in <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> {{where it would}} connect with most <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Transit commuter lines. It would offer <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> commuters a direct route to Grand Central Terminal on the East Side of Manhattan and connections to most other New York City subway routes. If opened, the extension would take the New York City Subway outside the state's borders for the first time. The plan would replace the Access to the Region's Core (ARC) tunnel, which was canceled by <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Governor Chris Christie in October 2010.|$|E

5|$|<b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> {{remained}} {{there until the}} Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 required the United States Secretary of the Navy to list and maintain Iowa and Wisconsin on the Naval Vessel Register.
