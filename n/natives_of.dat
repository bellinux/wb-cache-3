5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit {{the trauma of the}} Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that the}} <b>natives</b> <b>of</b> Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the <b>natives</b> <b>of</b> Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E

A comparative analysis was conducted for the following comparisons: (a) compare the TAKS reading scores <b>of</b> <b>native</b> speaker <b>of</b> Spanish in a Two Way Dual Language program to <b>native</b> speaker <b>of</b> Spanish in a Bilingual Transitional program (b) compare the English TAKS reading scores <b>of</b> <b>native</b> speakers <b>of</b> Spanish (NSOS) in a Two Way Dual Language program to <b>native</b> speakers <b>of</b> English (NSOE) in an English-only program (c) compare the English TAKS reading scores <b>of</b> <b>native</b> speaker <b>of</b> English in a Two Way Dual Language program to <b>native</b> speaker <b>of</b> English in an English-only program (d) compare English TAKS reading scores <b>of</b> <b>native</b> speaker <b>of</b> English to the <b>native</b> speaker <b>of</b> Spanish in a Two Way Dual Language program. The research indicates that English TAKS scores <b>of</b> <b>native</b> speaker <b>of</b> English in the Dual Language program had a higher score than those English reading TAKS scores <b>of</b> <b>native</b> speaker <b>of</b> English in the English-only program. The English reading TAKS scores <b>of</b> <b>native</b> speaker <b>of</b> Spanish in the Dual Language Program indicated no evidence for the difference in the English reading scores between the <b>native</b> speakers <b>of</b> English in the English-only program.

5|$|<b>Natives</b> <b>of</b> {{the region}} {{encountered}} foreigners at {{several times and}} places during the 18thand 19thcenturies. European and American vessels explored the coastal area around {{the mouth of the}} river in the late 18thcentury, trading with local natives. The contact would prove devastating to the Indian tribes; a large portion of their population was wiped out by a smallpox epidemic. Canadian explorer Alexander Mackenzie crossed what is now interior British Columbia in 1793. From 1805 to 1807, the Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the Oregon Country along the Clearwater and Snake rivers, and encountered numerous small settlements of natives. Their records recount tales of hospitable traders who were not above stealing small items from the visitors. They also noted brass teakettles, a British musket, and other artifacts that had been obtained in trade with coastal tribes. From the earliest contact with westerners, the <b>natives</b> <b>of</b> the mid- and lower Columbia were not tribal, but instead congregated in social units no larger than a village, and more often at a family level; these units would shift with the season as people moved about, following the salmon catch up and down the river's tributaries.|$|E
