Yet the first true pound lock was built in 1396 at Damme near Bruges, Belgium. A famous civil engineer of pound locks in Europe was the Italian Bertola da <b>Novate</b> (c. 1410–1475), who constructed 18 {{of them on the}} Naviglio di Bereguardo (part of the Milan canal system sponsored by Francesco Sforza) between the years 1452 and 1458.|$|E

5000|$|The third type of lease is {{described}} as a <b>novated</b> finance lease or non-maintained <b>novated</b> lease where only the <b>novated</b> lease itself is salary packaged, with none of the other running costs such as fuel, insurance or maintenance being paid by the employer. [...] This arrangement is of little or no benefit to the employee as there is no change to the fringe benefit value, being based on the original purchase price, but any tax benefits on the other running costs are lost as they are not salary packaged. The effect of paying FBT or using ECM offsets most or all the potential tax benefits from salary packaging the lease rentals alone.|$|R

5000|$|While the <b>novated</b> lease {{is only a}} part of {{the salary}} {{packaging}} arrangement, the whole arrangement is often described as a [...] "novated lease" [...] even though the term strictly applies only to the lease for the finance of the vehicle which has been <b>novated.</b> This usage of [...] "novated lease" [...] is almost universal on documentation, advertising and the websites of salary packaging companies and leads to confusion about whether it is the whole arrangement or just the lease itself which is meant by the term.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first term}} is fully {{maintained}} <b>novated</b> lease, describing {{the most common}} type of salary packaging arrangement, where a finance lease is <b>novated</b> so the employer pays the lease rentals but also pays all other running costs (excluding the effect of employee contributions). [...] This terminology is confusing as outside of salary packaging, a fully maintained lease, describes an operating lease where the lease contract includes in the rental payments the fixed running costs of a vehicle or asset, such as insurance, registration, servicing and roadside assistance as well as some variable costs like fuel and tyres. The lessor simply hands back the vehicle at the end of the lease with the lessor assuming the residual value risk. There are usually terms in the contract with penalties or fees to protect the lessor from excessive costs and depreciation of the asset. Thus, a fully maintained <b>novated</b> lease is not a novation of a fully maintained lease.|$|R

50|$|To {{make things}} more confusing, {{it is also}} very common to include up front costs {{over and above the}} {{purchase}} cost, such as stamp duty, registration, the first year's comprehensive insurance, extended warranties and other insurances and fees, into the lease in a fully maintained <b>novated</b> lease, since there will not have been sufficient time to set up the payments by the employer into the salary packaging account to cover those costs. For this reason it is also common for <b>novated</b> leases to have deferred payments, that is, the first one or two rentals are set at $0, with the remaining rentals increased to compensate.|$|R
50|$|The term is {{commonly}} used in Australia to describe an arrangement {{for the use of}} a motor vehicle via salary packaging, where, as part of the arrangement, a lease is <b>novated</b> from an employee to an employer.|$|R
50|$|While {{a salary}} {{packaged}} <b>novated</b> lease {{has the potential}} to yield tax benefits for the employee, providing net savings on the overall cost of purchasing and running a motor vehicle, the complexity of the process and lack of transparency makes it difficult for most people to evaluate the extent of the benefits. Salary packaging companies will usually provide a comparison stating projected savings, but this only compares leasing the vehicle with the same estimated costs without the benefit of salary packaging. This is unlikely to be how a motor vehicle would actually be purchased in Australia, in most cases a car or personal loan or some other source of funds such as savings or redraw from a home mortgage would be used. Additional costs of leasing and fees can mean the raw running costs of a salary packaged <b>novated</b> lease are significant higher than the equivalent costs of private ownership with a loan, but with the benefits of tax savings, the net cost can be lower. In addition, tax deductions for any business use of a vehicle are specifically disallowed for a salary packaged <b>novated</b> lease.|$|R

50|$|It is {{frequently}} considered by employees that a salary packaging arrangement including a <b>novated</b> lease is a loan for the vehicle which includes non-finance running costs. This confusion {{is compounded by}} salary packaging companies and finance companies who quote interest rates for leases.|$|R
50|$|Salary {{packaging}} companies often claim {{access to}} fleet discounts on {{the purchase price}} of vehicles that are not available to individuals. In some cases these may be only on specific makes or models of vehicle, and may be no greater or even lower than discounts which can be negotiated by an individual with a dealer. There is generally no reason why an individual cannot negotiate an acceptable purchase price, then arrange a lease which is then <b>novated</b> and the vehicle salary packaged. Significant savings {{can be obtained by}} salary packaging a <b>novated</b> lease on a cheaper used or demonstrator vehicle. Additional volume discounts may also be available on insurance or servicing arranged by the salary packaging company, but contrariwise, they may be more expensive than those privately arranged.|$|R
