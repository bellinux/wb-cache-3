2500|$|The fall of Rangoon cut off {{the routine}} import of Burmese rice into India and Ceylon. [...] In India, {{according}} to the Famine Commission's, Final Report, [...] "the areas most affected were parts of the provinces of Bombay and Madras and the States of Cochin and Travancore." [...] The imports from Burma normally met India's supply deficit in rice, which totaled 1,750,000 tons. In Bengal, the <b>net</b> <b>import</b> for which actual receipts and despatch documents existed, was on average 50,000 tons annually for 1932–1937, [...] and 159,000 tons annually for 1938–42, the highest levels being recorded for the years 1934 and 1939 at 364,000 tons and 382,000 tons respectively. [...] But, according to the Final Report, there was also unrecorded import into Bengal [...] "by country boat from Assam and from Arakan in Burma" [...] the extent of which was not known accurately. [...] The Commission proposed that this import was {{of the order of}} 50,000 tons annually for 1932–1937 and 100,000 tons annually for 1938–1942. [...] Aggregate consumption was also computed, not by a direct approach using census-based population statistics whose margin of error was too high, but by indirect estimation from a combination of the available values of annual supply, <b>net</b> <b>import,</b> carry-over stock at the year's beginning, and the same at the year's end. [...] However, as carry-over stock in any individual year could not be accurately estimated, averages were computed for a longer periods under the expectation that the carry-over stock at {{the beginning and the end}} of the periods were negligible compared to the total consumption during the periods. [...] The commission also made adjustments in annual supply, which had errors stemming from the assessment of cultivated acreage under the permanent settlement in Bengal. In this way, average consumption for the 15-year period 1928 to 1942 was computed to be 8.14 million tons annually for unadjusted acreage, and 9.18 million tons for the adjusted. Annual consumption was then estimated by assuming that it veered off the unadjusted average by increments, or decrements, of 0.10 million tons every year, and off the adjusted average by those of 0.12 million tons. [...] Using these data in the Famine Inquiry Commission report, the percentage of net imports—either recorded only, or both recorded and unrecorded, computed relative to a 15-year- or 5-year time period, and to consumption- or supply averages, which were either unadjusted or adjusted—were found by scholars to be 1.1% and 1.4% in one instance, and [...] "less than 4%" [...] in another. Using different data, P. C. Mahalanobis estimated the net imports to be on average 1% of aggregate supply for the period 1934–39, estimating their highest value for a single year at 5% for 1934, and noting that [...] "the physical quantities of net imports was never large." [...] While acknowledging that the influx of Burma rice was a factor in stabilizing prices, as it prevented hoarding or cornering the market, he concluded that there was [...] "chronic but a growing shortage of rice in Bengal," [...] which had not affected prices or imports because a large number of people, lacking the money to buy enough food, often made do with less than what was enough.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{financial}} year 2012–13, {{the production of}} crude oil is 37.86 million tons and 40,679 million standard cubic meters (nearly 26.85 million tons) natural gas. The <b>net</b> <b>import</b> of crude oil [...] & petroleum products is 146.70 million tons worth of Rs 5611.40 billions. This includes 9.534 million tons of LNG imports worth of Rs. 282.15 billions. Internationally, LNG price [...] (One mmBtu of LNG = 0.1724 barrels of crude oil (boe) = 24.36 cubic meters of natural gas = 29.2 litres diesel = 21.3 kg LPG) is fixed below crude oil price in terms of heating value. LNG is slowly gaining its role as direct use fuel in road [...] and marine transport without regasification. By the end of June 2016, LNG price has fallen by nearly 50% below its oil parity price making it more economical fuel than diesel/gas oil in transport sector. [...] In 2012-13, India consumed 15.744 million tons petrol and 69.179 million tons diesel which are mainly produced from imported crude oil at huge foreign exchange out go. Use of natural gas [...] for heating, cooking and electricity generation is not economical {{as more and more}} locally produced natural gas will be converted into LNG for use in transport sector to reduce crude oil imports. In addition to the conventional natural gas production, coal gasification, coal bed methane, coal mine methane and Biogas digesters / Renewable natural gas will also become source of LNG forming decentralised base for production of LNG to cater to the widely distributed demand. There is possibility to convert most of the heavy duty vehicles [...] (including diesel driven rail engines) into [...] LNG fuelled vehicles to reduce diesel consumption drastically with operational cost and least pollution benefits. Also, the break even price at user end for switching from imported coal to LNG in electricity generation is estimated near 6 US$/mmBtu. The advent of cheaper marine CNG transport will restrict LNG use in high end transport sector to replace costly liquid fuels leaving imported CNG use for other needs. As the marine CNG transport is economical for medium distance transport and has fast unloading flexibility at many ports without costly unloading facilities, they have become alternate solution to submarine gas pipelines.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The U. S. has {{historically}} been a net importer of wood and paper products. During the 1990 ’s, the U. S. trade deficit widened, implying an increasing U. S. impact on timber harvests in foreign supply regions. An analysis was made of historical and projected trends in U.

S. has increased its <b>net</b> <b>imports</b> and that the estimated harvest of roundwood overseas to make imports to the U. S. has increased faster than the estimated reductions in overseas harvest due to exports of U. S. products overseas.
