25|$|Most of {{the base}} of the {{mountain}} lies in the Tsaté <b>nappe,</b> a remnant of the Piedmont-Liguria oceanic crust (ophiolites) and its sedimentary rocks. Up to 3,400 metres the mountain is composed of successive layers of ophiolites and sedimentary rocks. From 3,400 metres to the top, the rocks are gneisses from the Dent Blanche <b>nappe</b> (Austroalpine nappes). They are divided into the Arolla series (below 4,200 m) and the Valpelline zone (the summit). Other mountains in the region (Weisshorn, Zinalrothorn, Dent Blanche, Mont Collon) also belong to the Dent Blanche <b>nappe.</b>|$|E
25|$|The commune, {{which is}} at the heart of the geology, has its {{specificities}} related to the ancient city built upstream of the cluse which the Bléone has pierced into the <b>Nappe</b> de Digne to dump in the tertiary basin of Valensole.|$|E
25|$|The {{hot springs}} were captured, since ancient times, {{to the point}} where these carixian limestones are cut by the hack of the southernmost valley, {{descending}} from Entrages. Their healing powers are linked to their ascent along the gypsiferous Triassic levels of the sole thrust of the <b>Nappe</b> de Digne.|$|E
5000|$|Basement <b>nappes</b> are {{composed}} generally of crystalline basement rocks (but may contain basement sedimentary cover), forming so-called thick-skinned style. <b>Nappes</b> {{of this type}} usually reach a large thickness and form independent superunits such as Penninic <b>nappes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Infrahelvetic complex {{has been}} overthrusted by the Helvetic <b>nappes,</b> that partly contain similar rocks. It crops {{out in the}} {{northern}} part of the canton of Graubünden, generally south and below the Helvetic <b>nappes</b> and north of the Penninic <b>nappes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{rocks of}} the Austroalpine <b>nappes</b> form {{most of the}} {{outcrops}} in the Eastern Alps, while in the west these <b>nappes</b> are, {{with the exception of}} a few places (the Dent Blanche and Sesia units), eroded away. In the Western Alps the Helvetic <b>nappes</b> can be found to the north and west, sometimes still under klippes of the Penninic <b>nappes,</b> as in the Préalpes du Sud south of Lake Geneva.|$|R
25|$|The Matterhorn {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of gneisses (originally {{fragments of the}} African Plate before the Alpine orogeny) from the Dent Blanche <b>nappe,</b> lying over ophiolites and sedimentary rocks of the Penninic nappes. The mountain's current shape {{is the result of}} cirque erosion due to multiple glaciers diverging from the peak, such as the Matterhorn Glacier {{at the base of the}} north face, forming a horn.|$|E
25|$|Wetzlar lies on {{the eastern}} edge of the Rhenish Massif. The {{substrate}} consists of geologically young sediments of the Lahn and much older Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of the two main geological units of the Massif, the Lahnmulde and the so-called Giessen <b>nappe.</b> The northwestern part of the urban area {{lies on the}} Lahntal silt, sand and gravel, which have only slightly hardened. They were deposited by the River Lahn, at a point where its valley (which is still up to one kilometre wide) to the west becomes increasingly narrow and deep. The main part of the city is built on in part intensively folded, faulted and slated layers of shales, sandstone, quartzite and limestone. They were deposited in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods in a sea characterised by island chains, volcanoes and atolls that were pushed together and covered by a layer of rock that had been transported from another location during the period of mountain building known as the Variscan orogeny. The marine sedimentary rocks which resulted from this tectonic action now give the town its character as they were often used for building material.|$|E
25|$|From 1925 to 1926 Lees {{surveyed}} Oman with K. Washington Gray, {{the resulting}} papers (given to the Geological Society of London and the Royal Geographical Society) remained standard {{works for the}} region until at least the 1950s. Lees (1928) addressed the intriguing question of how remnants of oceanic crust, known as the Semail Ophiolite, came to occur all around the Hajar Mountains of Oman. He proposed a huge thrust sheet, the Semail <b>Nappe,</b> based on his observations in the Oman Mountains, and on {{his knowledge of the}} Alps and of the Zagros. Lee's theory was remarkably far-sighted and, as evidence of plate tectonics grew, a development of his theory emerged. This postulated that, as the continents moved together, a slab of ocean crust from the ancient Tethys Ocean had been pushed over the continental margin for hundreds of kilometres about 87-76 million years ago. However, Hugh Wilson, a leading proponent of the 'in-situ' theory that these igneous rocks had essentially flowed into position, observed that the major displacement surfaces were not prominent in the field and that he had seen more evidence of extension than compression in the Oman Mountains. Glennie (2001) remains a spirited critique of most of Wilson's arguments. Almost all later authors interpret the Semail Ophiolite as thrust, or obducted, probably due to a short period of subduction close to the margin of the Arabian plate.|$|E
50|$|The Helvetic <b>nappes</b> are thrusted {{over the}} Infrahelvetic complex and the {{external}} massifs of the Alps (like the Aarmassif or Mont Blanc Massif). In Switzerland, Germany and Austria {{they are also}} thrusted over the Molasse basin of the Alpine foreland. In turn, the Helvetic <b>nappes</b> were overthrusted by the Penninic <b>nappes</b> from the south. In Switzerland these have been eroded away at most places but in Germany and Austria they are still covering the Helvetic <b>nappes.</b> Due to this the Helvetic <b>nappes</b> only crop out as a thin band in those countries, which forms the Northern Limestone Alps.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} base of the mountain, the Matterhorn is {{composed}} of gneiss belonging to the Dent Blanche klippe, an isolated part of the Austroalpine <b>nappes,</b> lying over the Penninic <b>nappes.</b> The Austroalpine <b>nappes</b> are part of the Apulian plate, a small continent which broke up from Africa before the Alpine orogeny. For this reason the Matterhorn has been popularized as an African mountain. The Austroalpine <b>nappes</b> are mostly common in the Eastern Alps.|$|R
50|$|Fragments of Piemont-Ligurian oceanic crust were {{preserved}} as ophiolites in the Penninic <b>nappes</b> of the Alps and the Tuscan <b>nappes</b> of the Apennines. These <b>nappes</b> were subducted, {{sometimes to}} great depths in the mantle, before being obducted again. Due {{to the high}} pressures at these depths, much of the material had been metamorphosed in the blueschist or eclogite facies.|$|R

50|$|In Switzerland, the Austroalpine <b>nappes</b> {{have been}} eroded away {{except for a}} few {{isolated}} outcrops called the Sesia unit and the Dent Blanche klippe (the Matterhorn is the most outstanding example of an Austroalpine klippe).

50|$|Cenozoic eclogites {{do occur}} in the Penninic <b>nappes,</b> which contain {{material}} that has been through blueschist or eclogite facies. These <b>nappes</b> show a Barrovian field gradient. This type of metamorphism can only occur when a rock is in pressure-temperature conditions that normally {{occur in the}} Earth’s mantle. This means the Penninic <b>nappes</b> consist of material that was subducted into the mantle and was later obducted onto the crust.|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} of Valdeón and {{adjacent}} western Liébana (along the provincial boundary between León and Santander, in northern Spain) Namurian and Westfalian flysch deposits are unconformably covered by a sequence of olisto-strome and flysch units, alternating with <b>nappes.</b> This sequence, with a thickness of about 5 km, was built up during the Middle Cantabrian. It is covered in turn by the Picos de Europa <b>nappes</b> with intercalated flyschoid sediments of a slightly younger age. In this paper the discrete lithostratigraphic and structural units are described and analyzed. Special attention {{is given to the}} fusulinid biostratigraphy. The contact relations between <b>nappes</b> and olistostrome units and their complementary lithostratigraphy are explained as the result of synsedimentary emplacement of the <b>nappes</b> by gravitational sliding along the earth surface. The palaeogeo-logic setting prior to the deposition of the <b>nappes</b> and olistostromes is deduced from the stratigraphy and lithofacies of the <b>nappes</b> and the allochthonous elements constituting the olistostromes. The regional geologic setting thus obtained and its consequent sedimentological and structural development, are discussed. A...|$|R

The only difficulty is that when silences have been so long and so hideous the renewal of the communication, the patching-up (as regards the mere facts) of the weakened and ragged link, becomes in itself a necessity, or a question, formidable even to deterrence. I have had verily an année terrible--the fag-end of which is, however, an immense improvement on everything that has preceded it. I won't attempt, none the less, to make up arrears of information in any degree whatever--but simply let off at you this rude but affectionate signal from the desert-island of my shipwreck--or what would be such if my situation were not, on the whole, the one with which I am for the present most in tune. I am staying on here with my dear and admirable sister-in-law and her children, with whom I have been ever since my beloved and illustrious elder brother's death in the country at the end of August.... My younger brother had died just a month before--and I am alone now, of my father's once rather numerous house. But there--I am trying to pick up lost chords--which is what I didn't mean to ... I expect to stick fast here through January and then go {{for a couple of months}} to New York--after which I shall begin to turn my face to England--heaven send that day! The detail of this is, however, fluid and subject to alteration--in everything save my earnest purpose of struggling back by April or May at furthest to your (or verily my) distressed country; for which I unceasingly languish.... The material conditions here (that is the best of them--others intensely and violently not) suit me singularly at present; as for instance the great and glorious American fact of weather, to which it all mainly comes back, but which, since last August here, I have never known anything to surpass. While I write you this I bask in golden December sunshine and dry, crisp, mild frost--over a great <b>nappe</b> of recent snow, which flushes with the [...] "tenderest" [...] lights. This does me a world of good--and the fact that I have brought with me my little Lamb House servant, who has lived with me these 10 years; but for the rest my life is exclusively in this one rich nest of old affections and memories. I put you, you see, no questions, but please find half a dozen very fond ones wrapped up in every good wish I send you for the coming year.
