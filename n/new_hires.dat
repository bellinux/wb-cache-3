5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very few <b>new</b> <b>hires</b> are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E
5|$|The fledgling Union's first film, Kedok Ketawa, was {{released}} in July 1940. Following a young couple who face off against criminals {{with the help of}} a masked bandit, this film was directed by Jo An Djan and starred Oedjang, Fatimah, and Basoeki Resobowo. It received positive reviews; the journalist Saeroen wrote in Pemandangan that the film's quality was comparable to imported Hollywood productions, and a review in Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad praised the cinematography. Following these positive reviews, Union hired Saeroen– who had previously written Terang Boelan and several works for Tan's Film– as a screenwriter. He made his debut for the company with Harta Berdarah, directed by <b>new</b> <b>hires</b> R Hu and Rd Ariffien, following Jo An Djan's departure for Populair's Film.

25|$|A {{firefighter}} sick-out {{appeared to}} occur {{the week of}} August 18, 2013. Usually, 20 to 30 firefighters call in sick in an average week. But beginning on August 18, 83 firefighters did so. The absences caused the department to require mandatory overtime of 67 firefighters, forcing them to work for 36 straight hours. DCFEMS officials called the illnesses suspicious, while the union said the illnesses showed the department had too few firefighters to cover the schedule. At a press conference on August 26, Ellerbe asserted that the firefighter shortage would be ending soon. He said 60 firefighters would {{be added to the}} force {{by the end of the}} year. He credited <b>new</b> <b>hires,</b> as well as graduates of the fire training academy, for adding to the force.|$|E

25|$|Roh's ambitious initial {{promises}} to establish Korea {{as an international}} business hub in Asia faded soon after his election. Instead, Korea under Roh suffered negative publicity in the foreign business community due to prosecutorial investigations on the purchase and sale of Korea Exchange Bank by the Lone Star Fund, spurring foreign investors to join their domestic counterparts in leaving the country. When housing prices soared, To prevent speculative bubble like Japanese asset price bubble crisis, Roh introduced additional 1~3% of property tax on real estate exceeding 600 million won(about 600,000US$). This efficiently slowed down the bubble, but this policy met high opposition by the riches who had to pay higher tax. At the same time, Roh also increased welfare spending by 18% a year, and drastically increased spending by increasing {{the size of the}} civil service by more than 95,700 <b>new</b> <b>hires,</b> or approximately 60 people a day. Criticism of lax discipline among the civil service and police force was high during his government.|$|E
25|$|Airline unions fought Lorenzo and Continental {{at every}} step. In the Federal courts, they un{{successful}}ly sued {{to stop the}} company's reorganization. They were successful in working to persuade Congress to pass a new bankruptcy law preventing bankrupt companies from terminating contracts as Continental had successfully done, but the law {{was too late to}} affect Continental. Lorenzo took Continental into Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 23, 1983, after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a lower pay rate with labor unions. Chapter 11 saved the company from liquidation, but required substantial reorganization, which began immediately. Following bankruptcy, Continental was freed of its contractual obligations and imposed a series of new labor agreements on its union workers, sharply reducing the airline's labor costs. Continental became vastly more competitive with the new airline startups then emerging and thriving in the southwestern U.S., but employee attitudes and loyalty were adversely affected. By the end of 1984, Continental recorded a $50million profit. Pilots went on strike in 1983, but were unsuccessful due to Continental pilots and <b>new</b> <b>hires</b> who crossed the picket line.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining a Social Security {{number for}} a child is voluntary. Further, there is no general legal {{requirement}} that individuals join the Social Security program unless they want or have to work. Under normal circumstances, FICA taxes or SECA taxes will be collected on all wages. About {{the only way to}} avoid paying either FICA or SECA taxes are to join a religion that does not believe in insurance, such as the Amish, Christian Science or a religion whose members have taken a vow of poverty (see IRS publication 517 and 4361). Federal workers employed before 1987, various state and local workers including those in some school districts who had their own retirement and disability programs were given the one-time option of joining Social Security. Many employees and retirement and disability systems opted to keep out of the Social Security system because of the cost and the limited benefits. It was often much cheaper to obtain much higher retirement and disability benefits by staying in their original retirement and disability plans. Now only a few of these plans allow <b>new</b> <b>hires</b> to join their existing plans without also joining Social Security. In 2004, the Social Security Administration estimated that 96% of all U.S. workers were covered by the system with the remaining 4% mostly a minority of government employees enrolled in public employee pensions and not subject to Social Security taxes due to historical exemptions.|$|E
