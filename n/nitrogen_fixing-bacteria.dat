40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation {{is a process}} in which the atmospheric nitrogen (N 2) is transformed into ammonia (NH 3) by a select group of nitrogen-fixing organisms, or diazotrophic bacteria. In order to furnish the biologically useful nitrogen to plants, these bacteria must be in constant molecular communication with their host plants. Some of these molecular plant-microbe interactions are very specific, resulting in a symbiotic relationship between the diazotroph and the host. Others are found between associative diazotrophs and plants, resulting in plant infection and colonization of internal tissues. Independent of the type of ecological interaction, glycans and glycoconjugates produced by these bacteria {{play an important role in}} the molecular communication prior and during colonization. Even though exopolysaccharides (EPS) and lipochitooligosaccharides (LCO) produced by diazotrophic bacteria and released onto the environment have their importance in the microbe-plant interaction, it is the lipopolysaccharides (LPS), anchored on the external membrane of these bacteria, that mediates the direct contact of the diazotroph with the host cells. These molecules are extremely variable among the several species of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing-bacteria,</b> and there are evidences of the mechanisms of infection being closely related to their structure...|$|E
40|$|Diazotrophic {{bacteria}} {{isolated from}} banana plants {{were characterized by}} morphological and physiological aspects. Three different groups of these plant-bacteria could be established. Two of them showed similarity to species of the Herbaspirillum genus. The third one was different because used only a few carbon substrates and produced water diffusible compounds that fluoresced under UV light. All three bacterial groups were thin rods with mono or bipolar flagella, presented negative reaction in Gram stain, showed catalase activity, were able to reduce nitrate and grew better in semi-solid JNFb medium at 31 ÂºC. The nitrogenase activity was detected in semi-solid N-free JNFb medium and expressed higher values when pH ranged from 6. 5 to 7. 0 (groups I and II) and 6. 0 to 6. 5 (group III). The diazotrophs isolated from banana plants were distinct from species of Herbaspirillum previously identified in gramineous plants. Key words: Herbaspirillum, Herbaspirillum-like, Musa spp., microbial ecology Over the last decades {{there has been a}} great interest in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing-bacteria</b> associated to non-legumes, principally gramineous plants.
