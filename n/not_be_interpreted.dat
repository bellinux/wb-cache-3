5|$|Many logical flaws {{were found}} in COBOL 60, leading GE's Charles Katz to warn that it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> unambiguously. A {{reluctant}} short-term committee enacted a total cleanup and, by March 1963, {{it was reported that}} COBOL's syntax was as definable as ALGOL's, although semantic ambiguities remained.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} decision, {{reached by}} a majority of four judges to three, was that the Migration Act did permit indefinite detention. Each judge delivered a separate judgment with Justices McHugh, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon forming the majority, although Justice Heydon agreed entirely with Justice Hayne, and offered no extra reasoning. Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow and Kirby dissented, finding instead that the Migration Act should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> to permit indefinite detention.|$|E

25|$|In the Incorporation case in 1990 the High Court {{affirmed the}} view in Huddart, Parker that the {{corporations}} power {{was confined to}} making laws with respect to companies that had commenced trading and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> so as to support laws providing {{for the formation of}} companies.|$|E
50|$|In case of {{employer}} emails, {{although the}} words “the people” {{may appear to}} be broad and to include any employee, this amendment (or any other part of the United States constitution) has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> to protect the privacy interest of private- sector employees.

25|$|Section 21 {{ensured that}} the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms would be read as supplementing, rather than {{replacing}} any rights of the English and French languages, which had been constitutionalized prior to 1982.

25|$|The court split 6:1 in its decision.

5000|$|Supporters of a {{prediction}} sometimes {{contend that the}} problem lies not with {{the wording of the}} prediction, but with the interpretation — an argument sometimes used by supporters of religious texts. This argument may lead to the question: [...] "What is the point of {{a prediction}} that cannot <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> correctly before the event?" [...] However, the argument <b>is</b> <b>not</b> that the prediction could <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> correctly prior to the event, but simply that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> in the case in question, thus the question is working from a false premise. Of course, any [...] "prediction" [...] that is so vague as to <b>not</b> <b>be</b> correctly <b>interpreted</b> before the event it allegedly [...] "predicted" [...] is functionally equivalent to no prediction at all.|$|R
25|$|Especially {{on human}} rights and {{fundamental}} freedoms, the Constitution provides {{for human rights and}} freedom of citizen according to the universally recognised principles and norm of international law as well as the Constitution and affirms that the listing in the Constitution of the Russian Federation of the fundamental rights and freedom shall <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a rejection and derogation of other universally recognised human rights and freedom.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the EU {{changed its}} {{reading of the}} Cotonou Agreement (the Association Agreement between the EU and the ACP countries). It now stated that the Cotonou {{agreement}} should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as mandating free movement of labour, but rather the free trade of goods and services.

The leader of the Ugandan delegation, Internal Affairs Minister Ruhakana Rugunda stated that his priority was to obtain a quick ceasefire. The LRA delegation, led by Martin Ojul, said that LRA's acceptance of the peace talks should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> that LRA can no longer fight, but stressed that a negotiated settlement {{is the best way}} to end the conflict.|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} to this study. The {{drawing of the}} sonographer was reinterpreted {{by one of the}} study investigators to determine the degree of carotid stenosis using B-mode alone. Due to the subjective nature of the drawing, what the sonographer interpreted as < 50 % stenosis on the diagram may <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as such by our investigators. Conversely, what the sonographer interpreted as ≥ 50 % may <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>interpreted</b> as such by our investigators, as was the case for the one false negative in Table 3. Further research should determine the optimal residual diameter or area of residual lumen as seen on B-mode which would allow one to objectively rule out clinically important stenosis.|$|R

25|$|In 1564, Dee {{wrote the}} Hermetic work Monas Hieroglyphica ("The Hieroglyphic Monad"), an {{exhaustive}} Cabalistic {{interpretation of a}} glyph of his own design, meant to express the mystical unity of all creation. Having dedicated it to Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor {{in an effort to}} gain patronage, Dee attempted to present it to him during the time of his ascension to the throne of Hungary. This work was esteemed by many of Dee's contemporaries, but the work can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> today without the secret oral tradition from that era.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} to challenge BSAC royalty claims {{were made by}} the Governor of Northern Rhodesia between 1935 and 1937. The Governor, Sir Hubert Young, attempted to convince the Colonial Office that BSAC only owned mineral rights in the areas of the concessions from Lewanika and the Certificates of Claim from Johnston. This excluded most of the Copperbelt, as the area east of the Kafue River had never been ruled by Lewanika. The Colonial Office response was that BSAC ownership of mineral rights throughout Northern Rhodesia had been accepted in practice, and the references to the Lewanika concessions and Certificates of Claim should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> in a narrow sense.|$|E
25|$|One common {{misconception}} of BDSM and kink is {{that women}} are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. Roy Baumeister (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might think otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about femininity; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like feminization of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.|$|E
40|$|Without {{acknowledging}} the paradigm difference between testing theory and predicting events, {{researchers in the}} field of management and organization continue to use the DEL-technique as a promising technique to evaluate theory based on cross-classification data analysis. We address the purpose and interpretation of the DEL-measure within the theory-testing and events-predicting paradigm. We argue that DEL, a proportionate reduction in error measure, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> in terms of the proportionate error reduction of knowing a prediction rule over not knowing it. In addition, a significant DEL-value <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a dependence-measure of acceptance of a hypothesis as the only and best relationship between two categorical variables, just as a non-significant DEL-value cannot <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a measure of independence. Furthermore, an alternative proportionate reduction in error measure generates unequivocally interpretable results compared to the DEL-technique...|$|R

25|$|Dabar ha-lamed me-inyano ("Something proved by the context") {{refers to}} {{definition}} from the context. Rabbi Ishmael omits rule 6 entirely, and has another (No. 13) instead {{which is not}} found in Hillel, and which reads thus: שני כתובים המכחישים זה את זה, עד שיבוא הכתוב השלישי ויכריע ביניהם ("If two passages contradict each other, this contradiction must be reconciled by comparison with a third passage"). The method of solution of such opposing statements by {{the help of a}} third passage is a point of divergency between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the latter, the third sentence decides in favor of one of the two contradictory statements (Mekhilta, ed. Isaac Hirsch Weiss, 6a); according to the former, it modifies the interpretation of both. With regard to the meaning of words which are pointed in the text, Simeon ben Eleazar laid down the rule that if the pointed part of the word (נקודה) is equal to the unpointed part (כתב) in length, the word must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> at all; but if one part is longer than the other, such part must be interpreted (Genesis Rabbah lxxviii.). Concerning the interpretation of words by a change of letters or vowels the rule is: אל תקרא ("Do not read so, but so"). Under this rule the integrity of the text itself is not assailed, the changes made being only for the purpose of explanation.|$|E
25|$|Gürsel freed 200 {{students}} and nine newsmen, and licensed 14 banned newspapers to start publishing again (Time, 6 June 1960).

President Cemal Gürsel also formed a scientific council to guide the Ministry of Defence (in parallel to a separate scientific law council to write the new constitution of the Republic of Turkey) at the time and later ordered the foundation of the broader Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey as the extended continuation of his MoD Scientific Council with the primary advisory duty of providing guidance to the government's all plans and policies.|$|E
500|$|Multiple reactor sensors at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station, located [...] {{northeast}} of the epicenter, detected a slight power reduction {{as a result of}} vibrations in the reactor or monitoring devices. This caused the two nuclear reactors to shut down automatically seconds before off-site power was lost. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent additional inspectors to the Virginia plant after preliminary measurements suggested that the ground shook more than the two reactors were designed to handle. The damage was minimal and the NRC advised that further inspections should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> to mean that the plant was not safe. After a $21 million inspection, engineers stated that they only found cosmetic damage. On November 11, 2011, the NRC gave its approval for restarting the reactors.|$|E
