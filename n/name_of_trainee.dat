30|$|Ectopic pregnancies (EP) {{account for}} {{approximately}} 1 % of all pregnancies. Surgical management of such {{patients should be}} accomplished through the laparoscopic route. Presently, available data from national studies suggest that {{only a minority of}} women benefit from such an approach. Regional studies and single institution reports suggest that trainee involvement in these procedures vary widely. Competency in laparoscopic surgery for EP is a mandatory requirement for independent practice in the UK. In a recent survey <b>of</b> UK <b>trainees</b> <b>of</b> all grades in obstetrics and gynaecology, 53.4 % <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> reported that they were trained or being trained in such procedures. This study examines the perspectives <b>of</b> the <b>trainees.</b> We performed a national questionnaire survey of intermediate- and advanced-level trainees in the UK During a 12 -month period, 52 % <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> had performed at least one procedure independently; 80 % <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> performed most <b>of</b> the procedure on at least one occasion. The satisfaction with training was rated as 3 on a five-point Likert scale. Thirty percent <b>of</b> the <b>trainees</b> had access to a laparoscopy simulator. We found a high level <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> engagement with laparoscopic tubal surgery. The intensity of experience is likely inadequate to satisfy the learning curve. A holistic approach s required to ensure surgical competence.|$|R

The additional resources which school receive from {{being involved in}} teacher training offer {{them an opportunity to}} raise standards, but this has to be set against the possible losses due to school students being taught by inexperienced beginning teachers and the diversion of mentors’ efforts away from the classroom. Inspection evidence is used to assess whether trainee teachers affect school students’ test and examination results. The findings of this research are that the number <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> has no significant effect on school results at A-level or GCSE, or on the overall value-added between Key Stage 3 and GCSE level.

40|$|In Britain formal {{counsellor}} {{training is}} regarded as an essential pre-requisite for practice but {{its impact on the}} personal and professional development <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> remains largely unexplored in the research literature. A hierarchical nested research study design (N= 64) was used to investigate trainee characteristics and change processes across three BACP accredited counsellor training programmes. This study used quantitative and qualitative methods to conduct two related studies: ‘The Early Effects of Practitioner Training’ and ‘A Longitudinal Examination <b>of</b> <b>Trainee</b> Change’. The first was comprised of a cross sectional examination <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> characteristics (n= 63) and two qualitative studies: The Beginning of Training Study and a single subject Case Study of Margaret. The second consisted of one quantitative and two qualitative studies, these were: a paired sample investigation of the impact of training on one student cohort (n= 20), the End of Training Qualitative Study <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> (n= 7), and an Assimilation Model Analysis of Mandy. The research was conducted from a critical realist perspective. The majority <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> were white, female and middle aged but the experience of minority groups within cohorts was explored. Trainees had personal histories characterised by supportive relationships, loss, trauma, abuse and recovery. Practitioner training {{had a significant impact on}} personal and professional development but evidence of some negative effects, including Stressful Involvement, were found. Low levels of distress and increased emotional functioning were positively related to the completion of training. It is proposed that although the achievement of key competencies is the ultimate aim of practitioner counsellor training that it is the ability <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> to assimilate problematic experiences and integrate different kinds of knowledge that is likely to result in therapeutic expertise...|$|R

40|$|Although {{research}} {{has examined the}} psychological adaptation of practising clinical psychologists, little {{research has}} examined adaptation early in psychologists' careers, particularly during training. Clinical psychology training is a professionally highly formative period, which makes it an important time to assess adaptation and intervene appropriately. The current study sought to profile the psychological adaptation <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> clinical psychologists across training courses in the UK throughout the three years of clinical training. A sample <b>of</b> 167 <b>trainee</b> clinical psychologists {{who had participated in}} an earlier national study (Kuyken, et al., 1998) were followed up one year later. Taken as whole, the study suggested that the population <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> reported psychological adaptation in the normal range for employed adults, suggesting considerable resiliency in this population. However, over the three years of clinical psychology training, trainees reported significant increases in work adjustment problems, depression and interpersonal conflict, with the significant change being between year one and two of training. Consistent with earlier work (Kuyken et al., 1998), when sub-groups <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> were considered on a multi-dimensional profile of adaptation, a significant proportion <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> reported difficulties on one or more dimensions, which were enduring over time.

The study {{investigated}} the views <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> teachers {{about the role of}} mentors in their academic and professional development. The other purposes were to find out whether trainee teachers valued mentors’ assessment of teaching practice; mentors’ behaviours valued by trainee teachers; and why mentors are important in professional development. The study employed the descriptive survey method and questionnaire instrument. The population of the study was 439 third year trainee teachers who had Just completed a yearlong school attachment programme. A sample <b>of</b> 198 <b>trainee</b> teachers was chosen using preferred sampling. Research assistants who were lecturers at Seke Teachers’ College administered the questionnaire. This ensured a 100 % return of completed questionnaires. The study used EP 16 programme for data capturing and SPSS programme to produce frequency distribution runs. It was found out that trainee teachers viewed lecturers as better placed to help in their academic development than the mentors, and that trainee teachers viewed mentors as better placed to help in their professional development than lecturers. The study recommended further research to compare the views <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> teachers, mentors and lecturers about the role of mentors in the professional development <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> teachers...|$|R

40|$|For our purposes, machine {{perception}} {{is defined as}} the ability of a computer-based training system to sense the behavior and affective state (e. g. mood or emotions) <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> and interpret whether they are engaged, bored, frustrated, confused or even hostile during the training process. This paper puts forward the notion that the maturation of machine perception <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> affect is critically important to optimizing learning for individuals and teams in embedded virtual simulations and other isolated training environments. Embedded training applications within operational platforms (e. g. tanks, aircraft, ships and individual Warfighting systems) continue to be explored today in many NATO countries (e. g.

The lack of human tutors within operational platforms limits the understanding <b>of</b> each <b>trainee’s</b> affective state and the completeness <b>of</b> the <b>trainee</b> model, the representation <b>of</b> the <b>trainee’s</b> state within intelligent tutoring systems. Tutor technology is currently not sufficiently mature to provide accurate, portable, affordable, passive and effective sensing and interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>trainee’s</b> affective state and limits the adaptability and effectiveness of the instruction in today’s embedded training systems.

Objectives: The present study aims to analyze how self-concept influences the engagement <b>of</b> <b>trainees</b> attending the Training Courses for Petty Officers 1 st Class (CFS). Methodology: The study methodology made use of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (Schaufeli, Salanova, González-Romá & Bakker, 2002), the Assessment Scale for Trainee Engagement in the Portuguese Navy (Frade & Veiga, 2014; Frade, 2015), as well as the Assessment Scale for Trainee Self-concept in the Portuguese Navy (Frade & Veiga, in press; Frade, 2015). The sample was comprised <b>of</b> 149 <b>trainees</b> from the CFS of the Portuguese Navy. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS software.

40|$|This {{study is}} driven by two {{separate}} but interrelated issues. First, it {{is driven by}} the desire to explore the effectiveness of assistive technologies in the structure of professional development <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> teachers. Second, it seeks to explore the extent to which such technologies, as reflected in the use of digital recordings in the process <b>of</b> self-reflection by <b>trainee</b> teachers, can contribute to the promotion of a dialogic (Alexander, 2008) and cooperative (Edge 1992, 2002 and 2006) approaches in the use of feedback for the development <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> teachers with a focus on problem solving. The anchor for this exploration is the desire {{to move away from the}} teacher (educator) –centred role (Copland 2010) that is prevalent in the use of feedback in contemporary teacher training programmes. The study surveyed the views <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> teachers in two colleges through the use of a questionnaire and through a focus group discussion in consonance with the integrative approach to action research which acknowledges the importance of the voice of the third person (Coghlan and Brannick, 2010). The findings were subjected to both qualitative and quantitative analysis, the former through the use of the SPSS statistical analysis tool and the latter through an ethno-linguistic approach (Copland 2010). The study found that in the views <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> teachers (third person), the use of assistive technologies can significantly facilitate the promotion of the dialogic/cooperative approaches to giving and using feedback in the professional development <b>of</b> <b>trainee</b> teachers if certain conditions were met.
