50|$|In 1951 MAN {{presented}} a turbocharged version of their MK26 truck, {{although it was}} never put into mass production. Series production of turbocharged diesel trucks commenced in 1954, when both MAN 750TL1 and Volvo Titan Turbo {{were introduced to the}} markets. The building of the Interstate Highway System in the USA from 1956 made long-distance road transportation of goods more attractive. To keep up with general traffic, more powerful engines came in increasing demand. Cummins, Detroit, and CAT all had turbo-charging as an option by the late-1960s. In Europe, legislation was introduced in Germany mandating a minimum power-to-weight ratio for trucks; by the late 1960s, a 38-tonne consist had to have at least 304 hp. Most manufacturers met these requirement with large-displacement <b>natural</b> <b>aspiration</b> engines, some with the option of large-displacement or turbo-charging, while Scania and Volvo where among those that only provided turbocharged trucks that met the demands. Turbo-charging was not preferred initially as the engines were perceived to be less reliable, however the method won a decisive victory by the mid-1970s as the 1973 oil crisis increased fuel costs. The last market to see the absolute penetration of turbo diesels was Japan, where legislation on particle emissions effectively mandated <b>natural</b> <b>aspiration</b> engines until effective particle filters became available.|$|E

40|$|The term “poor respond (POR) patients” is {{used for}} the group of women who respond badly to usual doses of gonadotropins in in vitro {{fertilization}} (IVF) treatments; the consequence is low pregnancy rate. A consensus was reached on the minimal criteria needed to define POR. At least two of the following three features must be present: 1. advanced maternal age (40 years or more) 2. previous POR (3 or less oocytes with a conventional stimulation protocol) 3. abnormal ovarian reserve (AMH 0. 5 - 1. 1 ng/ml or AFC 5 - 7). The aim is to find better therapeutic options for these patients. Increased levels of day 3 follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E 2), as well as decreased levels of anti-Mьllerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC), can be used to assess ovarian reserve, as indirect predictive tests. A larger number of well designed, large scale, randomized, controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy of different management strategies for poor responders: flare up gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist protocols, modified long GnRH agonist mini-dose protocols, luteal initiation GnRH agonist stop protocol, pretreatment with estradiol - GnRH antagonist in luteal phase, <b>natural</b> cycle <b>aspiration</b> or <b>natural</b> cycle <b>aspiration</b> GnRH antagonist controlled, adjuvant therapy with growth hormone or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).

40|$|Citizens’ {{aspirations}} {{for the future}} are politically important; they are linked to welfare and whether citizens engage in forward-looking political and economic behavior. How do <b>natural</b> disasters affect <b>aspirations,</b> and can governments’ social protection policies successfully mitigate any damaging effects? If <b>natural</b> disasters threaten <b>aspirations,</b> there is strong policy interest in understanding these threats and what government can do to protect aspirations. This article uses Pakistan’s 2010 floods to identify {{the effects of a}} natural disaster on citizens’ aspirations. Aspirations were significantly reduced—especially among the poorest and most vulnerable. However, by exploiting exogenous variation in access to targeted government social protection, the authors show that social protection following natural disasters can significantly reduce their negative aspirational effects. This offers a new understanding of government social protection. It not only raises social welfare in the short term by restoring livelihoods and replacing damaged assets; it also has an enduring effect by raising citizens’ {{aspirations for}} the future. The authors show not only that the aspirations of citizens matter for citizens’ behaviors, but also that government policies can effectively protect and increase those aspirations.

For Austen, marriage and children were a girl's <b>natural</b> and best <b>aspiration.</b> She advocated sincere attachment, material prudence and circumspect delay in the choice of a marriage partner. If the appropriate conditions were met, then marriage should follow. Austen realized that women without independent means felt very great pressure to marry someone who could look after them, because otherwise they would be a burden on their families. The marriage market that she describes is quite detailed and well understood by all concerned. For example, as is explained in Mansfield Park, [...] "Miss Maria Ward, 'with only seven thousand pounds', had the good luck to captivate a baronet, 'her uncle, the lawyer, allowed her to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it'. To indulge in a marriage less lucrative than might have been expected was regarded as 'throwing oneself away', and someone like Mary Crawford, who prided herself on her realism, could not bring herself to do it." ...|$|R

He also introduced a crankshaft to link the engine with the gearing, eschewing the bicycle-style belt drive of previous cars; and he installed a clutch pedal and a gear stick, situated between the seats, to operate the gearbox, thus creating the first modern transmission. The siting of the engine on the front of the car rather than the rear provided far more room for passengers. The resultant configuration - unfortunately for Levassor - was soon called the systeme Panhard.|$|E

5000|$|The Catholic teaching, already {{outlined}} {{against the}} Pelagians by various councils and popes from the fifth century, is fully presented against the Reformers by the Council of Trent, especially Session V, Decree on Original Sin, and Session VI, Decree on Justification. In those two sessions, both anterior to Baius' writings, we find three statements which are obviously irreconcilable with Baius' three main positions described above: (1) Man's original justice is {{represented as a}} supernatural gift; (2) Original Sin is described not as a deep deterioration of our nature, but as the forfeiture of purely gratuitous privileges; (3) Justification is depicted as an interior renovation of the soul by inherent grace. The condemnation by Pius V of the 79 Baianist tenets {{is an act of}} the supreme magisterium of the Church, an ex cathedra pronouncement. To say, with the Baianists, that the papal act condemns not the real and concrete tenets of the Louvain professor, but only certain hypothetical or imaginary propositions; to claim that the censure is aimed not at the underlying teaching, but only at the vehemence or harshness of the outward expressions, is to practically stultify the pontifical document. From the tenor of the Bull, [...] "Ex Omnibus", we know that to each of the 79 propositions one or several or all of the following censures will apply: hæretica, erronea, suspecta, temeraria, scandalosa, in pias aures offendens. For a more precise determination of the Catholic doctrine, we have to consult, besides the Council of Trent, the consensus Catholicorum theologorum. That consensus was voiced with no uncertainty by such universities as Paris, Salamanca, Alcalá and Louvain itself, and by such theologians as Cunerus Petri (d. 1580-"De gratiâ", Cologne, 1583); Suarez (d. 1617-"De gratiâ Dei" [...] in Op. Omn., VII, Paris, 1857); Robert Bellarmine (d. 1623-"De gratiâ et libero arbitrio", in Controversiæ, IV, Milan, 1621); Juan Martínez de Ripalda (d. 1648-"Adversus Baium et Baianos", Paris, 1872); Stayaert (d. 1701-"In propositiones damnatas assertiones", Louvain, 1753); Honoré Tournély (d. 1729-"De Gratiâ Christi", Paris, 1726); Casini (d. 1755-"Quid est homo?" [...] ed. Scheeben, Mainz, 1862). It should not, however, be omitted here that, even apart from Jansenism, which is a direct offshoot of Baianism, some traces of Baius' ideas about the natural and the supernatural {{are to be found in}} the history of theology. The Augustinian School, represented by such men as Henry Noris, Fulgentius Bellelli and Giovanni Lorenzo Berti, adopted, though with qualifications, the idea of man's <b>natural</b> <b>aspiration</b> to the possession of God and beatific vision in Heaven. The standard work of that school, [...] "Vindiciæ Augustinianæ", was even once denounced to the Holy See, but no censure ensued. Later Benedict Stattler, Georg Hermes, Anton Günther, J. B. Hirscher and Johannes von Kuhn evolved a notion of the supernatural which is akin to that of Baius. While admitting relatively supernatural gifts, they denied that the partaking of Divine nature and the adoption to eternal life differ essentially from our natural moral life. That theory was opposed by Kleutgen and seems now to have died out. The new French theory of [...] "immanence", according to which man postulates the supernatural, may also have some kinship with Baianism, but it can only be mentioned here as it is yet the centre of controversy. Matulewicz, [...] "Doctrina Russorum de Statu iustitiæ originalis" [...] (Cracow, 1903), says that modern Russian theology embodies in great measure the views of Baius.|$|E
40|$|With the re-proclaimed {{independence}} of Kosova on 17 February 2008 {{and with the}} foundation (establishment) of Kosova’s state among the public opinion began to circulate the idea that “since Kosova became a state, now we can also find the “Kosova nation”, because every state should have his own nationality, different (divers) by other national-states. The {{aim of this study}} is to argue that the idea of the Kosova state has not born with the purpose to create the new national identity of Kosova’s people (so the Kosovo nation) because the Albanian national identity of Kosova has been solid, established and determined. Besides the political unit not necessarily imposes the changing the national identity of the people (even if in the occupation circumstances). In fact, the efforts of Kosova people for liberation, independence and state building had the aim to protect guarantee and cultivate their determined and formed Albanian national identity which was being violated by Serbia. The paper will explain the idea that the “Kosova identity” as the “new national identity of Kosova” is more an artificial construction that ignores the historical and political conditions on the road of Albanian of Kosova for independence, than a real <b>natural</b> identity <b>aspiration</b> of Kosova’s people. Moreover, this idea is in contradict with the theoretical principles of modern nation building in general. At the end, will be concluded that Kosova state was projected from elites and the people of Kosova as a second Albanian state, temporarily unable for the union with the (natural Albanian state), Albania, so the “Kosova’s identity” is only an Albanian sub-identity with distinguished characteristics, but this is normal for all the modern national identities. As an actual obstacle of natural compliance of the Albanian identity with the state of Kosova are the “Ahtisaar principles” of the actual Republic (the republic of 17 February); which the political elites of Kosova after 2007 accepted as a compromise for the “recognition” of Kosova independence from the Security Council of UN (even after this compromise the council does not recognize Kosova’s independence) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For Élie Bertrand (1713 – 1797) and his like-minded contemporaries, God’s {{design and}} {{providence}} {{set the stage}} for understanding the workings of the Earth. Bertrand used various methods, including field observations, to accumulate considerable geological knowledge, which he published in his Dictionnaire universel des fossiles (1763) and Recueil de divers traités sur l’histoire naturelle (1766). By examining Bertrand’s life and writings, we may come to appreciate the strengths and shortcomings of his visions of the natural world. His focus on collecting, catalo-guing, and classifying natural objects and phenomena fitted the classic concept of natural history in his era. On the basis of his observations, he dared to systematize and theorize. His work provides a window on his time and on attempts of natural theologians then to understand the products and operation of the world. Once a counsellor to the King of Poland, a correspondent of Voltaire, and a contributor to the Encyclopédie, Bertrand’s name has largely vanished from view.

40|$|Present work {{represents}} a detailed reflection {{on what has}} to be exactly meant by “parental obligations”, such as regulated in Article 147 of the Civil Code, "Duties toward children", that, taking the provisions of Article 30 of the Constitution, affirm the obligation for parents to "maintain and educate their offspring, taking into account the capabilities, <b>natural</b> inclinations and <b>aspirations</b> of children”. More than addressing the issues of instruction and material maintenance, for which any deficiencies are easier to ascertain, the focus is strictly pointed on educational aspects. Given the complexity of the concept of "parenting" and the subjectivity of the individual resources and needs that characterize each child, it is difficult to assess or measure from the outside if the parenting duties have met the above parameters. The literature does not provide useful elements for the purpose: rather than focus attention on the concepts of "diligence, prudence and skill" in performing the duties parenting, it is mainly occupied to analyze any form of real “abuse of power” or serious and objective shortcomings of parents towards their children, which fall in the categories of "psychological abuse" or "negligence". After examining the parental role in its multiple legal, social and emotional aspects, drawing from the psychological and pedagogical knowledge, the work shows that it is impossible and even dangerous to identify minimum standards relevant to the assessment of a "correct" performance of parental duties, which should form the basis for the evaluation of the negligent default in this field...|$|R

The Dervishes threatened Kassala as soon as the news of Adowa reached them, and indeed there were signs of increased activity in Omdurman itself. In these circumstances the British Government determined to assist Italy by making a demonstration on the Wady Halfa frontier. They turned to Egypt. It had always been recognised that the recovery of the lost provinces was a <b>natural</b> and legitimate <b>aspiration.</b> 'The doubtful point was to decide the time when the military and financial resources of the country were sufficiently developed to justify an assumption of the offensive.' [LORD CROMER'S REPORTS: EGYPT, No. 2, 1896.] From a purely Egyptian point of view the best possible moment had not yet arrived. A few more years of recuperation were needed. The country would fight the Soudan campaigns more easily if first refreshed by the great reservoirs which were projected. For more than two years both projects had been pressed upon the Government of his Highness the Khedive--or, to write definitely, upon Lord Cromer.

40|$|Journal articleCitizens’ {{aspirations}} {{are increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} important dimension of their well-being. Those with high aspirations set ambitious goals for themselves, and those with low aspirations may fall prey to a poverty trap. Do natural disasters negatively impact aspirations? If so, can governments blunt these effects? We consider Pakistan’s devastating 2010 floods—and the government’s uneven relief efforts—to analyze these questions. We first show that the extreme rainfall generating this disaster significantly reduced aspirations, even when current levels of household expenditure, wealth, and education are taken into account. Individuals experiencing 2010 monsoon season rainfall that was one standard deviation higher than average had aspiration levels 1. 5 years later that were 0. 15 standard deviations {{lower than those of}} similar individuals experiencing just average levels of rainfall. This is the same negative shock to aspirations that one would experience {{as a result of a}} 50 % reduction in household expenditures. Moreover, the negative effect of <b>natural</b> disasters on <b>aspirations</b> is especially strong among the poor, and among those who are most vulnerable to weather shocks. However, exploiting exogenous variation in flood relief access, we show that government social protection can attenuate these negative impacts. Individuals in villages that received Citizens Damage Compensation (Watan Card) Program flood relief—providing cash equivalent to 9. 4 % of annual household expenditures in each of the three years following the disaster—saw significantly lower declines in aspirations than did those in similarly affected villages without this relief. This offers a new understanding of social protection; it not only restores livelihoods and replaces damaged assets, but also has an enduring effect by easing mental burdens, and thus raising aspirations for the future. The negative effects of natural disasters and the efficacy of government relief programs may thus be underestimated if aspirations are ignored.

6000|$|In {{the end you}} {{are forced}} to ask the {{question}} you should have asked at the beginning. What do you give a man an income for? Obviously to keep him alive. Since it is evident that the first condition on which he can be kept alive without enslaving somebody else is that he shall produce an equivalent for what it costs to keep him alive, we may quite rationally compel him to abstain from idling by whatever means we employ to compel him to abstain from murder, arson, forgery, or any other crime. The one supremely foolish thing to do with him is to do nothing; that is, to be as idle, lazy, and heartless in dealing with him as he is in dealing with us. Even if we provided work for him instead of basing, as we do, our whole industrial system on successive competitive waves of overwork with their ensuing troughs of unemployment, we should still sternly deny him the alternative of not doing it; for the result must be that he will become poor and make his children poor if he has any; and poor people are cancers in the commonwealth, costing far more than if they were handsomely pensioned off as incurables. Jesus had more sense than to propose anything of the sort. He said to his disciples, in effect, [...] "Do your work for love; and let the other people lodge and feed and clothe you for love." [...] Or, as we should put it nowadays, [...] "for nothing." [...] All human experience and all <b>natural</b> uncommercialized human <b>aspiration</b> point to this as the right path. The Greeks said, [...] "First secure an independent income; and then practise virtue." [...] We all strive towards an independent income. We all know as well as Jesus did that if we have to take thought for the morrow as to whether there shall be anything to eat or drink it will be impossible for us to think of nobler things, or live a higher life than that of a mole, whose life is from beginning to end a frenzied pursuit of food. Until the community is organized {{in such a way that}} the fear of bodily want is forgotten as completely as the fear of wolves already is in civilized capitals, we shall never have a decent social life. Indeed the whole attraction of our present arrangements lies in the fact that they do relieve a handful of us from this fear; but as the relief is effected stupidly and wickedly by making the favored handful parasitic on the rest, they are smitten with the degeneracy which seems to be the inevitable biological penalty of complete parasitism, and corrupt culture and statecraft instead of contributing to them, their excessive leisure being as mischievous as the excessive toil of the laborers. Anyhow, the moral is clear. The two main problems of organized society, how to secure the subsistence of all its members, and how to prevent the theft of that subsistence by idlers, should be entirely dissociated; and the practical failure of one of them to automatically achieve the other recognized and acted on. We may not all have Jesus's psychological power of seeing, without any enlightenment from more modern economic phenomena, that they must fail; but we have the hard fact before us that they do fail. The only people who cling to the lazy delusion that it is possible to find a just distribution that will work automatically are those who postulate some revolutionary change like land nationalization, which by itself would obviously only force into greater urgency the problem of how to distribute the product of the land among all the individuals in the community.|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to analyze}} the human aging healthy {{point of view of}} health, {{allowing}} to inform the professional a more critical and stimulating discussion regarding the subject mentioned. Methodology: this descriptive and exploratory study conducted through literature integrative review, taking as the database LILACS for articles in the period between the months of August and September 2009. Results: the findings showed that one of the strategies to leverage the gains of the aging process would be to search for a healthy life, thanks to a series of activities encouraged in order to promote health by preventing or delaying the installation of chronic conditions, slowing functional decline, encouraging their autonomy and independence. Thus, it preserved the cognitive aspect of social integration and enhancement of interpersonal relationships and affective. Conclusion: the aging of a population is a <b>natural</b> <b>aspiration</b> of any society. But by it self, is not enough. It is also important aim is {{to improve the quality of}} life of those who have aged or are in the process of aging, regardless of their social, cultural and biological. Thus, it is necessary that public policy be directed and implemented specifically for this age group aimed at promoting health perspective of healthy aging...|$|E
40|$|Aspiration in an axial {{compressor}} is normally regarded as sucking out the low momentum boundary layer from blade suction surface, thus lowering {{the chances of}} flow separation and consequently that of stall under off-design operation. However, the suction mass flow does not take part in useful work and leads to loss of engine power output. This paper deals with a new concept of <b>natural</b> <b>aspiration</b> to energize blade suction surface boundary layer by injecting some fluid from pressure to suction side through a part span slot on the blade. The energized boundary layer has lesser tendency to separate, thus enhancing stall margin. Numerical simulations were carried out to study the effect of aspiration slot location and geometry on the performance and stall margin of a transonic {{axial compressor}} rotor. The computational results without aspiration slot were in fair agreement with the published experimental data. The modified rotor, with part span aspiration, showed ~ 3. 2 % improvement in stall margin at design rotational speed. The pressure ratio and efficiency of the aspirated rotor dropped by ~ 1. 42 % and ~ 2. 0 %, respectively, whereas the structural analysis did not indicate any adverse effect on the blade stress distribution {{in the presence of}} aspiration slot...|$|E
40|$|European {{integration}} {{is not just}} a goal of the foreign policy of the Republic of Moldova, but also a <b>natural</b> <b>aspiration</b> of an European nation to join the European family and the signing of the Association Agreement between Moldova and the European Union is an important step in achieving this goal. The Republic of Moldova has developed and continues to promote rigorous reforms in the area of public finance management. In this article we have analyzed the main reforms and achievements in the field of public finance management in the Republic of Moldova, their importance by reference to good European practices, but also the need to continue them in the context of signing the Association Agreement. The authors argue that until now, the public finance management reform had been focused mainly on the planning and execution phases of National Public Budget, nonetheless the main problems lay in poor budgetary reporting and control. Corruption and fraud are the main risk areas for all the promoted reforms. The conclusion of this paper is that the most urgent actions that should be undertaken consist in improving public procurement procedures, enhancing the internal control, financial inspection and external audit. Only in such a way trustful relation with EU could be created and this is particularly important as it could permit to absorb more European funds to invest in the economic and social development in our country...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} the conservation {{economy in the}} Monsoonal North of Australia. It first describes the drivers behind {{the development of a}} conservation economy in the region and why this is important. It then takes a step back to describe what a conservation economy is, and provides simple explanations for the concepts and terms that populate the literature. It identifies how investments are prioritised and where priority areas for conservation management are located in the Monsoonal North. Finally, it provides a compendium of conservation economy opportunities operating in the region, and examines prospects for future development. The conservation economy has largely been driven by community concern over the deteriorating condition of our land, seas, water and atmosphere; by consumer demand for ethically and sustainably-produced products; and Indigenous people's desire to derive income from their traditional lands. The conservation economy literature provides a framework for assessing the value of conservation management and who should bear the cost of this management. Its basic principles include recognition of the dependence of humans on ecosystem services and the valuation of managing those services. There is the expectation that production systems should be managed sustainably, and where it is profitable to do so, the producer should bear the cost of adopting sustainable management. Payment can be expected for conservation management that is beyond reasonable expectations, and provides public rather than private benefit. Conservation economy priorities are driven by international conventions covering biodiversity conservation and social justice. As a signatory to these conventions, the Australia Governments has accepted obligations to list and protect threatened species and World Heritage sites; operate a protected area estate; mitigate climate change; adhere to sustainable development goals and alleviate poverty among Indigenous people in Australia and the third world. Non-government organisations (NGOs) also largely subscribe to these aims. The Monsoonal North has extensive tracts of intact landscapes that are largely in good condition. It scores well in conservation prioritisation schemes based on these natural values, but poorly in schemes prioritising habitat fragmentation, land degradation and threatened species. Priority areas for biodiversity conservation largely coincide with areas of Indigenous held land, so are attractive areas for conservation investment that incorporates social justice goals. External investment in the conservation economy in the Monsoonal North comes from governments, NGOs and the voluntary efforts of property owners and managers. Most funding comes from the Australian Government, either through grants programs or fee-for-service arrangements. This funding has declined over the last decade, and disproportionately so in the Monsoonal North. This has left a sizeable dint in the region's conservation economy. However, funding for Indigenous cultural and natural resource management has been largely maintained, because Indigenous economic development continues to be a high national priority. The Australian Government has also established the Emission Reduction Fund as a marketplace to purchase emission reductions from land and agricultural management, and is considering a national marketplace for water. The Queensland and Western Australian governments also subsidise conservation management through grant programs and conservation covenants, though this funding has also declined in recent years. In the Northern Territory, conservation agreements are brokered by the Natural Resource Management (NRM) body. Most NRM groups in the north also run devolved grants schemes, though these are funded by the Australian Government's National Landcare Programme. Governments also regulate for adherence to duty-of-care principles in the management of weeds, pest animals, vegetation management and water quality management; and provide extension program and structural adjustment loans to support adoption of sustainable practices. NGOs are increasing their presence in northern Australia, particularly working in partnership with Indigenous communities to support their cultural and <b>natural</b> resource management <b>aspirations.</b> Indigenous communities are active participants in the conservation economy. Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) now constitute one-third of Australia's National Reserve System. Indigenous rangers are employed to undertake cultural and natural resource management, including protection of cultural heritage; transfer of Traditional Knowledge; weed, fire and feral animal management; and biodiversity monitoring and management. Fee-for-service arrangements operate for biosecurity surveillance, collection of marine debris and emission abatement. The pastoral industry can also benefit from the conservation economy. However, other than entering into agreements to reserve parts of their land for biodiversity conservation and reducing methane emissions from cattle, this is unlikely to be in the form of external payments. Rather, adopting recognised best practice herd management will not only reduce emissions and improve land condition by decreasing grazing pressure, it will also increase profitability. Voluntary uptake of such practices is also likely to circumvent increased government regulation of the industry. Because such practices are profitable, they are unlikely to attract stewardship payments. However, assistance through the necessary transition can be provided through extension programs and structural adjustment loans. In summary, the principal prospects in the conservation economy in the Monsoonal North are: • Greenhouse gas abatement activities • Indigenous Land and Sea Management supported by governments and NGOs • Protection of high priority biodiversity on private or leasehold land funded through development offsets, and through government-funded programs • Taking advantage of the inherent financial benefits of herd management to improve animal performance and land condition. Hence, the conservation economy is operating in northern Australia and is likely to grow, but it is also subject to variation with shifting government policy and consequent market opportunities. Growth is most likely to be driven by the international priorities of conservation of listed threatened species, protection of World Heritage values, establishment of a protected area estate and alleviation of poverty among Indigenous people and in the third world, adherence to sustainable development goals and mitigation of climate change. These priorities are likely to inform future investments by governments, NGOs and private donors...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: DNA-based {{microbiological}} {{studies are}} moving beyond studying healthy human microbiota to investigate diverse infectious diseases, including chronic respiratory infections {{such as those}} in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis (BE). The species identified in the respiratory secretion microbiota from such patients can be classified into those that are common and abundant among similar subjects (core) versus those that are infrequent and rare (satellite). This categorization provides a vital foundation for investigating disease pathogenesis and improving therapy. However, whether the core microbiota of people with different respiratory diseases, which are traditionally associated with specific culturable pathogens, are unique or shared with other chronic infections of the lower airways is not well studied. Little is also known about how these chronic infection microbiota change from childhood into adulthood. Objectives: We sought to compare the core microbiota in respiratory specimens from children and adults with different chronic lung infections. Methods: We used bacterial 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and ecological statistical tools to compare the core microbiota in respiratory samples from three cohorts of symptomatic children with clinically distinct airway diseases (protracted bacterial bronchitis, BE, CF), and four healthy children. We then compared the core pediatric respiratory microbiota with those in samples from adults with BE and CF. Measurements and Main Results: All three pediatric disease cohorts shared strikingly similar core respiratory microbiota that differed from adult CF and BE microbiota. The most common species in pediatric disease cohort samples were also detected in those from healthy children. The adult CF and BE microbiota also differed from each other, suggesting common early infection airway microbiota that diverge by adulthood. The shared core pediatric microbiota included both traditional pathogens and many species not routinely identified by standard culture. Conclusions: Our results indicate that these clinically distinct chronic airway infections share common early core microbiota, which are likely shaped by <b>natural</b> <b>aspiration</b> and impaired clearance of the same airway microbes, but that disease-specific characteristics select for divergent microbiota by adulthood. Longitudinal and interventional studies will be required to define the relationships between microbiota, treatments, and disease progression. ...|$|E
40|$|The Supreme Court of Canada {{ruling in}} the case of Carter versus Canada (2015 SCC 5) {{concerns}} the right of a competent adult to a physician-assisted death if his or her suffering from a grievous and irremediable medical condition is intolerable. Discussions of the ruling have extended the parameters to include competent minors and advanced directives. They may also have altered the way we look at a separate but related end-of-life scenario, withdrawal of life-support; the number of anesthetic agents used to cover a patient during the withdrawal of life-support appear to have increased recently. How is it that all our legal and religious traditions imply that an abhorrence of terminating life is built into civilization, and yet a group of empathetic citizens believe that it may have a role in caring for the seriously ill? Can the decision to end the life of a patient be made impartially?The clinical situation described in the ruling is rare in the spectrum of end-of-life scenarios. The vast majority of patients {{will not be able to}} communicate their consent to termination. Most of us chose our life’s companion to be the person who will make our critical decisions when we are incapable. Even though we might hope to guide them by making our wishes known in advance, all decisions are made in their own moment, and upon these delegates we impose the full responsibility of deciding. While most patients prefer their next-of-kin to be their substitute decision maker, lawyers recommend a third party who will not benefit financially or otherwise by the patient’s death. Having a State or hospital committee decide is not acceptable because of past errors made with respect to forced sterilization or memories of Nazi euthanasia programs. However, even an acceptable third party may not be able to remain impartial. Two doctors would probably be required to determine medical issues in end-of-life protocols. The duplication is an acknowledgement of the subjective nature of such issues and of the risk of conflicts of interest. The strategy of using 2 doctors’ opinions originated in France to allow autopsies within 24 hours of death and was later applied to committing patients for psychiatric treatment and to the declaration of brain death for transplantation. 1 Should the patient’s own doctor be 1 of the 2 ? While a doctor’s opinion is unlikely to be influenced by the loss or gain of fees, doctors may share with the patients’ representatives a different conflict of interest: the risk of caregiver fatigue. It is well known that the neural networks stimulated by fear and pain are also activated by observing, or even imagining, the events that cause the fear or the pain. Caregivers suffer with those for whom they care. Loved ones who vicariously experience pain and suffering in ultimately futile care have difficulty coping. Wanting to prevent it from happening again is a <b>natural</b> <b>aspiration.</b> Surgeons try to learn from the experience in order to make the care easier on future patients and to make the outcomes more successful. For others, termination of that phase of life might be considered a better option to prevent futile suffering. There are some diseases, such as advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where the prospect of progress appears remote, reinforcing the urge to end the hopeless phase “with dignity. ”The stress of care and prolonged exposure to suffering affect family and professional caregivers. Different forms of caregiver fatigue are known, but poorly defined. The ALS Society of Canada believes compassion fatigue occurs when caregivers begin to feel the pain and suffering of the patient so that they lose a sense of themselves and their role in the patient’s care. 2 Sixteen symptoms are listed. Some of these symptoms are similar to those of people with depression, such as difficulty concentrating or sleeping; others are similar to those of people with addiction, such as obsession or difficulties at work. Irritability and difficulty making decisions are hallmarks of compassion fatigue. Caregiver fatigue may be worsened by the roller coaster of life-saving procedures followed by complications and the inevitable hurdles before recovery. Most surgeons have watched families go from wanting everything done to despair regarding any treatment and then back again — all within hours or days. Surgeons who have invested a lot of effort trying to save a patient risk the same emotional confusion. To build resilience to caregiver fatigue, surgeons need to recognize warning signs and seek a colleague’s support in the patient’s care. The modern trend to rotating team care inhibits the guidance a surgeon can offer families. All of this may result in a premature decision to withdraw life support. It also prevents an impartial decision to terminate life. The empathy that professional and family caregivers have for seriously ill patients is hard-wired into our brains. The same neural networks are stimulated in third parties reviewing evidence of a patient’s suffering. This neurologic mechanism makes us want to end suffering, even if it means terminating life. However, it is the same mechanism that prevents us from making the truly impartial decision necessary to terminate life. An innate understanding of this dilemma is the basis for our customary prohibition on terminating life. It is a dilemma that we may never be able to solve...|$|E
