5|$|In 1991, Sid Meier {{released}} Civilization and popularized {{the level}} of detail {{that has become a}} staple of the genre. Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> between the Civilization computer game and board game is the importance of diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's Civilization was also influenced by personal computer games such as the city management game SimCity and the wargame Empire. Civilization became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come.|$|E
25|$|A <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> between Colorado Springs and {{its sister}} cities are their {{geographic}} positions: {{three of the}} seven cities are also located near {{the base of a}} major mountain or mountain range.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the Neolithic Period is marked by the ceramics of the Narva culture, and appear in Estonia at the {{beginning of}} the 5th millennium. The oldest finds date from around 4900 BC. The first pottery was made of thick clay mixed with pebbles, shells or plants. The Narva-type ceramics are found throughout almost the entire Estonian coastal region and on the islands. The stone and bone tools of the era have a <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> with the artifacts of the Kunda culture.|$|E

50|$|Rick Brant never {{graduated}} {{to any other}} medium of entertainment, although there are <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> {{to be found in}} the Jonny Quest franchise.|$|R
2500|$|Located on {{the corner}} of Market and 17th Streets, One Liberty Place is 61 stories tall. At , it is the second tallest {{building}} in Philadelphia. One Liberty Place contains [...] with an average floor size of [...] Helmut Jahn is an admirer of American eclecticism and Art Deco and when designing Liberty Place he used New York City's Chrysler Building as a reference. Rouse said that he calls it the [...] "Son of Chrysler" [...] because of the similarity in design. The most <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> to the Chrysler Building is the [...] tall spire that crowns the skyscraper. One Liberty Place's spire is made up of four gabled setbacks leading up to a 2-ton, [...] long steel spire on top. Instead of curved setbacks like on the Chrysler Building, One Liberty Place's setbacks use straight angular edges.|$|E
6000|$|In these {{depressed}} regions {{the comparatively}} salubrious climates of the uplands become {{dangerous to the}} European; the people also are degraded, mostly pirates and water-thieves, as the Nigerian Ibos, the Congoese Musulungus, and the Landim (Amalandi) Kafirs about the lower Zambeze. There is a <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> in their productions, partly known to Pliny (v. 8), who notices [...] "the calamus, the papyrus, and the animals" [...] of the Nigris and the Nile. The black-maned lion and the leopard rule the wold; the gorilla, the chimpanzee, and other troglodytes affect the thinner forests; the giraffe, the zebra, and vast hosts of antelopes scour the plains; the turtle swims the seas; and the hippopotamus, the crocodile, and various siluridae, some of gigantic size, haunt the lakes and rivers. The nymphæa, lotus or water-lily, forms rafts of verdure; and the stream-banks bear the calabash, the palmyra, the oil-palm, and the papyrus. Until late years it was supposed that the water-lily, sacred to Isis, had been introduced into Egypt from India, where {{it is also a}} venerated vegetable, and that it had died out with the form of Fetishism which fostered it. It has simply disappeared like the crocodile from the Lower Nile. Finally, to conclude this rapidly outlined sketch, all at the present moment happily share the same fate; they are being robbed of their last mysteries; the veil of Isis is fast yielding to the white man's grasp.|$|E

50|$|The more {{recently}} promulgated Quan Yin Method of meditation espoused via the spiritual teachings of Supreme Master Ching Hai has <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> to Surat Shabd Yoga.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are some}} <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> in {{equations}} for momentum, energy, and mass transfer which {{can all be}} transported by diffusion, {{as illustrated by the}} following examples: ...|$|R
50|$|The song {{has some}} <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> in musical phrasing to Daniel Bedingfield's 2003 single Never Gonna Leave Your Side, and both videos were shot in Spain with horses {{featuring}} prominently.|$|R
50|$|Amanita solitaria is {{a closely}} related species, though a {{completely}} different European taxa. The <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> is that both it and A. cokeri are double-ringed. A. timida, from the tropical South Asia, resembles A. cokeri in its volval structure, thick and notable ring and the large bulbal base.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{possibly}} related to Sergeant Doppelpunkt (German for [...] "colon", {{as in the}} punctuation mark), {{one half of the}} town watch in Bad Blintz, Überwald, seen in The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents. Other Discworld characters with a <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> to Colon include a member of the guard in the Überwald town of Bonk (who was nicknamed [...] "Colonesque" [...] by Samuel Vimes) and one of the market guards in Al Khali, Klatch. Like the various Dibblers, {{this may be due to}} morphic resonance.|$|E
5000|$|In Pliny's {{account in}} Book IV of his Naturalis Historia {{there is a}} <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> between the two tribe names, Frisiavones, {{mentioned}} twice, and the Frisii. This {{could be due to}} coincidence, to tribal relationship, or to a similar etymology. This raises questions about the Frisians being the only people with this type of name, and in turn also raising {{the question of whether the}} ancient Frisii can equated to the traditional inhabitants of modern Frisia. So far all knowledge on this issue is based on deduction.|$|E
5000|$|The game's protagonist is a witch called Ripple {{flying on}} a broomstick, {{along with two}} {{anthropomorphic}} stars which serve as Gradius-style options. The game has many <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> to Cotton, released for the console by Success the very same year.|$|R
50|$|The Quan Yin Method of {{meditation}} promoted though the spiritual teachings of Supreme Master Ching Hai also has <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> to Sant Mat. The religious movement Eckankar {{is considered by}} some to be an offshoot of the Sant Mat tradition. Paul Twitchell, who founded Eckankar, was an initiate of Sant Kirpal Singh.|$|R
50|$|Most of Goode's art {{is created}} as a vitrine, or display case, with {{three-dimensional}} artwork inside. Similar to Joseph Cornell, his work incorporates many aspects of assemblage. Goode's work also has <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> to Damien Hirst and Jeff Vaughan, especially his tendency to represent elements {{of the natural world}} in his mixed-media installations.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, Sid Meier {{released}} Civilization and popularized {{the level}} of detail {{that has become a}} staple of the genre. Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> between the Civilization computer game and board game is the importance of diplomacy and technological advancement.

5000|$|The {{planetary}} {{system in the}} book included a gas giant planet named Megas in a very short-period orbit about its primary star. (Erythro is a moon of Megas.) This was a radical idea in 1989, but was vindicated {{with the discovery of}} the first extrasolar planet orbiting a sun-like star (51 Pegasi) in 1995, dubbed [...] "Bellerophon". Furthermore, the first speculated [...] "habitable" [...] planet discovered, Gliese 581c, orbits a red dwarf star (Gliese 581) located only 20.3 light years from Earth—a <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> to the novel wherein Erythro is the first inhabited extra-solar body.|$|E
5000|$|Amongst the Finno-Permic {{speakers}} {{there was}} a <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> between their sky gods, including Ukko of Finnish mythology, [...] "Jumal" [...] or [...] "Taevataat" [...] (Sky Grandfather) in Estonian mythology, and [...] "Jumo" [...] in Mari mythology. The Mari language word [...] "Jumo" [...] and Baltic-Finnic words [...] "Jumal" [...] and [...] "Jumala" [...] are also etymologically related. Another possible similarity between the sky gods is that Finnish Ilmarinen, a mythical smith-hero, might originally be a sky god, distantly related to Udmurtian Inmar. There is also a notable relation between the sky gods of the speakers of Finno-Permic, Scandinavian, Slavic and Baltic languages.|$|E
5000|$|Irrigmann is {{typically}} {{understood as a}} proto-Impressionist due to <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> with other later Impressionist poets and authors, including Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud of France. [...] Although Irrigmann's work significantly predates what is now considered Impressionism as an artistic movement, he {{can be seen as}} exploring the foundations of central Impressionistic features.|$|R
50|$|Lezgins are {{believed}} to descend partly from people who inhabited the region of southern Dagestan in the Bronze Age. However, there is some DNA evidence of significant admixture during the last 4,000 years with a Central Asian population, as shown by genetic links to populations throughout Europe and Asia, with <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> to the Burusho people of Pakistan.|$|R
50|$|St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Richmond, Virginia, {{designed}} by Stewart several years later, is {{largely based on}} his designs for St. Luke's Church. <b>Notable</b> <b>similarities</b> include {{the design of the}} envelope of the church, interior organization, ventilation system, and decorative elements. In St. Paul's, one can see what St. Luke's might have looked like had the steeple been built.|$|R
5000|$|Critics also {{compared}} [...] "Heartbeat Song" [...] to Jimmy Eat Worlds single [...] "The Middle" [...] (2001) {{due to a}} <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> {{between the}} melodies of the songs verses, {{as well as their}} choruses. In his review for Idolator, Stern observed both songs similitude. Hunter Hauk of The Dallas Morning News also remarked of the two songs similarities, but was ambivalent of [...] "Heartbeat Song"s lack of innovation as compared to Clarksons previous lead singles. Digital Spy rated this song with 2 stars out of 5 and concluded by describing it: [...] "ruthless in its pursuit of earworm status, and like it or not itll find itself lodged in the inner vestibules of your brain.|$|E
50|$|Wood carving {{workshops}} {{were still}} {{active in the}} 12th century {{in the western part}} of the region in the high valleys of the Pyrenees in Catalonia. There are over thirty examples of these large crucifixes, called majestats. The Batlló Majesty has been linked to the region of Olot near Girona. As with much medieval art, its creator is unknown, although a medieval legend credits Nicodemus with producing the sculpture soon after the actual Crucifixion, a pious tradition repeated elsewhere in Europe in connection with similar monumental crosses, like the better known Volto Santo in the church of San Martino, Lucca, to which they bear a <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> in appearance and date, these Catalan crucifixes were believed to have miraculous powers.|$|E
5000|$|Genetic {{roots of}} the hedonic set point are also disputed. Sosis (2014) has argued the [...] "hedonic treadmill" [...] {{interpretation}} of twin studies depends on dubious assumptions. Pairs of identical twins raised apart aren't necessarily raised in substantially different environments. The similarities between twins (such as intelligence or beauty, say, {{there are too many}} to count) may invoke similar reactions from the environment. Thus, we might see a <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> in happiness levels between twins even though there aren't happiness genes governing affect levels directly, they're governing other things, things which make the subjects happiness levels similar (such as intelligence or beauty). In other words, subjects in these studies might experience similar happiness levels even though genetics are not governing these happiness levels directly.|$|E
5000|$|N. gargensis neighbors [...] Nitrosopumilus maritimus and Nitrososphaera viennensis on the phylogenetic tree. [...] Like Nitrososphaera gargensis, both {{of these}} organisms are chemolithoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizers that thrive in hot and humid habitats. Spang et al. elucidated, in 2012, the <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> between N. gargensis and N. viennensis through their {{nitrification}} ability and PHA (putatively polyhydroxybutyrate) production along with other elements.|$|R
50|$|Sidewize is a 2D {{horizontal}} scrolling shooter with <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> to the Capcom arcade game Side Arms. The player controls the warrior Dynar his lone attack against waves of Mutants {{on the four}} worlds of the Xeolom Alliance. Dynar is equipped with an armored suit with jetpack {{and an array of}} weapons. Power-ups may be collected for improved mobility, weapons and firepower.|$|R
50|$|Life of an American Fireman is a short, silent film Edwin S. Porter {{made for}} the Edison Manufacturing Company. It was shot late in 1902 and {{distributed}} early in 1903. One of the earliest American narrative films, it depicts the rescue of a woman and child from a burning building. It bears <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> to the 1901 English short film Fire!, directed by James Williamson.|$|R
5000|$|He is {{possibly}} related to Corporal Knopf, (as Knopf {{can be translated}} as knob), {{one half of the}} town watch in Bad Blintz, Überwald, seen in The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents. Other Discworld characters with a <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> to Nobby include a member of the guard in the Überwald town of Bonk, who was nicknamed [...] "Nobbski" [...] by Vimes, and one of the market guards in Al Khali, Klatch. Like the various Dibblers, {{this may be due to}} morphic resonance. Despite this, being related to Nobby is not seen as a good thing in Ankh Morpork. One of the Unseen University bedlows who, by sheer coincidence, shared the same last name as Nobby was incredibly swift to denounce any potential ties of family.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Welch as Emmet, Mandy's {{best friend}} who also harbors romantic {{feelings}} for her, but, unlike his male counterparts, conceals them. His argument with Dylan {{in the beginning}} of the film, which ends with him convincing Dylan to jump from the roof to impress Mandy, resulting in his death— puts a rift between himself and Mandy. Their peers lay blame on Emmet for Dylan's death, and he becomes ostracized by the high school, while Mandy is embraced by his popular oppressors. By him being ostracized and eventual perpetration of the murders led several critics to draw comparisons to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the teenagers responsible for the Columbine massacre. A <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> is that in one scene he is portrayed to be wearing a shirt similar to that worn by Eric Harris on the day of the massacre.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{disappearance}} of the trend, critics and public used the term to refer female pop stars who had <b>notable</b> <b>similarity</b> with or majorly influenced by Madonna. When inducting Madonna into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, American singer and actor Justin Timberlake stated that [...] "The world has always been full of Madonna wannabes, and I might have even dated a couple" [...] referring to his former girlfriend, Britney Spears. William Anthony Donohue, the president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, called Lady Gaga a mediocre [...] "Madonna wannabe" [...] due to the usage of Catholic imagery in her [...] "Alejandro" [...] music video. Chris Riemenschneider, a journalist of Star Tribune, wrote an article in 2012 ranking several singers as [...] "Madonna wannabe", including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Katy Perry, Rihanna, as well as Lady Gaga who topped the list with 10 out of 10 rating.|$|E
5000|$|Yubi lakpi is a seven-a-side {{traditional}} {{football game}} played in Manipur, India, using a coconut, which has some <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> to rugby. Despite these similarities, {{the name is}} not related to the game of rugby or Rugby School in England, it is in fact of Meitei origin, and means literally [...] "coconut snatching". Emma Levine, an English writer on little known Asian sports, speculates: ...|$|R
40|$|This paper overviews {{the range}} of plant {{physiological}} studies carried out in Amazonia drawing out the major conclusions and <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> and differences which might exist between vegetation types and localities. The relevance {{of some of the}} results emerging from these studies to current thinking in ecophysiology and global ecology are assessed. Finally the paper considers directions that plant physiological research in rainforests and replacement vegetation shouldtake in future years. 199...|$|R
50|$|The fable is classed as Aarne-Thompson type 313 (A girl {{helps the}} hero to flee) and {{revolves}} about a transformation chase. Others {{of this type}} include The Water Nixie, The Foundling-Bird, The Master Maid, and The Two Kings' Children. The motifs contain <b>notable</b> <b>similarities</b> to the legend of Jason and Medea, in the tasks assigned to the hero, and in the help from a woman connected with the villain.|$|R
