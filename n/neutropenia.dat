5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} also {{occurs in}} conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. cyclic <b>neutropenia</b> and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} infection. In cyclic <b>neutropenia,</b> more severe oral ulceration occurs during periods of severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying <b>neutropenia</b> prevents the cycle of ulceration. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|In cyclic <b>neutropenia,</b> {{there is}} a {{reduction}} in the level of circulating neutrophils in the blood that occurs about every 21 days. Opportunistic infections commonly occur and aphthous-like ulceration is worst during this time.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its role}} in facilitating iron uptake, copper {{deficiency}} can produce anemia-like symptoms, <b>neutropenia,</b> bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism. Conversely, Wilson's disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid {{has been}} studied as an {{alternative}} to vancomycin in the treatment of febrile <b>neutropenia</b> in cancer patients when Gram-positive infection is suspected. It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and may therefore be effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to <b>neutropenia,</b> anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E
5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (<b>neutropenia),</b> as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, {{cases of}} MDS present with {{isolated}} <b>neutropenia</b> or thrombocytopenia without anemia and with dysplastic changes {{confined to the}} single lineage. The term refractory <b>neutropenia</b> and refractory thrombocytopenia have sometimes been used to describe these cases. A diagnosis of MDS in patients with <b>neutropenia</b> or thrombocytopenia without anemia should be made with caution.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is also {{aimed at}} the {{underlying}} cause of the <b>neutropenia.</b> One severe consequence of <b>neutropenia</b> {{is that it can}} increase the risk of infection.|$|E
25|$|The terms agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia and <b>neutropenia</b> are {{sometimes}} used interchangeably. Agranulocytosis implies a more severe deficiency than granulocytopenia. <b>Neutropenia</b> indicates a deficiency of neutrophils (the most common granulocyte cell) only.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of <b>neutropenia</b> are {{associated}} with the underlying cause of the decrease in neutrophils. For example, {{the most common cause of}} acquired <b>neutropenia</b> is drug-induced, so an individual may have symptoms of medication overdose or toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Haematological {{adverse effects}} include <b>neutropenia</b> (95.5%), anaemia (90.4%), febrile <b>neutropenia</b> (11.0%) and {{thrombocytopenia}} (8.0%). Deaths due to toxicity accounted for 1.7% of the 2045 patients, and incidence was increased (9.8%) {{in patients with}} elevated baseline liver function tests (liver dysfunction).|$|E
25|$|Leukopenia and <b>neutropenia</b> â€“ due to {{splenomegaly}} with splenic margination.|$|E
25|$|The major {{difference}} {{was that there was}} a higher incidence of <b>neutropenia</b> in the peginterferon groups.|$|E
25|$|Neutrophils - as <b>Neutropenia</b> {{is one of}} the {{complications}} of HDN, the neutrophil count should be checked.|$|E
25|$|Like <b>neutropenia,</b> {{symptoms}} {{and treatment of}} lymphocytopenia are directed at the underlying cause {{of the change in}} cell counts.|$|E
25|$|Rare (<0.1% of patients): <b>neutropenia,</b> {{first degree}} heart block, hypotension, hypertension, pancreatitis, dysphagia, oliguria, rhabdomyolysis, suicidal {{thoughts}} or behavior.|$|E
25|$|Hypersplenism and pancytopenia, {{the rapid}} and {{premature}} destruction of blood cells, leads to anemia, <b>neutropenia,</b> leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (with {{an increased risk}} of infection and bleeding).|$|E
25|$|Newborn babies {{experience}} with vomiting, acidosis, hyperammonemia, hepatomegaly (enlarged livers), hyperglycinemia (high glycine levels), and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Later, cases of thrombocytopenia and <b>neutropenia</b> can occur.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{adverse effects}} (<0.1% of patients) include: anaphylaxis, toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis, erythema multiforme, red man syndrome, superinfection, thrombocytopenia, <b>neutropenia,</b> leukopenia, tinnitus, dizziness and/or ototoxicity, and DRESS syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of established or suspected infection following {{exposure to radiation}} (characterized by <b>neutropenia</b> and fever) {{is similar to the}} one used for other febrile neutropenic patients. However, important differences between the two conditions exist. Individuals that develop <b>neutropenia</b> after exposure to radiation are also susceptible to irradiation damage in other tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and central nervous system. These patients may require therapeutic interventions not needed in other types of neutropenic patients. The response of irradiated animals to antimicrobial therapy can be unpredictable, as was evident in experimental studies where metronidazole and pefloxacin therapies were detrimental.|$|E
25|$|Defined as total {{lymphocyte}} count below 1.0x109/L, the cells most commonly affected are CD4+ T cells. Like <b>neutropenia,</b> lymphocytopenia may be acquired or intrinsic {{and there are}} many causes. This is not a complete list.|$|E
25|$|Anemia and thrombocytopenia, {{when they}} occur, are {{improved}} with blood transfusion. <b>Neutropenia</b> (a decrease of the neutrophil granulocyte count below 0.5 x 109/litre) {{can be improved}} with synthetic G-CSF (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, e.g., filgrastim, lenograstim).|$|E
25|$|To be precise, <b>neutropenia</b> is {{the term}} {{normally}} used to describe absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) of less than 500 cells per microlitre, whereas agranulocytosis is reserved for cases with ANCs of less than 100 cells per microlitre.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects include feeling sick (nausea), diarrhea, headaches, leg aches/cramps, fluid retention, visual disturbances, itchy rash, lowered {{resistance}} to infection, bruising or bleeding, loss of appetite; weight gain, reduced number of blood cells (<b>neutropenia,</b> thrombocytopenia, anemia), and edema.|$|E
25|$|Hematologic effects, such as <b>neutropenia,</b> {{agranulocytosis}} {{and other}} blood dyscrasias, have occurred during therapy with ACE inhibitors, especially {{in patients with}} additional risk factors (see Warnings). Patients should be advised to report symptoms such as sore throat or fever to their physician.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} {{disorders}} can cause decreases in {{white blood cell}}s. This type of white blood cell decreased is usually the neutrophil. In this case the decrease may be called <b>neutropenia</b> or granulocytopenia. Less commonly, a decrease in lymphocytes (called lymphocytopenia or lymphopenia) may be seen.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a direct}} {{relationship}} between the degree of the <b>neutropenia</b> that emerges after exposure to radiation and the increased risk of developing infection. Since there are no controlled studies of therapeutic intervention in humans, most of the current recommendations are based on animal research.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids cause immunosuppression, {{decreasing}} the function and/or numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes (including both B cells and T cells), monocytes, macrophages, and the anatomical barrier {{function of the}} skin. This suppression, if large enough, can cause manifestations of immunodeficiency, including T cell deficiency, humoral immune deficiency and <b>neutropenia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) (â‰¥ 1% of patients) {{associated with}} the cephalosporin therapy include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, and pain and inflammation at injection site. Infrequent ADRs (0.1â€“1% of patients) include vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal candidiasis, pseudomembranous colitis, superinfection, eosinophilia, nephrotoxicity, <b>neutropenia,</b> thrombocytopenia, and fever.|$|E
25|$|Advanced-stage tumors (IIB-IVA) {{are treated}} with {{radiation}} therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. On June 15, 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved {{the use of a}} combination of two chemotherapy drugs, hycamtin and cisplatin, for women with late-stage (IVB) cervical cancer treatment. Combination treatment has significant risk of <b>neutropenia,</b> anemia, and thrombocytopenia side effects.|$|E
25|$|A neutropenic fever, {{also called}} febrile <b>neutropenia,</b> is a fever {{in the absence}} of normal immune system function. Because of the lack of infection-fighting neutrophils, a {{bacterial}} infection can spread rapidly; this fever is, therefore, usually considered to require urgent medical attention. This kind of fever is more commonly seen in people receiving immune-suppressing chemotherapy than in apparently healthy people.|$|E
25|$|Cases of leukopenia, <b>neutropenia,</b> thrombocytopenia, and {{pancytopenia}} (some fatal) {{have been}} reported with infliximab. The FDA issued a warning to doctors appearing in the respective product labeling of infliximab instructing them to screen and monitor potential patients more carefully. The FDA issued a warning to doctors {{that there is an}} increased risk of lymphoma and other cancers {{associated with the use of}} infliximab and other tumor necrosis factor blockers in children and adolescents.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine {{also carries}} five black box warnings, {{including}} warnings for agranulocytosis, {{central nervous system}} depression, leukopenia, <b>neutropenia,</b> seizure disorder, bone marrow suppression, dementia, hypotension, myocarditis, orthostatic hypotension (with or without syncope) and seizures. Lowering of the seizure threshold may be dose related and slow initial titration of dose may decrease the risk for precipitating seizures. Slow titration of dosing may also decrease the risk for orthostatic hypotension and other adverse cardiovascular side effects.|$|E
25|$|When {{used in the}} {{systemic}} therapy, IFNs are mostly administered by an intramuscular injection. The injection of IFNs in the muscle or under the skin is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects are flu-like symptoms: increased body temperature, feeling ill, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, convulsion, dizziness, hair thinning, and depression. Erythema, pain, and hardness on the spot of injection are also frequently observed. IFN therapy causes immunosuppression, in particular through <b>neutropenia</b> and can result in some infections manifesting in unusual ways.|$|E
25|$|Diamondâ€“Blackfan anemia (DBA), {{also known}} as Blackfan-Diamond anemia, {{inherited}} pure red cell aplasia and as inherited erythroblastopenia, is a congenital erythroid aplasia that usually presents in infancy. DBA causes low red blood cell counts (anemia), without substantially affecting the other blood components (the platelets and the white blood cells), which are usually normal. This {{is in contrast to}} Shwachmanâ€“Bodianâ€“Diamond syndrome, in which the bone marrow defect results primarily in <b>neutropenia,</b> and Fanconi anemia, where all cell lines are affected resulting in pancytopenia.|$|E
25|$|Dental infections {{such as a}} pericoronal abscess {{can develop}} into septicemia and be {{life-threatening}} in persons who have <b>neutropenia.</b> Even in people with normal immune function, pericoronitis may cause a spreading infection into the potential spaces {{of the head and}} neck. Rarely, the spread of infection from pericoronitis may compress the airway and require hospital treatment (e.g. Ludwig's angina), although the majority of cases of pericoronitis are localized to the tooth. Other potential complications of a spreading pericoronal abscess include peritonsillar abscess formation or cellulitis.|$|E
