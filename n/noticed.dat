50|$|In Mechanics lien law a Preliminary <b>Notice</b> (also {{known as}} a <b>Notice</b> to Owner, Materialmens <b>Notice</b> to Owner, <b>Notice</b> of Furnishing, Contractor/Subcontractors <b>Notice</b> to Owner, and others) is a <b>notice</b> sent by the general contractor, subcontractor, materialmen, {{equipment}} lessors or other parties to a construction project not to create a Mechanics lien but rather to establish the right to file a Mechanics lien {{in the event of}} nonpayment. The distinction is important. If the Preliminary <b>Notice</b> is sent but the claimant's bill is paid, the Preliminary <b>Notice</b> has no further legal effect. However, if the bill is not paid the claimant may now file a Mechanics lien on the owner's property. Most states do not allow the filing of a Mechanics lien without claimants being able to prove they first sent a Preliminary <b>Notice.</b>|$|R
