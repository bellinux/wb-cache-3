40|$|BACKGROUND: Aerosol {{face mask}} {{design and the}} {{distance}} at which the face mask is held from the face affect the delivery of <b>nebulized</b> <b>medication</b> to pediatric patients. OBJECTIVE: To measure the inhaled mass of nebulized albuterol with 3 types of pediatric face mask, at 3 different distances from the face, with {{a model of a}} spontaneously breathing infant. METHODS: We compared a standard pediatric face mask and 2 proprietary pediatric face masks (one shaped to resemble a dragon face, the other shaped to resemble a fish face). The albuterol was nebulized with a widely used jet nebulizer. Aerosol delivery with each type of mask was measured with the mask at 0 cm (ie, mask directly applied to the mannequin face), 1 cm, and 2 cm from the mannequin face. In each test the nebulizer was filled with a 3 -mL unit dose of albuterol sulfate and powered by oxygen at 8 L/min, with a total nebulization time of 5 min. The mannequin face was connected to a lung simulator that simulated a spontaneously breathing infant. We measured inhaled mass by collecting the aerosol on a 2 -way anesthesia filter that was attached {{to the back of the}} mannequin’s oral opening via a 15 -mm silicon adapter. We also measured residual drug left in the nebulizer, and estimated the drug lost to the atmosphere. RESULTS: The mean SD inhaled percentage of the nominal dose values at 0 cm, 1 cm, and 2 cm, respectively, were 2. 18 0. 53 %, 1. 45 0. 46 %, and 0. 92 0. 51 % with the standard mask; 2. 65 0. 55 %, 1. 7 0. 38 %...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{determine}} the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains among residents in residential care {{homes for the}} elderly in Hong Kong. DESIGN. Cross-sectional and descriptive study. PARTICIPANTS. A total of 949 residents in 13 residential care homes for elderly persons in Hong Kong in January 2005. METHODS. MRSA colonization was assessed by culture of swab specimens from anterior nares and active skin lesions. Characteristics of residents were obtained by a standard questionnaire. All MRSA isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for their staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec content and were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequencing. RESULTS. MRSA colonization was detected in 27 residents (2. 8 %). No MRSA was found in 2 facilities. The rate of MRSA carriage in the other 11 facilities ranged from 1. 9 % to 4. 2 %. In univariate analysis, functional immobility (odds ratio [OR], 1. 4), history of hospital admission (OR, 2. 3), {{and the use of}} <b>nebulized</b> <b>medication</b> (OR, 5. 4) were significantly associated with MRSA colonization. The isolates had 11 unique antibiograms, with 14 isolates susceptible to all but 1 or 2 of the non-β-lactam antimicrobial agents tested. The isolates exhibited SCCmec types I (1 isolate), II (2 isolates), III (1 isolate), IV/IVA (10 isolates), and V (13 isolates). No isolates had the Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes. PFGE analysis clustered all except 1 isolate into 7 PFGE types, designated HKU 10 to HKU 70. Between 1 and 4 unique PFGE types were found in the individual residential care facilities. CONCLUSION. This study documented the emergence of SCCmec types IV and V among genetically diverse MRSA strains in residential care homes for elderly persons in Hong Kong. © 2007 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

40|$|In 1994 we {{investigated}} a large outbreak of Burkholderia (formerly Pseudomonas) cepacia respiratory tract acquisition. A case patient {{was defined as}} any patient {{with at least one}} sputum culture from which B. cepacia was isolated from 1 January to 31 December 1994. Seventy cases were identified. Most (40 [61 %]) occurred between 1 February and 31 March 1994; of these, 35 (86 %) were mechanically ventilated patients, 30 of whom were in an intensive-care unit (ICU) when B. cepacia was first isolated. Compared with control patients who were mechanically ventilated in an ICU, these 30 case-patients {{were significantly more likely to}} have been ventilated for 2 or more days (30 / 30 v. 15 / 30; P < 0. 001) or to have been intubated more than once (12 / 30 v. 2 / 30; OR = 9. 3, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 68. 8; P = 0. 002) before the first isolation of B. cepacia. By multivariate analysis, the 35 mechanically ventilated case-patients were significantly more likely to have received a <b>nebulized</b> <b>medication</b> (OR = 11. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 6 - 553. 1; P < 0. 001) and a cephalosporin antimicrobial (OR = 11. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 6 - 553. 1) in the 10 days before the first isolation of B. cepacia, compared with B. cepacia-negative control-patients matched by date and duration of most recent mechanical ventilation. Although B. cepacia was not cultured from medications or the hospital environment, all outbreak strains tested had an identical DNA restriction endonuclease digestion pattern by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Review of respiratory therapy procedures revealed opportunities for contamination of nebulizer reservoirs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{difficulty}} of assessing nebulizer responses in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{has been demonstrated}} before. This study aims to re-examine both the role of domiciliary nebulizers in COPD and also bronchodilator (BD) assessment in individuals. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial, 19 stable patients with severe COPD were given the following medication 6 -hourly for 2 -week periods: (1) nebulized salbutamol 2 · 5 mg with ipratropium 0 · 5 mg and placebo inhalers (MDI) with spacer; (2) placebo nebules and inhaled salbutamol 400 μ g with ipratropium 80 μ g via MDI with spacer; (3) inhaled salbutamol 400 μ g with ipratropium 80 μ g via MDI with spacer (but no placebo nebulized drugs). Both nebulized and MDI drugs produced highly significant improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), specific airways conductance, 6 -min walking distance (6 MWD) and residual volume. There {{were no significant differences between}} BD responses obtained after active nebulized and active MDI BDs. From the diary cards, 2 weeks of active nebulized BDs produced a slightly higher median peak expiratory flow (PEF) than active MDI BDs (236 and 219 l m− 1, respectively, P= 0 · 01) and slightly less extra inhaler use (0 · 8 and 1 · 1 puffs, respectively, P< 0 · 05) but no significant difference in dyspnoea or quality of life (QOL) scores. There were significant correlations between domiciliary PEF and acute BD-induced changes in FVC and 6 MWD, and also between domiciliary dyspnoea scores and acute changes in both total lung capacity and 6 MWD. In conclusion, <b>nebulized</b> <b>medication</b> conferred little clinical advantage over the regular use of inhalers with spacers in this group of patients with severe COPD. However, acute changes in total lung capacity, FVC and 6 MWD may be useful predictors of the longer-term effects of nebulized BDs in individual patients...|$|E

Text message reminders {{have been shown to}} be effective at improving adherence rates in other chronic diseases such as asthma and diabetes. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of sending text reminders for a prolonged period of time to children with CF. Materials and methods: Children with CF aged 5 – 16 years taking at least one medication via a nebulizer with an electronic adherence monitor were consented for the study. Text message reminders were sent to participants and/or parents via the hospital’s automated text service, up to twice a day, for 6  months. The adherence rates for the 6 -month text period were compared to the previous 6  months before the study. Rates were calculated for weekdays, weekends, and school holidays. Results: Seventeen participants were recruited to the study, with a mean age of 12 years and a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) of 81 % predicted. Fifteen children ­completed the 6 -month text period, and I-neb data were accurately analyzed for 13 participants. The mean adherence rate in the 6 months receiving texts was 80 %, compared to 81 % in the prior 6 months. Overall adherence rates on weekdays, weekends, and school holidays were equivalent during the 2 time periods. A subgroup of patients with moderate baseline adherence showed increased adherence during the text period, particularly at weekends. Conclusion: It is feasible to send text message reminders to children with CF, and they are amenable to this approach. Although text reminders do not increase rates in patients with existing optimal adherence, they may be of value in patients with more moderate baseline rates.

30|$|Because brain-dead organ {{donors are}} not legally {{considered}} to be human subjects {{for the purposes of}} Institutional Review, we did not seek approval from the institutional review boards (IRBs) of the 175 hospitals where a brain-dead donor enrolled in BOLD might be cared for by the CTDN. The IRBs at the coordinating center (Vanderbilt) and at the BOLD Lung Physiology Laboratory site at UCSF both confirmed that the study does not involve human subjects. However, in the course of implementing the study, we have encountered questions from several hospital IRBs when they have become aware of the study, usually as a result of questions from hospital respiratory therapists who are asked to administer the study drug. By request, the study has been submitted and approved by several hospital IRBs. One hospital declined to participate, although no reason was given and the protocol had received IRB approval.

40|$|Chronic pseudomonal bronchopulmonary {{infections in}} cystic {{fibrosis}} patients are frequently controlled with inhaled antibiotics.

Microparticles containing one or both antibiotics were prepared by spray-drying. Their Anderson cascade impactor deposition profiles showed 10 – 30 % fine particle fractions of the nominal dose. Microparticles containing varying amounts of each antibiotic showed statistically different deposition profiles.

The antipseudomonal activities of microparticles co-encapsulating half of the 50 % effective concentration (EC 50) of both ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin (5  mg of particles containing 5 % ceftazidime and 10 % ciprofloxacin) were at least additive compared to particles containing the EC 50 of each antibiotic separately (5  mg of particles containing 10 % ceftazidime or 5  mg of particles containing 20 % ciprofloxacin). Co-encapsulation of the antibiotics in microparticles ensures co-deposition at desired ratios, improves the particles’ aerodynamics and fine particle fraction, as compared to microparticles with equivalent amounts of ceftazidime alone, and achieves additive antipseudomonal activity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundMore {{aggressive}} {{management of}} cystic fibrosis (CF), {{along with the}} use of new therapies, has led to increasing survival. Thus, the recommended daily treatment regimens for most CF adults are complex and time consuming. MethodsIn the Project on Adult Care in CF (PAC-CF), an ongoing longitudinal study of CF adults, we assessed self-reported daily treatment activities and perceived treatment burden as measured by the CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), a disease-specific quality of life measure. ResultsAmong the 204 respondents, the median number of daily therapies reported was 7 (IQR 5 – 9) and the mean reported time spent on treatment activities was 108  minutes per day (SD 58  min). Respondents reported a median of 3 inhaled and 3 oral therapies on the day prior to the survey. Only 49 % reported performing airway clearance (ACT) on that day. There were no differences in the number of medications or the time to complete therapies based on gender, age or FEV 1. The mean CFQ-R treatment burden domain score was 52. 3 (SD 22. 1), with no significant differences in the treatment burden based on age or FEV 1. In a multivariable model controlling for age, gender, and FEV 1, using 2 or more <b>nebulized</b> <b>medications</b> and performing ACT for ≥ 30  min were significantly associated with increased treatment burden. ConclusionThe level of daily treatment activity is high for CF adults regardless of age or disease severity. Increasing number of nebulized therapies and increased ACT time, but not gender, age, or pulmonary function, are associated with higher perceived treatment burden. Efforts to assess the effects of high treatment burden on outcomes such as quality of life are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Background: Smoke {{inhalation}} is a {{major source}} of morbidity and mortality. Heparin and N-acetylcysteine treatment has potential efficacy in inhalation injury. We investigated the impact of a heparin/N-acetylcysteine/albuterol nebulization protocol in adult patients with inhalation injury. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of adult inhalation injury patients, admitted to a regional burn center between January 2011 and July 2012, who underwent a protocol of alternating treatments of heparin and N-acetylcysteine/albuterol nebulization every 4 hours. The study cohort was matched 1 : 1 by age, sex, and burn size to a control cohort admitted within 5 years before protocol implementation. Results: The study (n = 20) and control cohorts (n = 20) were well matched, with nearly identical age (50 vs 49 years), sex distribution (70 % male), burn size (total body surface area, 22 % vs 21 %), and inhalation injury, except grade I injuries (79 % vs 47 %, P = 0. 01). The protocol did not change mortality (30 % vs 25 %, P = 0. 72) or duration of mechanical ventilation (8. 5 vs 8. 8 days, P = 0. 9). There was no difference in development of sepsis (40 % vs 33 %, P = 0. 7) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (15 % vs 10 %, P = 1); however, those who received the protocol were more likely to develop pneumonia (45 % vs 11 %, P = 0. 03). Conclusions: The implementation of a heparin/N-acetylcysteine/albuterol protocol did not reduce mortality or duration of mechanical ventilation in this cohort of adults with inhalation injury and resulted in a significant increase in pneumonia rates. Larger prospective studies are necessary, with close attention paid to minimizing the infection risk incurred from frequent administration of <b>nebulized</b> <b>medications...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic {{fibrosis}} perform airway clearance techniques and receive <b>nebulized</b> <b>medications</b> {{on a regular}} basis. Some positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices allow concomitant administration of aerosol. I hypothesized that this practice alters the aerosol charac-teristics and patient dose. I compared the aerosol characteristics and patient dose of nebulized albuterol from 2 types of nebulizer, alone and when connected to different PEP and vibratory PEP devices. METHODS: Three units of a continuous-output nebulizer (Up-Draft II Opti-Neb) and 3 units of a breath-enhanced nebulizer (LC Plus) were tested alone and connected to PEP devices (Acapella Choice, Acapella Duet, and EzPAP for Up-Draft II Opti-Neb, and Pari PEP at 2 different settings, and Pari PEP S system with the LC Plus). Aerosol characteristics were evaluated with a cooled cascade impaction technique. The nebulizers were loaded with 2. 5 mg/ 3 mL albuterol solu-tion and operated for 4 min at 6 L/min (wall air). Patient dose was evaluated with simulated breathing patterns for a child, small adult, and large adult. Albuterol was assayed via spectropho-tometry. RESULTS: Connecting the LC Plus to the PEP devices did not change the aerosol char-acteristics or patient dose. Connecting the Up-Draft II Opti-Neb to the PEP devices significantly reduced the mass median aerodynamic diameter, from 4. 13 m to 3. 72 m with EzPAP (P. 02), 1. 24 m with Acapella Choice (P <. 001), and 1. 22 m with Acapella Duet (P <. 001). The total amount of albuterol captured by the impactor decreased when connected to either Acapella Choice (65 %) or Acapella Duet (69 %), with 17 – 25 % retained in the PEP devices. Patient dose decreased by 76 % and 84 % when connected to Acapella Choice and Acapella Duet, respectively. CONCLU-SIONS: Concomitant use of nebulizer and PEP or vibratory PEP devices that obstruct the aerosol pathway significantly decrease the aerosol particle size and the patient dose.
