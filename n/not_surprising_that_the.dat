5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, {{perhaps it is}} <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cure for {{political}} injustices {{is identical to the}} cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. They were looking for a government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E
25|$|In the 1961–1962 season, the Duleep Trophy {{was inaugurated}} as a zonal competition. It {{was named after}} Ranji's nephew, Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji (1905–59).

25|$|Given his record, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other Party {{leaders were}} {{suspicious}} of Beria's motives. Khrushchev opposed the alliance between Beria and Malenkov, {{but he was}} initially unable to challenge them. His opportunity came in June 1953 when a spontaneous uprising against the East German Communist regime broke out in East Berlin.|$|E
25|$|N-oxides {{are prone}} to undergo the Polonovski {{rearrangement}} when treated with acetic anhydride, and this was illustrated by the synthesis of oxazepam. It is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> N-methyl analogue (1) also undergoes this process, and hydrolysis of the resulting acetate gives temazepam (2). Care must be exacted with the conditions, or the inactive rearrangement product (3) results.|$|E
25|$|The {{topographic}} location {{marks the}} Glauberg {{as a long-term}} focus of human activity. It combines access to fertile arable land and water with an easily defensible site and a strategic location along several natural traffic routes. Thus, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hill {{was the site of}} human occupation long before and long after its Celtic phase, well into the medieval period.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{electrical}} breakdown mechanisms {{of air and}} PMMA plastic are considerably different, the branching discharges {{turn out to be}} related.

25|$|Given {{the results}} of the trial, it is perhaps <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> project was {{scrapped}} almost immediately over safety concerns. However, it has since been suggested that the entire project was a hoax devised as part of Operation Fortitude, to convince the Germans that plans were being developed to attack the heavily fortified defences surrounding the Pas-de-Calais rather than the less-defended Normandy coastline.|$|E
25|$|Schloss Trautenfels and {{the picturesque}} hamlet of Pürgg have {{attracted}} numerous tourists and excursionists. In addition, {{the area is}} popular for mountain climbers, who climb the Grimming, the Totes Gebirge mountains, and in the southern Niedere Tauern. In Wörschachwald is a small winter sports area and the Spechtensee lake, a popular destination. Therefore, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> municipality has numerous inns and hostels.|$|E
25|$|At the War Council (5August) Kitchener and Lt.-General Sir Douglas Haig {{argued that}} the BEF should be {{deployed}} at Amiens, where it could deliver a vigorous counterattack once the route of German advance was known. Kitchener {{argued that the}} deployment of the BEF in Belgium would result in having to retreat and abandon much of its supplies almost immediately, as the Belgian Army {{would be unable to}} hold its ground against the Germans; Kitchener was proved right, but given the belief in fortresses common at the time, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> War Council disagreed with him.|$|E
30|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{postnatal}} depression have consistently found {{stressful life events}} to be risk factors and few studies have found no association.

50|$|Accordingly, {{the figurative}} palanquins of the Ga are very rarely shown {{in public and}} {{especially}} for foreigners they are difficult to see. Therefore, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> although <b>the</b> palanquins look similar to the figurative coffins which are well known to the western art market, the figurative palanquins remained completely unknown until recently.|$|R
60|$|Away they went, over {{hills and}} through meadows, {{covering}} {{the ground with}} astonishing speed.

25|$|Knowing her {{background}} in anthropology and various Native American organizations, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most prevalent image in her poetry are bones. In her poetry, {{the image of}} battered bone is the direct link to native American sense of self. The bones of dead Indians almost form {{the words on the}} page and are the spine holding together each of her volumes of poetry. Stemming from her work with anthropology, she writes about bones auctioned, objects sold, and bodies stuffed for our edification in a museum display. Those dead Indians both form the phantoms that haunt her poetry {{and at the same time}} are given new life and the chance to speak out in her poetry.|$|E
25|$|Both sFlt-1 and sEng are {{upregulated}} in all {{pregnant women}} to some extent, supporting {{the idea that}} hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of maternal immune tolerance for a foreign placenta, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> maternal immune system might respond more negatively {{to the arrival of}} some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled spiral arteries in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.|$|E
25|$|Further {{indications}} of the legend's connection with West Yorkshire (and particularly Calderdale) are {{noted in the}} fact that there are pubs called the Robin Hood in both nearby Brighouse and at Cragg Vale; higher up in the Pennines beyond Halifax, where Robin Hood Rocks can also be found. Robin Hood Hill is near Outwood, West Yorkshire, not far from Lofthouse. There is a village in West Yorkshire called Robin Hood, on the A61 between Leeds and Wakefield and close to Rothwell and Lofthouse. Considering these references to Robin Hood, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people of both South and West Yorkshire lay some claim to Robin Hood, who, if he existed, could easily have roamed between Nottingham, Lincoln, Doncaster and right into West Yorkshire.|$|E

25|$|The Toronto, Grey and Bruce and the Toronto and Nipissing Railways were promoted, at {{the same}} time, and with similar objectives, by an {{interlocking}} group of Ontario businessmen and politicians. It is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group should economise by employing one Chief Engineer who would apply the same design principles and choices on both lines. The first consulting Engineer in Canada was John Edward Boyd of New Brunswick, who conducted the preliminary surveys over the ground to Orangeville and Uxbridge. Douglas Fox came to Canada several times in 1868 and 1869 to support the parliamentary campaign and verify the surveys. On his return to England {{in the summer of}} 1869 he made arrangements for an associate, Edmund Wragge, to come to Canada at once to take up the engineering of both lines. In August Wragge visited Pihl in Norway to see his narrow-gauge lines, and arrived in Toronto in September 1869. The tenders for the first sections of line were immediately put out.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of the {{percentage}} of female sexual dysfunction attributable to physical factors have ranged from 30% to 80%. The disorders most likely to result in sexual dysfunction are those that lead to problems in circulatory or neurological function. These factors have been more extensively explored in men than in women. Physical etiologies such as neurological and cardiovascular illnesses have been directly implicated in both premature and retarded ejaculation as well as in erectile disorder, but the contribution of physiological factors to female sexual dysfunction is not so clear. However, recent literature does suggest that there may be an impairment in the arousal phase among diabetic women. Given that diabetic women show a significant variability in their response to this medical disorder, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> disease’s influence on arousal is also highly variable. In fact, the lack of a clear association between medical disorders and sexual functioning suggests that psychological factors play a significant part in the impact of these disorders on sexual functioning.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch land {{forces were}} less {{amenable}} to the Prince's powers of persuasion, and neither was {{the civilian population}} in North Holland. If anything, {{the effect of the}} invasion was to unify the divided Republic against the invader. The Prince's arrogant proclamation, peremptorily ordering the Dutch people to rally to Orange, was also not calculated to convince the Dutch of the wisdom of a restoration of the Stadholderate. It was therefore <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> call for an uprising by the old Stadtholder himself from Lingen met with indifference by the people. A motley band of Orangist émigrés at the Westervoortsche Bridge near Arnhem, was easily put to flight on September 4 by a small detachment of the Batavian National Guard, proving that the invaders had to do the work themselves. Other Orangist incursions in the eastern Netherlands and Friesland met with even less success. Nevertheless, the Uitvoerend Bewind of the Batavian Republic declared martial law and under these emergency measures an aristocratic partisan of the stadtholder, the freule (baroness) Judith Van Dorth tot Holthuizen was convicted of sedition and executed.|$|E

50|$|It is <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> he did <b>not</b> mention Petros' Doxastarion syntomon, {{but only}} his Anastasimatarion, which {{should not be}} mistaken with the Anastasimatarion neon, {{published}} by Petros Ephesios in 1820. It is <b>not</b> less <b>surprising,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> psalmodic composition of the vesper psalm 140.1 Κύριε ἐκέκραξα (kekragarion) in the Anastasimatarion was listed by Chrysanthos as example of the papadic melos.|$|R
25|$|Refineries {{examine whether}} {{it makes sense}} {{economically}} to install alkylation units. Alkylation units are complex, with substantial economy of scale. SAAU and HFAU have comparable capital investment costs. It is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two processes are competitive on a capital cost basis, when one considers the basic process differences. The SAAU has a more expensive reactor section and requires refrigeration. However, equal costs are realized in the HF unit by the need for feed driers, product treating, regeneration equipment and more exotic metallurgy. In addition, most refiners will require a dedicated cooling system for an HF unit, to remove the risk of site-wide corrosion {{in the case of}} an HF leak. It should be noted that these capital cost estimates do not account for the additional safety and mitigation equipment now required in HF units. Due to the possible hazardous aerosol formation when the HF catalyst is released as a superheated liquid, expensive mitigation systems are now required in many locations throughout the world where HF is used as an alkylation catalyst.|$|E
25|$|For example, in act 1, scene 2, the {{scenario}} is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; {{just a simple}} solo with a short chorus and sparse orchestration. The music is not some baroque contrapuntal scheme, {{nor is it a}} Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music is very easy to listen to. This music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, and not just for educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.|$|E
