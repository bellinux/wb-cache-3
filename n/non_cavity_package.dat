In this work, an overcoat material is used to cover a sacrificial polymer, which protects the MEMS device during packaging. Once the overcoat is in place, the sacrificial polymer is thermally decomposed freeing the MEMS structure while the overcoat dielectric provides mechanical protection from the environment. An epoxy POSS dielectric {{was used as a}} high-selectivity etch mask for the PPC and a rigid overcoat for the structure leading to the process improvements. The packaging structures can be designed for a range of MEMS device sizes and operating environments.

Most do not realize that our “modern ” plastic packages use very old materials and processes that have been pushed to their limits by increasing performance demands. After more than 50 years of epoxy resins and transfer molding, events are unfolding that open up opportunities for high-performance thermoplastics and automatic injection molding. Thermoplastics not only have superior properties, they’re halogen-free and can be completely recycled.

Among plastic materials, thermoplastic resins such as Liquid Crystal Polymers (LCP) offer attractive properties including low gas permeation, high temperature resistance, thermal stability and low dielectric constant (3. 1 at 1 MHz and 2. 8 at 10 GHz). However LCP present anisotropic mechanical properties (Young’s modulus, CTE, …) due to the straight rigid molecular chains oriented parallel to the molding direction during processing. The difference of properties between the molding direction (MD) and the transverse direction (TD) of injection could induce a potential fragility of the material and then a lack of reliability of the package.

40|$|An {{approach}} to curing thermosetting polymers ist {{the use of}} Variable Frequency Microwave (VFM) systems, which {{have been shown to}} cure encapsulation materials in substantially shorter times than conventional methods. The microwave curing of thermosetting polymer material is a complex process, with interactions between electromagnetic field intensity, temperature, polymer cure kinetics and resulting development of potential thermomechanical stresses. As the real-time in-situ experimental analysis of a number of these parameters is extremely challenging, a numerical model has been developed to assess this process. The integration of microwave curing into an existing assembly machine imposes the requirement of a compact microwave system, based on a solid state source. Such a system has been designed and installed into our prototype demonstrator. A series of shear tests have been performed on an electrically conductive adhesive and an encapsulation material.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a MEMS RF switch designed and developed specifically for space communication systems, {{with a novel}} geometry and operating mode that overcome the drawbacks of previous devices. To avoid the need for high voltage control, the switch uses electro-thermal rather than electrostatic operation; although this requires higher power consumption during switching, a latching configuration was used such that the hold power is zero in either switch state. This requires that the actuation is lateral (with respect to the chip surface) rather than vertical as in most MEMS switches. Lateral actuation allowed a large open-state separation to be achieved, leading to high-isolation performance. The latching operation also inherently provides high mechanical stability. While most reported MEMS switches have been 2 -port series or shunt switches, the system requirement addressed here was for a 3 -port, single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch (i. e. one input, two selectable outputs). To keep the device compact, this necessitated the use of strongly confining transmission lines, so thin-film microstrip (TFMS), rather than coplanar waveguides (CPWG), was used. By integrating low-loss TFMS with our novel MEMS switch geometry, the SPDT switch operation was achieved with good initial performance, including operating voltage 3 V, isolation 50 dB and insertion loss 1. 8 dB at 5 GHz, and operating range 1 - 20 GHz.

Challenges include strong HOM damping, high HOM power and high fundamental-mode power (in operating scenarios without full energy recovery). For efficient use of space a high real-estate gradient is desirable and for economic operation good fundamental-mode efficiency is important. The technology must also be robust and should be based on well-proven and reliable technologies. For Ampere-class levels of beam current both halo interception and beam break-up (BBU) are important considerations. These factors tend to drive the designs to lower frequencies where the apertures are larger and the transverse impedances are lower. To achieve these goals we propose to use a compact waveguide-damped multi-cell <b>cavity</b> <b>packaged</b> in an SNS-style cryomodule. CONCEPT Future high-power FEL’s for scientific, defense or industrial applications could benefit from a compact, economical and efficient accelerator layout.

The approaches {{are based on}} temporary handling and permanent bonding of cap structures using adhesives or solder onto passive or active silicon wafers which are populated with MEMS components or the MEMS wafer themselves. Firstly, {{an overview of the}} possible packaging configurations based on different types of MEMS is discussed where TSV based and non-TSV based packaging solutions are distinguished in general. The cap in a TSV based solution can have the same lateral size as the MEMS carrying substrate, since the electrical contacts for the MEMS can be routed either thought the cap or base substrate. Thus, full format cap wafers can be used i n a regular wafer to wafer bonding process to create the wafer level <b>cavity</b> <b>packages.</b> However, if no TSVs are present in the cap or base substrate, the caps need to be smaller than the base chips, so that electrical contacts outside the cap area can be accessed after the caps were bonded.

From design point of view, this dissertation examined the theoretical characteristics using a piezoelectric multimorph model with the appropriate diffraction geometry and evaluated the ray tracing geometries to estimate the system spectroscopic performance. To realize the MOEMS device, the fabrication was divided into three main parts: 1) Piezoelectrically actuated grating, 2) microoptics for light coupling, and 3) a three-dimensional aligned packaging. The micrograting actuator was fabricated via bulk-micromachining process with a ZnO thin-film sandwich to provide linear actuation with input voltage.

One of the most fundamental processes in this regard is the solvation of hydrophobic solutes in water. The vast majority of theoretical and numerical studies examine density fluctuations at the short length scale focusing exclusively on spherical cavities. In this work, we use both first-principles and classical molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that density {{fluctuations in}} liquid water can deviate significantly from the canonical spherical shapes. We show that regions of empty space are frequently characterized by exotic, highly asymmetric shapes that can be quite delocalized over the hydrogen bond network. Interestingly, density fluctuations of these shapes are characterized by Gaussian statistics with larger fluctuations. An important consequence of this is that the work required to create <b>non</b> spherical <b>cavities</b> can be substantially smaller than that of spheres. This feature is also qualitatively captured by the Lum-Chandler-Weeks theory. The scaling behavior of the free energy as a function of the volume at short length scales is qualitatively different for the nonspherical entities. We also demonstrate that nonspherical density fluctuations are important for accommodating the hydrophobic amino acid alanine and are thus likely to have significant implications when it comes to solvating highly asymmetrical species such as alkanes, polymers, or biomolecules...|$|R
40|$|Transport Index {{based on}} nuclear {{criticality}} safety is 100. The TN-FSV package is a cylindrical cask with an outer diameter slightly less than 31 in., and a cavity diameter of 18 in. Shielding from gamma rays is provided by a minimum of 3. 38 in. of lead sandwiched between an inner steel sleeve 1. 12 in. thick and an outer steel shell that is 1. 50 in. thick. The cask has an overall length of 207 in. The TN-FSV cask is the primary containment boundary, (see Chapter 4). The Oak Ridge Container fits inside the TN-FSV <b>package</b> <b>cavity,</b> and provides a second containment boundary. The container has an outer diameter of 16. 85 in. {{along the length of}} its body, increasing to 20. 19 in. at the top, where the bolted lid closure is located...|$|R
