Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city to another and investing time and money {{in one of two}} outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If the show of force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege that reduced the city to rubble and ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops at its own expense, called execution, but the soldiers would not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E

For instance, Caroline Bynum has shown how, {{in the late}} Middle Ages, miracles attending the taking of the Eucharist were not simply symbolic of the Passion story, but served as vindication of the mystic's theological orthodoxy by proving that the mystic had not fallen prey to heretical ideas, such as the Cathar rejection of the material world as evil, contrary to orthodox teaching that God took on human flesh and remained sinless. Thus, the nature of mystical experience could be tailored to the particular cultural and theological issues of the time.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} gives {{a justification}} of judicial review, {{which is the}} institution of courts having final authority to interpret a constitution. Under the family of liberal democratic political theories, judicial review can be justified, even though it constricts popular control over important political decisions, {{as a means of}} protecting basic democratic liberties and perhaps promoting other important social goods. On this view, democracy is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> procedural <b>matter</b> of popularly-responsive government, but a form of sovereignty that requires a variety of substantive rights, potentially including rights unrelated to the political process. Since the rights judicial review might protect must be further articulated and specified to apply to particular cases, however, the democratic justness or legitimacy of judicial review requires that judges interpret constitutions using methods of interpretation that can themselves be democratically justified. This dissertation shows how a Rawlsian idea of public reason supplies the basis for just such a method of reasoning, one that proceeds based on reasons all reasonable persons could accept in their capacity as democratic citizens. This idea of public reason applies not only to judges or where matters of fundamental justice are at issue, but ideally can be extended to regulate much, if not all, public political debate in a democracy. ...|$|R

Photographs of couples when they were first married and 25 years later were judged for physical similarity and for the likelihood that they were married. The results showed that there is indeed an increase in apparent similarity after 25 years of cohabitation. Moreover, increase in resemblance was associated with greater reported marital happiness. Among the explanations of this phenomenon that were examined, one based on a theory of emotional efference emerged as promising. This theory proposes that emotional processes produce vascular changes that are, in part, regulated by facial musculature. The facial muscles are said to act as ligatures on veins and arteries, and they thereby are able to divert blood from, or direct blood to, the brain. An implication of the vascular theory of emotional efference is that habitual use of facial musculature may permanently affect the physical features of the face. The implication holds further that two people who live with {{each other for a long}}er period of time, by virtue of repeated empathic mimicry, would grow physically similar in their facial features.

40|$|The U. S. federal {{government}} contracts over five hundred {{billion dollars in}} goods and services each year. Traditionally, these contracts are awarded {{on the basis of}} a combination of a contractor's proposed cost, quality, technical capability and demonstrated past performance. While all valid and important comparators, the overall quality and customer satisfaction achieved at the completion of contracts awarded on these bases remains highly variable from contract-to-contract. This thesis examines potential reasons for the variability of these results and further proposes additional factors for contract evaluation and award that should improve the chances for successful contract outcomes. Twenty four randomly selected and recently completed U. S. Coast Guard construction contracts were used as the basis for study. The documented performance information for each contract was compared against contract demographic information in a search for correlations that are predictive of the likelihood of a high level of contract satisfaction. Contract performance ratings, contract timeliness and contract on-budget performance were compared to overall contractor annual revenue, total contractor employees, the relative contract size and a contractor's revenue per employee. The main finding is that total contractor revenue, relative contract size (higher is better) and contractor revenue per employee (higher is better) are reliable predictors of performance and should be considered as relevant source selection factors for negotiated contracts. Capable small contractors should be selected <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of conformance to a social program, but because the expected results are higher. In addition, the following recommendations apply in order to maximize the probability of positive performance outcomes on U. S. Coast Guard construction contracts: 1) Improve the collection and utilization of past performance data. 2) Minimize sealed-low bid contracting. 3) Maximize contracts by negotiation. 4) Maximize the usage of small businesses, above the "micro-small" level. by Dennis C.

40|$|This essay {{surveys and}} {{critically}} assesses {{international law and}} economics scholarship as it has evolved since the 1990 s as a distinct strand of international legal theory. In this work, international law and economics scholars have sought to demonstrate the virtues of certain forms of economic modelling techniques for answering questions of institutional arrangement and jurisdictional authority that have posed challenges central to the discipline of international law such as which institutions should make which rules in the global order and whose rules ought to apply in what circumstances. Without denying {{the importance of these}} issues, many significant global issues that are central to the work of economists and international legal scholars working in other theoretical traditions are not addressed by international law and economics [...] issues such as poverty, income inequality, economic growth, the role of law in distribution, the impact of culture, institutional divergence or power asymmetries on economic behavior, to name a few. In the remainder of the essay, the author suggests that the limited range of research questions engaged, methods used and policy reforms prescribed in international law and economics work may be a function of a shared but largely unexamined set of background principles, assumptions, presuppositions and teleological expectations about the “normal” unfolding of economic behaviors and processes. If this intuition is correct, then engaging issues and questions previously left out of international law and economics scholarship will <b>not</b> be <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of applying existing theory to new areas of study. Rather, innovation in international law and economics both at the level of theory and of substantive research will require better methods for identifying and foregrounding the assumptions and normative values that animate the research choices and policy conclusions in both existing and future scholarship on the one hand, and for tracing and comparing the analytic and normative implications of different research choices and values by reference to their usefulness in reflecting or predicting the observable behavior of actors in the world around us. In short, a new critical practice of self-conscious analytic introspection and normative transparency would be necessary to move international law and economic theory beyond its prior limits...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the volatile {{body as a}} historiographical and literary category in selected works of Renaissance English literature. Through readings of poems by Edmund Spenser, John Donne, and John Milton, and of plays by Ben Jonson, John Webster, Richard Brome, Philip Massinger, and Sir William Berkeley, I investigate how Renaissance writers trope the idea of transformation in different ways, in different moments, and in different genres. What meanings inhere in the shifting forms they represent, and how do these transformations interplay with both literary and non-literary modalities? Each chapter focuses on metamorphic changes that at times engage with psychological inwardness {{and at other times}} manifest social, political, or theological imperatives arising out of the Reformation. My inquiry is not, however, limited to instances of physical transformation: to these writers, shapeshifting is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> subject <b>matter</b> or theme but an aesthetic practice preoccupied with molding and remolding literary form itself. Recognizing the formal implications of textualized, topical, and literal transformation helps us understand the complexity of early modern ideas about transformation without losing sight of transformation. s material aspect. ^ Chapter One focuses on Adicia, Spenser. s embodiment of injustice in The Faerie Queene, whose psychosomatic transformation complicates Spenser. s politically topical allegories of justice in Book 5 and opens up new ways to read his approach to Elizabethan historiography. Chapter Two examines Milton. s Satan, whose hardened and altered body manifests his fallen and polluted inner state. Satan 2 ̆ 7 s physical volatility and newfound capacity to feel pain is, physiologically and semantically, integral to Milton 2 ̆ 7 s phenomenology of evil.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the experiences of}} selected academics pioneering e-learning in Malaysian tertiary institutions. It begins with {{an overview of the}} broad factors shaping the Malaysian educational environment and then proceeds to examine the experience of individual teachers and e-learning programs. It takes an in-depth qualitative approach to engaging with this case study material drawing heavily on semi-structured interviews with key actors. Conversations with several respondents suggested that the social networks of mentor relations found in the Malaysian case studies might be aptly described as ‘bamboo networks’. Bamboo, which happens to be plentiful in the Malaysian peninsula where these case studies are based, spreads from clump to clump through a series of underground connections involving a mature clump of bamboo sending out a subterranean runner, often over very long distances that then emerge into the open as a new bamboo clump. All of those interviewed reported that they have found it difficult to find a support base in their first years of pioneering online developments. Consequently, they tended to fall back on their peer networks linked to the institutions at which they had studied. Prominent individuals championing e-learning in the institutions where they teach tend to form small groups for information sharing and networking. They do look to their management for tacit ‘permission’ rather than direct encouragement. Consequently, the active promotion of e-learning in Malaysia can be described as being ‘middle-down’ rather than ‘top-down’ in nature. That is to say, it is mid-level teachers that inspire those below them to join in the development of e-learning programs. They are internally driven and strongly motivated. In time, their activity should produce new generations of locally developed e-learning experts but this has yet to take place in a substantial fashion. This study shows that both men and women ‘academic guanxi’, or peer networks, {{play a key role in}} the adoption of online technologies. Key early adopters become change-agents by inspiring a small network of their peers and via their guanxi networks. It was also discovered that motivation is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>an</b> individual <b>matter</b> but is also about groups and peer networks or communities of exchange and encouragement. In the development of e-learning in Malaysia, there is very little activity that is not linked to small clusters of developers who are tied into wider networks through personal contacts. Like clumping bamboo, whilst the local clusters tend to be easily seen, the longer-range ‘subterranean’ personal connections are generally not nearly so immediately obvious. These connections are often the product of previous mentoring relationships, including the relationships between influential teachers and their former postgraduate students. These relationships tend to work like bamboo runners: they run off in multiple directions, subterranean and unseen and then throw up new clumps that then send out fresh runners of their own. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The first-person Hebrew {{narrative}} of the Persian courtier sent to be governor of Judah, the "Nehemiah Memorial" (or NM: Neh 1 - 2 : 20; 3 : 33 - 7 : 3; 13 : 4 - 31), is a crucial text for understanding how elements within ancient Judaism conceived of {{their relationship to the}} Persian Achaemenid Empire, which ruled over Judah from the 6 th to the 4 th centuries BCE. This dissertation investigates NM via the issue of genre. Scholarship on NM in recent years has reached an impasse on this topic, suggesting that NM resists identification with any one genre. Newer developments in genre theory, however, offer resources for understanding genre <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> as <b>a</b> classificatory <b>matter</b> but also as a malleable relationship between writers and readers that can be exploited for rhetorical effect. NM makes use of two main genres: a "foreign court narrative" (cf. Daniel, Esther, and the Joseph narrative) slowly transforms into a biographical inscription or "official memorial", a genre attested throughout the ancient Near East. The subtle combination of these different genres suggests that Nehemiah's pious advocacy for his people and his city carries over from his role as Judean courtier before the Persian king to his role as governor over the Persian province of Judah. It also, however, ultimately underscores the ideological incompatibility of these genres, just as the goals of the subversive courtier {{at the mercy of the}} Persian king are at odds with the goals of the governor representing that king. Early readers of NM responded to these contradictions. A literary investigation of Ezra-Nehemiah reveals that editors of that book incorporated Nehemiah's story, but subtly corrected it, whether by reframing his actions in terms of the work of community as a whole and the Torah (Neh 10, Neh 12 : 44 - 13 : 3) or by contrasting him to the superior reformer Ezra (Ezra 7 - 10). The book of Ezra-Nehemiah thus mutes the signals sent by NM's use of genre indicating that the authority for Nehemiah's reforms, which were essential to Jerusalem's restoration, derived not from Israelite tradition or from the will of the people, but from the power of Judah's imperial masters.

40|$|The {{juridical}} {{reflection on}} origins clearly {{took place in}} a context dominated by a culture that was both of theological extraction and rhetorical formation. The "textual" culture of the theologians soon became the practice of interpretation of the jurists, who substituted the Justinian text for the Biblical one in their exegetic attitudes, but who nevertheless – at least initially– maintained intact the essentially rhetorical nature of their interpretative accessus to the textus of the Justinian corpus. It was with that interpretative tendency that the central role reserved for the maxim "nomina sunt consequentia rerum" emerged, which postulated the existence of a system of necessary correspondences between the nomina iuris and empirical reality which the jurist strove to fit into the interpretative structure of his own analytic discourse. Originally, mediaeval man considered the nomina iuris as the immediate and direct consequence of their ontological basis. To his eyes, the names of things were precisely the key to the privileged awareness of reality; knowing single physical entities meant first discovering their names. This also held true for the activity of the jurist, who essentially depended precisely on the nomina iuris of his work of constructing a normative system. Besides, the etymological logic of the mediaeval derivatores, from the Pisan Uggucione to the Genoese Balbi, to Papias vocabulista, had as its characteristic note precisely this essential basis in the field of sensory perception: the process of making names was <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> formal, linguistic <b>matter</b> but was above all material and concrete. As in the hierarchy of being one thing derived from another, and similarly, consequently – and almost as a mirror image – {{in the structure of the}} language one name derived from another. The derivatio was the final fruit of the specific mutation of practical reality, the organisation of which was expressed in each single nomen. And the names were considered real and proper "normative objects", as they might be called, which functioned as in the world of things and everyday experience. And the premise of that embryo of ideology lay precisely in this: that the jurist and the rhetorician, while "etymologising" and discussing the nomina iuris, seemed rather to be describing the autonomous semantic content of the nomina themselves, while in reality they were manipulating them – and without excessive scruples – and so were passing off as objective and incontrovertible normative prescription what was, in truth, the pure fruit of their conceptual elaborations...|$|R
