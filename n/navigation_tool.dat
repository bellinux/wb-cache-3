50|$|CAD {{navigation}} {{refers to}} software tools {{which are used}} for the correlation of electronic semiconductor design data with a physical semiconductor device. CAD <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> consist of software {{that is capable of}} reading and displaying the physical layout and logical schematic for the device. The logical design consists of a netlist and/or a schematic. The physical design consists of a set of polygons which precisely represent the location of all electrical conductors, diffusions and interconnections in the physical semiconductor device. CAD <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> are often used to provide a cross-correlation between the logical design and the physical design. CAD <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> are used extensively with E-beam probers, focused-ion beam systems and photon probers for the purpose of semiconductor failure analysis.|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} open {{hypermedia}} systems has been well-argued by various authors. In this {{paper we discuss}} the Microcosm model for open hypermedia and show how filters {{have been used to}} extend this model both for greater efficiency and to make it totally reconfigurable. This enables users to tailor the functionality of the system to meet their own requirements, for example to select different sets of links, or to add <b>navigation</b> <b>tools.</b> The implementation of a management system for filters is described, and examples of how it has been used to extend the functionality of the model are presented, in particular the use of filters to design and implement a set of <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> for Microcosm. This latter case study demonstrates the power and flexibility of the filter-based model since all <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> for the system can be implemented as filters. The filter technology is discussed in the context of Microcosm but can be generalised to other hypermedia systems. CONTENTS CSTR 92 - 12 1 Conten [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{unmanned}} aerial {{vehicles for}} autonomous inspections of industrial environments in general, and cargo holds and tanks in particular, {{is a goal}} that has become within reach {{the last couple of}} years, though a lot of development still remains. A problem when developing for inspection of cargo holds is the lack of real world testing opportunities, slowing down development. In this thesis a simulation framework has been developed to speed up the development of autonomous inspection. Furthermore, <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> needed for autonomous flight has been implemented and tested within the framework. The simulation framework uses the Gazebo simulator and the Robot Operating System environment to create a framework which focuses on clean interfaces, ease of use, and portability to real world usage. The <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> developed were a collision avoidance algorithm and a Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm, both relying on a 2 d-scanning lidar. Being tested in the simulator, the <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> performed well, both in normal surroundings and that of a cargo hold, though the size and openness of the cargo hold made the performance very reliant on the range of the lidar. Through the development and testing of the <b>navigation</b> <b>tools,</b> the simulation framework itself was tested and proved to be a valuable and useful resource, providing a flexible and modular interface, which helped the ease of development and speed of testing significantly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} {{objectives}} and first {{results of the}} Peacox project. Pea-cox aims at providing travelers with personalized multi-modal <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> that allow, help and persuade them to travel and drive ecological friendlier. To support the users in making travel decisions without feeling restricted, Peacox considers their situational and individual range of acceptable travel choices and provides personalized and tailored navigation support. 1 Project Overview, Motivation and Objectives PEACOX- Persuasive Advisor for CO 2 -reducing cross-modal trip planning- is an international research project aiming to provide travelers with personalized multi-modal <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> that allow, help and persuade them to travel and drive ecologi-cal friendlier. Existing <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> typically focus either on one trip mode, do not offer personalization or do not stress the ecological aspect. As ecological issues in environments {{become more and more}} pressing, means to reduce the ecological impact of people are needed urgently. A substantial part of emissions is related to traffic and mobility, and as work and leisure life becomes more and more geographically distrib...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} complexity {{and variety of}} applications of on-line services tools for orientation and navigation {{become more and more}} important. Accordingly there is a growing trend to develop and use such tools. But today's orientation and <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> are usually affected by two problems. They are developed either as singular solutions so that they cannot be generalized to other applications or they are generic or not sufficiently usable. Therefore the objective of an HHI project is to develop various orientation and <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> that are both usable and generic. The emphasis of the present paper is to explain and demonstrate the adopted approach...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} confronting website designers is to provide effective navigational support. Supplemental <b>navigation</b> <b>tools</b> such as search, indexes and sitemaps are frequently included on websites.

This paper reports an empirical investigation into the expectations of users regarding the purpose and design of supplemental <b>navigation</b> <b>tools.</b> Expectations are then compared with a survey of the current utilization of these tools in major commercial websites. The study establishes a relationship between certain types of information goals and the selection of search and sitemap tools...|$|R
