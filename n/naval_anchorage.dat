25|$|Oceanic {{headed for}} Scapa Flow in Orkney, Britain’s main <b>naval</b> <b>anchorage,</b> {{with easy access}} to the North Sea and the Atlantic. From here she {{proceeded}} north to Shetland travelling continuously on a standard zigzag course as a precaution against being targeted by U-boats. This difficult manoeuvring required extremely accurate navigation, especially with such a large vessel. In the event it appears to have been poor navigation, rather than enemy action that was to doom Oceanic.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of October 6, a force of two Israeli Dabur Class Fast Patrol Boats were {{anchored}} on buoys at Ras Sudar—then a small Israeli <b>naval</b> <b>anchorage</b> in the northern sector of the Gulf of Suez — part of a routine patrol mission in the Gulf. The Israeli boats, commanded by Navy Lt. Zvika Shahak, had left their base at Sharm al Sheikh a day before. According to Shahak, the intelligence briefing prior to the mission only included a general reference to Egyptian preparation for a possible war.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli boats {{continued}} their patrol with no special events until 22:00 {{when they were}} ordered to turn south, towards Ras Zafranah, a <b>naval</b> <b>anchorage</b> used by the Egyptian Navy. Their mission was to seek, engage and destroy any enemy boats they could find. The boats arrived at Ras Zafranah anchorage, and found it empty. By that time The Daburs lost communications with their home-base at Sharm, which — as they later learned — had been attacked by Egyptian Raduga KSR-2 cruise missiles. Even though he was not ordered to do so, Shahak decided to inspect Marsa Talamat, an anchorage further south from Ras Zafranah.|$|E

He was shot down by two Messerschmitt Bf 109s from Jagdgruppe Losigkeit, flown by Leutnants Heinz Knoke and Dieter Gerhard.

25|$|In March–April 1942, the Japanese {{landed on}} Bougainville {{as part of}} their advance into the South Pacific. At the time, there was only a small Australian {{garrison}} on the island which consisted of about 20 soldiers from the 1st Independent Company and some coastwatchers. Shortly after the Japanese arrived, the bulk of the Australian force was evacuated by the Allies, although some of the coastwatchers remained behind to provide intelligence. Once secured, the Japanese began constructing a number of airfields across the island. The main airfields were on Buka Island, the Bonis Peninsula in the north, at Kahili and Kara, in the south, and Kieta on the east coast, while a <b>naval</b> <b>anchorage</b> was constructed at Tonolei Harbor near Buin on the southern coastal plain, along with anchorages on the Shortland Islands group.|$|E

The Japanese hoped to take the U.S. Pacific fleet by surprise and sink or damage {{a significant number of}} the fleet's aircraft carriers or other large ships.|$|R
50|$|On 28 August 1941 Naval Air Station Argentia was commissioned. NAS Argentia {{was built}} on the plateau atop the {{triangular}} peninsula adjacent to <b>Naval</b> Station Argentia's <b>anchorage</b> and shore facilities. The air station was used to base convoy protection, coastal patrol and anti-submarine aircraft, both land-based aircraft and seaplanes. While NAS Argentia was nominally an independent facility from Naval Station Argentia, both facilities are largely viewed as one.|$|R
2500|$|The Japanese Twenty-Eighth Army under Lieutenant General Shōzō Sakurai, after {{retreating}} from Arakan and the Irrawaddy valley, {{had reached}} the Pegu Yomas, a range of low mountains, hills and uplands between the Irrawaddy and the Sittang River in central Burma. They were joined by Major General Hideji Matsui's 105th Independent Mixed Brigade, also known as [...] "Kani" [...] Force (men of anti-aircraft batteries, airfield construction battalions, <b>naval</b> <b>anchorage</b> units and NCO schools) which had faced IV Corps.|$|E
2500|$|During their {{occupation}} the Japanese constructed naval aircraft {{bases in}} the north, east, {{and south of the}} island; but none in the west. They developed a <b>naval</b> <b>anchorage</b> at Tonolei Harbor near Buin, their largest base, on the southern coastal plain of Bougainville. [...] On the nearby Treasury and Shortland Islands they built airfields, naval bases and anchorages. These bases helped protect Rabaul, the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea, while allowing continued expansion to the south-east, down the Solomon Islands chain, to Guadalcanal and New Guinea and beyond. To the Allies, Bougainville would later also be considered vital for neutralizing the Japanese base around Rabaul.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 April 1920 Pathfinder was in Manila {{for repairs}} with field parties {{from the ship}} engaged in {{topographic}} and hydrographic surveying, including the Cavite <b>naval</b> <b>anchorage</b> {{in anticipation of the}} arrival of a destroyer [...] division in May. She sailed 21 April for surveys off Negros until a casualty to the [...] limiting operations.

2500|$|As {{the leading}} British and Indian troops {{approached}} Pegu, {{many of the}} Japanese rear-area troops in the Rangoon area and even some hastily mobilised Japanese civilians were formed into the Japanese 105th Independent Mixed Brigade under Major General Hideji Matsui, who had recently been appointed commander of the [...] "Rangoon Defence Force". The units of this brigade (also called Kani Force) included anti-aircraft batteries, airfield construction battalions, <b>naval</b> <b>Anchorage</b> Units, the personnel of NCO schools and other odds and ends. They were dispatched north to defend Pegu, although they were delayed by lack of transport (which had been commandeered for Burma Area Army HQ and other units leaving Rangoon) and arrived only piecemeal.|$|E
2500|$|Taihō was {{formally}} commissioned on 7 March 1944. Following {{several weeks of}} service trials in Japan's Inland Sea, she was deployed to Singapore, arriving there on 5 April. Taihō was then moved to Lingga Roads, a <b>naval</b> <b>anchorage</b> off Sumatra, where she joined veteran carriers [...] and [...] in the First Carrier Division, First Mobile Force. All three carriers engaged in working up new air groups by practicing launch and recovery operations and acting as targets for mock aerial attacks staged from Singapore airfields by their own planes. On 15 April, Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa officially transferred his flag from Shōkaku to Taihō {{to take advantage of}} the carrier's extensive command facilities. Shortly thereafter, the First Mobile Force departed Lingga and arrived on 14 May at Tawi-Tawi off Borneo, where the fleet could directly refuel with unrefined Tarakan Island crude oil and await execution of the planned Kantai Kessen ("decisive battle") known as Operation A-GO.|$|E
2500|$|No RAF {{units were}} based {{permanently}} at Crete until April 1941, but airfield construction had begun, radar sites built and stores delivered. Equipment was scarce in the Mediterranean {{and in the}} backwater of Crete. The British forces had seven commanders in seven months. In early April, airfields at Maleme and Heraklion and the landing strip at Retimo on the north coast were ready and another strip at Pediada-Kastelli was nearly finished. After the German invasion of Greece, {{the role of the}} Crete garrison changed from the defence of a <b>naval</b> <b>anchorage</b> to preparing to repel an invasion. On 17 April, Group Captain George Beamish was appointed Senior Air Officer, Crete, taking over from a flight-lieutenant whose duties and instructions had been only vaguely defined. Beamish was ordered to prepare the reception of the Blenheim bombers of 30 and 203 Squadrons from Egypt and the remaining fighter aircraft from Greece, to cover the evacuation of W Force, which enabled the transfer of [...] and Dominion troops to the island, preparatory to their relief by fresh troops from Egypt.|$|E

50|$|Inchkeith was the HQ of the Outer Defences of the Firth of Forth in both wars, in {{conjunction}} with batteries at Kinghorn, on the north shore, and Leith on the southern.
