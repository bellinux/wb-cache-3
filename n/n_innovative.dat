We establish the innovation network with the patent coauthorship data by these 5 MNCs and classify the networks by the tail of distribution curve of connections. To make a comparison of the learning performance of these 5 MNCs with differing network structures, we develop an organization learning model by regarding the reality as having m dimensions, which denotes the heterogeneous knowledge about the reality. We further set <b>n</b> <b>innovative</b> individuals that are mutually interactive and own unique knowledge about the reality. A longer (shorter) distance between the knowledge of the individual and the reality denotes a lower (higher) knowledge level of that individual. Individuals interact with and learn from each other within the small-world network. By making 1, 000 numerical simulations and averaging the simulated results, we find that the differing structure of the small-world network leads to the differences of learning performance between these 5 MNCs. The network monopolization negatively impacts and network connectivity positively impacts learning performance. Policy implications in the conclusion section suggest that to improve firm learning performance, it is necessary to establish a flat and connective network...|$|E

40|$|Automotive {{producers}} require {{light weight}} alternatives to steel for vehicle body work, but while aluminium alloys {{have been used}} extensively in some models they suffer relatively poor formability in deep drawing (draw ability). Asymmetric rolling (ASR), i. e. rolling with different roll surface velocities, is a <b>n</b> <b>innovative</b> production technique {{with the potential to}} produce sheet metals with improv ed drawability in large volume. Put simply it increases the limiting drawing ra tio (LDR) of aluminium alloys by imposing significant shear strain in the plane of the sheet, altering the crystallographic texture, so that the normal anisotropy is increas ed [1 â 4]. While im provements in normal anisotropy may be achieved to some deg ree by symmetric cold rolling via strengthening of the conventional beta fibre texture (e. g. the { 112 }, { 123 } and { 110 } orientations) this gain in formability is typically compromised during recrystallisation where fibre grains transf orm to the detrimental cube component { 100 }; {{this is not the case}} with the fibre and { 001 } formed during ASR, as such orientations tend either to persist [5 â 7] or transform randomly [8 â 10] during recrystallisation, either case being more favourable. However through thickness gradients in the texture after ASR have been observed, and the impact and means of control of such is a subject of active research [11, 12]. [11, 12]. While numerous lab scale experiments in ASR of alum inium have been reported, it is valuable to explore the process window feasib le for industrial application with a modelling technique capable of predicting textu re gradient evolution during cold asymmetric rolling and assessing the im pact of such gradients on the formability. The results of such an investigation are p resented, where (i) a parametric finite element model of a 2 D idealisation of the ASR process is applied to obtain deformation fields and to calculate resulting texture gradie nts via the ALAMEL crystal plasticity model [13], and (b) a 3 D multi-scale model [14] of the tensile test, using these texture gradients as input to predict the effect on the macroscopic normal anisotropy (r value) of such graded materials. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Secret image sharing, as an {{extension}} of secret sharing, has attracted the attention of many scholars in recent years. Multi-secret image sharing is {{an extension}} of traditional secret image sharing in which only one secret image can be shared among one group. In order to extend the utility of the mechanism, we propose an <b>innovative</b> (<b>n,</b> n) secret image sharing scheme based on matrix transformation. Due to the skillful design of the matrix operation used in matrix transformation, the proposed scheme is applicable to more than one secret image. Further, more secret images and participants can be included in this sharing system even after the secret image sharing procedure has been constructed. Also, the proposed scheme produces high-quality shadow images, and it can reconstruct the secret images losslessly. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed scheme is minimized by only using the XOR operation, which stands for exclusive or and is a logical operation that outputs true whenever both inputs differ. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed scheme provides the aforementioned advantages...|$|R

Neutrons were produced by spallation at the <b>innovative</b> <b>n</b> TOF facility at CERN; the γ rays from capture events were detected with organic C 6 D 6 scintillators. Experimental setup and data analysis procedures are described with emphasis on the corrections for detection efficiency, background subtraction, and neutron flux determination. At low energies, resonances could be resolved up to about 1 keV, yielding a resonance integral of 3575 ± 210 b, an average s-wave resonance spacing of (D 0) = 1. 49 ± 0. 07 eV, and a neutron strength function of (S 0) = (3. 87 ± 0. 33) x 10 − 4. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections are reported for thermal energies between 5 and 100 keV. These results are of relevance for nuclear structure studies, nuclear astrophysics, and nuclear technology. The new value of the Maxwellian-averaged cross section at kT = 30 keV is 3. 08 ± 0. 15 b, considerably larger than previous theoretical estimates, and provides better constraints for the thermodynamic conditions during the occurrence of the slow neutron capture process in low-mass stars during their asymptotic giant branch phase.

Health advocates (<b>n</b> = 3), <b>innovative</b> {{health care professionals}} (n = 4) and representatives of health care professional organizations (n = 4) from pharmacy and medicine also participated. Interviews were analyzed via thematic analysis. Results Twenty-one in-depth interviews were conducted. The core finding was the potential for community pharmacies to become a health hub destination, whereby pharmacy staff assist consumers with chronic conditions to: navigate the health system (e. g., provide information on support services), manage their medications, and provide health advocacy. Participants expressed their concern that consumers {{may not be aware}} of the breadth of the pharmacist's expertise and that further collaboration is needed with non-government consumer health organizations and other health providers. Emphasis was placed on the improvement of the pharmacist's current role, particularly in the area of medication advice and accessibility, with the current pharmacy remuneration model identified as a barrier to becoming a health hub destination. Conclusion The eventual progression toward a health hub destination was seen to be important to better assist consumers with chronic conditions. This focuses on a more proactive approach to care encompassing simple advice, referrals to consumer health organizations and ultimately, health advocacy.

They also offer the advantage of being non-intrusive or minimally intrusive. The goal of this project was to get PSP working at VKI and to perform a demonstration test on a simple geometry. This would establish a basis of knowledge of PSP technology to allow it to become a regular part of VKI’s testing suite. The performance of the paint itself has been verified. Problems with wavelength selective filters have been discovered and investigated. The advantages of reflecting filters have been demonstrated.

40|$|Background: The {{experiences}} of transition of graduated nurses entering {{the world of}} work are of fundamental concern to those seeking to prepare, recruit and retain such nurses (Darvill, Fallon & Livesley 2014). Graduate nurse transition continues to remain a difficult time for many new graduate nurses internationally, with significant numbers of graduates being dissatisfied, ultimately considering leaving or exiting the profession (Philips, Estermann & Kenny 2015). New graduates engaging in a professional practice role are confronted with a broad range of emotional, physical, intellectual, developmental and socio-cultural changes that are experienced as reality or transition shock (Kramer 1974, Boychuk Duchscher 2007). The context for this study is a final year semester one module “Preparation for role transition” which aims to prepare undergraduate nursing students for transition and to ameliorate some {{of the effects of the}} findings in the literature as suggested by Darvill (2013). This study explores how students prepare for transition through self assessment and personal development planning of their knowledge, skills and values necessary for a smooth transition. Students will also be utilising an evidence based 3 rd year checklist (Leigh et al. 2014 a, Leigh et al. 2014 b) in support allocating the student to their final practice placement. This is a longitudinal study progressing through the final two semesters of the undergraduate nursing programme; and working in their first staff nurse role. This paper will present the findings of the initial stages of the study. Aim(s) : 1. 	To critically evaluate preparation for transition from the perspectives of key stakeholders 2. 	To identify the structures, processes and outcomes that impact on the student’s readiness for transition Research methodology: The theoretical framework for this study is Kirkpatrick’s levels of evaluation model (Kirkpatrick 1983, Winfrey 1999). The study design to realise the levels of Kirkpatrick's Model will capture the intended and unintended effects (impacts) of the participants. Sample Purposive sample of •	Students attending the Preparation for Role Transition Module with mark of 85 and above (n= 15) •	Student’s mentor on the final placement (n= 15), Data Collection: Documents and the semi structured interview will be utilized to critically explore transition. Data Analysis: Thematic content analysis will be applied to the interviews conducted and documents retrieved, and this will ensure that the analysis is rigorous and that links are being made between the empirical data and the claims made by the researcher (Green and Thorogood 2004). Ethical approval gained from the University of Salford. Key findings and recommendations: The initial findings clearly demonstrate the positive impact that preparation for transition has had on student’s learning and development. The process of self-assessment and personal development planning (PDP) has increased their self awareness and confidence levels. They have been able to highlight areas for development during and their final year and these areas will be discussed. Support has been a theme identified by the students and the perspectives of their final placement mentors will also be explored. The findings clearly demonstrate synergy between transition, leadership, personal resilience, student self- motivation, assertiveness and role modelling. These are the personal qualities required for effective transition. Recommendations so far include: •	Self assessment and personal planning should be embedded at the start of the final year of nursing programmes. •	Create the right conditions for students to demonstrate personal qualities of effective transition •	The support of the mentor is crucial to the development of transition focused PDP’s •	Education of mentors regarding transition focused PDP’s References: Boychuk Duchscher, J.

However, the definitive literature for engineering typically cites Dewey (1910) on how learners construct knowledge from laboratories. In the UK the Engineering Council define in the Accreditation of Higher Education Programme (AHEP), (The Engineering Council, 2014), and UK engineering accreditation institution also require all engineering degrees to have a significant amount of laboratory based learning. The aim of laboratory learning being to support student learning through practice, for example; "Appropriate laboratory work should be evident throughout the entire degree programme…provide the vehicle for exploring the relationship between conceptual models and real engineering systems…provide hands-on experience of the behaviour of materials and processes…" IMechE (2013) Feisel and Rosa (2005) identified that instructional laboratories should be designed to develop students' engineering knowledge, understanding and application abilities; they also identified the importance of the chronological relationship between laboratory and lecture for student knowledge synthesis. This paper will present the common observations and results of a project that has evaluated student learning in laboratory in the engineering laboratories of engineering and maths preparatory year of study. Also, provide evidence of any effective laboratory pedagogy practice that supports engineering student learning, and data that can be utilised by academics provide as guidance for designing and developing, and delivering engineering laboratories for all the engineering courses. The research method used during the project was quantitative and qualitative research methods. Students' learning in the engineering laboratory session has been evaluated to check their understanding of a theoretical topic from the corresponding lecture programme, associated practical learning and whether the laboratory provided the opportunity to place the theory into practice. The research methodologies employed quantitative techniques using MCQs to measure student learning post laboratory and qualitative using survey, Q&A, and a viva voce to assess the student learning. It should be noted none of these methods will form the summative assessment of the student knowledge for the module. However, the MCQ did provide formative assessment feedback to the students and in advertently support student learning for the formal student summative assessment; the laboratory write up. The initial results indicate the length of time of the lecture and whether lecture is pre or post lecture is critical to maximising student learning opportunity in the engineering laboratory. The paper will highlight the impact laboratories have on student learning and aims to inform the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) community on the best practice engineering laboratory design and timetabling to assist in maximising the learning opportunity for students.
