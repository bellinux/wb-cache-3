A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other. There is nothing {{in the nature of the}} cases which should make a difference; <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case. They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings.|$|E

25|$|Other constructivist {{scholars}} {{agree with}} this and emphasize that individuals make meanings through the interactions {{with each other and}} with the environment they live in. Knowledge is thus a product of humans and is socially and culturally constructed (Ernest 1991; Prawat and Floden 1994). McMahon (1997) agrees that learning is a social process. He further states that learning is not a process that only takes place inside our minds, <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> passive development of our behaviors that is shaped by external forces and that meaningful learning occurs when individuals are engaged in social activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} {{published}} by Ebers in July 1826. Ebers became interested in Ainsworth's novel early on and started to add discussions about it in The Literary Souvenir {{in order to promote}} the work. Although the work was jointly written and sometimes claimed by Aston as solely his, many of the reviews described the novel as Ainsworth's alone. The novel also brought Ainsworth to the attention of historical novelist Walter Scott, who later wrote about the work in various articles; the two later met in 1828. During that year, J. G. Lockhartt published Scott's private journals and instigated the notion that the novel was an imitation of Scott. Sir John Chiverton is neither a true historical novel <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> gothic novel. It was also seen by Ainsworth as an incomplete work and he later ignored it when creating his bibliography. The novel does serve as a precursor to Ainsworth's first major novel, Rookwood.|$|E
25|$|For example, in act 1, scene 2, the {{scenario}} is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; {{just a simple}} solo with a short chorus and sparse orchestration. The music is not some baroque contrapuntal scheme, <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music {{is very easy to}} listen to. This music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, and not just for educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, {{it is not surprising that}} the tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.|$|E

25|$|The later {{sub-period}} can be summarily disposed of, for it {{is almost}} entirely {{accounted for by the}} delay between Zumárraga's death on June 3, 1548 and the arrival in Mexico of his successor, Archbishop Alonso de Montúfar, on June 23, 1554. During this interval there was lacking not only a bishop in Mexico City (the only local source of authority over the cult of the Virgin Mary and over the cult of the saints), but also an officially approved resident at the ermita – Juan Diego having died in the same month as Zumárraga, and no resident priest having been appointed until the time of Montúfar. In the circumstances, {{it is not surprising that}} a cult at Tepeyac (whatever its nature) should have fallen into abeyance. <b>Nor</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> matter for surprise that a cult failed to spring up around Juan Diego's tomb at this time. The tomb of the saintly fray Martín de Valencia (the leader of the twelve pioneering Franciscan priests who had arrived in New Spain in 1524) was opened for veneration many times for more than thirty years after his death in 1534 until it was found, on the last occasion, to be empty. But, dead or alive, fray Martín had failed to acquire a reputation as a miracle-worker.|$|E
25|$|Jealous {{servants}} of Ketil who {{look down on}} slaves, destroy Thorfinn's and Einar's wheat crops. When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E

[...] He went on to say that by moving away from the big and [...] "sweeping" [...] statements present in some of her older material, towards personal narration, Beyoncé managed to effectively examine the themes and statements she explored throughout her career. Feeney concluded by stating: [...] "It's not a breakup anthem, <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> declaration of undying love.

500|$|Oakhanger {{contains}} four Grade II listed buildings. Oakhanger Farmhouse is a two storey house {{which dates}} from 1811 with late 19th century extensions. It consists of walls made of Flemish bond with blue headers, flat arches, and stone cills. The farmhouse became a Grade II listed building 18 July 1986. Two stables which lie both {{east and north}} are also Grade II listed buildings: the stable to the east dates from 1814 and has yellow carstone walls, whereas the stable to the north was built in 1820 and has a hipped tiled roof. The final listed building is a barn which lies [...] east of Oakhanger Farmhouse. It dates from the 18th century and consists of timber framed walls with sections of boarding, brickwork, and ironstone. St Mary Magdalene's Church was built in 1873 by architect Moreton Glover.

500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today {{praised the}} film's sense of timeliness, writing, [...] "It's tough to capture an era while it's still happening, yet Up in the Air does so brilliantly, with wit and humanity... Reitman {{emerges as a}} modern-day Frank Capra, {{capturing}} the nation's anxieties and culture of resilience." [...] Stephen Saito of IFC.com wrote, [...] "It touches on larger themes of mass unemployment, cultural alienation and technology as a crutch. But ultimately, it's really an expertly done character study that's a dramatic change of pace from director Jason Reitman's previous two films." [...] Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, [...] "Its cynical wit almost places it in the Billy Wilder bracket: Up In The Air is as eloquent about today's executive culture as The Apartment was about that of 1960. It is a brutal, desolate film – but also a superb existential rom-com, and the most entertaining lesson in contemporary socio-economics that you could hope for." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote, [...] "This isn't a comedy. If it were, {{it would be hard}} to laugh in these last days of 2009. <b>Nor</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> tragedy. It's an observant look at how a man does a job." ...|$|E
