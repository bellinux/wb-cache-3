60|$|The most {{elementary}} {{failure in}} Russia is {{in regard to}} food. In a country which formerly produced a vast exportable surplus of cereals and other agricultural produce, and in which the <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>population</b> is only 15 per cent. of the total, {{it ought to be}} possible, without great difficulty, to provide enough food for the towns. Yet the Government has failed badly in this respect. The rations are inadequate and irregular, so {{that it is impossible to}} preserve health and vigour without the help of food purchased illicitly in the markets at speculative prices. I have given reasons for thinking that the breakdown of transport, though a contributory cause, is not the main reason for the shortage. The main reason is the hostility of the peasants, which, in turn, is due to the collapse of industry and to the policy of forced requisitions. In regard to corn and flour, the Government requisitions all that the peasant produces above a certain minimum required for himself and his family. If, instead, it exacted a fixed amount as rent, it would not destroy his incentive to production, and would not provide nearly such a strong motive for concealment. But this plan would have enabled the peasants to grow rich, and would have involved a confessed abandonment of Communist theory. It has therefore been thought better to employ forcible methods, which led to disaster, as they were bound to do.|$|E
60|$|As the Brissago council came {{to realise}} {{that what it}} had {{supposed}} to be temporary camps of refugees were rapidly developing into great towns of a new type, {{and that it was}} remoulding the world in spite of itself, it decided to place this work of redistributing the <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>population</b> {{in the hands of a}} compactor and better qualified special committee. That committee is now, far more than the council of any other of its delegated committees, the active government of the world. Developed from an almost invisible germ of 'town-planning' that came obscurely into existence in Europe or America (the question is still in dispute) somewhere in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, its work, the continual active planning and replanning of the world as a place of human habitation, is now so to speak the collective material activity of the race. The spontaneous, disorderly spreadings and recessions of populations, as aimless and mechanical as the trickling of spilt water, which was the substance of history for endless years, giving rise here to congestions, here to chronic devastating wars, and everywhere to a discomfort and disorderliness that was at its best only picturesque, is at an end. Men spread now, with the whole power of the race to aid them, into every available region of the earth. Their cities are no longer tethered to running water and the proximity of cultivation, their plans are no longer affected by strategic considerations or thoughts of social insecurity. The aeroplane and the nearly costless mobile car have abolished trade routes; a common language and a universal law have abolished a thousand restraining inconveniences, and so an astonishing dispersal of habitations has begun. One may live anywhere. And so it is that our cities now are true social gatherings, each with a character of its own and distinctive interests of its own, and most of them with a common occupation. They lie out in the former deserts, these long wasted sun-baths of the race, they tower amidst eternal snows, they hide in remote islands, and bask on broad lagoons. For a time the whole tendency of mankind was to desert the river valleys in which the race had been cradled for half a million years, but now that the War against Flies has been waged so successfully that this pestilential branch of life is nearly extinct, they are returning thither with a renewed appetite for gardens laced by watercourses, for pleasant living amidst islands and houseboats and bridges, and for nocturnal lanterns reflected by the sea.|$|E

40|$|Measuring {{trends in}} the size of prehistoric populations is {{fundamental}} {{to our understanding of the}} demography of ancient people and their responses to environmental change. Archaeologists commonly use the temporal distribution of radiocarbon dates to reconstruct population trends, but this can give a false picture of population growth because of the loss of evidence from older sites. We demonstrate a method for quantifying this bias, and we use it to test for population growth through the Holocene of Australia. We used model simulations to show how turnover of site occupation across an archaeological landscape, interacting with erasure of evidence at abandoned sites, can create an increase in apparent site occupation towards the present when occupation density is actually constant. By estimating the probabilities of abandonment and erasure from archaeological data, we then used the model to show that this effect does not account for the observed increase in occupation through the Holocene in Australia. This is best explained by population growth, which was low for the first part of the Holocene but accelerated about 5000 years ago. Our results provide new evidence for the dynamism of <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>populations</b> through the Holocene. Christopher N. Johnson and Barry W. Broo...|$|R

Do recent initiatives repair or damage the interests of urban workers? This article examines these questions through a study of urban health insurance reform. It argues the state has taken over from work units the responsibility for health insurance, that collectivism has been partially preserved through redistrib utory "risk-pooling" systems, and that the party-state is moving away from its traditional state enterprise-centred working-class base and widening participation to include workers in the private and rural industrial sectors.

40|$|ABSTRACT DENTAL PATHOLOGY DISTRIBUTION AND SEX RATIOS IN WINDMILLER POPULATIONS FROM CENTRAL CALIFORNIA by Katharine E. Kolpan Master of Arts in Anthropology California State University, Chico Spring 2009 This thesis {{focuses on}} how dental pathologies {{may be used}} to make inferences about the {{subsistence}} patterns of a prehistoric hunter-gatherer population. Dental caries and dental attrition are often used as markers to indicate subsistence changes, such as the transition from foraging to agriculture. However, pathological changes to teeth may also be used to indicate differences in subsistence and dietary patterns among <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>populations.</b> Previous investigations in California and beyond have suggested that females display higher rates of dental caries than their male counterparts. Various lines of evidence have been used to explain the disparity in dental caries prevalence between men and women. Some have argued that it may be, in part, physiological, with female hormone production decreasing salivary flow and increasing the risk of developing dental caries. Others have suggested it is due to female's position as gatherers allowing them greater access to plant resources, which they may have consumed in larger quantities, both at meal times and in between meals. In this study, I analyze rates of dental caries among males and females from archaeological sites associated with Windmiller skeletal assemblages (ca. 4500 - 2500 B. P.) in California's Central Valley to test whether females exhibit statistically higher proportions of dental caries than males. I analyzed 138 and 111 individuals from the Windmiller (CA-SAC- 107) and Phelps (CA-SJO- 56) Mounds, respectively. The final sample included 11 individuals from the Windmiller Mound and 45 individuals from the Phelps Mound. These data were compared to 93 individuals from two previously analyzed Windmiller sites, the Blossom Mound (CA-SJO- 68) and the McGillivray # 1 Mound (CA-SJO- 142). While females exhibited a higher proportion of dental caries at all four sites, the difference was significant only in the Phelps and Blossom Mound samples. However, when caries rates for all four sites were combined females exhibited significantly more caries than males. While some of this disparity is likely due to physiological differences, I argue {{that the majority of the}} differences between the sexes in terms of dental caries may be due to female's roles as gatherers and their differential access to plant resources.

40|$|Forestland {{dynamics}} {{can affect}} the ecological security of a country and even the global environment, and therefore it is of great practical significance to understand the characteristics of temporal and spatial variations of forestland. Taking Jiangxi Province as the study area, this study first explored the driving mechanism of the natural environment and social economy on deforestation and afforestation using a simultaneous equation model. The results indicate that population size, topographic and geomorphologic factors, climate, and location play leading roles in influencing forestland density fluctuations. Specifically, the population size, economic development level, gross value of forestry production, climate conditions, and government policies are key influencing factors of afforestation. Deforestation is mainly influenced by agricultural <b>population,</b> <b>non-agricultural</b> economy, forestry production, forestry density, location, transportation, and climate. In addition, this study simulated the spatial distribution of land use and analyzed the spatial characteristics and variation trends of forestland area and quality under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) climate scenarios from 2010 to 2030 using the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects (CLUE) model.

40|$|The report {{describes}} {{prospects and}} challenges for Chinese agriculture until 2030 under different scenarios, using the Chinagro welfare model. A scenario {{is defined as}} a coherent set of assumptions about exogenous driving forces (farm land, <b>population,</b> <b>non-agricultural</b> growth, world prices etc.), derived from the literature and own assessments. Under these assumptions, simulations with the Chinagro model analyze the price-based interaction between the supply behavior of farmers, the demand behavior of consumers and the determination of trade flows by merchants. The outcomes from the "Baseline scenario" seem reassuring in that foreign imports remain moderate relative to Chinas size, though quite large as fraction of world trade. It would be possible to feed people as well as animals without excessive imports. There is even a potential for significant export flows of vegetables and fruits. Regarding concerns, the trends in per capita agricultural value added are problematic, because they stay in all regions behind per capita value added outside agriculture, albeit that they are rising steadily. This leads to growing disparity in per capita incomes within and across regions. The mounting environmental pressure from fertilizer losses and unused manure surpluses is another cause of concern. The second scenario, the Trade liberalization scenario, appears to hurt farm incomes more than it benefits them and to raise the gap with non-agriculture, also because food becomes cheaper in urban areas. Hence, it highlights the difficult choice between economic efficiency and poverty alleviation that agricultural policy makers often face. The "High income growth scenario" reinforces the national food self-sufficiency result of the baseline simulation. Even with meat demand higher than under the baseline, levels of imports remain manageable. The "High R&D scenario" shows that a considerable reduction in dependence on agricultural imports is possible. However, a substantial part of the gains will accrue to consumers rather than to farmers, due to price reductions. Finally, the "Enhanced irrigation scenario" shows outcomes {{similar to those of the}} high R&D scenario. Here also the agricultural trade balance improves and consumer welfare improves, but farmers have to cope with drops in prices, and those who do not benefit from land improvement, only experience losses through falling prices. The present report is written at the onset of the CATSEI-project that will analyze policy packages with more specificity and detail after implementing the following model improvements. First, the impact of Chinas imports and exports on world markets will be represented explicitly. Second, the developments outside agriculture in rural areas will be accounted for endogenously, particularly to represent farm revenue from off-farm employment. Third, the trade and transportation margins between farm-gates and markets will be made dependent on the relative flexibility of the actors (farmers, processors, traders) along the chain.

Research results {{are based on}} a systematic analysis studying the relationship between hotel development and urbanization. This study adopts pooled OLS, feasible generalized least square, and fixed effect model to study urbanization effects on hotel development. This study identifies that the GDP per capita, <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>population</b> proportion, hospital beds, length of highways, and domestic tourism are the key determinants affecting hotel development. All variables exhibit a positive relationship with hotel growth. This study provides insight and empirical evidences on how urbanization affects hotel development at the provincial level.

The author has analyzed the dynamics and components of city-population growth (1960 - 1997), the town-net structureas to size and population distribution (1990 — 1997), periods of city growth (1979 — 1997). There have been presented some aspects of territorial concentrati on of <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>population</b> in the country, their labor migration, changes of social and professional indicators related to rural population, their growing territorial and social mobile character...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture in China has {{experienced}} a compelling growth in the early 1980 s, a buoyant upbeat in the early 1990 s, and {{an extended period of}} low growth after 1995. Decollectivization, mar-ket reforms, public investments and technology have played a critical role during this overall successful process. However, the transition has also led to increasing inequalities between the agricultural and <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>population,</b> and substantial institutional issues remain to be fully addressed. The Chinese government is now reemphasizing agriculture and rural develop-ment under its New Rural Campaign with the objective to address rural-urban inequalities, but a stronger emphasis on participation and tenure reforms is warranted. agriculture, rural development, transition, institutions, China, Community/Rural/Urban Development, International Development, O 43, P 21, P 32,...|$|E
30|$|Urbanization, {{caused by}} {{scientific}} and technological progress {{as well as the}} development of productivity, is a historical process both of the agricultural population dispersing in agricultural functional areas and moving into the nonagricultural population in nonagricultural functional areas, as well as traditional rural society transforming into a modern urban society. The urbanized population is not only the traditional urban population of label significance, but is also a population that enjoys urban infrastructure and public service. The urban area is not only the area with administrative and geographic significance, but also the functional area of bearing <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>population</b> and industries. Chinese urbanization exhibits the increase of the number of cities, the expansion of urban areas, the increase of the urban population; as well as the change of jobs, the industrial structure, and spatial morphology. The great change of human society's organization methods, productive methods, and living method produces a new face of the economy, society, culture, environment, and human beings.|$|E
