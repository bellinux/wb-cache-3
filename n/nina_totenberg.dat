[...] However, other commentators criticized the majority opinion's methodology; Hadley Arkes, for example, wrote that the Court's decision [...] "revealed the unlovely spectacle of the conservatives talking themselves ever deeper into a genuine moral relativism in the regulation of speech". Some analysts also claimed the majority's opinion left open unanswered questions within the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. Lyle Denniston, for example, suggested that after the Court issued its decisions in Reed and Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, [...] "the meaning of the First Amendment, in general, became somewhat more confusing".
