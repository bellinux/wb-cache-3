25|$|Prehistoric Daepyeong {{incorporates}} in area {{formed by}} the curves of the Nam River in a single area of several small, linked alluvial plains that are semi-circumscribed by steep hills of 100–1100 metres. In the north, Daepyeong includes Sonam-ni and Eoeun, and in the south Okbang and Sangchon-ni are included. Eoeun and Okbang make up the central area and are partially protected by a <b>natural</b> <b>levee</b> formed by terracing {{and changes in the}} flow of the Nam River.|$|E
2500|$|Chhoti Gandak is a groundwater-fed {{meandering}} river originating near Dhesopool, Maharajganj {{district of}} Uttar Pradesh. It travels {{a distance of}} about [...] and joins Ghaghara near Guthani, Siwan district of Bihar. The Chhoti Gandak River Basin is located between 26°00' to 27°20' N latitude and 83°30' to 84°15' E longitude. [...] tributaries are Khekhra, Hirna, Jethan, Maun, Duhari, Kanchi and Koilar rivers; Khanua river joins from the left bank. The discharge of Chhoti Gandak is mainly controlled by rain, which is very high during the monsoon season and low during the summers. It has been observed that whenever precipitation is high in the catchment areas, there is flood in the downstream part of the Chhoti Gandak River Basin. The region exhibits upland terrace surface, river valley terrace surface, present-day river channel with narrow flood plains, <b>natural</b> <b>levee,</b> and point-bar deposits. All these geomorphic features are depositional in nature and made up of alluvium of different ages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>levees</b> {{occur when}} the {{floodplain}} of an alluvial river is primarily shaped by overbank deposition and when relatively coarse materials are deposited near the main channel. The <b>natural</b> <b>levees</b> become higher than the adjacent floodplain, leading {{to the formation of}} backswamps and yazoo channels, in which tributary streams are forced to flow parallel to the main channel rather than converge with the main channel.|$|R
50|$|Overbank {{deposits}} {{can also}} {{be referred to as}} floodplain deposits. Examples include <b>natural</b> <b>levees</b> and crevasse splays.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{seasonal}} flooding, {{possible from}} December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile floodplain in the Mississippi Delta. The river's flooding created <b>natural</b> <b>levees,</b> which planters had built higher {{to try to}} prevent flooding of land cultivated for cotton crops. Temporary workers built levees along the Mississippi River on top of the <b>natural</b> <b>levees</b> that formed from dirt deposited after the river flooded.|$|R
2500|$|The {{mainland}} {{behind the}} island {{on the south}} side was connected to the town of Tiptonville, Tennessee, by a good road on the <b>natural</b> <b>levee</b> of the river. This was the only approach to the island on dry land through Tennessee, as the region is otherwise a mixture of lakes, sloughs, and swamps, with the nearest high ground nearly [...] to the east. Reelfoot Lake, the largest of these, was [...] long and in places [...] wide. In low water, the northern end of Reelfoot Lake was near Tiptonville, but in high water such as was present in the spring of 1862, it extended north to beyond the bend. The water was nowhere very deep, so that individual soldiers could cross it by wading or using makeshift rafts, but an army trying to do so {{would not be able to}} move its heavy equipment, and also would lose cohesion. For these reasons, Island No. 10 was considered to be invulnerable to land attack from the Tennessee side. It also meant, however, that the only route for either reinforcement or escape was the Tiptonville road.|$|E
2500|$|New Orleans {{was founded}} in 1718 by the French as Nouvelle-Orléans, under the {{direction}} of Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville. [...] After considering several alternatives, Bienville selected the site for several strategic reasons and practical considerations, including: it was relatively high ground, along a sharp bend of the flood-prone Mississippi River, which thus created a <b>natural</b> <b>levee</b> (previously chosen as the site of an abandoned Quinipissa village); it was adjacent to the trading route and portage between the Mississippi and Lake Pontchartrain via Bayou St. John, offering access to the Gulf of Mexico port of Biloxi without going downriver 100 miles; and it offered control of the entire Mississippi River Valley, at a safe distance from Spanish and English colonial settlements. From its founding, the French intended it to be an important colonial city. [...] The city was named in honor of the then Regent of France, Philip II, Duke of Orléans. [...] The priest-chronicler Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix described it in 1721 as a place of a hundred wretched hovels in a malarious wet thicket of willows and dwarf palmettos, infested by serpents and alligators; he seems to have been the first, however, to predict for it an imperial future. In 1722, Nouvelle-Orléans was made the capital of French Louisiana, replacing Biloxi in that role.|$|E

50|$|Five {{artificial}} mounds, {{identified as}} Mounds 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, are {{in or near}} the stream meander zone. They are each round, about 100 feet in diameter, and two to three feet high. Most of these mounds are now part of the <b>natural</b> <b>levees</b> along the Fisheating Creek. The mounds may have been built on existing <b>natural</b> <b>levees,</b> or the presence of the mounds may have helped shape the levees. Three burials were found in Mound 13, which may have been used as a burial mound and later as a house mound. Mound 10 was not excavated. Little other than sherds were found in the other mounds.|$|R

50|$|The lower {{reaches of}} the Latrobe River, Thomson River and Mitchell River flow into the Gippsland Lakes and have {{extensive}} floodplains {{in which there are}} large wetlands, often separated by <b>natural</b> <b>levees</b> from the main river channels.|$|R
5000|$|The Sheyenne is {{classified}} as a [...] "perch river," [...] as its banks are higher than the surrounding ground, formed as <b>natural</b> <b>levees</b> in flooding centuries ago. When floodwaters break through the banks, they spread in a wide area.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately before {{large-scale}} human development, {{most of the}} Delta islands had saucer-like cross sections, {{with low}} <b>natural</b> <b>levees</b> flanking a marshy interior [...] "bowl" [...] that flooded intermittently with the seasons and tides. The height of these <b>natural</b> <b>levees,</b> formed from overbank deposits of sediments deposited by annual river floods, ranged from 1 ft above mean high tide at Sherman Island on the Sacramento River, to 7 to 8 ft at Andrus, Staten and Tyler Islands, located further east near the Mokelumne River. An estimated 60 percent of the Delta flooded {{for up to two}} hours each day at high tide; during spring tides or river floods, it was not uncommon for the entire Delta to be under water.|$|R

Between the Mississippi River and Little River District {{drainage}} ditches lies {{one of the}} oldest drainage systems in the United States, Crowley’s Ridge, established in 1905, is a remnant of an old coastal floodplain and <b>natural</b> <b>levee</b> that crosses the country.|$|E
50|$|Ouachita Parish was {{the home}} to many {{succeeding}} Native American groups in the thousands of years before European settlements began. Peoples of the Marksville culture, Troyville culture, Coles Creek culture and Plaquemine culture built villages and mound sites throughout the area. Notable examples include the Filhiol Mound Site, located on a <b>natural</b> <b>levee</b> of the Ouachita River.|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{the main}} river {{flows through the}} landscape, {{widening}} a valley and creating a floodplain. Sediment accumulates and creates a <b>natural</b> <b>levee.</b> Tributaries that want to enter the main channel are not allowed because of this levee. Instead, the water then enters the back swamps, or form a yazoo stream. Because yazoo streams are separated from the main river by natural levees, they flow and meander (streams and rivers rarely flow in straight lines) parallel to the main stream channel or river on the floodplain for a considerable distance. These series of smooth bends or curves flows with a slight gradient, usually south, and is normally blocked from entering by a <b>natural</b> <b>levee</b> along the larger stream. A yazoo stream will join the major river where it will eventually break through the natural levees and flow into the larger waterway at its belated confluence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>levees</b> {{commonly}} form around lowland {{rivers and}} creeks without human intervention.

50|$|Keeping floodwaters out of New Orleans {{motivated}} the region’s most influential landscape manipulation: the erection of artificial levees on {{the crown of}} <b>natural</b> <b>levees</b> to prevent overbank flooding. These levees were first built along the Mississippi River and then later along Lake Pontchartrain to prevent inundation of the city from the rear.|$|R
50|$|Yazoo stream {{formation}} {{can also}} be influenced by glacial processes. An example is {{the formation of the}} Montana Creek valley during the recent Little Ice Age. The Mendenhall Glacier carved out a wide floodplain that is domed in the center. High valley walls due to tectonic uplift and glacial outwash (the <b>natural</b> <b>levee)</b> create two yazoo streams that parallel the Mendenhall River.|$|E
5000|$|The Sliver by the River is a {{nickname}} {{for the area}} of New Orleans, Louisiana, closest to the Mississippi River, which escaped major flooding after Hurricane Katrina hit the city in 2005. It exists on higher ground, the <b>natural</b> <b>levee</b> built up by centuries of flooding before there was human settlement. It generally corresponds to the mid-19th-century Crescent City nickname for the city.|$|E
50|$|The Delta National Wildlife Refuge {{is located}} 10 mi east of Venice, Louisiana along the Mississippi River. The area formed when a breach in the <b>natural</b> <b>levee</b> of the Mississippi River {{occurred}} in 1862 approximately 100 mi below New Orleans, Louisiana.

30|$|This study {{discusses}} the formation mechanisms {{of the delta}} front reservoir of K 1 q 4 of the Quantou Formation in the central region of the Fuyu oil field and summarizes the types of deposition based on an analysis of facies markers and a comprehensive study of the sedimentary microfacies using well cores, logs, and geologic data. The results show that K 1 q 4 of the Quantou Formation mainly formed through shallow-water sedimentation on a delta front and includes five sedimentary microfacies: underwater distributary channels, underwater <b>natural</b> <b>levees,</b> underwater diversion bays, river mouth bars, and distal bars. Due {{to the effects of}} allocyclicity, the composite sand body evolved by vertical overlaying, whereas because of the effects of autocyclicity, the composite sand body evolved by horizontal transport. Three main types of composite sand bodies are located in the study area, including composite underwater distributary channels without levees, composite underwater distributary channels with <b>natural</b> <b>levees,</b> and composites of underwater river mouth bars with distributary channels.|$|R
