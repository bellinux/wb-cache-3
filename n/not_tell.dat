5|$|At first, Napoleon was {{not totally}} {{confident}} of victory. In {{a letter written}} to Minister of Foreign Affairs Talleyrand, Napoleon requested Talleyrand <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> anyone about the upcoming battle {{because he did not}} want to disturb Empress Joséphine.

5|$|In 1886, when Jacques van Marken was in France at a spa, Agneta Matthes found {{a letter}} from Maria Eringaard {{requesting}} the child support that he owed for their children, which led to Matthes discovering {{that her husband had}} begun a relationship with Eringaard in 1871 when she was aged 15, and that he had four children by her. Matthes solved the financial problems discreetly. She did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> van Markem that she knew about the affair until 1889, when Eringaard died of tuberculosis, as had two of her children.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century Vladimir Beneshevich (1874–1938) {{discovered}} parts of three more {{leaves of the}} codex in the bindings of other manuscripts {{in the library of}} Mount Sinai.

5|$|Minton {{informed}} Eisenhower of {{his intention}} to retire in a letter on September 7, 1956, in which he dryly stated his retirement was authorized by law. Eisenhower responded with a brief note wishing him a happy retirement. Although he did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> the president, Minton informed {{the members of the}} Court that his duties were too taxing on his health. His anemia had steadily worsened, slowing him physically and mentally. Minton served as a Justice until October 15, 1956, retiring after 7years and 3days of service. He was succeeded by William J. Brennan, Jr.|$|E

5|$|Reynolds did {{not believe}} there was time to make changes because, {{if there were any}} delays in publication, the {{newspaper}} would not be published {{before the end of the}} school year. After consulting with his supervisors, he opted to publish a four-page newspaper instead of a six-page one, omitting the pages containing the two stories in question. Cutting two pages removed a total of seven articles from the paper. Reynolds did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> the students about the decision, and they did not find out about it until the paper was delivered to the school.|$|E
5|$|Scull appealed his {{conviction}} to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a unanimous ruling in May 1959, {{the high court}} held in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Comm. on Law Reform and Racial Activities that the conviction violated Scull's 14th Amendment rights to due process because the committee's inquiry was so vague and so confusing that Scull could <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> what he was being asked.|$|E
5|$|Spall {{auditioned for}} another role, but Ridley Scott {{asked him to}} play Millburn. Trying to {{duplicate}} {{the reaction of the}} Alien cast to the chestburster scene, the director did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> the Prometheus cast that a Hammerpede puppet was in the silicon replica of Spall's body; Kate Dickie's scream is genuine. The character of Milburn was criticized, since no biologist would touch an unidentified, extraterrestrial organism displaying hostility. Spall defended his character, citing a deleted scene where Millburn holds a smaller, docile Hammerpede.|$|E

5|$|The cantata text does <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> a {{story but}} {{reflects}} {{different aspects of}} the Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} David C. Large wrote that, {{like any}} public pronouncements, these bylaws did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> {{the full story}} about HIAG's real goals. By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, {{he was able to}} tease out what the organisation stood for. For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving and fallen, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.|$|E

The episode ends with Pembleton going to the bar with his fellow detectives, which he seldom does.|$|E

A few days later, Eva goes to her massage appointment with Marianne and realizes that Albert is Marianne's ex-husband after Marianne tells a story about how he manages to pick out onions when scooping salsa — the same story Albert had told Eva, but about guacamole. Tess then arrives at the house and Eva's suspicions are confirmed. Marianne tries to introduce Eva to Tess, but Eva hides behind a tree to avoid the meeting. Eva continues seeing Albert, keeping her friendship with Marianne a secret; likewise, she does <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> Marianne that she is seeing him.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010 Archie Comics {{introduced}} an openly gay character, Kevin Keller in Veronica #202, {{though it was}} only published in the U.S. and Canada. In the story, Veronica quickly falls for the new-boy-in-town, with a sweet smile and chiseled good looks, Kevin. Kevin beats Jughead in a burger-eating contest, and he tells Jughead that he's not interested in Veronica because he's gay. Unbeknownst to Kevin, Jughead has a score to settle with Veronica. So, when Jughead requests for Kevin <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> Veronica about his sexuality, Kevin willingly agrees. The bulk of the story is about Veronica's cluelessness.|$|E
5|$|Mario and Aldo were {{surprised}} to find a half-mile dirt racing track when they moved to Nazareth. The twins worked on a 1948 Hudson Commodore modified funded by money that they earned in their uncle's garage in 1959. They took turns racing the old Hudson on oval dirt tracks near Nazareth in 1959. They did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> their parents that they were racing. The twins each had two wins after their first four races. Aldo was seriously hurt {{near the end of}} the season, and their parents were unhappy to find out that the twins were racing. Mario had 21 modified stockcar wins in 46 races in 1960 and 1961.|$|E
