50|$|The {{first human}} trial of DOM was {{conducted}} in Japan in 2008 with 16 male volunteers examining the effect of <b>Nigari</b> (natural salty sea or lake water) standardized on magnesium in a two way, randomized cross over study. The healthy subjects were given a fat load test prior to measuring effect of postprandial (after meal) hyperlipidaemia. They found that Mg supplementation reduced and delayed the postprandial serum and chylomicron TAG responses after fat loading. The data indicates that Mg supplementation may contribute to preventing the atherogenic process in healthy subjects.|$|E

Due to their firmness, some {{of these types of}} tofu can be tied by rope and carried. These types of firm tofu are produced with seawater instead of <b>nigari</b> (magnesium chloride), or using concentrated soy milk. Some of them are squeezed to eliminate excess moisture by using heavy weights. These products are produced in areas where travelling is inconvenient, such as remote islands, mountain villages, and heavy snowfall areas.|$|E

50|$|Hilal Naqvi {{started his}} poetry with Ghazal in 1967. Later his {{interest}} expanded to {{other forms of}} poetry as well. So, basically he is a poem writer. He became famous because of adopting a new style in marsiya writing. He used the third line of stanza free from following qafia of other three lines. It was discussed too much in literally debates.Dr Hilal Naqvi is one of the very authentic poets of Jadeed Marsia <b>Nigari.</b> Listening the Marsiya by Josh Malih Abaadi inspired him for marsiya writing. So he wrote the first marsiya in 1970, when he was a student of B.A. He presented the marsya to Josh Malih Abadi for correction. Josh has called him his very first student in one of his letters. Dr Hilal Naqvi was also a student of Naseem Amrohvi Sahib who guided him on his journey of writing Marsiya. Dr Hilal Naqvi has also written many Ghazals, Poems, Rubayaats and free verses.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nigari,</b> an {{effluent}} of salt industries, is less expensive fertilizer. Without testing {{its effect on}} bioactive substances, {{it may not be}} suitable for fertilizer. Greenhouse trials were conducted over two years to evaluate antioxidant content, fruit quality, yield, and mineral contents in fruits and leaves of sweet pepper ‘Papri new-E-red’ by application of three <b>nigari</b> concentrations at 0, 2 and 4 mL L - 1 and additional N P K to equal the standard. Capsaicin, ?-carotene, ascorbic acid, fruit quality attributes, and fruit mineral compositions were evaluated at five different ages of fruits at 25 Days after fruit set (DFS), 35 DFS, 45 DFS, 55 DFS, and 65 DFS. Results revealed that capsaicin, ?-carotene, ascorbic acid, fruit quality, and mineral contents in fruits and leaves of sweet pepper increased with increasing rate of <b>nigari</b> compared to the control. Furthermore, capsaicin, and ?-carotene increased linearly with the advancement of fruit ages, but not ascorbic acid. Exceptionally, ascorbic acid increased until the turning of fruit maturity at 45 DFS and after that decreased drastically. Total soluble solid (o Brix) and titratable acidity (TA) were higher at 45 DFS, although an increasing trend was found for most of the mineral contents with maturing fruits. We concluded that a higher amount of antioxidant and improved fruit quality with higher yield and moderate mineral contents in fruits could be achieved by application of 2 mL L - 1 <b>nigari</b> to sweet pepper in soilless culture. We can also suggest harvesting sweet pepper fruits between 45 to 55 DFS. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{beneficial}} effect of magnesium supplementation on exercise performance {{has been reported}} by many researchers. In the present study, the effect of <b>nigari,</b> a concentrate of deep seawater containing high magnesium levels, on exercise performance, was examined. Gerbils were given double-distilled water or <b>nigari</b> (18 mg · kg- 1, po) orally 30 min before exercise. All animals were subjected to forced exercise on a treadmill for 90 min at three successive speeds of 10, 15, and 20 m · min- 1. The retention numbers were recorded. The retention numbers were 85. 0 ± 21. 0, 46. 0 ± 9. 7, and 48. 0 ± 14. 2 in the control group, and 44. 0 ± 10. 9, 23. 0 ± 8. 4, and 13. 0 ± 4. 8 in the nigari-treated group at the three speeds, respectively. The retention numbers were significantly reduced at higher speeds (by 50 % at 15 and 73 % at 20 m · min- 1, respectively) in the nigari-treated group when compared {{to those of the}} control group, respectively. Thus, <b>nigari</b> administration appeared to reduce retention numbers and enhance exercise performance in gerbils...|$|E

40|$|Green tea catechins, {{especially}} {{epigallocatechin gallate}} (EGCG), {{have been linked}} {{with a number of}} health benefits. However, only drinking green tea may not provide a sufficient level of EGCG to achieve those health benefits. Incorporation of EGCG in tofu, which is a protein-rich food widely used in Asia, and by vegetarians in Western countries, is an alternative way of enhancing the intake of EGCG and its health promoting effects. The present study optimised the conditions necessary to obtain the optimum yield of tofu including concentration of soy protein isolate (SPI), coagulant and pressing time; it then further investigated the possibility of fortifying EGCG in tofu via the effect of EGCG on tofu production yield and the recovery of EGCG. It was possible to fortify both firm and silken tofu with EGCG. The results showed that optimum yield of firm tofu was obtained at 6 % (w/w) SPI, 30 mM <b>Nigari</b> and 50 min pressure; and for the silken was at 6 % (w/w) SPI, 30 mM GDL and 20 min pressure. EGCG recovery was higher in the silken tofu than the firm one. For both types of tofu, the EGCG addition was suggested at a level of 0. 5 % (w/w) to obtain the optimum yield of tofu, which resulted in 0. 97 g and 0. 95 g of EGCG in a serve of 100 g of firm and silken tofu, respectively...|$|E
