In this paper, zirconia slurry for making zirconia fiber was prepared by inorganic salt solution added with zirconia powders, effect of content of PVA, PEG and zirconia powder solid content <b>of</b> the <b>slurry</b> on properties <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> was studied. It can be concluded that the content of PEG as a dispersing agent was 5 wt. %, dispersibility of zirconia powder and stability <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> got its best, where viscosity <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> improved correspondingly. Solid content of zirconia powder had an important impact on the rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>slurry,</b> when zirconia solid content was less than 30 %, the slurry showed as a pseudoplastic fluid, whereas the zirconia solid content <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> became 40 % and 50 % it exhibited plastic fluid characteristics.

40|$|In this study, slurry {{availability}} {{and the extent}} <b>of</b> the <b>slurry</b> mixing (i. e., among fresh slurry, spent slurry, and residual rinse-water) were varied via three different injection schemes. An ultraviolet enhanced fluorescence technique was employed to qualitatively indicate slurry {{availability and}} its flow on the pad during polishing. This study investigated standard pad center area slurry application and a slurry injection system (SIS) that covered only the outer half of the wafer track. Results indicated that the radial position <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> injection and the alteration of fluid mechanics by the SIS played important roles in slurry mixing characteristics and availability atop the pad. Removal rates were found to decrease with slurry availability, while a higher degree <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> mixing decreased the fraction <b>of</b> fresh <b>slurry</b> and consequently lowered the removal rate. By using a hybrid system (i. e., a combination <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> injection via SIS and standard pad center slurry application), the polishing process benefited from higher slurry availability and higher fraction <b>of</b> fresh <b>slurry</b> than the conventional pad center slurry application and the shorter SIS, individually.

30|$|In coal–oil co-processing, the {{temperature}} <b>of</b> coal–oil <b>slurry</b> after heating by the preheater is generally up to 380 – 400  °C. The coal will decompose and generate {{a large amount}} of free radicals during heating. The free radicals are very unstable. If there is sufficient active hydrogen, the free radicals can combine with the active hydrogen to generate small molecular substances. The small molecular substances can reduce the viscosity <b>of</b> coal–oil <b>slurry.</b> However, if the active hydrogen is insufficient, the free radicals themselves will aggregate to produce macromolecular substances. The macromolecular substances can increase the viscosity <b>of</b> coal–oil <b>slurry.</b> Generally, the viscosity <b>of</b> coal–oil <b>slurry</b> changes significantly during heating. Viscosity is an important parameter of the preheater design. Viscosity is also important to determine the flow status <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> and to calculate pressure drop and heat transfer. Therefore, it is necessary to study the viscosity variations <b>of</b> coal–oil <b>slurry</b> during heating at high pressure. The study on the viscosity variations <b>of</b> coal–oil <b>slurries</b> is mainly in direct coal liquefaction (Okutani et al. 1984; Tsutsumi and Yoshida 1986; Deng et al. 1987; Xiong et al. 2009).

40|$|Agricultural {{slurries}} contain useful {{amounts of}} plant nutrients. However, {{the quantity of}} these nutrients available in a particular slurry {{is not easy to}} quantify without laboratory facilities. Thus, when these slu-rries are applied to land, their fertilizer potential is often unknown. This has both agronomic and environ-mental implications. In order to achieve the goal of making better agronomic use <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> and reducing pollution risks, con-venient methods and means are necessary to (1) quantify the nutrients in slurry and (2) spread them effi-ciently and accurately in accordance with codes of good agricultural practice.

40|$|The {{objectives}} <b>of</b> manure or <b>slurry</b> management on intensive pig {{farms are}} the provision <b>of</b> adequate <b>slurry</b> storage capacity and the efficient recycling <b>of</b> the <b>slurry</b> nutrients for crop production. However, recent surveys <b>of</b> pig <b>slurry</b> dry matter suggest there is excessive dilution <b>of</b> raw pig <b>slurry</b> with water. This has two {{important implications for}} management. The first is greater storage capacity will be required due to the increased volume <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> generated. Slurry storage is expensive. For example, a 350 sow unit adding 10 weeks storage needs to invest £ 50, 000. Secondly, evidence from the literature indicates an improved slurry nitrogen efficiency with the more dilute manure. The results of field trials showed that higher dry matter pig slurries reduced the relative efficiency <b>of</b> pig <b>slurry</b> nitrogen for second cut silage production. This is probably linked to reduced ammonia volatilisation losses, consequent to the less viscous nature <b>of</b> dilute <b>slurry</b> which permits a more rapid infiltration of the ammonium nitrogen into the soil. The use of a band spreader or shallow injection rather than the conventional splash plate were shown {{to increase the efficiency}} <b>of</b> pig <b>slurry</b> nitrogen for grass silage production. Therefore, the potential for the higher pig slurry dry matter, required for cost effective storage/ handling costs, to reduce the efficiency of its nitrogen for grass silage production can be partially offset by using band spreaders or shallow injection spreading systems.
