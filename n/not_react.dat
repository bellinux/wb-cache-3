5|$|Silver does <b>not</b> <b>react</b> with air, even at red heat, {{and thus}} was {{considered}} by alchemists as a noble metal along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms copper(I) oxide when heated in air to red heat) and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air {{to form the}} black silver sulfide (copper forms the green sulfate instead, while gold does <b>not</b> <b>react).</b> Unlike copper, silver will <b>not</b> <b>react</b> with the halogens, {{with the exception of}} the notoriously reactive fluorine gas, with which it forms the difluoride. While silver is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as dilute or concentrated nitric acid. In the presence of air, and especially in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{reactive}} element in its group; it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe2+. However, it does <b>not</b> <b>react</b> with concentrated nitric acid and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer, which can nevertheless react with hydrochloric acid.|$|E

5|$|Copper does <b>not</b> <b>react</b> with water, {{but it does}} slowly {{react with}} {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E

Mac, Max and Logan finish their report, but the {{professor}} cuts Logan off in the middle and dislikes it. Leo becomes a deputy again, while Vinnie enters the Sheriff’s office and states his intention to run against Keith in the special election.|$|E
5|$|During these events, no gunshots were fired. The {{people did}} <b>not</b> <b>react</b> strongly, which {{according}} to the military, {{was a sign of}} approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E

5|$|Flock {{behaviour}} in sheep {{is generally}} only exhibited {{in groups of}} four or more sheep; fewer sheep may <b>not</b> <b>react</b> as expected when alone or with few other sheep. Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E
5|$|Indium metal does <b>not</b> <b>react</b> with water, {{but it is}} {{oxidized}} by stronger {{oxidizing agents}} such as halogens to give indium(III) compounds. It does not form a boride, silicide, or carbide, and the hydride InH3 has at best a transitory existence in ethereal solutions at low temperatures, being unstable enough to spontaneously polymerize without coordination. Indium is rather basic in aqueous solution, showing only slight amphoteric characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions.|$|E
5|$|Mendeleev further {{predicted}} that eka-aluminium would be discovered {{by means of}} the spectroscope, and that metallic eka-aluminium would dissolve slowly in both acids and alkalis and would <b>not</b> <b>react</b> with air. He also {{predicted that}} M2O3 would dissolve in acids to give MX3 salts, that eka-aluminium salts would form basic salts, that eka-aluminium sulfate should form alums, and that anhydrous MCl3 should have a greater volatility than ZnCl2: all of these predictions turned out to be true.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Suzuki felt {{compelled}} to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on. The Japanese government did <b>not</b> <b>react.</b> Emperor Hirohito, the government, and the war council considered four conditions for surrender: {{the preservation of the}} kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, or Formosa, and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.|$|E

5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does <b>not</b> <b>react</b> with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Triazole-based carbenes are {{thermodynamically}} {{stable and}} have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 210–220 ppm for the carbenic carbon. The X-ray {{structure of the}} triphenyl substituted carbene above shows an N-C-N bond angle of ca. 101°. The 5-methoxytriazole precursor to this carbene {{was made by the}} treatment of a triazolium salt with sodium methoxide, which attacks as a nucleophile. This may indicate that these carbenes are less aromatic than imidazol-2-ylidenes, as the imidazolium precursors do <b>not</b> <b>react</b> with nucleophiles due to the resultant loss of aromaticity.|$|E

Van Nistelrooy did <b>not</b> <b>react</b> and was escorted away by Manchester United captain Roy Keane, but the incident escalated away from the two of them. In defence of their teammate, Manchester United players Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gary Neville, Mikaël Silvestre, Quinton Fortune and Rio Ferdinand also became involved in the situation.|$|E
5|$|Bart and his catchphrase {{continue}} to be popular, while Krusty creates {{a wide array of}} merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins to fear that the fad will wear off, so he tries to expand his act and personality during an interview on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him that he should continue because he makes people happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but the audience is bored with the line and does <b>not</b> <b>react.</b> With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did <b>not</b> <b>react</b> to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E
