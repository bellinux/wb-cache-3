Asymptotically far from the defect, the wave number of the LDOS oscillations at the Fermi energy is usually equal to the distance between <b>nesting</b> <b>segments</b> of the Fermi contour, and the envelope of the LDOS oscillations shows a power-law decay as {{moving away from the}} line defect.

Our findings provide evidence of strongly anisotropic Dirac fermion-mediated interactions. Even more remarkably, the validity of our findings goes beyond topological insulators but applies for systems with spin orbit lifted degeneracy in general.

40|$|Achieving {{arcsecond}} {{angular resolution}} in a grazing-incidence foil-optic x-ray telescope (such as the segmented mirror approach {{being considered for}} the NASA Constellation-X mission) requires accurate placement of thousands of individual foils. We have developed a method for assembling large numbers of <b>nested,</b> <b>segmented</b> foil optics with sub-micron accuracy using lithographically defined and etched silicon alignment microstructures, called microcombs [1] (see Fig. 1). A system of assembly tooling incorporating the silicon microstructures, called an assembly truss, is used to position the foils that are then bonded to an engineered flight structure. The advantage of this procedure is that the flight structure has relaxed tolerance requirements while the high accuracy assembly tooling can be reused. We have built and tested an experimental assembly truss to demonstrate this alignment and mounting technique [2]. This system has demonstrated ~ 0. 5 micron assembly accuracy, corresponding to ~ 1 arcsecond angular tolerance. In this paper we will review the microcomb fabrication process and assembly concept, and present results of recent efforts to model and measure the effects of bending stresses and Hertzian forces on the design and accuracy o...|$|R
50|$|The {{foundation}} of each nest is generally {{by a single}} female founder haplometrotically. It is possible, rarely, for two females to cohabit a colony at its founding, but this scenario does not represent the norm. There are {{a limited number of}} females per colony, suggesting that the females tend to abandon the colony once they achieve a certain level of ovarian development. Nevertheless, because satisfactory sites for nidification are rare, there is a large number of females without colonies that are looking for a good region on which to found a nest, or a nest that they could strategically usurp. As a result, the rare cases where there are two females at foundation {{are more likely to be}} a form of usurpation rather than cooperation. Researchers have yet to perform long-term studies on P. jacobsoni; like most hover wasps, P. jacobsoni has not undergone long-term observation so there is only limited information on their colony cycles. Similar Parischnogaster species, however, demonstrate a five-stage colony cycle, with a pre-emergence period divided into foundation and initial <b>nest</b> <b>segments,</b> and a post-emergence period divided into young colony, middle-age colony and mature colony segments.|$|R

40|$|Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are {{double-stranded}} DNA viruses with segmented genomes that replicate {{only in the}} oviducts of {{some species}} of parasitic wasps and are required for the successful parasitization of lepidopteran insects. PDV DNA segments are integrated in the genomes of their associated wasp hosts, and some are nested; i. e., smaller segments are produced from and largely colinear with larger segments. To determine the internal structure of <b>nested</b> viral <b>segments,</b> the first complete nucleotide sequence of a PDV genome segment and its integration locus was determined. By restriction mapping, Southern blot, and sequence analyses, we demon-strated that the Campoletis sonorensis PDV segment W is integrated into wasp genomic DNA. DNA sequence analysis revealed that proviral segment W terminates in two 1, 185 -bp direct long terminal repeats (LTRs) in the wasp chromosome, while only one LTR copy {{is present in the}} extrachromosomal (viral) W. The results suggest that terminal direct repeats are a general feature of PDV DNA segment integration but that the homology and size of the repeats can vary extensively. Segment W contains 12 imperfect direct repeats of six different types between 89 bp and 1. 9 kbp with 65 to 90 % homology. The orientation and structure of the repeats suggest that W itself may have arisen through sequence duplication and subsequent divergence.

Within such a collective, kinship ties and adherence to group obligations ensured and strengthened the coherence of social networks. Chief among these was the collective code which directed tribal members’ conduct and which equated personal honor with conformity to group interests and unconditional loyalty to the group (Abu-Lughod 1986; Abu-Rabia-Queder 2007; Eickelman 1989; Lancaster 1981).|$|R

40|$|Nested {{transactional}} memory (TM) facilitates software composition {{by letting}} one module invoke another without either knowing whether the other uses transactions. Closed nested transactions extend isolation of an inner transaction until the toplevel transaction commits. Implementations may flatten nested transactions into the top-level one, {{resulting in a}} complete abort on conflict, or allow partial abort of inner transactions. Open nested transactions allow a committing inner transaction to immediately release isolation, which increases parallelism and expressiveness {{at the cost of}} both software and hardware complexity. This paper extends the recently-proposed flat Log-based Transactional Memory (LogTM) with nested transactions. Flat LogTM saves pre-transaction values in a log, detects conflicts with read (R) and write (W) bits per cache block, and, on abort, invokes a software handler to unroll the log. Nested LogTM supports <b>nesting</b> by <b>segmenting</b> the log into a stack of activation records and modestly replicating R/W bits. To facilitate composition with nontransactional code, such as language runtime and operating system services, we propose escape actions that allow trusted code to run outside the confines of the transactional memory system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring egg-laying, some endoparasitic wasps {{transmit}} a polydnavirus {{to their}} caterpillar host, causing physiological disturbances that benefit the wasp larva. Members {{of the two}} recognized polydnavirus taxa, ichnovirus (IV) and bracovirus (BV), have large, segmented, dsDNA genomes containing virulence genes expanded into families. A recent comparison of IV and BV genomes revealed taxon-specific features, but the IV database consisted primarily of the genome sequence of a single species, the Campoletis sonorensis IV (CsIV). Here we describe analyses of two additional IV genomes, the Hyposoter fugitivus IV (HfIV) and the Tranosema rostrale IV (TrIV), which we compare to the sequence previously reported for CsIV. The three IV genomes share several features including a low coding density, a strong A+T bias, similar estimated aggregate genome sizes (∼ 250  kb) {{and the presence of}} <b>nested</b> genome <b>segments.</b> In addition, all three IV genomes contain members of six conserved gene families: repeat element, cysteine motif, viral innexin, viral ankyrin, N-family, and a newly defined putative family, the polar-residue-rich proteins. The three genomes, however, differ in their degree of segmentation, in within-family gene frequency and in the presence, in TrIV, of a unique gene family (TrV). These interspecific variations may reflect differences in parasite/host biology, including virus-induced pathologies in the latter...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{prefrontal cortex}} subserves {{executive}} control, i. e., {{the organization of}} action or thought in relation to internal goals. This brain region hosts a system of executive processes extending from premotor to the most anterior prefrontal regions that governs the temporal organization of behavior. Little is known, however, about the prefrontal executive system involved in the hierarchical organization of behavior. Here, we show using magnetic resonance imaging in humans that the posterior portion of the prefrontal cortex, including Broca's area and its homolog in the right hemisphere, contains a system of executive processes that control start and end states and the <b>nesting</b> of functional <b>segments</b> that combine in hierarchically organized action plans. Our results indicate that Broca's area and its right homolog process hierarchically structured behaviors regardless of their temporal organization, suggesting a fundamental segregation between prefrontal executive systems involved in the hierarchical and temporal organization of goal-directed behaviors...|$|R

I examined the spatial variation of macroinvertebrate community structure: abundance, richness, evenness, percentage of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), and taxonomic composition across {{a wide range of}} spatial scales in two mountain streams. In a <b>nested</b> design, three <b>segments</b> were selected within each basin, three riffles within each segment, three sections within each riffle, and three samples within each section. Significant variation of communities occurred mainly at sample and riffle scales, although different community characteristics may vary at different scales. Environmental factors were strongly related to communities, but these relationships depended on spatial scale in many cases, suggesting that the influence of the environment is ultimately regulated by the grain and extent of organisms. This study highlights the importance of multiscale studies to obtain a complete understanding of the spatial variation of macroinvertebrate communities and their relationship with the environment...|$|R
40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that surface {{magnetic}} doping of topological insulators induces backscattering of Dirac states which are usually protected by time-reversal symmetry [Sessi et al., Nat.

Here we report on quasiparticle interference measurements where, by improved Fermi level tuning, strongly focused interference patterns on surface Mn-doped Bi 2 Te 3 could be directly observed by means of scanning tunneling microscopy at 4 K. Ab initio and model calculations reveal that their mesoscopic coherence relies on two prerequisites: (i) a hexagonal Fermi surface with large parallel <b>segments</b> (<b>nesting)</b> and (ii) magnetic dopants which couple to a high-spin state. Indeed, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism shows superparamagnetism even at very dilute Mn concentrations.

40|$|Interchromosomal duplications are {{especially}} important {{for the study of}} X-linked genes. Males inheriting a mutation in a vital X-linked gene cannot survive unless there is a wild-type copy of the gene duplicated elsewhere in the genome. Rescuing the lethality of an X-linked mutation with a duplication allows the mutation to be used experimentally in complementation tests and other genetic crosses and it maps the mutated gene to a defined chromosomal region. Duplications {{can also be used to}} screen for dosage-dependent enhancers and suppressors of mutant phenotypes as a way to identify genes involved in the same biological process. We describe an ongoing project in Drosophila melanogaster to generate comprehensive coverage and extensive breakpoint subdivision of the X chromosome with megabase-scale X segments borne on Y chromosomes. The in vivo method involves the creation of X inversions on attached-XY chromosomes by FLP-FRT site-specific recombination technology followed by irradiation to induce large internal X deletions. The resulting chromosomes consist of the X tip, a medial X segment placed near the tip by an inversion, and a full Y. A nested set of medial duplicated segments is derived from each inversion precursor. We have constructed a set of inversions on attached-XY chromosomes that enable us to isolate <b>nested</b> duplicated <b>segments</b> from all X regions. To date, our screens have provided a minimum of 78 % X coverage with duplication breakpoints spaced a median of nine genes apart. These duplication chromosomes will be valuable resources for rescuing and mapping X-linked mutations and identifying dosage-dependent modifiers of mutant phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|Premise of the study: Wood {{specific}} gravity (WSG) mediates an interspecific trade-off between growth and mortality {{and is a}} key measure for estimating carbon stocks. Most studies use species mean values to represent WSG, despite variation {{at different levels of}} biological organization. We examined sources of variation in WSG across four <b>nested</b> scales (<b>segments</b> within cores, cores within trees, trees within species, and species), compared the pattern of radial variation in WSG among species differing in growth strategies, and investigated the effect of WSG radial variation on aboveground biomass estimates. Methods: We took two perpendicular cores from six individuals each of 20 tropical tree species representing a broad range of mean WSGs and growth–mortality strategies in a lowland tropical moist forest in Panama. Cores were divided into 1 -cm segments, and WSG was determined for each segment. Key results: The bulk of the total variance in WSG was dominated by interspecies variation (88 %), whereas variation due to measurement error, segments within cores, and cores within trees (8 %) was minimal. Radial variation in WSG, defined as change in WSG with increasing distance from the pith, was significant in 17 of the 20 species and included significant monotonic increases in 6 species and nonmonotonic patterns in 11 species. Radial variation in WSG resulted in a small but significant bias in aboveground biomass estimates. Conclusions: Radial variation in WSG is related to a species’ growth strategy and, though minimal compared with interspecific variation in WSG, can cause a downward bias when not incorporated into aboveground biomass estimates. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the genetic and statistical {{properties of the}} nested association mapping (NAM) design currently being implemented in maize (26 diverse founders and 5000 distinct immortal genotypes) to dissect the genetic basis of complex quantitative traits. The NAM design simultaneously exploits the advantages of both linkage analysis and association mapping. We demonstrated the power of NAM for high-power cost-effective genome scans through computer simulations based on empirical marker data and simulated traits with different complexities. With common-parent-specific (CPS) markers genotyped for the founders and the progenies, the inheritance of chromosome <b>segments</b> <b>nested</b> within two adjacent CPS markers was inferred through linkage. Genotyping the founders with additional high-density markers enabled the projection of genetic information, capturing linkage disequilibrium information, from founders to progenies.

By integrating genetic design, natural diversity, and genomics technologies, this new complex trait dissection strategy should greatly facilitate endeavors to link molecular variation with phenotypic variation for various complex traits...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a fragment of}} separation logic, called NOLL, for auto- mated reasoning about programs manipulating overlaid and nested linked lists, where overlaid means that the lists may share {{the same set of}} objects.

We prove that checking the entailment between two NOLL formulas is co-NP complete. For this result, the decision procedure for entailment is based on a small model property. We also provide an effective procedure for checking entailment in NOLL, which first con- structs a Boolean abstraction of the two formulas, in order to infer all the implicit constraints, and then, it checks the existence of a homomorphism between the two formulas, viewed as graphs. We have implemented this procedure and ap- plied it on verification conditions generated from several interesting case studies that manipulate overlaid and nested data structures...|$|R

Specifically, a temporal information among consecutive phases is exploited via a coupling between deformable models and graph cuts which provides automated accurate cues for graph cuts and also good initialization scheme for deformable model that ultimately leads to more accurate and smooth segmentation results with lower interaction costs than using only graph cut segmentation. In addition, we define deformable model as a region defined by two <b>nested</b> contours and <b>segment</b> epicardium and endocardium in an unified way by optimizing single energy functional. This approach provides inherent coherency among the two contours thus leads to more accurate results than deforming separate contours for each target.

40|$|The random-phase {{approximation}} (RPA) is here {{applied to}} a two-orbital model for the BiS 2 -based superconductors that was recently proposed by Usui et al., arXiv: 1207. 3888. Varying the density of doped electrons per Bi site, n, in the range 0. 46 < n < 1. 0, the spin fluctuations promote competing A 1 g and B 2 g superconducting states with similar pairing strengths, in analogy with the A 1 g-B 1 g near degeneracy found also within RPA in models for pnictides. At these band fillings, two hole-pockets centered at (0, 0) and (π,π) display nearly parallel Fermi Surface segments close to wavevector(π/ 2,π/ 2), whose distance increases with n.

Last year the author found that Onthophagus ater WATERHOUS could become an intermediate host of the said tapeworms. This year the author found a large number of ants living inside and outside the chicken yards carrying to their <b>nests</b> many <b>segments</b> of the tapeworms. So after having examined whether the ants were infected with cysticercoids or not, the author found that a small dark brown species, Pheidole fervida F.

The cysticercoids were approximately elliptical in shape with the larval scolex invaginated into the bladder and entirely surrounded by a heavy cyst wall. Neither caudal appendage nor embryonal hooks were observed on any of the specimens examined. The larvae were filled with calcaresus corpuscles which masked the internal structure. In general the cysticercoids (Fig. 1) infected in Pheidole fervida F. SMITH arelarger than those (Fig. 2) of Tetramorium caespiturn subsp. jacoti WHEELER. Both cysticercoids which infected in the two species of ants were only mature cysticercoids and the developing stage of them were not found.

40|$|Search is an {{important}} tool in an ant's navigational toolbox to relocate food sources and find the inconspicuous nest entrance. In habitats where landmark information is sparse, homing ants travel their entire home vector before searching systematically with ever increasing loops. Search strategies have not been previously investigated in ants that inhabit landmark-rich habitats where they typically establish stereotypical routes. Here we examine the search strategy in one such ant, Melophorus bagoti, by confining their foraging in one-dimensional channels to determine if their search pattern changes with experience, location of distant cues and altered distance on the homebound journey. Irrespective of conditions, we found ants exhibit a progressive search that drifted towards the fictive <b>nest</b> and beyond. <b>Segments</b> {{moving away from the}} start of the homeward journey were longer than segments heading back towards the start. The right tail distribution of segment lengths was well fitted by a power function, but slopes less than - 3 on a log-log plot indicate that the process cannot be characterized as Lévy searches that have optimal slopes near - 2.

40|$|In {{everyday}} settings, spatial attention helps listeners isolate {{and understand}} individual sound sources. However, the neural mechanisms of auditory spatial attention (ASpA) are only partially understood. This thesis uses within-subject analysis of functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data to address fundamental questions regarding cortical mechanisms supporting ASpA by applying novel multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) approaches. A series of fMRI studies of ASpA were conducted in which subjects performed a one-back task in which they attended to one of two spatially separated streams. Attention modulated blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activity in multiple areas in the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortex, including non-visuotopic intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but not the visuotopic maps in IPS. No spatial bias was detected in any cortical area using standard univariate analysis; however, MVPA revealed that activation patterns in a number of areas, including the auditory cortex, predicted the attended direction. Furthermore, we explored how cognitive task demands and the sensory modality of the inputs influenced activity with a visual one-back task and a visual multiple object tracking (MOT) task. Activity from the visual and auditory one-back tasks overlapped along the fundus of IPS and lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC). However, there was minimal overlap of activity in the lPFC between the visual MOT task and the two one-back tasks. Finally, we endeavored to identify visual and auditory networks using rsFC. We identified a dorsal visual attention network reliably within individual subjects using visuotopic seeds. Using auditory seeds, we found a prefrontal area <b>nested</b> between <b>segments</b> of the dorsal visual attention network. These findings mark fundamental progress towards elucidating the cortical network controlling ASpA. Our results suggest that similar lPFC structures support both ASpA and its visual counterpart during a spatial one-back task, but that ASpA does not drive visuotopic IPS in the parietal cortex. Furthermore, rsFC reveals that visual and auditory seed regions are functionally connected with non-overlapping lPFC regions, possibly reflecting spatial and temporal cognitive processing biases, respectively. While we find no evidence for a spatiotopic map, the auditory cortex is sensitive to direction of attention in its patterns of activation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Chromosome rearrangements {{occur in}} a variety of {{eukaryotic}} life cycles, including during the development of the somatic macronuclear genome in ciliates. Previous work on the phyllopharyngean ciliate Chilodonella uncinata revealed that macronuclear-tubulin and protein kinase gene families share alternatively processed germ line <b>segments</b> <b>nested</b> within diver-gent regions. To study genome evolution in this ciliate further, we characterized two additional alternatively processed gene families from two cryptic species of the ciliate morphospecies C. uncinata: those encoding histidine acid phosphatase protein (Hap) and leishmanolysin family protein (Lei). Analyses of the macronuclearHap and Lei sequences reveal that each gene family consists of three members in the macronucleus that are marked by identical regions nested among highly divergent regions. In-vestigation of the micronuclearHap sequences revealed a complex pattern in which the three macronuclear sequences are de-rived either from a single micronuclear region or from a combination of this shared region recombined with additional dupli-cate micronuclear copies ofHap. We propose a model whereby gene scrambling evolves by gene duplication followed by partial and reciprocal degradation of the duplicate sequences. In this model, alternative processing represents an intermediate step in the evolution of scrambled genes. Finally, we speculate on the possible role of genome architecture in speciation in ciliates by describing what might happen if changes in alternatively processed loci occur in subdivided populations.

Includes maps and colored illustrations. I developed and evaluated methodologies for studying ecological communities. The first component of my work, Chapter 2, develops a scientific framework, {{referred to as}} the nutshell philosophy, for classifying aquatic habitats in the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway. The "nutshell" is a compact philosophy for practitioners, including two parts: (1) a classification framework using a small set of environmental predictor variables; and (2) test of the classification using biological data. My classification resulted in two units: segments and reaches. Segments have a dimension of 15 + km and are delineated by major tributary outlets and channel slopes. Reaches are <b>nested</b> within the <b>segments,</b> with a dimension of 2 + km and are delineated by changes in stream substrate. A data set of mussel communities was clustered to test the classification. The clusters were consistent with the segments. The "nutshell" philosophy was validated in this case. The second component of my work, Chapter 3, introduces a method investigating stream substrate with underwater videos. With it a desired large area can be covered, and the resulting videos can be archived and used for quantitative analysis. The third component of my dissertation, Chapters 4 and 5, relate to clustering methods. Chapter 4 investigates impacts of selected cluster number on the accuracy of clustering algorithms. I clustered data sets of known structure with three different methods, varying the cluster number; clustering accuracy was evaluated using the Rand statistic. The Elbow phenomenon was typically found for the response of the Rand statistic with the cluster number. I described the Rand curves with an analytical relationship and proposed a threshold slope of 0. 001 to locate the optimal cluster number. Chapter 5 evaluates performance of an emerging clustering method, Self-Organizing Map (SOM), with the more traditional methods of K-mean and Unweighted-Pair-Group-Method-using-Arithmetic-Averages (UPGMA). The SOM method was similar to the K-means in performance, and it was the best clustering method overall because of its additional and exceptional visualization feature. Although the UPGMA method also has visualization feature and worked well with data of low complexity, its performance decreases substantially with data of medium or high complexity...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{addressed}} {{to the problem of}} how it is possible to conduct coherent, purposeful conversations. It describes a computer model of a conversation between two robots, each robot being represented by a section of program. The conversation is conducted in a small subset of English, and is a mixed-initiative dialogue which can involve interruptions and the <b>nesting</b> of one <b>segment</b> of dialogue in another. The conversation is meant to arise naturally from a well defined setting, so that it is clear whether or not the robots are saying appropriate things. They are placed in a simple world of a few objects, and co-operate in order to achieve a practical goal in this world. Their conversation arises out of this common aim; they have to agree on a plan, exchange information, discuss the consequences of their actions, and so on. In previous language-using programs, the conversation has been conducted by a robot and a human operator, rather than by two robots. In these systems, it is almost always the human operator who takes the initiative and determines the overall structure of the dialogue, and the processes by which he does so are hidden away in his mind. The aim of our program is to make these processes totally explicit, and {{it is for this reason}} that we have used two robots and avoided human participation. Thus the main focus of interest is not the structuring of individual utterances, but the higher-level organisation of the dialogue, and how the dialogue is related to the private thoughts which underlie it. The program has two kinds of procedure, which we call ROUTINES and GAMES, the Games being used to conduct sections of conversation and the Routines to conduct the underlying thoughts. These procedures can call each other in the normal way. Thus the occurrence of a section of dialogue will be caused by the call of a Game by a Routine; and when the section of dialogue ends, the Game will exit, returning control to the Routine which called it. There are several Games, each corresponding to a common conversational pattern, such as a question and its answer, or a plan suggestion and the response to it. The Games determine what can be said, who will say it, how each remark will be analysed, and how it will be responded to. They are thus joint procedures, in which the instructions are divided up between the robots. When a section of dialogue occurs, the relevant Game will be loaded in the minds of both robots, but they will have adopted different roles in the Game, and will consequently perform different instructions and make different utterances...|$|R
