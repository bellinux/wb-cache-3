Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin and Portuguese mass {{was replaced by}} Indonesian mass. Before the invasion, only 20 percent of East Timorese were Roman Catholics, and by the 1980s, 95 percent were registered as Catholics. With over 90 percent Catholic population, East Timor is currently {{one of the most}} densely Catholic countries in the world.|$|E
