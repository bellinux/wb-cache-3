5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was <b>not</b> <b>carrying</b> a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E

Halfway through filming series two, Macfadyen got to carry a gun {{for the first time in}} the series; he was disappointed in <b>not</b> <b>carrying</b> one in the first series.|$|E

5|$|In November 1791, a French convoy sailed from Mahé on {{the short}} journey to Mangalore. The convoy {{included}} two merchant vessels and the frigate Résolue, a 36-gun warship under Captain Callamand. Passing northwards, the convoy soon passed Tellicherry and Cornwallis sent Strachan with Phoenix and Perseverance to stop and inspect the French ships to ensure they were <b>not</b> <b>carrying</b> military supplies. As Smith halted the merchant ships and sent boats to inspect them, Strachan did the same to Résolue, hailing the French captain and placing an officer in a small boat to board the frigate. The French captain was outraged at this violation of his neutrality, and responded by opening fire: British sources suggest that his initial target was the small boat, although Phoenix was the ship most immediately damaged.|$|E
5|$|NY141 {{begins at}} a trumpet {{interchange}} with NY9A {{on the western}} edge of the hamlet of Hawthorne, located within the town of Mount Pleasant. This junction also serves as the south end of NY9A's overlaps with NY100. NY141 initially heads to the northeast as an independent route, following the two ramps <b>not</b> <b>carrying</b> either direction of NY100. After just , all four ramps merge into a four-lane divided highway, creating a short overlap between NY141 and NY100. The divided highway ends at Brighton Avenue, the first road that it intersects. NY100 splits from NY141 here, following Brighton Avenue southward while NY141 heads southeastward along the two-lane Broadway, passing through a lightly developed commercial area. After one block, the route intersects Bradhurst Avenue, here a state-maintained street serving as a one-block spur of NY100.|$|E
5|$|The ACCC {{conceded that}} the state governments were <b>not</b> <b>carrying</b> on {{businesses}} in procuring the medical products. This meant that the governments were immune from Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental immunity. On 16 May 2005, The Federal Court of Australia (Allsop J presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance. While {{the court held that}} Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental immunity under Section2B extended to Baxter Healthcare. Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices Mansfield, Dowsett and Gyles presiding). The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating that the question of derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of Bradken.|$|E

5|$|On 23 March, Pattle flew {{his first}} {{missions}} with No. 33 Squadron, now based at Larissa. They flew as escort for Blenheims from No. 84 Squadron over the Pindus Mountains and Paramythia. Supported by No. 112 Squadron Gladiators, they flew to raid Berat. The cloud base {{was low and}} thick and they descended below it at 1,900 feet. The bombers attacked and two Hurricanes were badly damaged by ground fire. One of the squadron was shot down by a Fiat G.50 and bailed out — the Italians disappeared before they could retaliate. In the afternoon, he was briefed to strafe the heavily defended Fieri airfield. It was an unpopular sort of mission. At 25,000 feet, they were intercepted and a dogfight began with G.50s and Macchi C.200s. Only Pattle and one other Hurricane attacked the airfield. Furious, Pattle berated the pilots for <b>not</b> <b>carrying</b> out their primary assignment. He had claimed one enemy fighter as a probable and proceeded to the airfield to claim another victory — his 25th — and claimed another three on the ground.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September, Emden {{entered the}} Bay of Bengal, {{achieving}} complete surprise, since the British assumed {{she was still}} with Spee's squadron. She operated on shipping routes there without success, until 10 September, when {{she moved to the}} Colombo–Calcutta route. There, she captured the Greek collier Pontoporros, which was carrying equipment for the British. Müller took the ship into his service and agreed to pay the crew. Emden captured five more ships; four were sunk, and the fifth, a steamer named Kabinga, was used to carry the crews from the other vessels. On 13 September, Müller released Kabinga and sank two more British prizes. Off the Ganges estuary, Emden caught a Norwegian merchantman; upon searching her, the Germans determined she was <b>not</b> <b>carrying</b> contraband and therefore released her. The Norwegians informed Müller that Entente warships were operating in the area, and so he decided to return to the eastern coast of India.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is <b>not</b> <b>carrying</b> eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E
