5|$|Federally, Boston {{is split}} between two congressional districts. The {{northern}} {{three-fourths of the}} city is in the 7th district, represented by Mike Capuano since 1998. The southern fourth is in the 8th district, represented by Stephen Lynch. Both are Democrats; a Republican has <b>not</b> <b>represented</b> a significant portion of Boston in over a century. The state's senior member of the United States Senate is Democrat Elizabeth Warren, first elected in 2012. The state's junior member of the United States Senate is Democrat Ed Markey, who was elected in 2013 to succeed John Kerry after Kerry's appointment and confirmation as the United States Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|Hooper {{was born}} in England but has <b>not</b> <b>represented</b> the {{national}} team at any level. In March 2011 {{it was thought that}} he may be eligible to represent Scotland. However, this possibility was later closed off. Since his move to Celtic he has been considered for England duty and was called up to the under-21 squad for a friendly but had to pull out due to injury. He was then included in the provisional squad for the 2011 European Under-21 Championship but did not go to the tournament.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} after World War I, Britain, Japan and the US all began design work on {{a new generation of}} ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers. The new burst of shipbuilding that each nation's navy desired was politically controversial and potentially economically crippling. This nascent arms race was prevented by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, where the major naval powers agreed to limits on capital ship numbers. The German navy was <b>not</b> <b>represented</b> at the talks; {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Versailles, Germany was not allowed any modern capital ships at all.|$|E
5|$|It is {{no longer}} {{possible}} for active parliamentarians to sit on the committee, except for the last half year of parliamentary representation, if they have stated that they will not run for re-election. This allowed Jagland and Valle to sit on the committee in 2009, while they were still elected. The appointment is made by parliament after nominations by the parties who are to be represented in the committee. In 2009, the Labour Party had two seats, while the three next-largest parties, the Progress Party, the Conservative Party and the Socialist Left Party, each have one representative. The remaining parties in parliament are <b>not</b> <b>represented.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like the Council, {{from time}} to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior {{military}} officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from the NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was <b>not</b> <b>represented</b> on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members. Such {{was the case in the}} lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.|$|E

The IFPI operates in 66 countries and services affiliated industry associations in 45 countries. In some cases, the IFPI is merely affiliated with the already operational certification bodies of a country, but in many others countries with lesser-developed industries, the IFPI acts as the sole certifying body servicing the country or region's music industry. Still other countries <b>not</b> <b>represented</b> by the IFPI have certifying bodies operating independently, such as individual record companies which service the country or region's music industry as a whole.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper; the claim {{is based on an}} exponential function of whether the sandwich has the ingredient or <b>not,</b> <b>represented</b> by a binary number of 0 or 1, raised to the power of number of possible ingredients at the time, ten, thus 210 =1,024. This claim was later expanded to There are 221,184 possible ways for a customer to order a Whopper sandwich. Other slogans include It takes two hands to handle a Whopper and Burger King: Home of the Whopper.|$|E

Hancock was not yet a political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.|$|E

5|$|After the war Helm {{identified}} with the Democratic Party, and {{he returned to the}} state senate in 1865. During his tenure he chaired the Committee on Federal Relations and fought against punitive and restrictive laws against ex-Confederates. On January 22, 1866 he presented to the state senate a protest against the actions of the United States Congress during the Civil War. It denounced the Reconstruction Amendments {{on the grounds that they}} granted powers to the federal government that were reserved for the states, and that they were passed while many southern states were <b>not</b> <b>represented</b> in Congress. He also decried the creation and operation of the Freedmen's Bureau. On January 29, 1867, Helm introduced legislation to organize a meeting in Louisville to rally support for President Andrew Johnson and his efforts to restore the Union.|$|E

The station crest of the former RAF Leuchars, Fife, also showed the Saltire, in this case surmounted by a sword. The crest of the former RAF East Fortune, East Lothian, also showed a sword surmounting the Saltire, however unlike Leuchars this sword was shown inverted, and the station crest of the former RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, showed a Saltire surmounted by an eagle's head. The East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron crest features a Saltire surmounted by an open book; the book itself being supported by red lions rampant.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was <b>not</b> <b>represented</b> by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E

40|$|According to {{a popular}} but {{controversial}} view in contemporary party research, political parties increasingly put a premium on governing within {{the institutions of the}} state rather than on representation of interests and identities in society. This critique has been phrased most uncompromisingly in Richard Katz and Peter Mair’s theory of the cartel party, according to which the cartel party governs but does <b>not</b> <b>represent,</b> and thus fails to do what we expect of parties in a modern democracy. This article is an analysis and critique of this presupposition, which has largely escaped the attention of commentators. The idea that the cartel party governs but does <b>not</b> <b>represent</b> rests on an untenable view of political representation. As I argue, the normative problem with the cartel party is not so much that this type of party does <b>not</b> <b>represent,</b> as to decide when and how it does or does <b>not</b> <b>represent...</b>|$|R
