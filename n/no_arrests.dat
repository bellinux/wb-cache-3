5|$|In {{the early}} hours of March 18, 1990, guards at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston {{admitted}} two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call. Once inside, the men tied up the guards and, over the next hour, stole 13 works of art valued at $500 millionthe largest-value theft of private property in history. Despite efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and multiple probes around the world, <b>no</b> <b>arrests</b> have been made and no works have been recovered.

5|$|Four {{years after}} the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for {{physicians}} to prescribe contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses). This second clinic, the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923. To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women. The existence of the clinic was finally announced {{to the public in}} December 1923, but this time there were <b>no</b> <b>arrests</b> or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years of struggle, birth control had finally become widely accepted in the United States. The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.|$|E

5000|$|Speaking {{on the day}} of Zimmerman's arrest, Al Sharpton said, [...] "Forty-five days ago, Trayvon Martin was murdered. <b>No</b> <b>arrest</b> was made. The Chief of Police in Sanford {{announced}} {{after his}} review of the evidence there would be <b>no</b> <b>arrest.</b> An outcry from all over this country came because his parents refused to leave it there." [...] Jesse Jackson also referred to Martin as [...] "murdered and martyred". And U.S. Rep.

5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of Rosewood had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people, and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities {{were aware of the}} violence, <b>no</b> <b>arrests</b> were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black residents; none ever moved back.|$|E
25|$|Within {{three days}} of the crime, prime {{suspects}} had been identified. <b>No</b> <b>arrests</b> were made, however, until over {{two weeks after the}} killing. The officer who had been leading the murder investigation from its third day, and who would ultimately lead the murder squad for 14 months, explained to an incredulous public inquiry in 1998 that part of the reason <b>no</b> <b>arrests</b> had taken place by the fourth day after the killing (Monday 26 April) was that he had not known the law allowed arrest upon reasonable suspicion – a basic point of criminal law.|$|E
25|$|The FBI {{investigation}} lasted five years. <b>No</b> <b>arrests</b> or indictments occurred, and {{in early}} 2009, Justice Department officials closed {{the case and}} announced {{they would not be}} filing any charges.|$|E

50|$|On his {{way home}} that December, Foster was met by {{government}} officials at the Toronto, Canada, airport while trying to board a connecting flight. Foster's passport was scanned and sent to Washington, D.C., but <b>no</b> <b>arrest</b> or further confrontations ever materialized.|$|R

5000|$|Justice Jackson was [...] "convinced {{that there}} are, many {{unlawful}} searches {{of homes and}} automobiles of innocent people which turn up nothing incriminating, in which <b>no</b> <b>arrest</b> is made, about which courts do nothing, and bout which we never hear." [...] (Jackson, J., dissenting).|$|R
6000|$|... "That doesn't matter," [...] he answered. [...] "It {{was from}} a quarter where they ought to know better, and it ordered me to make <b>no</b> <b>arrest.</b> I have sent to the War Office to-day a full report, and I am praying that they may change their minds." ...|$|R
25|$|As of 2015, the New Orleans Police Department {{has made}} <b>no</b> <b>arrest</b> in the case, despite a $15,000 Crimestoppers reward being {{in effect for}} any {{information}} leading to an indictment. The case received extensive media coverage, including national radio, television, and print coverage in the United States and Canada.|$|R
25|$|In 1996, Cambridge University Library {{realised}} {{that its}} {{two copies of}} Newton's Principia Mathematica, {{from the collection of}} the Bishop of Ely, were missing.

In 1960, a U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Profaci's deportation order, ending the legal action.|$|R
5000|$|At trial, {{the judge}} held {{that there was}} <b>no</b> <b>arrest</b> as the {{inspector}} was not authorized to use [...] "reasonable force." [...] The verdict was overturned on appeal.
