5000|$|When using Mahalanobis {{distance}} or covariant discriminant [...] {{to calculate}} the similarity of two proteins based on their amino acid compositions, to avoid the divergence problem due to the normalization condition imposed to their 20 constituent components, a dimension-reduced operation is needed by leaving {{out one of the}} 20 components and making the remaining 19 components completely independent. However, which one of the 20 components should be removed? Will the result be different by removing a different component? The same problems also occur when the calculation is based on (20 + λ)-D (dimensional) pseudo amino acid composition, where λ is an integer. Generally speaking, {{to calculate the}} Mahalanobis distance or covariant discriminant between two vectors each with Ω <b>normalized</b> <b>components,</b> the dimension-reduced operation is needed and hence the aforementioned problems are always to occur.

30|$|This {{manuscript}} uses HH subband of {{the images}} for WM embedding. Singular value matrices (S matrices) of the HH coefficients of the host image and the WM image are combined for watermark embedding. The amount of WM embedding {{is determined by the}} <b>normalized</b> principal <b>components</b> (NPC). Principal components are evaluated for the HH coefficients of the host and the WM images. This can be interpreted as a principal component analysis (PCA) fusion which fuses the singular values of HH coefficients of the host and the WM images. Since linear weighted fusion rule is applied for the singular value matrices of the frequency subbands of DWT, pitfalls of spatial domain fusion are eliminated. The novelty of the proposed method lies on the evaluation of <b>normalized</b> principal <b>components</b> as scaling factors for embedding process. Hence the proposed method distances itself from the conventional DWT–SVD–PCA watermarking. Performance of this method is analyzed by peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) and correlation coefficient (CC). Various experiments are conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed method. We also test the proposed method against geometrical and non-geometrical attacks on watermarked images.|$|R

In this paper {{we want to}} obtain their superposition and investigate their non-classical properties such as antibunching effect, quadrature squeezing and amplitude squared squeezing. For this purpose two types of superposition are considered. In the first type we neglect the normalization factors of the two components of the dual pair, superpose them and then we normalize the obtained states, while in the second type we superpose the two <b>normalized</b> <b>components</b> and then again normalize the resultant states.

The procedures were compared in terms of: (i) image uniformity, (ii) performance {{as a function of}} count rate, and (iii) impact on the estimate of the binding potential (BP) in brain rat studies. Image uniformity studies were performed on two cylindrical phantoms of different size filled with an aqueous concentration of 11 C (38 kBq/mL and 615 kBq/mL). BP was estimated with the Logan graphical approach on 12 11 C-Methylphenidate and 9 11 C-Dihydrotetrabenazine rat studies processed with all the normalization procedures.

The k th moment {{as a function of}} time can be characterized in terms of a differential equation involving lower moment functions and the time-dependent server-occupation probability. For general initial conditions, we show that the first two moment functions can be represented as the difference of two nondecreasing functions, one of which is the moment function starting at zero. The two nondecreasing components can be regarded as probability cumulative distribution functions (cdf’s) after appropriate normalization. The normalized moment functions starting empty are called moment cdf’s; the other <b>normalized</b> <b>components</b> are called moment-difference cdf’s. We establish relations among these cdf’s using stationary-excess relations. We apply these relations to calculate moments and derivatives at the origin of these cdf’s.

It is interesting that these various time-dependent characteristics can be described directly in terms of the steady-state workload distribution...|$|E
