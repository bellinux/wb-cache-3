A <b>nanoshell</b> is a 100 nanometer spherical shell of metal (often gold) surrounding a core of silicon dioxide atoms.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason this}} method is revolutionary is that the size and {{relative}} thickness of the gold <b>nanoshell</b> can be controlled by changing {{the amount of time}} the reaction is allowed to take place as well as the concentration of the plating solution.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} optical characterization of near infrared (NIR) gold <b>nanoshells</b> for the use as luminescent contrast agents for applications in small animal blood vessel imaging. Two types of gold-silica <b>nanoshells</b> excitable by NIR lasers are investigated: Type 1 <b>nanoshells</b> can be excited with a sub-mum NW laser, whereas Type 2 <b>nanoshells</b> can be excited with a NW laser in the micrometer range. Using NIR microscopy as an imaging platform, ex vivo and in vivo experiments are conducted to determine the efficacy of these <b>nanoshells</b> as suitable contrast agents. Specifically, individual particles of Type 1 <b>nanoshells</b> are successfully imaged and shown to provide bright optical contrast for blood vessel imaging both ex vivo and in vivo, while the Type 2 <b>nanoshells</b> are clearly imaged within the blood vessels ex vivo. These positive results suggest a promising possibility of developing {{a new class of}} contrast agents for deep tissue imaging and improving the imaging depth of NIR imaging techniques...|$|R

The optical properties of gold <b>nanoshells,</b> such as scattering, absorption, and asymmetry values were calculated with Mie scattering theory. For comparison and experimental quantifications, scattering coefficients were extracted from OCT images using Extended Huygens-Fresnel (EHF) principle based algorithms. With the addition of Her 2 conjugated <b>nanoshells,</b> ex vivo OCT images of human breast cancer tissue, which express signatures of Her 2 /neu, provide significant contrast in comparison to the normal and malignant controls. As an extended study of dual NIR absorbing/scattering <b>nanoshells</b> for integrated cancer imaging and therapy in vitro, combined OCT imaging and photothermal tumor ablation was performed in vivo. Results showed that gold <b>nanoshells</b> selectively accumulated in the tumorous regions and enabled clear differentiation of tumor. Tumor regression by the photothermal ablation using NIR tuned <b>nanoshells</b> was also reported.

This discovery is introducing other studies, such as encapsulation methods for hair loss.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} <b>nanoshell</b> {{plasmonics}} in cancer treatment involves placing drugs {{inside of the}} nanoparticle and {{using it as a}} vehicle to deliver toxic drugs to cancerous sites only. This is accomplished by coating the outside of a nanoparticle with iron oxide (allowing for easy tracking with an MRI machine), then once the area of the tumor is coated with the drug-filled nanoparticles, the nanoparticles can be activated using resonant light waves to release the drug.|$|E
50|$|A {{direct method}} of {{accessing}} and destroying tumour cells {{can be accomplished}} by photothermal cancer therapy or photodynamic therapy (PDT). This procedure is known to treat small tumours that are difficult to access and avoids the drawbacks (adverse effects) of conventional methods, including the unnecessary destruction of healthy tissues. The cells are destroyed by exposure to light, rupturing membranes causing the release of digestive enzymes. AuNPs have high absorption cross sections requiring only minimal input of irradiation energy. Human breast carcinoma cells infused with metal nanoparticles in vitro have been shown to have an increase in morbidity with exposure to near infrared (NIR). Short term exposure in vivo (4-6 minutes) to NIR had undergone the same effect. Hirsch et al observed that extreme heating in tumours would cause irreversible tissue damage including coagulation, cell shrinkage and loss of nuclear straining. Results of their in vivo <b>nanoshell</b> therapy of mice revealed penetration of the tumor ~5mm.The metal particles were tuned to high absorption and scattering, resulting in effective conversion of light into heat covering a large surface area.The El-Sayed group studied AuNP effects in vitro and in vivo. They determined that the NIR wavelengths were converted into heat on the picosecond timescale, allowing for short exposure of CW to minimize possible exposure to healthy cells. In vitro, photothermal therapy was used in oral epithelial cell lines, (HSC 313 and HOC 3 Clone 8) and one benign epithelial cell line (HaCaT). El-Sayed et al found that the malignant cells that had undergone incubation in AuNPs conjugated with anti-epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) required half the energy to destroy a cell than a benign cell. Their material included gold coated silica nanoshells that could selectively absorb NIR waves. The particles were tuned by varying the thickness of the Au shell and changing the size of the silica core. In exposing these particles to NIR, the efficacy of Au was measured through the decrease of EFGR in oral squamous carcinoma cells.|$|E

40|$|Several {{significant}} applications {{have been}} realized for light scattering in biomedical imaging. In {{order to improve}} imaging results with light scattering-based techniques, a variety of nanoparticles have been investigated as contrast agents, including gold <b>nanoshells.</b> As a method for studying the optical properties of plasmonic gold nanoparticles used as contrast agents for molecular imaging, we developed an automated goniometer instrumentation system. This system, which allows us to specifically study polarized angular-dependent light scattering of plasmonic nanoparticles, allowed us to perform a series of theoretical and experimental step-wise studies. The basic optical properties of the following gold nanoparticles were progressively investigated: (1) bare <b>nanoshells</b> at multipolar plasmonic resonances, (2) <b>nanoshells</b> with PEG modifications, (3) surface-textured <b>nanoshells</b> and (4) immunotargeted <b>nanoshells</b> (nanoshell-antibody bioconjugates) for cancer imaging. Based on the results from these studies, a new technique was developed to quantitatively measure the number of immunotargeted nanoparticles that bind to HER 2 -positive SKBR 3 human breast cancer cells. Preliminary studies of determining the minimal incubation time of immunotargeted <b>nanoshells</b> with SKBR 3 cells were also carried out to evaluate the potential clinical application of using gold <b>nanoshells</b> intraoperatively. We, therefore, anticipate that our findings will provide the theoretical groundwork required for further studies aimed at optimizing the application of plasmonic nanoparticles in scattering-based optical imaging techniques...|$|R
40|$|Metal nanoshells possess plasmon {{resonances}} {{that are}} controlled by the geometry of the nanoparticle. Because <b>nanoshell</b> plasmon resonances can be readily predicted by the plasmon hybridization model or Mie scattering theory, {{it is possible to}} design a <b>nanoshell</b> to possess specifically chosen plasmonic properties. This thesis examines how to optimize the <b>nanoshell</b> geometry for various sensing applications. Although the <b>nanoshell</b> plasmon can be described within the quasistatic limit using plasmon hybridization, experimentally feasible <b>nanoshell</b> plasmons are also influenced by finite size effects. It is thus important to gain insight into the properties of the <b>nanoshell</b> plasmon in this mesoscopic regime in order to optimize the <b>nanoshell</b> geometry for applications such as the plasmon enhanced fluorescence. We examine the roles of the nanoparticle plasmon resonance energy and nanoparticle scattering cross-section on the fluorescent emission of indocyanine green (ICG). We find that enhancement of the molecular fluorescence is optimized when the <b>nanoshell</b> exhibits a large scattering cross section and a plasmon resonance energy which corresponds to the emission frequency of ICG. Another potential biomedical application for <b>nanoshell</b> is their use as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors. We investigate the geometrical parameters that determine the sensitivity of an Au-nanoshell SPR sensor. It was found that the sensitivity of the <b>nanoshell</b> plasmon to its embedding medium depends primarily on total <b>nanoshell</b> size and less sensitively on core/shell ratio. It is clear from these studies that the efficacy of a <b>nanoshell</b> used in a particular application depends on more parameters than just the plasmon resonance energy...|$|E

A {{modeling}} {{study on}} energy absorption and transport {{in an isolated}} <b>nanoshell</b> and aggregates of nanoshells under localized surface plasma resonance (SPR) conditions is presented. A comprehensive model for multi-scattering of electromagnetic waves by a cluster of multilayered nanoshells is developed, which applies the Wigner-Eckart theorem for the calculation of the total scattering cross sessions of <b>nanoshell</b> aggregates. Absorption by an isolated <b>nanoshell</b> and by <b>nanoshell</b> clusters is studied using the model.

40|$|Background High intensity-focused {{ultrasound}} (HIFU) is an alterative ablative technique {{currently being}} investigated for local treatment {{of breast cancer}} and fibroadenomas. Current HIFU therapies require concurrent magnetic resonance imaging monitoring. Biodegradable 500 nm perfluoropentane-filled iron-silica <b>nanoshells</b> have been synthesized as a sensitizing agent for HIFU therapies, which aid both mechanical and thermal ablation of tissues. In low duty cycle high-intensity applications, rapid tissue damage occurs from mechanical rather than thermal effects, which can be monitored closely by ultrasound obviating the need for concurrent magnetic resonance imaging. Materials and methods Iron-silica <b>nanoshells</b> were synthesized by a sol-gel method on polystyrene templates and calcined to yield hollow <b>nanoshells.</b> The <b>nanoshells</b> were filled with perfluoropentane and injected directly into excised human breast tumor, and intravenously (IV) into healthy rabbits and Py 8119 tumor-bearing athymic nude mice. HIFU was applied at 1. 1 MHz and 3. 5 MPa at a 2 % duty cycle to achieve mechanical ablation. Results Ex vivo in excised rabbit livers, the time to visually observable damage with HIFU was 20 s without <b>nanoshells</b> and only 2 s with <b>nanoshells</b> administered IV before sacrifice. <b>Nanoshells</b> administered IV into nude mice with xenograft tumors were activated in vivo by HIFU 24 h after administration. In this xenograft model, applied HIFU resulted in a 13. 6 Â± 6. 1 mm 3 bubble cloud with the IV injected particles and no bubble cloud without particles. Conclusions Iron-silica <b>nanoshells</b> can reduce the power and time to perform HIFU ablative therapy and can be monitored by ultrasound during low duty cycle operation. Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.
