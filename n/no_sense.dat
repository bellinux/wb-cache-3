40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is a toxic, {{free radical}} gas with diverse {{biological}} roles in eukaryotes and bacteria, {{being involved in}} signalling, vasodilation, blood clotting and immunity and as an intermediate in microbial denitrification. Several bacterial transcriptional regulators sense this molecule and regulate the expression of genes involved in both NO detoxification and NO damage repair. However, a recently discovered <b>NO</b> <b>sensing</b> repressor, named NsrR, has gained attention because of its suggested role as a global regulator of the bacterial NO stress response. Recent advances in biochemical and transcriptomic studies of NsrR make it timely to review the current evidence for NsrR as a global regulator and to speculate on the recent controversy over its <b>NO</b> <b>sensing</b> mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Pathogenic {{bacteria}} {{encounter the}} toxic free radical nitric oxide (NO) during infection via {{the activity of}} host nitric oxide synthases or via the reduction of nitrite and nitrate in the gut by commensal bacteria. Survival of bacterial pathogens during infection depends on various mechanisms for <b>NO</b> <b>sensing</b> and detoxification. The foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni detoxifies NO to nitrate using a globin protein (Cgb), expression of which is induced strongly and specifically by the transcription factor NssR upon exposure to NO. Previous work indicates that nitric oxide does not directly modulate the interaction of NssR with target DNA, suggesting {{the existence of an}} indirect method for <b>NO</b> <b>sensing.</b> Bioinformatics analysis has revealed that NssR is likely to bind cyclic nucleotides, and cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) has previously been linked to <b>NO</b> <b>sensing</b> in other bacteria via a mechanism involving NO-responsive phosphodiesterase and cyclase enzymes. Structural modelling described herein is consistent with NssR binding to cyclic nucleotides, and tryptophan fluorescence quenching confirms the ability of NssR to bind to c-di-GMP, cAMP and cGMP. Subsequently, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) suggests that that binding of c-di-GMP to NssR leads to increase in affinity for the cgb promoter. Finally, an in vivo reporter assay provides direct evidence that c-di-GMP can influence NssR activity. Taken together, these data are consistent with an in vivo mechanism whereby NO elevates c-di-GMP levels in the cell, which in turn activates NssR activity resulting in Cgb expression and NO detoxification. This work provides potential molecular explanation for how <b>NO</b> is <b>sensed</b> and detoxified in C. jejuni...|$|R

All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} use of fluorescently labeled {{cytochrome}} c peroxidase (CcP) from baker's yeast for monitoring nitric oxide (NO) down to the sub-micromolar level, {{by means of a}} FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer) mechanism. The binding affinity constant (Kd) for the NO binding to CcP was determined to be 10 ± 1. 5 μM. The rate of NO dissociation from the CcP (koff) and the second order rate constant for the NO association (kon) were found to be 0. 22 ± 0. 08 min− 1 and 0. 024 ± 0. 002 μM− 1 min− 1 respectively. The immobilization of fluorescently labeled CcP into a polymeric matrix for use in a solid state <b>NO</b> <b>sensing</b> device was also explored. The results provide proof-of-principle that labeled CcP can be successfully implemented in a fast, simple, quantitative and sensitive <b>NO</b> <b>sensing</b> device...|$|R
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO), {{synthesized}} in eukaryotes by the NO synthases, {{has multiple}} roles in signalling pathways and in protection against pathogens. Pathogenic microorganisms have apparently evolved defence mechanisms that counteract {{the effects of}} NO and related reactive nitrogen species. Regulatory proteins that <b>sense</b> <b>NO</b> mediate the primary response to NO and nitrosative stress. The only regulatory protein in enteric bacteria known to serve exclusively as an NO-responsive transcription factor is the enhancer binding protein NorR (refs 9, 10 - 11). In Escherichia coli, NorR activates the transcription of the norVW genes encoding a flavorubredoxin (FlRd) and an associated flavoprotein, respectively, which together have NADH-dependent NO reductase activity. The NO-responsive activity of NorR raises important questions concerning the mechanism of <b>NO</b> <b>sensing.</b> Here we show that the regulatory domain of NorR contains a mononuclear non-haem iron centre, which reversibly binds NO. Binding of NO stimulates the ATPase activity of NorR, enabling the activation of transcription by RNA polymerase. The mechanism of NorR reveals an unprecedented biological role for a non-haem mononitrosyl-iron complex in <b>NO</b> <b>sensing...</b>|$|R

5|$|Anwar Sadat was {{convinced}} that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but within three months of sending troops to Yemen, Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments. Ahmed Abu-Zeid, who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in Cairo, including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and had <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> of loyalty or nationhood.

5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number of reports {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles {{to make sense of}} what he sees as contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse makes <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building.

40|$|WOS: 000330915600003 International audienceNitric oxide (NO) is an {{important}} signaling compound in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In plants, NO regulates critical developmental transitions and stress responses. Here, we identify a mechanism for <b>NO</b> <b>sensing</b> that coordinates responses throughout development based on targeted degradation of plant-specific transcriptional regulators, the group VII ethylene response factors (ERFs). We show that the N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis targets these proteins for destruction {{in the presence of}} NO, and we establish them as critical regulators of diverse NO-regulated processes, including seed germination, stomatal closure, and hypocotyl elongation. Furthermore, we define the molecular mechanism for NO control of germination and crosstalk with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling through ERF-regulated expression of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI 5). Our work demonstrates how <b>NO</b> <b>sensing</b> is integrated across multiple physiological processes by direct modulation of transcription factor stability and identifies group VII ERFs as central hubs for the perception of gaseous signals in plants...|$|R

5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E

40|$|The pulsed {{polarization}} {{measurement technique}} using conventional thimble type lambda probes {{is suitable for}} low ppm NOx detection in exhaust gas applications.

Besides answering questions {{with respect to the}} underlying principle, this investigation can resolve the main question of whether a simplified sensor element without reference may be also suitable for <b>NO</b> <b>sensing</b> using the pulsed polarization measurement technique. With an adequate sensor setup, the reference atmosphere of the thimble type lambda probe is changed completely after a certain diffusion time. Thus, the sensor response regarding NO is compared with and without different gas atmospheres on both electrodes. It is shown that there is still a very good NO sensitivity even without reference air, although the NO response is reduced due to non-existing overlying mixed potential type voltage, which is otherwise caused by different atmospheres on both electrodes. Considering these results, we see an opportunity to simplify the standard NOx sensor design by omitting the reference electrode...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} the power control problem in wireless networks where transmitters choose their control policy freely and selfishly {{in order to}} maximize their individual energy­ efficiency. In this framework, two new scenarios are studied in details: 1. a scenario where a fraction of the transmitters can observe the power levels of the other transmitters while the latter have <b>no</b> <b>sensing</b> capabilities; 2. a scenario where the observation structure is triangular, that is, the k th transmitter can observe the k- 1 th transmitters (which corresponds to a multi-level hierarchical game). In both scenarios the equilibrium analysis (existence, uniqueness, determination, efficiency) is conducted. In scenario 1, it is proved that the game outcome Pareto dominates the one obtained when <b>no</b> transmitters can <b>sense</b> the others. Taking the sensing cost into account, a simple condition under which being a follower (namely a transmitter who senses) is better than a leader is provided. Interestingly, the existence of an optimum fraction of cognitive transmitters in terms of sum utility is proved in the case where the sensing cost is neglected. In scenario 2, it is proved analytically that knowing more leads to a better utility and the game outcome Pareto dominates the solution with <b>no</b> <b>sensing.</b> The derived results are illustrated by numerical results and provide some insights on how to deploy cognitive radios in heterogeneous networks in terms of sensing capabilities...|$|R
