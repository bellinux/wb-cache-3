25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|Bandmate Billy Corgan {{has said}} of Chamberlin, [...] "he's {{up there with}} Bonham, you know, that level of drummer, who {{has been able to}} play a variety of music and have his style impact the way people play drums. That's the {{hallmark}} of a great drummer. And, right <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> pound for pound, he's the best drummer in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Wit & Fancy {{praised the}} {{transformation}} of the character and stated, [...] "Of course Meredith will still make rash decisions like when she took off with Zola, or tampered with the trial but she does things out of love and the kindness of her heart now and not because she is dark and twisty. Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up, she finally became “all whole and healed“." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 2011, Gorham told Billboard.com that Thin Lizzy may {{record a}} new album in the future, saying, [...] "That's the No.1 {{question}} we're getting from people – are we gonna record some new material? The fans seem to trust this line-up, and I don't blame them. We've kind of jumped this emotional hurdle together. Ricky's writing some fucking killer lyrics, and {{with the kind of}} talent that's in Thin Lizzy <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we can pull off a really cool set of tunes. At least it's something that we can think about now, where before it wasn't on the table." [...] On 25 June 2012, Thin Lizzy were in the studio recording new material, although it was not clear how many songs would be recorded or released.|$|E
500|$|Simon left Gracie Films and The Simpsons in 1993. Simon {{commented that}} he [...] "wasn't enjoying it anymore," [...] wished to pursue other projects, and [...] "that any show I've ever worked on, it turns {{me into a}} monster. I go crazy. I hate myself." [...] Before leaving, he {{negotiated}} a deal that saw him receive {{a share of the}} show's profits every year, particularly from home media, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since 1993. The deal means he made over $10 million a year from The Simpsons; he later told Stanford Magazine that [...] "tens of millions" [...] was a closer figure. Simon commented: [...] "When I was there I thought I was underpaid. I thought I wasn't getting enough credit for it. <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's completely the opposite. I get too much credit for it. And the money is ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Michael Sciannamea thought [...] "The Convict" [...] seemed {{different}} from previous episodes, citing as evidence {{the scene of}} Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: [...] "I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just seemed {{a little different than}} the others." [...] Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, [...] "When I first saw him up in Stamford, I thought he was just the Connecticut version of Dwight. But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he adds greatly to the mix and is definitely one who is going to stir things up in Scranton." [...] Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry believed [...] "the uncomfortable, unbearably awkward moments that the UK version perfected are definitely present throughout the episode." [...] She also praised Helms for [...] "prov once again how perfectly he fits in on this show as he is absolutely hysterical." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{role was}} first portrayed by {{three sets of}} twins, {{including}} Avital and Amiel Weiss, Matthew and Riley Esham, and Aiden and Andrew Gonzales {{over the course of}} 2006 to 2009. The role was then rapidly aged for the first time when Tucker assumed the role in October 2009. In May 2012, it was announced that the character had been rapidly aged again to a teenager, with Ehrich scheduled to join the cast. He made his debut on June 11, 2012. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ehrich stated that he had gone through a [...] "long audition process", saying: [...] "I got a callback and did a chemistry read with someone, then came back to read with Christian LeBlanc. By the end of that audition, I knew something felt right and that he could be my father." [...] When asked about signing a contract with the series, Ehrich stated: [...] "I'm still on recurring right <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's all relevant to your character and either way, in my book, it's awesome. I would sign, yes, but it'll happen when the time is right." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing the storyline {{which saw}} Kyla's Alcoholics Anonymous {{companion}} Stuart McElroy (Conor Mullen) violently attack her colleague, Ward Sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), Ayola has stated: [...] "It makes her finally accept what Stuart was capable of. She sees this huge gash and feels that all her instincts {{about other people}} are wrong – so she ends up running off. [...] has no excuses – all she can think is that she’s really messed up and needs to leave." [...] This plot strand saw Kyla once more resort to drinking while at work, and decide to quit her job, only to be talked out of doing so by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell). [...] Ayola explained: [...] "He suggests she takes a demotion, so she’ll have less to worry about and more {{time to deal with}} her problems. It's the lifeline she needs, because her work is all she has right <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if Kyla did leave, she’d end up simply going home and buying loads of cheap booze." [...] When asked if Kyla would be able to overcome her addiction and regain custody of her son, Ayola responded: [...] "I hope so. Kyla's had trouble being a good parent to Max, but she's had lots of time to reflect on why this is." ...|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the acquittal, {{the broader}} public {{perception}} was strong that Thorpe had not behaved well, nor had he adequately explained himself. The Archdeacon of Barnstaple, who {{was critical of}} Hornby's melodramatic thanksgiving service, wrote: [...] "There {{is a great deal}} of unhappiness [...] about the result at the Old Bailey. [...] As far as most people are concerned, the trial ended with a big question mark over the case". Prevented by his party from a return to active politics, in 1982 Thorpe was appointed by Amnesty International as director of its British section, but after protests from the organisation's staff, he withdrew. Not long afterwards, Thorpe first showed signs of the Parkinson's disease that led to his almost complete withdrawal into private life in the mid-1980s. There was a political reconciliation when, in 1988, following the merger of the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party, the newly formed North Devon Liberal Democrat association made him their honorary president. When he attended the Liberal Democrat party conference in 1997 he received a standing ovation. In 1999, Thorpe published his political memoir, In My Own Time, in which he justified his silence at the trial, and stated that he had never doubted the outcome. Nine years later, in January 2008, Thorpe gave his first press interview in 25 years, to The Guardian. Referring to the affair he said: [...] "If it happened <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the public would be kinder. Back then they were very troubled by it... It offended their set of values." [...] Thorpe died on 4 December 2014.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{was greeted with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim. Music journalist Mark Pytlik wrote the visual [...] "marked an unquestionable creative apex for Björk's visual work, a perfect synthesis of form and content". IGN gave the video a score of 9/10, writing it is an [...] "utterly gorgeous sight to behold" [...] and [...] "just about perfect". Times Craig Duff called it a milestone in computer animation and stated that [...] "no robot had expressed the sensuality that director Chris Cunningham imbues in a Björk-bot in the video". MusicRadar considered the music video to be [...] "one of the most visually striking promos of Björk's career." [...] NME also praised the [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] clip as one of Björk's best, and particularly commended the wide angle shot of the cyborgs kissing as the chorus kicks in. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine dubbed it [...] "the perfect pre-millennial precursor to our current gadget-assisted culture of self-love" [...] and also wrote, [...] "When it was released, I thought it looked cool and {{stressed the importance of}} loving yourself. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's a terrifying and sealed-off nightmare wherein you find out that you are the only person who will ever love you." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Scott Plagenhoef considered that [...] "the strongest single images from any video of the 1990s come from [...] ", also calling it [...] "strange and moving". CMJ New Music Monthlys Douglas Wolk called the video [...] "magnificent" [...] and praised it for [...] " [...] out the beauty of the song".|$|E

2500|$|Following the (then) record low of {{the arctic}} sea ice extend in 2007, Mark Serreze, the {{director}} of US National Snow and Ice Data Center, stated [...] "If you asked {{me a couple of}} years ago when the Arctic could lose all of its ice then I would have said 2100, or 2070 maybe.

2500|$|At {{least two}} {{variants}} {{of a conspiracy}} theory about the massacre have been promoted. Interviewed in 2006, Tony Rundle, Premier of Tasmania from 1996 to 1998, admitted that, {{because there was no}} trial, the evidence made public was possibly insufficient to support that Bryant had been the gunman: [...] "At the time, the view was that a trial could do no good for the victims and their families. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> maybe that wasn't the case. If all the evidence was heard, then maybe it would have provided some closure and stopped the proliferation of conspiracy theories that sprang up over the years." ...|$|E
