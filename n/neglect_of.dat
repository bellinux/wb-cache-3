Homosexual acts are punishable by flogging, imprisonment or death. Lashings are a common form of punishment and are often imposed for offences against religion and public morality such as drinking alcohol and <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> prayer and fasting obligations.|$|E

The attempt is a failure. Bertie in frustration plays the recording Lionel gave him. Bertie returns for daily treatments of exercises and practices to overcome the physical and psychological roots of his speaking difficulty.|$|E

The film won the Silver Lion Award at the 1953 Venice Film Festival and other honours. Ugetsu is one of Mizoguchi's most celebrated films, regarded by critics as a masterpiece of Japanese cinema. It is credited with simultaneously helping to popularise Japanese cinema in the West and influencing later Japanese film.|$|E

The limitations mainly {{exist in the}} <b>neglects</b> <b>of</b> the information reliability and completeness. The significances of the information reliability to the information measurements are further illustrated through example analysis. It is pointed out that such limitations originate from <b>neglects</b> <b>of</b> multi-level information uncertainties, uncertainty of the model and other objects of information system, and insufficient knowledge on uncertainties of probability values...|$|R
5|$|On {{his return}} to England Bellingham spent six months in London, seeking {{compensation}} for the imprisonment and financial losses he had suffered in Russia. He considered the British authorities were responsible, through their <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> his repeated requests for help. Successively he petitioned the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Privy Council, and Perceval himself; in each case his claims were politely rejected. Defeated and exhausted, in May 1811 Bellingham accepted his wife's ultimatum to abandon his campaign or otherwise lose her and his family. He joined her in Liverpool to begin life afresh.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the long period of <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> Schubert's piano sonatas seems to be their {{dismissal}} as structurally and dramatically inferior to the sonatas of Beethoven. In fact, the last sonatas contain distinct allusions and similarities to works by Beethoven, a composer Schubert venerated. However, musicological analysis has shown that they maintain a mature, individual style. Schubert's last sonatas are now praised for that mature style, manifested in unique features such as a cyclical formal and tonal design, chamber music textures, and a rare depth of emotional expression.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Louis I, Poland formed a Polish-Hungarian union. In the pact of 1374 (the Privilege of Koszyce), the Polish nobility was granted {{extensive}} concessions and agreed to extend the Anjou succession to Louis's daughters, as Louis had no sons. Louis's <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> Polish affairs resulted {{in the loss of}} Casimir's territorial gains, including Halych Rus', which was recovered by Queen Jadwiga in 1387. In 1396, Jadwiga and her husband Jagiełło (Jogaila) forcefully annexed the central Polish lands separating Lesser Poland from Greater Poland, previously granted by King Louis to his Silesian Piast ally Duke Władysław of Opole.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's {{first years}} as earl were {{predominantly}} {{concerned with the}} Scottish Wars. He had no personal interest in the region, but the Welsh Marches, where his landed interest lay, were largely pacified at the time, and Scotland presented {{a good opportunity to}} pursue military glory and reward. He was almost immediately trusted with important military commands on the northern border, and served as warden of Scotland from 1308 to 1309, and as captain of Scotland and the northern marches in 1309. He led an expedition to relieve the castle of Rutherglen in December 1308. The war effort, however, was not pursued with the same intensity by EdwardII as it had been by his father. The new king's <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> the Scottish Wars allowed Robert the Bruce to regain the initiative in the war.|$|E
5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E

5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E

She won the election unopposed on the ballot but faced criticism from McAfee who contended that she was too focused on issues of police brutality to the <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> concerns such as crime perpetrated against African Americans by African Americans. Levy-Pounds stated that she hoped to increase youth engagement with the NAACP during her term with the organization. She has been critical of racial disparities in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul region, citing them as some of the nation's worst.|$|E
5|$|Lowell {{was elected}} the poet {{of the class}} of 1838 and, as was tradition, was asked to recite an {{original}} poem on Class Day, the day before Commencement on July 17, 1838. He was suspended, however, and not allowed to participate. Instead, his poem was printed and made available thanks to subscriptions paid by his classmates. He had composed the poem in Concord, where he had been exiled by the Harvard faculty to the care of the Rev. Barzallai Frost because of his <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> his studies. During his stay in Concord, he became friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson and got to know the other Transcendentalists. His Class Day poem satirized the social movements of the day; abolitionists, Thomas Carlyle, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists were treated.|$|E

The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not been sufficiently recovered as of yet. Police have launched an investigation due to a <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> safety measures.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{traveled}} to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, John Allan married {{his second wife}} Louisa Patterson. The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe. Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically {{pleaded not guilty to}} induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the pudús {{include the}} horned owl, Andean fox, Magellan fox, cougar, {{and other small}} cats. The pudú is a wary animal that moves slowly and stops often, smelling the air for scents of predators. Being a {{proficient}} climber, jumper, and sprinter, the deer flees in a zigzag path when being pursued. The lifespan of the pudús ranges from 8 to 10years in the wild. The longest recorded lifespan is 15years and 9months. However, such longevity is rare and most pudús die at a much younger age, {{from a wide range}} of causes. Maternal <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> newborns, as well as a wide range of diseases, can decrease the population. A popular rumor is that if alarmed to a high degree, pudús die from fear-induced cardiac complications.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, {{failure to maintain}} infrastructure, looting, and <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the five member nations, which could eventually lead to a common East African shilling.|$|E
5|$|The Christians, {{believing that}} this tribulation came upon {{them for their}} <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> the Law of God and their {{religious}} duties, began to fervently read the Krista Purana, an epic poem {{on the life of}} Jesus Christ written by the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens (1549–1619). On discovering this, some Muslims destroyed the books, but the Christians constructed subterranean refuges in which to perform their religious devotions, read the books, and strengthen their faith. According to Mr. Silva of Gangollim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment ordered by Tipu was amputation of the ears, nose, feet and one hand.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus on male homosexuality and <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E
