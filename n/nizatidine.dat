50|$|<b>Nizatidine</b> is a {{histamine}} H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production, and {{is commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. It was developed by Eli Lilly and is marketed under the brand names Tazac and Axid.|$|E
50|$|Glaxo refined {{the model}} further by {{replacing}} the imidazole ring of cimetidine with a furan ring with a nitrogen-containing substituent, {{and in doing}} so developed ranitidine. Ranitidine was found to have a far-improved tolerability profile (i.e. fewer adverse drug reactions), longer-lasting action, and 10 times the activity of cimetidine. Ranitidine has 10% of the affinity that cimetidine has to CYP450, so it causes fewer side effects, but other H2 blockers famotidine and <b>nizatidine</b> have no CYP450 significant interactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nizatidine</b> was {{developed}} by Eli Lilly, and was first marketed in 1987.

In September 2000, Eli Lilly announced they would sell the sales and marketing rights for Axid to Reliant Pharmaceuticals. Subsequently, Reliant developed the oral solution of Axid, marketing this in 2004, after gaining approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, a year later, they sold rights of the Axid Oral Solution (including the issued patent protecting the product) to Braintree Laboratories.|$|E

This study sought to compare the effects of oral <b>nizatidine</b> and ranitidine on the gastric mucosal release of prostanoids in duodenal ulcer (DU) patients and to correlate prostanoid concentrations with H. pylori status. Twenty-eight patients with DUs were randomized to receive either <b>nizatidine</b> or ranitidine. <b>Nizatidine</b> 300 mg at night elevated intraluminal PGE 2 concentrations; 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha concentrations also rose, but did not reach statistical significance.

40|$|Twelve healthy {{volunteers were}} given one week's oral {{treatment}} {{with each of}} 300 mg <b>nizatidine,</b> 40 mg famotidine, and placebo once daily in a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind study. Three hours after administration, <b>nizatidine</b> led to {{a significant reduction in}} the mean (SD) resting heart rate compared with placebo (63. 6 (6. 4) beats/minute on placebo to 55. 9 (7. 2) beats/minute on <b>nizatidine</b> (p less than 0. 05)), whereas famotidine did not influence the heart rate significantly. Both drugs, however, increased significantly the pre-ejection period and the ratio of pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time on mechanocardiography and led to a significant decrease in cardiac output on impedance cardiography. The exercise heart rate on <b>nizatidine</b> as well as the resting heart rate on concurrent administration of <b>nizatidine</b> and the beta receptor blocking agent atenolol were subsequently investigated in the same volunteers. <b>Nizatidine</b> slightly inhibited exercise tachycardia by 4. 4 % (p less than 0. 05). When compared with placebo, the mean resting heart rate was decreased on atenolol alone by a mean of 10. 6 beats/minute (p less than 0. 01) and fell further on co-administration with <b>nizatidine</b> to a total of 16. 1 beats/minute (p less than 0. 05 versus atenolol alone). In conclusion, the effect of <b>nizatidine</b> in reducing the heart rate needs careful evaluation in elderly patients with heart failure or those also taking beta blockers.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the intestinal epithelial cell efflux transport processes that are involved in the intestinal transport of the H 2 receptor antagonist <b>nizatidine.</b> The intestinal epithelial efflux transport mechanisms of <b>nizatidine</b> were investigated and characterized across Caco- 2 cell monolayers, in the concentration range 0. 05 – 10  mM in both apical–basolateral (AP–BL) and BL–AP directions, and the transport constants of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux activity were calculated. The concentration-dependent effects of various P-gp (verapamil, quinidine, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and cyclosporine A), multidrug resistant-associated protein 2 (MRP 2; MK- 571, probenecid, indomethacin, and p-aminohipuric acid), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; Fumitremorgin C) inhibitors on <b>nizatidine</b> bidirectional transport were examined. <b>Nizatidine</b> exhibited 7. 7 -fold higher BL–AP than AP–BL Caco- 2 permeability, indicative of net mucosal secretion. All P-gp inhibitors investigated displayed concentration-dependent inhibition on <b>nizatidine</b> secretion in both directions. The IC 50 of verapamil on <b>nizatidine</b> P-gp secretion was 1. 2 [*]×[*] 10 − 2  mM. In the absence of inhibitors, <b>nizatidine</b> displayed concentration-dependent secretion, with one saturable (Jmax[*]=[*] 5. 7 [*]×[*] 10 − 3  nmol∙cm− 2 ∙s− 1 and Km[*]=[*] 2. 2  mM) and one nonsaturable component (Kd[*]=[*] 7 [*]×[*] 10 − 4  μL∙cm− 2 ∙s− 1). Under complete P-gp inhibition, <b>nizatidine</b> exhibited linear secretory flux, with a slope similar to the nonsaturable component.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Weight gain is {{associated}} with treatment with many psychotropic agents. <b>Nizatidine,</b> H 2 receptor antagonist, has been proposed to have weight-reducing effects. This was a 12 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of <b>nizatidine</b> in reducing/limiting weight gain in patients with schizophrenia who have been under treatment with olanzapine. METHOD: Patients receiving olanzapine (2 to 6 months) and weight gain > 5 % of their body weight during olanzapine treatment {{were randomly assigned to}} receive <b>nizatidine</b> 600 mg or placebo for up to 12 weeks. Change in psychopathology was assessed using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores from baseline to endpoint. Safety was assessed using the Safety Assessed Software, assessment of glucose and lipid blood levels, and treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Out of 54 patients enrolled in this analysis, 45 completed the protocol. The mean weight change prior randomization was 7. 6 kg and 7. 3 kg for those randomized to placebo and <b>nizatidine,</b> respectively (p = 0. 828). Patients receiving placebo and <b>nizatidine</b> had a mean weight gain of 12. 3 % (0. 7 kg) and 12 % (1. 1 kg) from baseline to endpoint, respectively (p = 0. 9). Patients from both groups experienced a statistically significant decrease on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale mean score from baseline to endpoint. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 18. 5 % and 25. 9 % on the placebo and <b>nizatidine</b> group, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in glucose and lipid blood levels from baseline to endpoint and between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant use of olanzapine with <b>nizatidine</b> was not effective in controlling weight gain in patients who had previously gained weight during treatment with olanzapine when compared to placebo...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{elucidate}} {{the effect of}} saliva stimulation by <b>nizatidine</b> on oral symptoms of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by administering it to PBC cases. METHODS: From among 73 cases that had been definitively diagnosed as PBC at our hospital by February 2010, we selected 27 cases of PBC, 4 males and 23 females, as subjects. We obtained subjects&#x 2019; consent after giving them a full explanation of the administration of <b>nizatidine.</b> <b>Nizatidine</b> 150 mg was administered internally twice daily, after morning and evening meals. To observe changes in the quantity of saliva secreted, chewing gum tests were carried out four times: before the initial dose, and after 6 mo, 12 mo and 24 mo of administration. For subjective dry mouth symptoms, a visual analog scale (VAS) method {{was used to assess}} their feelings of oral dryness and eating difficulty, five times: before the initial dose, and after 1, 6, 12 and 24 mo of administration in 8 cases. The nutritional condition and the hepatic functional reserve were compared between before and after the <b>nizatidine</b> treatment. RESULTS: The result of a chewing gum test on the subjects before the administration of <b>nizatidine</b> showed that 50 % produced less than 10 mL of saliva, i. e., the standard under which cases are considered to have hyposalivation. The results of these tests showed that the quantity of saliva secreted was 10. 5 1; 6. 8 mL before administration of <b>nizatidine,</b> 10. 9 1; 6. 0 mL after 6 mo, 10. 6 1; 4. 9 mL after 12 mo, and 11. 8 1; 6. 8 mL after 24 mo administration. Thus, there was a slowly increasing trend in the quantity of saliva in the whole group. The percentage of subjects with saliva production above 10 mL was 45. 8 % after 6 mo administration of <b>nizatidine,</b> that is, only a slight change from before its administration, but it was 64. 3 % after 12 mo, that is, a significant increase. The saliva secretion by subject patients was examined before the beginning of administration of <b>nizatidine,</b> 12 mo later, and 24 mo later, and Fisher&#x 2019;s combined probability test was used to examine the results for increases in saliva secretion. The analysis yielded P values of 0. 51 and 0. 53 for 12 mo later and 24 mo later, respectively. Thus, although there was no statistically significant increase, it was confirmed that saliva secretion tended to increase. A VAS method was employed to study the intensities of subjective symptoms of oral dryness and eating difficulty. Almost every case indicated some improvement of subjective oral dryness on the VAS early in the administration, i. e., one month after. We also studied the effects of the administration of <b>nizatidine</b> on nutritional condition, hepatic functional reserve, and long-term prognosis of PBC. No significant improvements in cholinesterase (ChE) level, albumin (Alb) level, or Child-Pugh score were found during the period of observation from the beginning to the end of administration of <b>nizatidine,</b> nor in comparison with the non-administration group. A comparative analysis between before administration and 24 mo later yielded P values of 0. 41 for Alb, 0. 56 for ChE, and 0. 59 for the Child-Pugh scores. CONCLUSION: It was confirmed that administering <b>nizatidine</b> to cases of PBC with dry mouth increased the secretion of saliva and improved the symptoms...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} the stability-indicating {{determination of the}} H 2 -receptor antagonist <b>nizatidine</b> in its bulk and capsules dosage form using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The developed method involved the use of Thermo Hypersil BDS-C 8 (4. 6 × 250 mm, 5 μm particle size) column and a mobile phase composed of 0. 05 M phosphoric acid and acetonitrile (50 : 50, v/v). The mobile phase was pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Quantification of <b>nizatidine</b> was based on measuring its peak area at 320 nm. The retention time for <b>nizatidine</b> was about 3. 61 min. The reliability and analytical performance of the proposed HPLC procedure were statistically validated with respect to linearity, range, precision, accuracy, specificity, robustness, detection and quantification limits.

40|$|Background: Systematic {{assessments}} of the onset of symptom relief {{in the treatment of}} gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are lacking. Objective: This work evaluated the time interval until complete symptom relief from heartburn (including both daytime and nighttime heartburn) and acid regurgitation in patients with GERD or endoscopy-negative GERD (NERD) during the first 7 days of treatment with pantoprazole, <b>nizatidine,</b> or ranitidine. Methods: This was a post hoc reanalysis of data from 2 previously published, multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, active-controlled, parallel-group studies. Male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years with endoscopically proven GERD or NERD (Hetzel-Dent grade ≥ [trial 1] or Savary-Miller grade 0 or 1 [trial 2]) were enrolled. Patients were required to have had reflux symptoms for the previous ≥ 3 months, with ≥ 1 symptom (ie, daytime heartburn, nighttime heartburn, or acid regurgitation) for ≥ 4 of the past 7 days in trial 1 or ≥ 1 symptom (ie, heartburn, acid eructation, or painful swallowing) of at least moderate intensity for the past 3 days in trial 2. The treatments were pantoprazole 20 mg once daily in both trials, <b>nizatidine</b> 150 mg BID in trial 1, or ranitidine 150 mg BID in trial 2. Presence and severity of symptoms were recorded on daily diary cards using a 4 -point Likert-type scale. Results: In total, 114 patients from trial 1 and 307 patients from trial 2 were evaluable for heartburn, and 58 patients from trial l and 271 patients from trial 2 were evaluable for acid regurgitation. In both studies, {{there were no significant differences}} in baseline characteristics between pantoprazole recipients and <b>nizatidine</b> or ranitidine recipients, with the exception of more men than women in trial 1 compared with trial 2 (P < 0. 001). On day 2 of trial 1, 23 (39. 0 %) and 8 (14. 5 %) of pantoprazole and <b>nizatidine</b> recipients, respectively, experienced complete relief from heartburn (P < 0. 01). The differences between groups remained statistically significant through day 7, when 28 (47. 5 %) and 8 (14. 5 %) of pantoprazole and <b>nizatidine</b> recipients had no heartburn (P < 0. 001). There were no differences in control of acid regurgitation over 7 days with pantoprazole compared with <b>nizatidine</b> or ranitidine, except at days 2 and 4 of trial 1, when significantly more patients receiving pantoprazole experienced relief from acid regurgitation than those receiving <b>nizatidine</b> (day 2 : 60. 6 % [n = 20] vs 20. 0 % [n = 5], P < 0. 01; day 4 : 48. 5 % [n = 16] vs 24. 0 % [n = 6], P < 0. 05). Conclusion: In this post hoc reanalysis of data from 2 previously published clinical trials, use of pantoprazole 20 mg once daily was associated with effective early relief from heartburn and acid regurgitation among these patients with GERD and NERD; relief occurred as fast as and, in some cases, even faster than that seen with <b>nizatidine</b> or ranitidine.

This was a 12 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of <b>nizatidine</b> in reducing/limiting weight gain in patients with schizophrenia who have been under treatment with olanzapine. METHOD: Patients receiving olanzapine (2 to 6 months) and weight gain > 5 % of their body weight during olanzapine treatment {{were randomly assigned to}} receive <b>nizatidine</b> 600 mg or placebo for up to 12 weeks. Change in psychopathology was assessed using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores from baseline to endpoint. Safety was assessed using the Safety Assessed Software, assessment of glucose and lipid blood levels, and treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Out of 54 patients enrolled in this analysis, 45 completed the protocol. The mean weight change prior randomization was 7. 6 kg and 7. 3 kg for those randomized to placebo and <b>nizatidine,</b> respectively (p = 0. 828). Patients receiving placebo and <b>nizatidine</b> had a mean weight gain of 12. 3 % (0. 7 kg) and 12 % (1. 1 kg) from baseline to endpoint, respectively (p = 0. 9). Patients from both groups experienced a statistically significant decrease on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale mean score from baseline to endpoint. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 18. 5 % and 25. 9 % on the placebo and <b>nizatidine</b> group, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in glucose and lipid blood levels from baseline to endpoint and between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant use of olanzapine with <b>nizatidine</b> was not effective in controlling weight gain in patients who had previously gained weight during treatment with olanzapine when compared to placebo. OBJETIVO: Ganho de peso está associado ao tratamento com inúmeros psicotrópicos. O uso de nizatidina, um antagonista H 2, pode estar associado à redução de peso. Este foi um ensaio clínico aleatorizado, duplo-cego, controlado com placebo, de 12 semanas, desenhado para avaliar a eficácia da nizatidina em reduzir/limitar o ganho de peso em pacientes com esquizofrenia recebendo olanzapina. MÉTODO: Pacientes recebendo olanzapina (entre dois e seis meses) e com ganho de peso > que 5 % desde o inicio do tratamento foram aleatorizados para receber nizatidina 600 mg ou placebo. Alterações psicopatológicas foram avaliadas usando-se a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total. A segurança foi avaliada por meio da pontuação na Safety Assessed Software, avaliação dos valores de glicemia e lipídios e a incidência de eventos adversos decorrentes do tratamento. RESULTADOS: Dos 54 pacientes incluídos na análise, 45 completaram o protocolo. A alteração média de peso antes da aleatorização foi de 7, 6 kg e 7, 3 kg nos pacientes aleatorizados para placebo e nizatidina, respectivamente (p = 0, 828). Pacientes recebendo placebo e nizatidina tiveram, respectivamente, ganho médio de peso de 12, 3 % (7 kg) e 12 % (1, 1 kg) ao longo do estudo (p = 0, 9). Ambos os grupos apresentaram diminuição estatisticamente significativa na pontuação média da Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Eventos adversos emergentes do tratamento foram relatados por 18, 5 % e 25, 9 % dos pacientes recebendo placebo e nizatidina, respectivamente. Não houve diferença estatisticamente significativa nos níveis glicêmicos e lipídicos do início ao final do estudo ou entre os grupos de tratamento. CONCLUSÕES: Comparado ao placebo, o uso concomitante de olanzapina e nizatidina não foi eficaz em controlar o peso em pacientes com ganho prévio de peso durante o tratamento com olanzapina...|$|E

In a previous study on rats, an increase was observed in cyclosporinaemia and hepatotoxicity after administration of cimetidine or ranitidine in association with cyclosporin A (CyA). On the contrary, famotidine does not influence the blood CyA levels. The aim {{of the study was to}} detect the possible synergistic nephro- and hepatotoxicity of <b>nizatidine</b> administered in association with CyA, assaying the serum creatinine, the ALT and AST levels, and histological features of thirty young male Sprague-Dawley rats, divided into 6 groups of five animals each. After 10 days, all the rats were sacrificed, their blood was collected to assay serum creatinine, ALT, AST and serum CyA levels: kidneys and livers were processed for light microscopy. The results obtained demonstrated that, while the level of creatinine was normal in each group, the average level of transaminase and the serum levels of CyA were significantly higher in the animals receiving the association of CyA and <b>nizatidine.</b> Furthermore, this group demonstrated a mild infiltrate of the liver characterized in some cases with eosinophilic polymorphonuclear cells. In light of the results obtained, it is probable that the increase of cyclosporinaemia is the conseguence of an enhanced hepatotoxicity due to administration of CyA in association with <b>nizatidine...</b>|$|E

The first four parts of the thesis examine the macrolide class of antibiotics, semisynthetic erythromycins. ^ The crystallographic structures of many important marketed macrolides are reported for the first time. These structures are erythromycin A dihydrate, erythromycin B dihydrate, clarithromycin anhydrate, and dirithromycin anhydrate form II. The hydrogen bonding networks are examined in detail. Questions surrounding the hygroscopic nature of the dihydrate form of erythromycin A are resolved {{using a combination of}} solid-state techniques. ^ Solid-state tautomerism of acetohexamide is investigated using the complimentary techniques of X-ray crystallography, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and FT-IR spectroscopy. The crystal structure of the marketed polymorphic form of acetohexamide is reported and discussed. The nitro of <b>nizatidine</b> and ranitidine have been shown to exist in solution in both trans and cis configurations. The crystallographic structure of the H 2 antagonist, <b>nizatidine</b> is reported and compared to ranitidine. <b>Nizatidine</b> is shown to exist in the solid-state only in the cis configuration. ^ Methyl group mobility in the nonsteroidal class of anti-inflammatories is examined using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. These studies attempt to correlate the activation energy for motional processes which bring about spin-lattice relaxation of the methyl group 13 C nucleus with solid-state properties.

40|$|Nine healthy {{volunteers were}} studied {{on the seventh}} day of dosing at 21 : 00 h with <b>nizatidine</b> 150 mg (N 150), <b>nizatidine</b> 300 mg (N 300), {{ranitidine}} 300 mg (R 300), or placebo, given in a predetermined random order. The double-blind 24 hour studies, using the Royal Free Hospital standard protocol, simultaneously measured intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin concentration. Compared with placebo, subjects responded to dosing with each H 2 -antagonist by a significant decrease of 24 hour intragastric acidity (N 150 - 45 %; N 300 - 49 % R 300 - 56 %; p less than 0. 01) and a significant rise of plasma gastrin concentration (N 150 + 20 %; N 300 + 27 %; R 300 + 58 %; p less than 0. 01). All three drug regimens caused similar significant decreases of nocturnal acidity (N 150 - 72 %; N 300 - 79 %; R 300 - 85 %; p less than 0. 01) and increases of nocturnal plasma gastrin concentration (N 150 + 41 %; N 300 + 52 %; R 300 + 80 %; p less than 0. 01). Dosing with ranitidine 300 mg at 21 : 00 h also caused a simultaneous significant decrease of morning acidity (- 32 %; p less than 0. 05) with a significant increase of plasma gastrin concentration (+ 36 %; p less than 0. 05), but the antisecretory effects of <b>nizatidine</b> 150 or 300 mg at 21 : 00 h were only observed during the night, with no effect during the morning.

40|$|The voltammetric {{behavior}} of <b>nizatidine</b> (a newly introduced antiulcer drug) was studied using direct current (DCt), alternating current and differential pulse polarography (DPP). Well-defined cathodic waves were obtained {{over the whole}} pH range in Britton-Robinson buffers, in addition to 0. 1 and 1 M HCl media. The main reduction wave was characterized as being irreversible and diffusion-controlled, although adsorption phenomena played a limited role in the electrode process.

The number of electrons involved in the reduction process was established, and the mechanism of electrode reaction was verified. The proposed method was successfully applied to determination of <b>nizatidine</b> in spiked human plasma and urine and the percentage recoveries were 96. 12 +/- 0. 40 and 97. 12 +/- 0. 17, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Ulcerogenesis of the {{gastroduodenal}} mucosa {{is caused}} by the digestive action of gastric juice and initially involves an inflammatory reaction with infiltration of phagocytes. The anti-inflammatory activity of many drugs have been attributed to the inhibition of the leukocyte enzyme, myeloperoxidase (MPO). In this study, the H 2 -antagonists in clinical use were found to be potent inhibitors of MPO-catalysed reactions (IC 50 < 3 μM) under conditions resembling those in experiments with intact neutrophils. Since peak plasma concentrations of cimetidine, ranitidine and <b>nizatidine</b> are well within the micromolar range, after oral therapeutic dosing, our results may be of clinical relevance. The inhibitory actions of cimetidine and <b>nizatidine</b> were largely due to scavenging of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a powerful chlorinating oxidant produced in the MPO-H 2 O 2 -Cl- system. In contrast to famotidine, ranitidine was also a potent scavenger of HOCl, while both drugs inhibited MPO reversibly by converting it to compound II, which is inactive in the oxidation of Cl-. The HOCl scavenging potencies of ranitidine and <b>nizatidine</b> were about three times higher than that of the anti-rheumatic drug, penicillamine, which had a potency similar to that of cimetidine. The rapid HOCl scavenging ability of penicillamine is thought to contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects. Using riboflavin as a probe, the H 2 -antagonists were found to be inhibitors of hydroxyl radical (·OH) generated in a Fe 2 +-H 2 O 2 reaction mixture. Spectral analyses of the interaction of iron ions with the drugs and studies with chelators, suggest that the drugs were efficient chelators of Fe 2 +, in addition to their ·OH scavenging abilities. Since the gastrointestinal tract can contain potentially reactive iron, the simultaneous presence of H 2 -antagonists may help to suppress iron-driven steps in tissue damage. Articl...|$|E
