5|$|During John's {{time in the}} Western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) had {{particular}} difficulty in forecasting and even estimating the strength of John. John weakened considerably after entering the Western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> and, before estimates were later revised, four consecutive advisories were issued that declared John a tropical depression. Each of these advisories called for imminent dissipation. As John persisted and did not dissipate as the JTWC had predicted, it was upgraded to a minimal tropical storm in the next advisory. At the same time, however, two separate ship reports indicated that John had sustained winds of at least 55 knots (100 km/h, 65 mph), far stronger than the advisory strength of 35 knots (65 km/h, 40 mph). John {{would go on to}} restrengthen into a strong Category 1 hurricane after reentering the Central <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> defying all JTWC predictions. After later reanalysis, the JTWC raised the estimated wind speeds of John for every advisory from 1200 UTC September 1 to its final advisory exactly a week later by at least 5 knots (9 km/h, 6 mph) and as much as 25 knots (46 km/h, 29 mph).|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples {{from each of}} the whale populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale. The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E

When its two extant species diverged from each other is uncertain, though the precipitating event was likely the formation of the ice cap over the Arctic Ocean, which would have isolated sharks in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> from those in the North Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 Pacific {{hurricane}} season saw a record four Pacific hurricanes strike Mexico the most ever recorded in a season. It was a below average season that produced 9 Tropical storms, 5 Hurricanes and 2 Major Hurricanes. It officially began May 15, 1996, {{in the eastern}} <b>north</b> <b>Pacific</b> and on June 1, 1996, in the central <b>north</b> <b>Pacific.</b> It ended on November 30, 1996. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season slightly exceeded these bounds when tropical storm One-E formed on May 13.|$|E
5|$|The IWC {{prohibited}} {{hunting in}} the Southern Hemisphere in 1976. The Soviet Union engaged in the illegal killing of protected whale species in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> and Southern Hemisphere, over-reporting fin whale catches to cover up illegal takes of other species. In the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> they reported taking over 10,000 fin whales between 1961–79, while the true catch was less than 9,000. In the Southern Hemisphere, they reported taking nearly 53,000 between 1948 and 1973, when the true total was a little over 41,000. The fin whale was given full protection from commercial whaling by the IWC in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> in 1976, and in the North Atlantic in 1987, with small exceptions for aboriginal catches and catches for research purposes. All populations worldwide remain listed as endangered species by the US National Marine Fisheries Service and the International Conservation Union Red List. The fin whale is on Appendix 1 of CITES.|$|E

5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover from the <b>north</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean {{than the rest}} of the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific.</b> This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E
