5|$|Because of {{the similar}} {{raptorial}} forelegs, mantidflies may {{be confused with}} mantises. This similarity {{is an example of}} convergent evolution; mantidflies do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> leathery forewings of mantises.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the Germans and decided not to leave the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time.

5|$|A strong upper-level trough {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated that it did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is {{not considered to be}} a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|After {{putting an}} end to the {{internal}} strife, Basil II launched a counter-campaign against the Arabs in 995. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the Empire's position in the east, and the gains of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with Aleppo besieged and Antioch under threat. Basil won several battles in Syria, relieving Aleppo, taking over the Orontes valley, and raiding further south. Although he did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> force to drive into Palestine and reclaim Jerusalem, his victories did restore much of Syria to the empire — including the larger city of Antioch which was the seat of its eponymous Patriarch.|$|E

30|$|For Persona 2, one {{approach}} is to average the penalties within the profile (i.e., (0.7 + 0.9)/ 2) and then multiply this by <b>the</b> penalty of <b>not</b> <b>having</b> a profile, resulting in a final penalty of 0.64 — here <b>the</b> penalty of <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> profile essentially acts as a weight. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that if an individual possesses a profile but it is very unnatural (i.e., tends towards an average elements/inferences penalty of 1) then this would be equated as similar to <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> profile at all. In the other two cases, i.e., when a profile is not natural but <b>the</b> persona <b>has</b> it, and when the persona is not natural and the persona also does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> it, <b>the</b> assessments are simple. That is, in the former case <b>the</b> penalty for <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> profile is assigned (e.g., 0.8 in our example above) and in the latter situation, there is no penalty. Future work will need to explore this further, ideally with the larger and more clearly typed participant set.|$|R
