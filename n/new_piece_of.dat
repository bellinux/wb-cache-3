5|$|Under {{the watchful}} eye of police detective Bobby Fulbright, Phoenix, Apollo and Athena become {{involved}} in several cases. Apollo and Athena investigate the murder of alderman Rex Kyubi. They face Simon Blackquill in court, who prosecutes despite serving a murder sentence himself. Additional content set after these events tells the story of Phoenix's first case after regaining his badge, having to defend an orca accused of killing her owner. Afterwards, Athena defends her childhood friend Juniper Woods who is charged with the murder of her teacher. Some time later, following a bombing at a space station, Apollo's friend Clay Terran is found murdered. During the trial, where Athena and Apollo defend an astronaut named Solomon Starbuck, a bomb goes off in the courtroom, injuring Apollo. Juniper is accused of the bombing, but Phoenix defends her and finds the real culprit. Feeling personally involved in the case, Apollo takes a leave of absence from the agency to investigate the case on his own while Phoenix takes over Solomon's case. He proves Solomon's innocence, but a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> evidence places Athena as the prime suspect.|$|E

25|$|In {{the close}} season {{prior to the}} 2012-13 season, the MyFootballClub Society {{membership}} stood at roughly 1300. A significant drop from the 32,000 peak, but the community remained active in supporting the club both financially {{and in terms of}} time. An example of this continued contribution to the club was in June 2012, where the society paid for a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> important equipment for the groundsman Peter Norton.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} styles in Balinese gamelan. Kebyar {{is one of}} the most recent ones. Some Balinese gamelan groups {{constantly}} change their music by taking older pieces they know and mixing them together, as well as trying new variations of the music. Their music constantly changes because they believe that music should grow and change; the only exception to this is with their most sacred songs which they do not change. A single <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> music can take several months before it is completed.|$|E
25|$|Comparing {{the market}} cost of {{recyclable}} material {{with the cost}} of new raw materials ignores economic externalities—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A life cycle assessment can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a carbon tax) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 {{two more}} storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, {{was a new}} XM Satellite Radio based system {{utilizing}} a special receiver and Baron Services weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant {{that even in the}} most remote areas storm chasers still had a live data feed. The second tool was a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> software called GRLevel3. GRLevel3 utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true vector format with GIS layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using Spotter Network (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.|$|E

25|$|Since traits {{come from}} the genes in a cell, putting a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> DNA into a cell can produce a new trait. This is how genetic {{engineering}} works. For example, rice can be given genes from a maize and a soil bacteria so the rice produces beta-carotene, which the body converts to Vitamin A. This can help children suffering from Vitamin A deficiency. Another gene being put into some crops comes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis; the gene makes a protein that is an insecticide. The insecticide kills insects that eat the plants, but is harmless to people. In these plants, the new genes are put into the plant before it is grown, so the genes are {{in every part of}} the plant, including its seeds. The plant's offspring inherit the new genes, which has led to concern about the spread of new traits into wild plants.|$|E
25|$|Under Weimar, the SPD {{was able}} put its ideas {{of social justice}} into {{practice}} by influencing a number of progressive social changes while {{both in and out}} of government. The SPD re-introduced and overhauled the Bismarckian welfare state, providing protection for the disadvantaged, the unemployed, the aged, and the young. The “Decree on Collective Agreements, Workers’ and Employees’ Committees, and the Settlement of Labour Disputes” of December 1918 boosted the legal effectiveness of collective bargaining contracts, while a number of measures were carried out to assist veterans, including the Decree on Social Provision for Disabled Veterans and Surviving Dependents of February 1919 and the Compensation Law for Re-enlisted Men and Officers of September 1919. The War Victims’ Benefits Law of May 1920 introduced a more generous war-disability system than had existed in the past. This <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legislation took into account all grievances voiced during the war and, for the first time in social legislation in Germany, considered child maintenance in calculating widows’ pensions.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Jarre was {{contacted}} by the musical director of the Houston Grand Opera with the proposal for him related to the celebrations of Texas' 150th birthday in 1986, 150th birthday {{of the city of}} Houston and NASA's 25th birthday. Because of NASA's involvement, Jarre got the chance to keep in contact with a friend of his, astronaut captain Bruce McCandless II who later introduced Jarre to a flight companion of his, astronaut and jazz musician Ron McNair. Together they had the idea that for the celebrations, Jarre would create a piece of music that could be performed by McNair on his saxophone. The idea was that McNair, on his next trip into space in the Challenger Space Shuttle, would perform (and record onto video) the <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> music, which would then be projected (through video playback) onto a giant screen that was to be constructed on the front of one of the buildings.|$|E

500|$|The Year Zero game {{consisted}} of an expansive series of websites, phone numbers, e-mails, videos, MP3s, murals, {{and other media}} that expanded upon the fictional storyline of the album.

Rolling Stone described the fan involvement in this promotion as the [...] "marketing team's dream".

500|$|The new parkway {{would lower}} traffic on NY9A through Elmsford while also {{connecting}} to the Westchester County Medical Center, a local jail, and Westchester Community College. Economic improvements of the parkway extension would include nearly 6,000 {{new jobs and}} over $2million (1978USD) in tax rebates. The fourth and final section of the Sprain Brook Parkway was opened on October 28, 1980 {{at the cost of}} $25million (1980USD). The last section, deemed a [...] long missing link, finished the parkway to its full length between the Bronx River Parkway and the traffic circle in Hawthorne. This <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the parkway was built with 70% of the required funds provided by the federal government, and was designed to redistribute traffic along different parkways, with NYSDOT estimating about 44,000 cars daily using the completed roadway.|$|E
500|$|The remake was {{announced}} in February 2012 by Famitsu. For the packaging, Kaneko was asked to design a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> key art.

Game Informer included the game on its list of [...] "RPGs Released Late In The PSP's Life Cycle", games that were likely never to see a release due to the flagging western PSP market. In response to {{the decision not to}} localize the remake, the original version was released on PlayStation Network in 2013. As part of the announcement, PlayStation Blog released a guide showing which characters had received name changes in the original localization. Intended to be playable on PSP, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3, a fault at release meant only the PS3 version was playable, which was fixed after players complained about it.|$|E
