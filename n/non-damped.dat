Here, to prevent false advection from open boundaries, HOPS is nested into the basin-scale DieCAST model [Dietrich, D. E., Haney, R. L., Fernández, V., Josey, S. A., Tintoré, J., 2004.

The forecast capability of HOPS is demonstrated in terms of a hindcast experiment, utilising two observational data sets of a subregion of the Balearic Sea which were acquired in mid September and early October 2002. While the data of the first survey is used for model initialisation, that of the second survey serves for validation of the forecast products. The forecast skill of the system is evaluated quantitatively by three different objective methods, comparing the rms difference of vertical profiles and horizontal fields, and pattern correlations, both for temperature and salinity. In five out of six cases, the forecasted fields are closer to the validation data set than the fields used for initialisation, i. e. the forecast beats persistence and the forecast is successful.

40|$|Landau damping/growing at {{boundary}} condition of excitation of a harmonic wave in collisionless ion-electron-neutrals plasma contradicts {{to the law}} of energy conservation of a wave damping/growing in space. There is also no criterion of a choice either damping or growing solution in difference from always <b>non-damping</b> in the direction of propagation Vlasov waves. Variety of other incongruities as consequence of Landau damping is specified also. Absence of explicit positivity and finiteness of wave solutions for electron distribution function near singularity point leads to need of imposing additional cutting off constraints with resulting positivity and finiteness of the electron distribution function at the singularity points and finiteness of the complex dispersion integral. Landau damping as a real physical phenomenon of collisionless damping does not exist. A relation is established for the real dispersion equation with real waves (see Appendices 2, 4) between the averaged over period wave damping decrement and the collisional energy-exchange term of kinetic equation. Collisionless Vlasov-Landau damping is explained finally by the usual wrong use of nonlinearly complex wave functions leading to complex dispersion equation. All used solution of the complex dispersion equation for the simultaneously existing collisionless both exponentially damping and growing nonlinear complex waves is entirely, quantitatively and in its logical sense, different from the solution of initially real dispersion equation for real either damping or growing waves and should be discarded (see Appendices 2, 4, 5, 6). Collisionless damping is caused by unreasonable use of wave functions with complex frequency or complex wave number leading to complex dispersion relation with unphysical binomial virtual complex roots.

40|$|We present {{arguments}} {{based on}} the measured abundances in individual damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) and sub-damped Lyman alpha systems (sub-DLAs), and also the average abundances inferred in large samples of QSO absorption line systems, to suggest that the amount of dust in intervening QSO absorbers is small and is not responsible for missing many QSOs in magnitude limited QSO surveys. While we can not totally rule out a bimodal dust distribution with a population of very dusty, metal rich, absorbers which push the background QSOs below the observational threshold of current optical spectroscopic studies, based upon the current samples it appears that the metallicity in QSO absorbers decreases with increase in H I column densities beyond 10 ^{ 19 } cm^{- 2 }. Thus the sub-DLA population is more metal rich than the DLAs, a trend which may possibly extend to the <b>non-damped</b> Lyman limit systems (NDLLS). Based on the recently discovered mass-metallicity relation for galaxies, we suggest that most sub-DLAs and possibly NDLLS, are associated with massive spiral/elliptical galaxies while most DLAs are associated with low mass galaxies.

This is a superconducting quantum interference device, which are the most sensitive sensors for magnetic flux variations. When the magnetoencephalography operates with people inside the room, the spectrum of the flux of the magnetic field shows anomalous peaks at several frequencies between 1 Hz and 20 Hz, independent of the experiment that is being run. As the variations in the flux of the magnetic field through the sensors might not only {{be related to the}} electrical currents circulating inside the brain, but also to <b>non-damped</b> mechanical oscillations of the room, we installed seismic instrumentation to measure the effective motion inside the room and to compare it to the external motion. For this analysis, we recorded the ambient seismic noise at two very close stations, one inside the magnetically shielded room, the other one outside in the room in which the magnetically shielded room is itself located. Data were collected over four days, including a week-end, to study the response of the magnetically shielded room subjected to different energy levels of external vibrations. The root mean square, Fourier spectra and power spectral density show significant differences between the signal recorded inside and outside the magnetically shielded room, with several anomalous peaks in the frequency band of 1 Hz to 20 Hz. The normalized spectral quantities (horizontal to vertical spectral ratio, and ratio between the internal and external spectra) show large amplification at several frequencies, reaching in some cases one order of magnitude.

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Trampolining is a sport entailing multiple somersaults and twists performed from an elastic sprung bed. During the aerial phase gravity is the only external force acting on the gymnast and since this acts through the gymnast's centre of mass, angular momentum is conserved. As somersault and twist production are {{an essential part of}} trampolining {{it is important to understand}} the mechanics for producing angular momentum during the contact phase. Previous research has neglected important factors such as the considerable mass of the bed and springs in the analysis of the contact phase. Consequently the mechanics of the contact phase is not yet clear. An experimental study is presented to determine the forces acting on the gymnast alone and the forces acting on both the gymnast and the suspension system (bed and springs) during the contact phase for plain jumps. Kinematic data was obtained using a three dimensional motion analysis system and inverse dynamics was used to determine vertical and horizontal forces. Kinetic data was recorded using four tri-axial force transducers, mounted underneath the trampoline using custom designed brackets. Peak vertical forces of 25 bodyweights were recorded during plain jumps at the centre of the trampoline and peak horizontal forces up to 0. 5 bodyweights were recorded in jumps with approximately I m offorwards travel during the subsequent aerial phase. A simulation model of the trampoline suspension system was developed comprising thirty eight <b>non-damped</b> linear springs and fifteen point masses. The model was evaluated using experimental data of an impactor (with known mass) dropped at centre and off-centre locations on the trampoline from varying heights. Results showed the trampoline behaves as a non-linear spring. The study presents relationships between vertical force and vertical bed displacement and horizontal force and horizontal bed displacement as well as the location of the mass centre of the bed and springs as a function of the location of the bed centre. These relationships may be used to model the behaviour of the bed and springs in the analysis of the mechanics of the contact phase for trampolining skills entailing multiple somersaults and twists...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} many {{developments}} of mine or metal detectors based on ground penetrating radar techniques, usually in hand-held or rover-mounted devices. In most mine or metal detector applications, conditions are in a stationary mode and detection speed is not an important factor. A novel, forward-looking, stepped-frequency ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been developed with a capability to detect improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at vehicular speeds of 15 to 20 mph (24 to 32 km/h), 10 to 20 m ahead of the vehicle, to ensure adequate time for response. The GPR system employs two horn antennas (1. 7 to 2. 6 GHz, 20 dBi) as transmit and receive. The detector system features a user-friendly instantaneous display on a laptop PC and is a low-power-consumption (3 W) compact system with minimal impact on vehicle operations. In practice, the whole GPR system and a laptop PC can be powered by plugging into a cigarette lighter of a vehicle. The stepped-frequency continuous-wave (CW) radar scans frequency from 1. 7 to 2. 6 GHz in 1, 000 steps of 0. 9 MHz, with the full frequency scan in 60 ms. The GPR uses a bi-static configuration with one horn antenna used as a transmitter and the other used as a receiver so that isolation between transmitter and receiver is improved. Since the horn antennas (20 dBi) are mounted {{on the roof of}} a vehicle at a shallow inclination angle (15 to 25 with respect to horizontal), there is a first-order reduction in ground reflection so that a significant amount of the total reflected power received by the GPR comes from the scattering of RF energy off of buried objects. The stepped-frequency technique works by transmitting a tone at a particular frequency, while the received signal is mixed with the transmitted tone. As a result, the output of the mixer produces a signal that indicates the strength of the received signal {{and the extent to which}} it is in phase or out of phase with the transmitted tone. By taking measurements of the phase relationship between the transmitted and received signals over a wide frequency range, an interference pattern is produced showing all target reflections. When a Fourier transform is performed on this pattern, the result is a time-domain representation of targets. Among the advantages of this technique over impulse radar is the ability to transmit and receive much more total energy, and to use <b>non-damped,</b> highly focused horn antennas. The novelty of the IED detector GPR has been achieved by miniaturization of GPR electronics (single electronics board, 10 x 5 x 2 cm), low power consumption (3 W), faster signal processing capability, and minimal impact on vehicle operations...|$|E
