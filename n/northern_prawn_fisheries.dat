40|$|Abstract Polychaetes are an {{important}} component of benthic ecosystems, both from an environmental and from an economic perspective. Polychaetes {{play a role in the}} environment by assisting in nutrient cycles, bioturbation and aeration of the sediment. Polychaetes are strongly linked within food webs with birds, fish, crustaceans and gastropods all having been recorded feeding on them. Polychaetes are among the best indicators of pollution and disturbance in environmental management and monitoring. They are well known as first stage colonisers of anthropogenic and naturally damaged marine ecosystems. All these roles that polychaetes play in marine ecosystems make them important in sustainable fisheries, aquaculture and environmental monitoring research. In this thesis, data on the diversity, abundance and richness of polychaete communities in the Gulf of Carpentaria (GoC) are presented and correlated with environmental predictors. Correlations of feeding guild diversity and richness to environmental data are also presented. Data are collated from four surveys conducted over the past twenty years. These surveys are the Gulf of Carpentaria Fish and Megabenthos Project SS 03 / 1990 (GoCFM); the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Benthic Spatial MSE Project SS 03 / 2005 (MPFB); Arafura Sea Biological Survey SS 05 / 2005; and the Northern Territory Museum (NTM) benthic baseline survey. Benthic samples were collected via different equipment for each survey, mainly a Smith-McIntyre, Box Core and Petersen Grab. Statistical analysis was conducted as part of three case studies: the 1990 dataset from the Gulf of Carpentaria Fish and Megabenthos Project; the 2005 dataset collected from the Southwest region of the GoC in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Benthic Spatial MSE Project; and the species level analysis of the Pilargidae family ecology, which combined data from the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Benthic Spatial MSE Project SS 03 / 2005; Arafura Sea Biological Survey SS 05 / 2005; and the Northern Territory Museum (NTM) benthic baseline survey. Statistical analysis was conducted at the family level, due to time restrictions in the project. Only one family, the Pilargidae, was identified to the species level for a more detailed assessment of distribution and ecology. This detailed assessment found five new species to science and five new species records for Australia. A total of 10, 044 individual polychaetes from forty-four families were collected during all four surveys. All these families are commonly collected from waters around Australia. The density of polychaetes in the 1990 GoC ranged from 10 – 2, 010 ind/m 2, = 130 ind/m 2. In 2005 the density of polychaetes ranged from 100 – 2, 880 ind/m 2, = 820 ind/m 2. The three dominant families in the GoC have remained the same between 1990 and 2005. However the top ranked family has changed between the two surveys. In 1990 Eunicidae was the top ranked family, followed by Capitellidae and Spionidae, whereas in 2005 Capitellidae was the top ranked, followed by Spionidae and Eunicidae. This may be due to a seasonal effect on polychaete groups, as the GoCFM survey was conducted at the start of the wet-season (Nov-Dec) and the NPFB survey was conducted at the end of the wet season (Feb-Mar). In 1990 and 2005 the same pattern in polychaete diversity, abundance and richness was observed across the GoC. In general there was a distinctly higher diversity and richness in the south-eastern region of the GoC, with a trend of reduction in a diagonal direction to the north-west GoC and into the Arafura Sea. This same pattern was observed in the feeding guild diversity and richness, except for the filter feeding guild. This guild did not show a reduction in abundance across the GoC sites. The best predictor for the relationship of polychaete community composition to environmental predictors, for both 1990 and 2005 was firstly the percentage sand content of the sediments and secondly the salinity of surrounding water. Polychaetes guild showed the same correlation with sand being the best predictor for guild diversity and richness. Species level analyses of the Pilargidae suggest that individual species have sediment grain size preferences. Overall the findings demonstrate that within the GoC higher sand content of the sediments supports a higher polychaetes diversity, abundance and richness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract only. The <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> <b>Fishery</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} fisheries in Australia with a yearly estimated value of production of about $ 64 mil. Nine prawn species are commercially harvested from the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> <b>Fishery</b> with 80 % of annual average catch represented by the banana prawn (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis) and the tiger prawns (Penaeus esculentus and Penaeus semisulcatus). The biological complexity of this multi-species fishery affects the ability of management to predict stock levels and consequently to set economically sustainable harvest levels. The model developed here suggests optimal management strategies using a stage population matrix to estimate prawn abundance as a function of catch and effort registered in previous years.

40|$|Summary of {{priority}} issues {{for managing the}} ecological effects of fishing in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> <b>Fishery</b> The ecological risk assessment (ERA) process was designed to assess and rank the ecological effects of fishing in Commonwealth fisheries. The ERA process for the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> <b>Fishery</b> (NPF) analysed the effect of commercial fishing, based on the effects on all organisms (protected species, bycatch, byproduct and target species), habitats and ecological communities {{that occur in the}} area of the fishery. The process provided a list of species, habitats and ecological communities that are at risk of ecological damage from the effects of fishing. The ecological effects of fishing in the NPF are largely due to the incidental capture of non-target species (including the capture of protected species). The methods of fishing employed in the NPF were found to have little to no detrimental impact on the physical marine environment. The highest level of ERA assessment conducted on the NPF is a quantitative Level 2. 5 assessment. The initial ERA process was completed in 2009 and identified seven species at high risk to the effects of fishing in the NPF (Table 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Capacity {{reduction}} {{programs in}} the form of buybacks or decommissioning programs have had relatively widespread application in fisheries in the US, Europe and Australia.

In this paper, the effects of a buyback program on average technical efficiency in Australia’s <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> <b>Fishery</b> are examined using a multi-output distance function approach with an explicit inefficiency model.

These estimates enabled per-recruit models for red-legged prawns to be revised and for the sustainability of the current fishing patterns to be assessed. The levels of estimated recruitment to the fishery are much lower than previously estimated and therefore the stocks may be more vulnerable to over-fishing than past assessments suggested. Secondly, broad-scale surveys across the inshore areas of the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf established that juvenile red-legged banana prawns are found in small, mangrove-lined creeks in the estuaries located 100 to 200 km south-east of the fishery (Fitzmaurice/Victoria Rivers to Cambridge Gulf).

Hydrophis elegans and Disteira major were caught frequently in all areas. The catch rates of H. elegans and Lapemis hardwickii were highest in the eastern gulf and in depths of 31 – 40 and 27 % of specimens from most areas. Other species that represented ≥ 20 % of specimens from one or more areas were: L. hardwickii, H. ornatus, D. major and Aipysurus eydouxii. Catch rates of all species of snakes combined {{did not differ significantly}} between 1984 – 86 and 1989 – 90, and were moderately high around Groote Eylandt where the fishery is centred. Most by-catch species occur in areas that are not subjected to extensive trawling, and there are no data to suggest that this fishery seriously threatens any population of sea snake. However, sea snakes may be more vulnerable to trawler-induced effects than most other by-catch species, and formal assessment of the status of populations is needed...|$|R
40|$|The size-frequency {{distribution}} of the commercial catch is often {{used as the basis}} of fisheries stock assessments (Paul and Morgan, 1987; Gulland and Rosenberg, 1992) because most dynamic processes of populations (growth, survival, recruitment) are reflected in changes in this distribution. The data are generally collected, often at great expense, by sampling the catch at landing sites and markets, or onboard fishing vessels. Size-frequency distributions of prawns (Penaeus esculentus and P. semisulcatus) can also be obtained from fish processors, who grade landings by size. These data are easier and cheaper to obtain than research samples, but unfortunately they are also considered less accurate and lack spatial information. However, they have been used in stock assessment of prawns in Kuwait (Jones and van Zalinge, 1981) and Malaysia (Simpson and Kong, 1978). It is often difficult to relate size data obtained from a processor to time and place of capture of the prawns, {{but this is not the}} case when the product is packed onboard, as in Australia's <b>northern</b> <b>prawn</b> <b>fishery</b> (NPF). Trawler operators in the NPF have voluntarily recorded size composition since 1985, when provision for this was made in operators' daily logbooks (between 30...|$|R
