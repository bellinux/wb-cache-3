40|$|The need to {{demonstrate}} that health care {{has an influence on}} health status is increasingly pressing. Such demonstrations require tools of measurement which are unfortunately not available. Development of instruments has been hampered by a lack of consensus on appropriate frames of reference, and there appears to be little agreement on what should be measured and what relative importance should be ascribed to different dimensions of health status. An approach that does not require the assignment of numerical values or weights to various aspects of health status and is applicable to all age groups within the population and to the whole spectrum of health problems rather than to specific medical diagnoses would seem desirable. A scheme that is based upon the development of a “profile ” rather than a single “index ” for describing health status is proposed in this paper. The model is a conceptual framework whose usefulness will depend upon efforts {{of a large number of}} researchers from many disciplines to develop instruments which can be incorporated in it. Although the problems in development of the scheme are complex, I hope that it will focus attention on the relevant dimensions and facilitate improved coordination of efforts to produce ways {{to demonstrate}} what health care con-tributes to health. The ultimate test of the efficacy and effec-tiveness of medical care is its outcome on patients.

40|$|This study {{tries to}} clarify {{a way of}} Ryukyuan Dance {{notation}} and to systematize it. Now is the age of mass communication. We can record, and keep pictures easily by using audio-visual apparatus such as VTR 8 mm, 16 mm, and 35 mm. But the dance art needs to be systematically analyzed and notated. An important {{of the work is}} to draw the whole figures of the dancer including the form of dance, movements and gestures. It is <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> but essential <b>part</b> <b>of</b> my work to draw the figures of motion so as to see the flow of pattern in dancing. In addition, the research has many more purposes. This study uses one of the fundamental methods by tracing the figures in the picture in a 8 mm film. It contains every dance figure from the begining to the end. Methods: 1. Photographing the dance with a 8 mm film. 2. Magnifying the pictures with a profile projector. 3. Tracing figures in the picture by everyone or ten frame, then numbering these. 4. Making reduced pictrues. 5. Drawing the illustrations of motional series of the dance. 6. Numbering the unity so as to see phrasing. 7. Estimating the time of performance by whole frames. 8. Adding rylics under the figures. 9. Writing a interpretation of the dance. In this present paper, I deal with one of the classical women's dances, "NUFA BUSHI". The total number of the frames is 20, 570, and the time is 19 minutes and 2 seconds. The number of the drown pictures is 2, 509. This dance usually takes from 18 to 20 minutes in performance. This is especially long among classical women's dance. The accompaniment music is from the Ryukyuan "Kun Kun Shi". Nowadays, the way of dancing can be seen in a film. But in the future, a great effort should be made to systematize the dance, so that a dancer can use the notations and drawings in acquiring the techniques of the dance. The detailed analysis is reported in this collected papers as "A Study on the Representative Features of Ryukyuan Dance (4) ". please refer to it...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{components}} of the diet, fat receives very dose attention because of its relationship to several chronic degenerative diseases (CDD). Currently most of the available information on these relationships is derived from epidemiologic or experimental studies in which lipid intake is calculated using food composition tables. In most of these tables the quoted lipid content is that of raw food, whereas most foods are usually consumed only after being subjected to several culinary processes. Often {{there is no indication}} of the type of fat used in food processing in general or in frying in particular. But as it known, in the course of these processes the lipid content undergoes important qualitative and quantitative changes and not keeping them in mind may be the underlying cause of the difficulties an the confounding results in studies trying to establish the relationship between lipid intake an health. In the Mediterranean diet, about 50 % of total dietary fat is derived not from the food itself but from the cooking fat, of which only a small fraction is eaten raw (as dressings) and the greatest proportion is used in thermal culinary processes, mainly deep-frying. The scientific study of the process whereby fat penetrates into fried foods has shown the benefits of this cooking method. If the process is correctly carried out, the amount of fat ingested with fried foodstuffs is not greater than when other procedures involving fat are used (for example, sautening, stewing or canning in oil). Very schematically deep-frying is a technique that replaces a fraction of the water content of food by cooking fat. Consecuently, the fat composition of the fried lean foods will be the same as that cooking fat. The process is more complex with fatty foods, and there are not great changes in the total quantity of fat in the fried food before and after frying. However, there are notable quality changes and these depend on the concentration gradients between frying oil and food. In deep-frying the cooking fat is usually used more than once, and there comes a moment when one considers subjectively that the oil is not longer suitable for frying and is discarded. This can be of practical significance for the total lipid intake, since a not determined quantity of oil is discarded and is not ingested. Consecuently the theoretical lipid intake has been decreased and, at the same time, some compounds, included saturated fats, are eliminated from diet whit the discarded oil. For example, the lipid composition of meats is substantially improved because of the highly favorable monounsaturated fatty acids penetration into them from the frying olive oil. In of the most important features is the possibility of manipulating fat intake by reducing it and improving the quality of the fat really consumed, this is of special interest in the possible relation to degenerative diseases. These changes in the fatty acids composition of oils and foods are repeatedly seen in laboratory experiments. However, their interpretation is <b>not</b> <b>easy,</b> in <b>part</b> because <b>of</b> the complexity of the deep-frying process used in the test. On the other hand, you would have to see the results obtained in the laboratory coincide with the results at practical level as well in the households as in catering, and, in this sense, some of the first results which we are obtaining in the population of Madrid are presented in the second <b>part</b> <b>of</b> this report...|$|R
