25|$|On May 2, Lee {{met with}} his generals on Clark Mountain, obtaining a {{panoramic}} view of the enemy camps. He realized that Grant was getting ready to attack, but did not know the precise route of advance. He correctly predicted that Grant would cross to the east of the Confederate fortifications on the Rapidan, using the Germanna and Ely Fords, but he could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain.</b> To retain flexibility of response, Lee had dispersed his Army over a wide area. Longstreet's First Corps was around Gordonsville, from where they had the flexibility to respond by railroad to potential threats to the Shenandoah Valley or to Richmond. Lee's headquarters and Hill's Third Corps were outside Orange Court House. Ewell's Second Corps was the closest to the Wilderness, at Morton's Ford.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} a young woman were found frozen in a creek by hunters on November 23, 2008, in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, near an {{abandoned}} farm. To extract the body, investigators were forced to chisel away the ice and scuba divers searched the bottom for evidence. Some articles of clothing were found, including a black and pink top with a pink bow, originating from Family Dollar, distributed in the spring of 2008. The underclothing that she wore, also from Family Dollar, was shipped only between July 1 and July 15, 2008. Her jeans were that of the Angels brand and the bottom of the legs had been rolled up, somewhat, and an elastic ponytail holder was found on her wrist. No socks or shoes were found at the scene. Initially, no jewelry was found, until a penny-sized St. Benedict medal was found by divers, but it may not have belonged to her, as examiners could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> how long {{it had been in the}} water. However, some reports claim that a bracelet containing several pendants was also found on the girl's remains. The hair was a shoulder-length light brown, possibly having hair highlights due to having some different shades. The clothing had caused some issues with investigators, as many of the different articles were in various sizes.|$|E
500|$|Czolgosz, gun in pocket, {{had arrived}} early at the fair, and was {{quite close to}} the podium before McKinley arrived. [...] He {{considered}} shooting the President during his speech, but felt he could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> of hitting his target; he was also being jostled by the crowd. [...] Czolgosz had not {{made up his mind}} when McKinley concluded his speech and disappeared behind security guards. [...] Nevertheless, he attempted to follow McKinley as the President began his tour of the fair, but was thrust back by officers. [...] Czolgosz saw no further chance at getting close to the President that day, and he returned to his $2/week rented room above a saloon.|$|E
500|$|W. L. Warren {{advances}} {{the theory}} that either Walter or Geoffrey Fitz Peter, instead of Ranulf Glanvill, {{was the author of}} Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Angliae, a legal treatise on the laws and constitutions of the English. Chrimes agrees that Glanvill was probably not the author, and feels that Walter likely was, although he could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain.</b> If he was the author, he composed what Chrimes called a [...] "great literary memorial of Henry II's government". Neither of Walter's two modern biographers, however, feel that he was the author of the Tractatus, and the historian Ralph Turner agrees. The historian Michael Clanchy says of Walter [...] "The proliferation of documents was a European and a continuing phenomenon, yet if it were to be associated in England with one man, he would be Hubert Walter." ...|$|E

500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest {{into the}} death of the Princess, on 13 February 2008, {{speaking}} by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he [...] "could not remember specifically" [...] whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it [...] "would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, but... I do not think the fact that they did not manage to find a file rules out anything either". He said he believed MI6 had an informant at the Paris Ritz but he could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> that this person was necessarily Henri Paul.|$|E
500|$|Laserblast has {{received}} largely negative reviews, and consistently {{ranks among the}} Bottom 100 list of films on the Internet Movie Database. A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "The only thing eerie about Laserblast is {{the thought that the}} people who made this loser are still running around loose." [...] In the review, Laserblast was described as [...] "an incomprehensible blending" [...] of popular recent films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, with a script [...] "so disordered we could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> that the reels were being run in proper sequence". It also criticized the props, particularly the laser gun, which they compared to a cereal box prize. A review by Variety magazine said the special effects were decent, but the script [...] "has more holes than the laser-ravaged landscape." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times said Kim Milford's performance was dull and that the script included plot-holes and inconsistencies. The Los Angeles Times critic Linda Gross said the script lacked [...] "credibility, psychological motivation and narrative cohesiveness", although she praised Terry Bowen's cinematography, saying it [...] "effectively captures the ambience of desert small-town life." [...] It was described as one of the worst films {{of the year in the}} book, The Golden Turkey Awards.|$|E

2500|$|In Israel, Passover is the seven-day holiday of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, {{with the}} first and last days {{observed}} as legal holidays and as holy days involving holiday meals, special prayer services, and abstention from work; the intervening days are known as Chol HaMoed ("Weekdays [...] the Festival"). Diaspora Jews historically observed the festival for eight days. Reform and Reconstructionist Jews and Israeli Jews, wherever they are, usually observe the holiday over seven days. The reason for this extra day is due to enactment of the ancient Jewish sages. It is thought by many scholars that Jews outside of Israel could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> if their local calendars fully conformed to practice of the Temple at Jerusalem, so they added an extra day. But as this practice only attaches to certain (major) sacred days, others posit the extra day may have been added to accommodate people who had to travel long distances to participate in communal worship and ritual practices; or the practice may have evolved as a compromise between conflicting interpretations of Jewish Law regarding the calendar; or it may have evolved as a safety measure in areas where Jews were commonly in danger, so that their enemies would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> on which day to attack.|$|E
2500|$|John Marshall, another {{archeologist}} at Mohenjo-daro, {{described the}} figure as [...] "a young girl, {{her hand on}} her hip in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats time to the music with her legs and feet." [...] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, [...] "We may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> that she was a dancer, but she was good at what she did and she knew it". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 June, Odell awoke at 6:00 AM, {{reporting}} that the night was largely free of wind and that he slept well. [...] At 8:00 AM, Odell started an ascent to Camp VI to make geological studies and to support Mallory and Irvine. The mountain was swept by mists so {{he could not see}} the NE Ridge clearly along which Mallory and Irvine intended to climb. At 7900m (26,000-ft) he climbed over a small outcropping. At 12:50, the mists suddenly cleared. [...] Odell noted in his diary, [...] "saw M & I on the ridge, nearing base of final pyramide". In a first report on 5 July to The Times he clarified this view. Odell was excited about having found the first fossils on Everest when there was a clearing in the weather and he saw the summit ridge and final pyramid of Everest. His eyes caught a tiny black dot which moved on a small snowcrest beneath a rock-step on the ridge. A second black dot was moving toward the first one. The first dot reached the crest of the ridge ("broke skyline"). He could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> if the second dot also did so.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{boarding}} crew were away, Bruun received {{a message from}} the 2nd Naval District by radio, informing him that the forts in the Oslofjord were in action against unidentified warships. Requests on the part of Bruun regarding the nationality of the intruding foreign ships were never answered. When {{the boarding}} crew returned from Roda, they reported that they had been prevented from properly inspecting the ship's cargo. The German captain had opposed the boarding crew in their attempt to access the ship's cargo holds. At 04:15 Bruun received a new report from the 2nd Naval District, informing him that unidentified foreign warships were forcing their way towards the city of Bergen. A follow-up radio message relaying the identity of the intruding warships as German, did not reach Bruun. Relying on the reports he had received, and what he had heard on the radio news, Bruun reasoned that he could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>certain</b> if the intruders were German or British. While awaiting clarification of the situation, he decided to seize Roda as a prize and move his own and the German ship to [...] further to the south. An eight-man prize crew was despatched to Roda with instructions to replace the German flag with the Norwegian naval ensign, disable the ship's radio transmitter, and order the German captain to move to Riskafjord. After the German captain had refused to follow the instructions of the prize crew, Bruun threatened him with opening fire, but the crew on Roda kept delaying while awaiting the coming German invasion.|$|E
