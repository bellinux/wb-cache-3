40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{exploratory}} research, {{as part of}} a three-stage study, into the use of a Group Support System (GSS) – the Zing Team Room (ZTR) – to enhance interpersonal communication between supervisor/managers (raters) and employee/functionaries (ratees) during performance appraisal interviews. A view of performance review is proposed which portrays how the substance of communication acts elicits tacit knowledge. Here participants, as a partnership, employ techniques to dialogue individual or organisational performance issues. The ZTR is seen as a vehicle which supports joint efforts to co-create meaning. Each anticipates and responds to the questions raised or reflects and deliberates on the answers given by the other. In this way the intent on achieving <b>negotiated</b> <b>commitment</b> to action is captured and made explicit. The ideal of two-sided agreement, and mutual accord being achieved in appraisal interviews is revisited, in this paper, but not from the standpoint of conventional performance review methods. Received wisdom holds that management’s interest in the now familiar structured or semi-structured appraisal interview, while historically a function of ‘control’ over employee performance, may in fact have diminishing value. Notwithstanding much of the disillusionment with respect to performance review procedures reported in the research literature, there is an increasing indication that the rules of engagement between managers and employees are changing inexorably. For some time theorists have suggested alternative systems of thinking concerning organisational performance issues based on perspectives of social equity and propriety. It is argued, for instance, that systems of enablement or empowerment (negotiated or otherwise) are more in keeping with complex adaptive systems theory and chaos theory. Chaos theory contends that ‘control’ as a central principle of performance management is illusory since uncertainty, change, and discontinuity are constant. Through the lens of social constructivism, a workable approach to describing the appraisal partnering process is explored as an alternative to conventional performance review procedures...|$|E

Second, while the "Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) " also <b>negotiates</b> <b>commitments</b> for Annex I countries, in practice this was originally deemed to relate in particular to those that have not ratified the Protocol - that is, the USA. In addition, the AWG-LCA negotiates "nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) " of developing countries, which are to be supported and enabled by industrialised countries through technology, financing and capacity building. Both the NAMAs and the support are to be undertaken in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner. Finally, the AWG-LCA negotiates ways to enhance adaptation efforts of developing countries, which are also to be financially and technologically supported by industrialised countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} paper discusses {{environmental agreements}} as {{a variant of}} cooperative or negotiated approaches. Environmental agreements are increasingly discussed as a new policy instrument to deal with environmental problems in a flexible manner at low cost. Environmental agreements are <b>negotiated</b> <b>commitments</b> from firms or industrial associations with the government to improve their environmental performance. Agents of the industry impute environmental agreements {{as an instrument of}} environmental policy a high level of environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency. Polluting industries make use of an environmental agreement in order to prevent government intervention by other instruments. Thereby they suppose to have a greater degree of freedom to act. That is the reason why environmental agreements are discussed as an alternative to other instruments of environmental policy. The result of this paper is that environmental agreements offer no advantages in comparison to other instruments of environmental policy: The problem of free-riding and the mostly unregulated abatement effort among the firms lead to low environmental effectiveness and economic inefficiency. Combining an environmental agreement with a tradable permit system or a tax in a ‘policy mix’ can limit free-riding and inefficiency. It may lead to increasing administrative costs, lost flexibility and no time saving in implementation. emission standards, emission taxes, incentives to innovate...|$|R

Although the recent turbulence has been global and unusually severe, significant disruptions occur at the regional and national level quite often.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} whether a {{different}} approach taken towards GATS mode 4 negotiations could generate more liberal commitments within the multilateral trading system which would benefit low skilled workers. In principle, mode 4 is meant to facilitate cross-border movement {{of all types of}} professions, regardless of their skill level. However, in practice WTO Members have often refrained from making commitments orientated to benefitting low skilled workers. This paper looks at the economic, political and legal concerns that exist due to the current composition of GATS mode 4. It proposes a different approach to negotiations at the multilateral level which allows for discussion on the regulation of the entry, stay and return of a temporary migrant. Such an approach is controversial. It would require WTO Members to discuss to a certain extent the labour standards to which temporary migrant workers would be subjected. Still, this paper finds there are legally and politically feasible opportunities offered by the current composition of the GATS allowing for the adoption of such a different approach. Changes to the law are discussed that could better facilitate negotiations on mode 4 movement beneficial for low skilled workers. Suggestions are made why the adoption of this different approach might be feasible in the current political climate. This paper’s objective is to provide WTO Members with tools to further <b>negotiate</b> <b>commitments</b> more efficiently benefiting the subset of low skilled workers within the multilateral trading system. status: accepte...|$|R

The EU’s exclusive competence for external negotiation of agreements in areas of exclusive competence and internal CCP regarding their implementation were confirmed.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on joint and {{separate}} in-depth interviews with twenty (female) same sex couples who planned and had their children together {{in the context of}} their relationship. These families are one example of the increasing possibilities to live in non-traditional relationships and family forms, in contemporary Western societies. While lesbian and gay parents have a long history, there is little precedence for same sex couples setting up families 'from scratch' i. e. choosing to have children {{in the context of their}} relationship. These possibilities can be placed in the context of wider transformations of intimacy. There is widespread agreement that individualism in personal relationships has substantially increased, although opinions differ about the extent to which this individualism is essentially selfish. Lesbian parents, for example, have been portrayed as selfish individuals (Phillips, 1998) or alternatively as 'prime everyday experimenters' (Giddens, 1992), although the reality may be more nuanced than either of these polarities suggests. Overall, recent sociological research into both heterosexual and 'non-heterosexual' family lives suggests that transformations of intimacy are characterised by <b>negotiated</b> <b>commitments</b> and moral reasoning. However, to date, relatively little attention has been paid to the ways in which these themes may be modified by the presence of dependent children, particularly given the socially constructed nature of children's needs. Respondents in my study are involved in both innovative family practices and the care of dependent children. As such, they can offer new insights to the above debates. They present a radical departure from dominant conventions of heterosexual gendered family norms and the biological imperatives of reproduction. However, while working out new ways of doing family, these practices are located within deeply conventional moralities of motherhood, which leave little space within which to offer up new stories of doing family...|$|R

See: [URL] To test a management model of facilitated reflection on network feedback as a means to engage services in problem solving the delivery of integrated primary mental healthcare to older people. DESIGN: Participatory mixed methods case study evaluating the impact of a network management model using organisational network feedback (through social network analysis, key informant interviews and policy review). INTERVENTION: A model of facilitated network reflection using network theory and methods. SETTING: A rural community in South Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 32 staff from 24 services and 12 senior service managers from mental health, primary care and social care services. RESULTS: Health and social care organisations identified that they operated in clustered self-managed networks within sectors, with no overarching purposive older people's mental healthcare network. The model of facilitated reflection revealed service goal and role conflicts. These discussions helped local services to identify as a network, and begin the problem-solving communication and referral links. A Governance Group assisted this process. Barriers to integrated servicing through a network included service funding tied to performance of direct care tasks and the lack of a clear lead network administration organisation. CONCLUSIONS: A model of facilitated reflection helped organisations to identify as a network, but revealed sensitivity about organisational roles and goals, which demonstrated that conflict should be expected. Networked servicing needed a neutral network administration organisation with cross-sectoral credibility, a mandate and the resources to monitor the network, to deal with conflict, <b>negotiate</b> <b>commitment</b> among the service managers, and provide opportunities for different sectors to meet and problem solve. This requires consistency and sustained intersectoral policies that include strategies and funding to facilitate and maintain health and social care networks in rural communities...|$|R

40|$|Stakeholder {{participation}} is advocated widely, {{but there is}} little structured, empirical research into its influence on policy development. We aim to further the insight into the characteristics of participatory policy development by comparing it to expert-based policy development for the same case. We describe the process of problem framing and analysis, as well as the knowledge base used. We apply an uncertainty perspective to reveal differences between the approaches and speculate about possible explanations. We view policy development as a continuous handling of substantive uncertainty and process uncertainty, and investigate how the methods of handling uncertainty of actors influence the policy development. Our findings suggest that the wider frame that was adopted in the participatory approach {{was the result of a}} more active handling of process uncertainty. The stakeholders handled institutional uncertainty by broadening the problem frame, and they handled strategic uncertainty by <b>negotiating</b> <b>commitment</b> and by including all important stakeholder criteria in the frame. In the expert-based approach, we observed a more passive handling of uncertainty, apparently to avoid complexity. The experts handled institutional uncertainty by reducing the scope and by anticipating windows of opportunity in other policy arenas. Strategic uncertainty was handled by assuming stakeholders' acceptance of noncontroversial measures that balanced benefits and sacrifices. Three other observations are of interest to the scientific debate on participatory policy processes. Firstly, the participatory policy was less adaptive than the expert-based policy. The observed low tolerance for process uncertainty of participants made them opt for a rigorous "once and for all" settling of the conflict. Secondly, in the participatory approach, actors preferred procedures of traceable knowledge acquisition over controversial topics to handle substantive uncertainty. This excluded the use of expert judgment only, whereas the experts relied on their judgment in the absence of a satisfactory model. Thirdly, our study provides empirical evidence for the frequent claim that stakeholder involvement increases the quality of the knowledge base for a policy development process. Because these findings were obtained in a case that featured good process management and a guiding general policy framework from higher authorities, they may not generalize beyond such conditions...|$|R

Usually, compensation as for example applied in BPEL (Business Process Execution Language), requires that all compensation steps associated with the business process perform successfully. Also, the conditions for a compensation are not considered and it is not dynamic. In some business scenarios, e. g. a complex production process involving several partners, compensation is a commitment under certain conditions. These conditions in turn can be dynamic and interdependent. Often, a lot of human effort is required to perform compensation.

This paper analyses {{some of the main}} provisions of the GATS and the Annex on Financial Services to determine its impact on domestic financial regulation and whether the GATS framework can achieve its objectives of liberalising international trade in financial services while allowing states to maintain adequate domestic regulatory institutions.

The extent to which states can depart from their GATS obligations to achieve regulatory objectives has become the source of academic debate and policy interest.

Whereas in the past, the primary, if not the sole role of international courts was that of settling disputes, in their modern legalized reincarnation these empowered international institutions have come to be seen primarily as enforcement mechanisms; mechanisms that have been put in place by states in order to give effect to their originally <b>negotiated</b> <b>commitments</b> and to hold states (or other entities) accountable for the international rules agreed-upon. Within this common enforcement-centered discourse of international courts, in turn, the natural tendency has so far been to think of 'justice' mainly through its 'legal' or 'rule of law' dimension. This paper challenges this enforcement-centered discourse. Focusing on the vibrant WTO dispute settlement system (DSS) and the rich experience of the EU in that system, the paper argues that the current enforcement-oriented debate of international courts, and the WTO DSS in particular, is lacking in several fundamental aspects. First, it brushes aside other important roles served by the DSS, and consequently overshadows the manifold social outcomes - beyond rule-compliance - produced by this system. Second, the prevalent rule-enforcement discourse further works, in turn, as to mask the multiple challenges of justice encapsulated in international disputes reaching the DSS's docket, and obstructs the need to explore other conceptions of justice - beyond its formal legalprocedural meaning - such as global distributive, corrective, or transformative justice, through which the outcomes generated by this international adjudicatory system may (and should) be evaluated. Against this backdrop, the paper puts forwards a broad multifunctional account of the WTO DSS, which goes beyond the prevalent view of the system as primarily an enforcement mechanism, portraying it instead as a system of multiple, competing, and shifting roles. Among them, and {{at the center of the}} paper, the role of providing an orderly mechanism of renegotiation, redistribution, and settlement, that essentially allows WTO Members to readjust their original WTO commitments and reallocate their burdens and benefits of international cooperation, and thereby to arrive at new - at times not fully legally-compliant - but not necessarily 'unjust' cooperative and sustainable social outcomes. This discussion paper is part of a series of contributions to the conference "Towards a Grammar of Justice in EU Law', which took place on 6 - 7 November 2014 at VU University Amsterdam, sponsored by ACCESS EUROPE Amsterdam, VU Centre for European Legal Studies and the Dutch Research Council VENI grant...|$|R
