5|$|Despite widely varying {{treatment}} (some {{groups were}} actively targeted for genocide, {{while others were}} <b>not),</b> <b>some</b> died in concentration camps such as Dachau and others from various forms of Nazi brutality. According to extensive documentation (written and photographic) left by the Nazis, eyewitness testimony by survivors, perpetrators and bystanders and records of the occupied countries, most perished in death camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau.|$|E

5|$|When {{two species}} {{are similar in}} a {{particular}} character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors were also similar, and convergent if they were <b>not.</b> <b>Some</b> scientists have argued {{that there is a}} continuum between parallel and convergent evolution, while others maintain that despite some overlap, there are still important distinctions between the two.|$|E

5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in {{that the purpose of}} the systems are to replicate, regardless of whether they benefit the host organism or <b>not.</b> <b>Some</b> have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as positive selection vectors.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Modern Times, Chaplin left with Goddard {{for a trip to}} the Far East. The couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship, and it was not known whether they were married or <b>not.</b> <b>Some</b> time later, Chaplin {{revealed}} that they married in Canton during this trip. By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, The Great Dictator. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} 18th and through the 19th century, {{criticism}} centred on debates over the moral message of the play. Actor and playwright David Garrick's 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that Rosaline had been purposely included in the play to show how reckless the hero was {{and that this was}} the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare's spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. With the advent of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, and <b>not</b> <b>some</b> character flaw, led to the lovers' deaths.|$|E
5|$|<b>Noting</b> <b>some</b> of its {{architectural}} similarities, it {{is often}} stated that Delhi's Parliament House which {{was built in the}} 1920s has been patterned on the lines of this circular-shaped temple. There is, however, no reliable basis for this.|$|R

5000|$|With a low budget {{production}} and insufficient marketing, Psychotic Reaction peaked at #122 on the Billboard 200. Other singles, released between 1966 and 1969, sold poorly and did <b>not</b> chart (<b>some</b> <b>not</b> {{included in the}} original LP).|$|R
5|$|Stress {{plays an}} {{important}} role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are <b>not.</b> <b>Some</b> words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.|$|E
5|$|The Banu Nadir began rousing the nomads of Najd. The Nadir {{enlisted the}} Banu Ghatafan by paying them {{half of their}} harvest. This contingent, the second largest, added a {{strength}} of about 2,000 men and 300 horsemen led by Unaina bin Hasan Fazari. The Bani Assad also agreed to join, led by Tuleha Asadi. From the Banu Sulaym, the Nadir secured 700 men, though this force would likely have been much larger had <b>not</b> <b>some</b> of its leaders been sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir, who had a pact with Muhammad, refused to join.|$|E
5|$|When Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, he held an {{approval}} rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later Bill Clinton, {{as the highest}} ratings for departing presidents in the modern era. He was the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms, after a succession of five prior presidents did <b>not,</b> <b>some</b> under unusual circumstances. Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in 1994 {{that he had been}} diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier that year. He appeared publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon. He died ten years later in 2004 at the age of 93. Reagan had the third-longest life out of all the presidents, after Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. An icon among Republicans, he is viewed favorably in historian rankings of U.S. presidents, and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} was studied chiefly by Clunies-Ross (1924). Ian Clunies Ross also {{demonstrated}} that a toxin {{produced by the}} tick {{was responsible for the}} paralysis and <b>not</b> <b>some</b> infective agent carried by the ticks. The lifecycle was further studied by Oxer and Ricardo (1942) and later summarised by Seddon (1968).|$|E

25|$|Relationships between Jewish {{religious}} {{movements are}} varied; {{they are sometimes}} marked by interdenominational cooperation outside {{of the realm of}} halakha (Jewish law), and sometimes <b>not.</b> <b>Some</b> of the movements sometimes cooperate by uniting with one another in community federations and in campus organizations such as the Hillel Foundation.

25|$|Many paranormal romances rely on {{the blend}} of {{contemporary}} American life with the existence of supernatural or magically empowered beings, human or otherwise; sometimes the larger culture {{is aware of the}} magical in its midst, sometimes it is <b>not.</b> <b>Some</b> paranormal romances focus less on the specifics of their alternative worlds than do traditional science fiction or fantasy novels, keeping the attention strongly on the underlying romance. Others develop the alternate reality meticulously, combining well-planned magical systems and inhuman cultures with contemporary reality.|$|E
