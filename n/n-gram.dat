25|$|An <b>n-gram</b> {{model is}} a type of {{probabilistic}} language model for predicting the next item in such a sequence {{in the form of a}} (n−1)–order Markov model. <b>n-gram</b> models are now widely used in probability, communication theory, computational linguistics (for instance, statistical natural language processing), computational biology (for instance, biological sequence analysis), and data compression. Two benefits of <b>n-gram</b> models (and algorithms that use them) are simplicity and scalability – with larger n, a model can store more context with a well-understood space–time tradeoff, enabling small experiments to scale up efficiently.|$|E
25|$|An <b>n-gram</b> model models sequences, notably natural languages, {{using the}} {{statistical}} properties of n-grams.|$|E
25|$|Here {{are further}} examples; these are word-level 3-grams and 4-grams (and counts {{of the number}} of times they appeared) from the Google <b>n-gram</b> corpus.|$|E

25|$|Syntactic <b>n-grams</b> are {{intended}} to reflect syntactic structure more faithfully than linear <b>n-grams,</b> and have {{many of the same}} applications, especially as features in a Vector Space Model. Syntactic <b>n-grams</b> for certain tasks gives better results than the use of standard <b>n-grams,</b> for example, for authorship attribution.|$|R

We {{show that there is}} value in using very shallow linguistic representations, such as character <b>n-grams,</b> for recognizing subjective utterances, in particular, gains in the recall of subjective utterances.

25|$|The Workman layout {{is found}} to achieve overall less travel {{distance}} of the fingers for the English language than even Colemak. It does however generally incur higher same-finger <b>n-gram</b> frequencies.|$|E
25|$|An {{issue when}} using <b>n-gram</b> {{language}} models are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. They are encountered {{in computational linguistics}} and natural language processing when the input includes words which were not present in a system's dictionary or database during its preparation. By default, when a language model is estimated, the entire observed vocabulary is used. In some cases, {{it may be necessary}} to estimate the language model with a specific fixed vocabulary. In such a scenario, the n-grams in the corpus that contain an out-of-vocabulary word are ignored. The <b>n-gram</b> probabilities are smoothed over all the words in the vocabulary even if they were not observed.|$|E
25|$|Language letter {{frequencies}} {{may offer}} little help for some extended historical encryption {{techniques such as}} homophonic cipher that tend to flatten the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or <b>n-gram)</b> frequencies may provide an attack.|$|E
30|$|In this set, all OpCode <b>n-grams,</b> of all sizes, were sorted {{according}} to their DF value. Then, the first 1, 800 <b>n-grams</b> with the top DF score were selected. Feature selection was applied on the collection of 1, 800 <b>n-grams</b> patterns.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a new text feature {{selection}} method symmetrical strength of <b>N-Grams</b> (SSNG method) has been introduced. It has improved {{the performance of}} the classifiers by assigning highest weight to the most informative <b>N-Grams,</b> while least weight to the non-informative <b>N-Grams.</b>|$|R
30|$|Let n is {{the total}} number of documents, r is total number of classes, p {{is the total}} number of terms, m number of terms are {{obtained}} after removal of stop words, punctuation marks and white spaces, M is {{the total number of}} <b>N-Grams,</b> k numbers of <b>N-Grams</b> are selected as informative <b>N-Grams</b> based on threshold value at first pass, and s numbers of <b>N-Grams</b> are selected in the second pass.|$|R
25|$|To {{choose a}} {{value for n}} in an <b>n-gram</b> model, it is {{necessary}} to find the right trade off between the stability of the estimate against its appropriateness. This means that trigram (i.e. triplets of words) is a common choice with large training corpora (millions of words), whereas a bigram is often used with smaller ones.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of {{computational}} linguistics, in particular language modeling, skip-grams are a generalization of n-grams in which the components (typically words) need not be consecutive in the text under consideration, but may leave gaps that are skipped over. They provide one way of overcoming the data sparsity problem found with conventional <b>n-gram</b> analysis.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>n-gram</b> {{models are}} often criticized {{because they lack}} any {{explicit}} representation of long range dependency. This is because the only explicit dependency range is (n−1) tokens for an <b>n-gram</b> model, and since natural languages incorporate many cases of unbounded dependencies (such as wh-movement), this means that an <b>n-gram</b> model cannot in principle distinguish unbounded dependencies from noise (since long range correlations drop exponentially with distance for any Markov model). For this reason, <b>n-gram</b> models have not made much impact on linguistic theory, where part of the explicit goal is to model such dependencies.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} shallow {{linguistic}} approach to subjectivity classification. Using multinomial kernel machines, we demonstrate that a data representation based on counting character <b>n-grams</b> {{is able to}} improve on results previously attained on the MPQA corpus using word-based <b>n-grams</b> and syntactic information. We compare two types of string-based representations: key substring groups and character <b>n-grams.</b> We find that word-spanning character <b>n-grams</b> significantly reduce the bias of a classifier, and boost its accuracy. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{contiguous}} {{sequences of}} the terms (<b>N-grams)</b> in the documents are symmetrically distributed among different classes. The symmetrical distribution of the <b>N-Grams</b> raises uncertainty in the belongings of the <b>N-Grams</b> towards the class. In this paper, we focused on the selection of most discriminating <b>N-Grams</b> by reducing the effects of symmetrical distribution. In this context, a new text feature selection method named as the symmetrical strength of the <b>N-Grams</b> (SSNG) is proposed using a two pass filtering based feature selection (TPF) approach. Initially, in the first pass of the TPF, the SSNG method chooses various informative <b>N-Grams</b> from the entire extracted <b>N-Grams</b> of the corpus. Subsequently, in the second pass the well-known Chi Square (χ 2) method {{is being used to}} select few most informative <b>N-Grams.</b> Further, to classify the documents the two standard classifiers Multinomial Naive Bayes and Linear Support Vector Machine have been applied on the ten standard text data sets. In most of the datasets, the experimental results state the performance and success rate of SSNG method using TPF approach is superior to the state-of-the-art methods viz. Mutual Information, Information Gain, Odds Ratio, Discriminating Feature Selection and χ 2.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{criticism}} {{that has been}} made is that Markov models of language, including <b>n-gram</b> models, do not explicitly capture the performance/competence distinction. [...] This is because <b>n-gram</b> models are not designed to model linguistic knowledge as such, and make no claims to being (even potentially) complete models of linguistic knowledge; instead, they are used in practical applications.|$|E
2500|$|In practice, <b>n-gram</b> {{models have}} been shown [...] to be {{extremely}} effective in modeling language data, which is a core component in modern statistical language applications.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>n-gram</b> {{models are}} widely used in {{statistical}} natural language processing. [...] In speech recognition, phonemes and sequences of phonemes are modeled using a <b>n-gram</b> distribution. [...] For parsing, words are modeled such that each <b>n-gram</b> is composed of n words. [...] For language identification, sequences of characters/graphemes (e.g., letters of the alphabet) are modeled for different languages. [...] For sequences of characters, the 3-grams (sometimes referred to as [...] "trigrams") that can be generated from [...] "good morning" [...] are [...] "goo", [...] "ood", [...] "od [...] ", [...] "d m", [...] " [...] mo", [...] "mor" [...] and so forth, counting the space character as a gram (sometimes {{the beginning and end}} of a text are modeled explicitly, adding [...] "__g", [...] "_go", [...] "ng_", and [...] "g__"). [...] For sequences of words, [...] the trigrams that can be generated from [...] "the dog smelled like a skunk" [...] are [...] "# the dog", [...] "the dog smelled", [...] "dog smelled like", [...] "smelled like a", [...] "like a skunk" [...] and [...] "a skunk #".|$|E
40|$|Background: In protein {{sequence}} classification, {{identification of}} the sequence motifs or <b>n-grams</b> that can precisely discriminate between classes is a more interesting scientific question than the classification itself. A number of classification methods aim at accurate classification but fail to explain which sequence features indeed contribute to the accuracy. We hypothesize that sequences in lower denominations (<b>n-grams)</b> {{can be used to}} explore the sequence landscape and to identify class-specific motifs that discriminate between classes during classification. Discriminative <b>n-grams</b> are short peptide sequences that are highly frequent in one class but are either minimally present or absent in other classes. In this study, we present a new substitution-based scoring function for identifying discriminative <b>n-grams</b> that are highly specific to a class. Results: We present a scoring function based on discriminative <b>n-grams</b> that can effectively discriminate between classes. The scoring function, initially, harvests the entire set of 4 - to 8 -grams from the protein sequences of different classes in the dataset. Similar <b>n-grams</b> of the same size are combined to form new <b>n-grams,</b> where the similarity is defined by positive amino acid substitution scores in the BLOSUM 62 matrix. Substitution has resulted in a large {{increase in the number of}} discriminatory <b>n-grams</b> harvested. Due to the unbalanced nature of the dataset, the frequencies of the <b>n-grams</b> are normalized using a dampening factor, which gives more weightage to th...|$|R
2500|$|Syntactic <b>n-grams</b> are <b>n-grams</b> {{defined by}} paths in {{syntactic}} dependency or constituent trees {{rather than the}} linear structure of the text. For example, the sentence [...] "economic news has little effect on financial markets" [...] can be transformed to syntactic <b>n-grams</b> following the tree structure of its dependency relations: news-economic, effect-little, effect-on-markets-financial.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecurring {{sequences}} of words {{have long been}} considered as a signifier of different genres and registers by corpus linguists. The previous research mainly focused on lexical <b>n-grams.</b> Nevertheless, <b>n-grams</b> of other linguistic features, such as part-of-speech, have been less studied. The current study is expected to examine whether <b>n-grams</b> of part-of-speech tags extracted from a large corpus can be a discriminator of different genres. The results show that a strong correlation exists between the information about <b>n-grams</b> of part-of-speech tags and the genre of the text...|$|R
2500|$|Note that in {{a simple}} <b>n-gram</b> {{language}} model, {{the probability of a}} word, conditioned on some number of previous words (one word in a bigram model, two words in a trigram model, etc.) can be described as following a categorical distribution (often imprecisely called a [...] "multinomial distribution").|$|E
2500|$|An <b>n-gram</b> of size 1 is {{referred}} to as a [...] "unigram"; size 2 is a [...] "bigram" [...] (or, less commonly, a [...] "digram"); size 3 is a [...] "trigram". Larger sizes are sometimes referred to by the value of n in modern language, e.g., [...] "four-gram", [...] "five-gram", and so on.|$|E
2500|$|In {{practice}} {{it is necessary}} to smooth the probability distributions by also assigning non-zero probabilities to unseen words or n-grams. [...] The reason is that models derived directly from the <b>n-gram</b> frequency counts have severe problems when confronted with any n-grams that have not explicitly been seen before – the zero-frequency problem. [...] Various smoothing methods are used, from simple [...] "add-one" [...] (Laplace) smoothing (assign a count of 1 to unseen n-grams; see Rule of succession) to more sophisticated models, such as Good–Turing discounting or back-off models. [...] Some of these methods are equivalent to assigning a prior distribution to the probabilities of the n-grams and using Bayesian inference to compute the resulting posterior <b>n-gram</b> probabilities. [...] However, the more sophisticated smoothing models were typically not derived in this fashion, but instead through independent considerations.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} use of {{recurrent}} word-combinations 			(<b>n-grams)</b> in texts produced by Norwegian learners of English and native speakers of 			English in two academic disciplines, namely linguistics and business. The study explores 			the {{extent to which the}} same <b>n-grams</b> are used by learners and native speakers in the two 			disciplines. Using an adapted version of Moon's (1998) functional framework, we map the 			functions of the <b>n-grams,</b> distinguishing between three major functions: 			ideational/informational, interpersonal and textual. The ngrams are extracted from the 			VESPA and BAWE corpora, representing learner and native language, respectively. The data 			reveal a complex picture. Informational <b>n-grams</b> are by far the most frequent type and 			they seem to be not only discipline-specific, but also topic-specific. There are more 			<b>n-grams</b> with an interpersonal function (evaluative and modalizing) in the linguistics 			than in the business discipline. Frequencies of <b>n-grams</b> with a textual/organizational 			function are more similar across the material. However, there is relatively little 			overlap in {{the use of}} individual <b>n-grams</b> with interpersonal and textual functions across 			the L 1 groups. There is a higher degree of similarity between learners and native 			speakers in the linguistics discipline than in the business discipline. On the other 			hand, there is some similarity across disciplines within L 1 groups as regards 			interpersonal and textual <b>n-grams...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a system for {{automatic}} English (L 2) grammatical error correction. It participated in ConLL 2013 shared tasks. The system applies a set of simple rules for correction of grammatical errors. In some cases, it uses syntactic <b>n-grams,</b> i. e., <b>n-grams</b> that are constructed in a syntactic metric: namely, by following paths in dependency trees, i. e., there is special procedure that allows obtaining syntactic <b>n-grams.</b> Note that in general case syntactic <b>n-grams</b> permit introducing syntactic information into machine learning methods, because syntactic <b>n-grams</b> have all properties of traditional <b>n-grams.</b> The system is simple, practically does not use additional linguistic resources and was constructed in two months. Due to its simplicity it does not obtain better scores as compared to more sophisticated systems that use many resources, the Internet and machine learning methods, {{but it can be}} positioned as a baseline system for the task. ...|$|R
50|$|For example, in {{the field}} of natural {{language}} processing (NLP) the similarity among features is quite intuitive. Features such as words, <b>n-grams</b> or syntactic <b>n-grams</b> can be quite similar, though formally they are considered as different features in the VSM. For example, words “play” and “game” are different words and thus are mapped to different dimensions in VSM; yet it is obvious that they are related semantically. In case of <b>n-grams</b> or syntactic <b>n-grams,</b> Levenshtein distance can be applied (in fact, Levenshtein distance can be applied to words as well).|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fields}} of {{computational}} linguistics and probability, an <b>n-gram</b> is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. [...] The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. When the items are words, -grams may also be called shingles.|$|E
2500|$|More concisely, an <b>n-gram</b> model predicts [...] {{based on}} [...] In {{probability}} terms, this is [...] When used for language modeling, independence assumptions are made {{so that each}} word depends only on the last n−1 words. [...] This Markov model is used as an approximation of the true underlying language. [...] This assumption {{is important because it}} massively simplifies the problem of estimating the language model from data. [...] In addition, because of the open nature of language, it is common to group words unknown to the language model together.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern {{applications}} {{that rely on}} <b>n-gram</b> based models, such as machine translation applications, do not rely exclusively on such models; instead, they typically also incorporate Bayesian inference. Modern statistical models are typically made up of two parts, a prior distribution describing the inherent likelihood of a possible result and a likelihood function {{used to assess the}} compatibility of a possible result with observed data. When a language model is used, it is used as part of the prior distribution (e.g. to gauge the inherent [...] "goodness" [...] of a possible translation), and even then it is often not the only component in this distribution.|$|E
40|$|Guaranteeing {{the quality}} of {{extracted}} features that describe relevant knowledge to users or topics is a challenge {{because of the large}} number of extracted features. Most popular existing term-based feature selection methods suffer from noisy feature extraction, which is irrelevant to the user needs (noisy).

This paper proposes a method for reducing the noise in <b>n-grams.</b> The method first extracts more specific features (terms) to remove noisy features. The method then uses an extended random set to accurately weight <b>n-grams</b> based on their distribution in the documents and their terms distribution in <b>n-grams.</b> The proposed approach not only reduces the number of extracted <b>n-grams</b> but also improves the performance.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the SPEX algorithm by Bernstein and Zobel (2004) for detecting co-derivative documents using duplicate <b>n-grams.</b> Although we {{totally agree with}} the claim that not using unique <b>n-grams</b> can greatly increase the efficiency and scalability {{of the process of}} detecting co-derivative documents, we have found serious bottlenecks in the way SPEX finds the duplicate <b>n-grams.</b> While the memory requirements for computing co-derivative documents can be reduced to up to 1 % by only using duplicate <b>n-grams,</b> SPEX needs about 40 times more memory for computing the list of duplicate <b>n-grams</b> itself. Therefore the memory requirements of the whole process are not reduced enough to make the algorithm practical for very large collections.
