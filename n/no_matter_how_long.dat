25|$|The {{electroscope}} is {{an important}} tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect. For example, if the electroscope is negatively charged throughout, there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem. If high-frequency light shines on the cap, the electroscope discharges and the leaf will fall limp. This is because {{the frequency of the}} light shining on the cap is above the cap's threshold frequency. The photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from the cap, reducing its negative charge. This will discharge a negatively charged electroscope and further charge a positive electroscope. However, if the electromagnetic radiation hitting the metal cap does not have a high enough frequency (its frequency is below the threshold value for the cap), then the leaf will never discharge, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> one shines the low-frequency light at the cap.|$|E

500|$|Salinger was {{assigned}} to a counter-intelligence division, for which he used his proficiency in French and German to interrogate prisoners of war. In April 1945 he entered a liberated concentration camp, probably one of Dachau's sub-camps. Salinger earned the rank of Staff Sergeant and served in five campaigns. Salinger's experiences in the war affected him emotionally. He was hospitalized {{for a few weeks}} for combat stress reaction after Germany was defeated, and he later told his daughter: [...] "You never really get the smell of burning flesh out of your nose entirely, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> you live." [...] Both of his biographers speculate that Salinger drew upon his wartime experiences in several stories, such as [...] "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor", which is narrated by a traumatized soldier. Salinger continued to write while serving in the army, publishing several stories in slick magazines such as Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post. He also continued to submit stories to The New Yorker, but with little success; it rejected all of his submissions from 1944 to 1946, a group of 15poems in 1945 alone.|$|E
500|$|Khaba {{is known}} by his serekh and Golden Horus name only. His Nisut-Bity title and his Nebty name are unknown. Additionally, Khaba {{is one of}} the very few kings from Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom times with an archaeologically proven Gold name, a likely {{predecessor}} to the Golden Horus name, which Khaba may also have introduced. Aside from Khaba, the only kings with Gold names who lived before king Sneferu, founder of the 4th dynasty, were Djer, Den, Nynetjer, Khasekhemwy, and Djoser. From Snefru onward, the Golden Horus name became a fixed royal title to any ruling king, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the king ruled. Khaba's Golden Horus name can be found on several seal impressions, although its correct reading and translation are disputed. Peter Kaplony interprets it as Nub-iret or Nub iret-djedef, though he is unsure whether the syllable djedef was an inherent part of the name or an additional honorary title. Thomas Schneider and Jürgen von Beckerath, in contrast, see Khaba's Golden Horus as Netjer-nub, which means [...] "golden falcon". Khaba's Gold name is the first to show the infinitive form of the royal Gold name.|$|E
500|$|Artists, however, do not {{necessarily}} take geometry literally. As Douglas Hofstadter writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, Gödel, Escher, Bach, by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: [...] "The difference between an Escher drawing and non-Euclidean geometry {{is that in the}} latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> one stares at the pictures." [...] Hofstadter discusses the seemingly paradoxical lithograph Print Gallery by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a [...] "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" [...] to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical. The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and Hendrik Lenstra, who propose that it could contain a Droste effect copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.|$|E

500|$|As {{neither side}} had {{established}} a winning lead in the series, the final match at The Oval was to be played to a finish, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it took. England scored a record team total of 903runs and Australia were heavily defeated. Verity, one of five Yorkshire players in the team, bowled 12overs {{in the game and}} took two wickets. He also played a part in the achievement of Len Hutton, who scored 364runs, breaking the record for the highest individual innings in a Test match. As Hutton's innings began to assume epic proportions, Verity stayed with him throughout the intervals, helping him to maintain concentration. On the Sunday of the match, when there was no play, Verity arranged for Hutton to have a break by the sea to relax away from cricket. Hutton commented: [...] "I owe [...] the kind of debt that one can never fully repay... His quiet, natural dignity was an immense source of strength to me throughout those long hours". The series was drawn; Verity took 14wickets at an average of 25.28, finishing second in the England bowling averages, behind Bowes. However, Charlie Barnett, who played in the series but disliked Hammond, believed that Hammond's poor tactical use of Verity cost England potential victories in the second and fourth Tests. Verity played no other representative cricket that season, but appeared once more against the Australians for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's team which defeated the tourists by 10 wickets.|$|E
