Costs are compared with the RPI (retail price index). It is shown that <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> landfill costs in the UK have increased four fold against RPI over the last 20 years, and it is predicted that they will increase {{at the same rate}} over the next 20 years.

50|$|The {{facility}} at 815 Mission Rock Road, Santa Paula, provided service to over 30,000 waste generators. At the time, it had received and processed over 2000000000 gal {{since it opened}} in 1959. The company says they treat about 100 different streams of waste. The owner of facility said that they never had a major problem such as this since the plant only takes <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> The capacity of the facility was increased to handle up to 100 gal or 140000 gal by 2014. The facility provides an environmentally safe and legal means of treating, disposing and recycling of contaminated but <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> {{as an alternative to}} dumping untreated wastes into municipal sewer systems or into the environment. The plant uses centrifuges, electrocoagulation, carbon and micron filtration, ozone injection, dissolved air flotation, and chemical treatments.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, waste {{quantities}} have grown steadily in close relation to economic growth. To tackle {{the problem of}} continuing waste growth within the EU, waste prevention was listed among four top priorities in the EU Sixth environment Action Programme. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is here used for projecting future quantities of hazardous and <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> in Sweden to 2030. The effects of driving forces behind waste generation are illustrated {{by comparing the results}} of waste projections for a Baseline scenario and four alternative scenarios. The scenarios differ mainly in GDP growth rates and in the assumptions about future waste intensities of the economic activities of firms and households. We use a high-resolution data set on waste flows of 18 various types of <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> and 16 various types of hazardous waste attributed to six waste-generating sources for the base year 2006. Waste generated in the scenarios, thus, relate to firms’ material input, output, employees, capital scrapping and fuel combustion as well as households’ consumption. The impact of economic growth in increasing the generation of nonhazardous and hazardous waste is apparent when comparing the growth of waste from 2006 to 2030 in the five scenarios. On the contrary, technological change resulting in less waste intensive production processes and changed behaviour among households, making their activities less waste intensive, have a strong reducing effect, especially on generation of <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> relating to firms’ material input. general equilibrium model; waste generation; decoupling; waste intensities waste scenarios. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{replacement}} {{of fossil fuels}} by renewable fuels can contribute to improve the environmental performance of the power production and to move forward in the sustainability way. The experience {{has shown that the}} availability of alternative fuels can be an obstacle for its extensive use for energy production, since biomass is not always available. The use of <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> may be a good alternative to biomass, mainly if they are economically unattractive for recycling or if they present a high cost for land-filling. The co-firing of <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> with coal is, therefore, a subject of great interest for the sustainability of energy production and the reduction of the emissions of fossil greenhouse gases. The use of these wastes for energy is promising if they combine well with other fuels during the conversion process for energy production and have no negative effect on the combustion system, on the ash quality and on the gaseous emissions...|$|R
