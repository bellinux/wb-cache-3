500|$|While both mining {{activity}} and natural faults could be causative factors, {{it is difficult}} to establish a precise cause. According to Professor Andrzej Kijko from the University of Pretoria's <b>Natural</b> <b>Hazard</b> Centre, mining can activate natural faults. He believes that more than 90% of South Africa's earthquakes are caused by mining, especially around the areas of Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Welkom. According to Hartnady, [...] "This part of Africa is {{in the vicinity of the}} East African Rift system, which is being pulled apart by a few millimetres annually." [...] He says [...] "earthquakes are caused by a slip on a fault line and the release of stored elastic energy" [...] and {{mining activity}} could have triggered the earthquake. Kijko and Hartnady believe that – unlike the 1969 Tulbagh earthquake – this event was a mining-related earthquake which is a relatively more common occurrence than a natural earthquake in South Africa. Professor Ray Durrheim, a seismologist at Wits University, said seismic events will continue while there is mining activity in the area, and even long afterwards. He said the flooding of inactive mines could also compound pressure on geological faults, triggering further seismic events. According to Durrheim, the link between mining and earthquakes lies [...] "on a continuum, from where it's purely induced by mining activities to where you are triggering a natural earthquake".|$|E
2500|$|The first European {{to record}} Point Arena was Spaniard Bartolomé Ferrer in 1543, who named it Cabo de Fortunas (Spanish for [...] "cape of fortunes"). The cape was renamed to Punta Delgado (narrow point) in 1775 by {{lieutenant}} Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra (commander of the schooner Sonora), {{part of a}} royal expedition chartered {{by the government of}} Mexico to map the north coast of Alta California. Later the point, and the small harbor town south of it, were called Barra de Arena (i.e. sandbar) and finally Point Arena (literally [...] "sand point"). [...] Point Arena is a narrow peninsula jutting around 1/2 mile (800 m) into the Pacific Ocean. This sandbar creates a <b>natural</b> <b>hazard</b> to navigation, and hence the need for a lighthouse and fog signal here.|$|E
2500|$|Flooding is {{the most}} {{prominent}} <b>natural</b> <b>hazard</b> in Argentina, and along with the littoral provinces, Buenos Aires is a very high risk area. Across the country, an according to 1998 statistics from Swiss-Re, Argentina ranks 18th {{in the world in}} potential flood losses, in excess of US$3 billion in 1998. [...] Argentina is also one of 14 countries whose potential losses from floods are greater than 1 percent of GDP. Specifically in Buenos Aires, flooding occurs on average about twice per year. These floods are due to two causes: the condition of the drainage network, and strong winds from the southeast, (sudestadas), which produce a rise of the Rio de la Plata high above its average. Its waters then spill over the land, flooding the coastal areas inhabited by the poor. From the topographical standpoint, the City of Buenos Aires and its suburbs are located in a periphery of rolling grasslands, characterized by its limited slope toward the Rio de la Plata. The area was originally carved by small watercourses that either drain into the Rio de la Plata or in the two most important bodies of water in the area: the Reconquista and Matanza-Riachuelo. All of the watercourses have the special characteristics of a plain region: short water courses with little permanent flow, irregular routes, and broad flood valleys. The layout of the watercourses defines flood-prone areas, where flooding of the following tributary areas often occurs. The Maldonado (covering 5,050 hectares in Buenos Aires), Medrano, (covering 2,050 ha in Buenos Aires and 4,600 in total); White-Vega (covering 1,777 ha); and Cildáñez are important basins covering Buneos Aires.|$|E

We construct a stylized theoretical gravity model of migration that includes hazards as random shocks. To estimate this model, we deploy exogenous data on geological and meteorological hazards from 1980 to 2010. We combine this data with the World Bank's Global Bilateral Migration Database. Overall, our results suggest little evidence that <b>natural</b> <b>hazards</b> affect medium to long-run international migration.
