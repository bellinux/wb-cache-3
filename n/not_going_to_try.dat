500|$|The episode {{marked the}} return of Special Agent Monica Reyes, who was first {{introduced}} in the earlier season eight episode [...] "This is Not Happening". Although Reyes would later become Doggett's partner, the series attempted to differentiate the Doggett/Reyes relationship from the Mulder/Scully relationship. Robert Patrick later noted, [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to duplicate , we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to regenerate the magic chemistry." [...] However, he later did say [...] "that Gillian and I had our own chemistry that was unique unto itself, and likewise {{with the addition of}} Annabeth. It was different." ...|$|E
500|$|Boyle {{acknowledged}} that the extravagance of the 2008 opening ceremony was an impossible act to follow — [...] "you can't get bigger than Beijing" [...] — and that this realisation had in fact liberated his team creatively. He said [...] "..obviously I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and build on Beijing, because how could you? We can't, and you wouldn't want to, so we're {{going back to the}} beginning. We're going to try and give the impression that we're rethinking and restarting, because they've (opening ceremonies) escalated since Los Angeles in 1984. They've tried to top themselves each time and you can't do that after Beijing." [...] Beijing's budget had been £65m, whereas London's final budget was £27m, which was twice the original provision. The London stadium had the same number of seats as Beijing's, but was half the size; this intimacy of scale meant that Boyle felt he could achieve something personal and connecting.|$|E
500|$|The band's label, Island Records, {{underwent}} changes {{while the}} group prepared to record, which postponed the studio schedule for three weeks. Bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz asserted that [...] "We're definitely writing all the time, so we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to squeeze every last {{drop out of}} the stone. That's part of what's been wrong with the rock industry: they keep fans waiting far too long, and bands go away and disappear {{off the face of the}} planet. That's not the way it's going to be for Fall Out Boy." [...] During this time off, Fall Out Boy contributed a cover of the song [...] "What's This?" [...] for the 2006 rerelease of The Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack, as well as a remix of their song [...] "Of All the Gin Joints in All the World" [...] for the Snakes on a Plane soundtrack. Wentz also purchased a house in Los Angeles, where he spent much time writing lyrics to new songs.|$|E

5000|$|KDKA Radio named Mike Pintek {{as the new}} host of the 12-3PM weekday {{time slot}} on Thursday, January 28, 2010. After the announcement, Honsberger's {{longtime}} friend and coworker {{had this to say}} about being named the new host for the time slot, [...] "A lot of people have asked me, 'Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> replace Fred? Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fill his shoes?' I'm filling the slot. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> even <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fill his shoes. Nobody can." ...|$|R
2500|$|Despite his {{financial}} problems and bankruptcy in 1987, Gwynn remained unfazed on the field. In the Padres home opener, Marvell Wynne, Gwynn, and John Kruk hit back-to-back-to-back homers {{to start the}} game for San Diego, the first time an MLB team had led off a game with three consecutive home runs. In June, he had 44 hits in 93 at-bats for a [...]473 average, the best month in his career. He finished fifth among NL outfielders voting for the All-Star game, which Padres manager Larry Bowa called [...] "a joke". However, Gwynn was unperturbed: [...] "People put a premium on the home-run hitters. I know what I am. I’m a contact hitter and not a home-run hitter ... I’m <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to be something I’m not." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recording}} session {{occurred in}} April 2005 {{in the garage}} of Stevens' Nashville, Tennessee home, which {{was used as a}} temporary studio. [...] "It was so hot in that garage the first session", guitarist Chris Rohman recalled in an interview. [...] "We go in there and we don't have the songs, we don't know what we're doing, we're stressed, he's stressed, and it's like 90 degrees [...] in the studio. Nobody wanted to be there." [...] Stevens began playing over the chords to [...] "I'm Not Alright", initially titled as [...] "I'll Be Fine", and at that point the band decided to rework the song's lyrical theme. [...] "We're not going to lie. We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to sit here and try to sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good. I'm not alright", Matt Hammit said. The previous material they had written was lyrically [...] "shifted to the stuff we were going through at [...] point". [...] "I'm Not Alright", which became the album's lead single, was rewritten and represented the themes of brokenness and confession on The Face of Love. Mark Graalman noted: [...] "It's been an unbelievably hard year for the band. But we've learned to rely on God’s grace, and we've learned to be honest and transparent. [...] Being honest and transparent means not faking it; it has to be OK to say, 'No, I'm not alright'." ...|$|E

As an extra, Ginger will also perform an HRH showcase of his new band, Hey ! Hello ! over and above the later Ginger Wildheart slot.|$|R
2500|$|Will Warren's Den, {{a boulder}} cave {{located on the}} west side of Rattlesnake Mountain, is an {{historic}} landmark of the town of Farmington.

He was pursued into the mountains, where some Indian squaws hid him in this cave." [...] The personage of Will Warren has never been vindicated historically, and may have been an amalgamation of several individuals. The cave is accessible from the Metacomet Trail.|$|R

50|$|Lloyd {{accompanied}} Macmillan to Bermuda (21-4 March), where Anglo-American {{relations were}} repaired, although private discussions were more frank than the press releases might have suggested. Over dinner Lloyd launched a strong attack on Nasser; Dulles replied that the USA would not defend Nasser’s regime but were <b>not</b> actively <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> overthrow him. Whilst in Bermuda Macmillan, after consultation with Lloyd, agreed to release Archbishop Makarios, {{who had been}} exiled to the Seychelles in March 1956, after being advised that this might calm EOKA down. This prompted the resignation of Lord Salisbury from the Cabinet.|$|R

5000|$|In a TLC {{interview}} done in {{the late}} 1990s, Kelley jokingly said {{one of his biggest}} fears was that the words etched on his gravestone would be [...] "He's dead, Jim." [...] Reflecting this, Kelley's obituary in Newsweek magazine began: [...] "We're <b>not</b> even <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> resist: He's dead, Jim." [...] On the other hand, he stated that he was very proud to hear from so many Star Trek fans who had been inspired to become doctors {{as a result of his}} portrayal of Dr. McCoy.

5000|$|Although {{not many}} critics {{reviewed}} the album {{because of its}} limited edition nature, those that did review the album published positive reviews. Iain Hazlewood of Spiral Earth rated the album four stars out of five and said the album is [...] "a refreshing back to basics affair" [...] and concluded that [...] "Covers 2 {{is the sound of}} one of the finest duos in English roots music having a blast, it's impossible not to be swept along with them". The magazine also said that the album is [...] "one of those under the radar gems that comes along every so often," [...] and as being [...] "chuffin' marvellous". Pete Fyfe of UK Folk Music told readers: [...] "If this is your first dip into the world of acoustic music (I'm <b>not</b> even <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> using the word 'folk' anymore) then you've come to the right place".

5000|$|The {{screenplay}} of {{the pilot}} by Howard Overman is not a direct adaptation of the novel, but uses certain characters and situations from the novel to {{form the basis of}} a new drama centred around Dirk. Speaking about his interpretation, Howard Overman stated in an interview with Benji Wilson [...] "I'm <b>not</b> even <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> adapt the book: you can't adapt this story. Especially not on a BBC Four budget. We made the deliberate decision not to do a straight translation of the books. If we'd done that the fans would have felt badly let down, because you can never portray that world on the screen as well as it's been done in people's own imaginations...If you just do a straight adaptation like The Hitchhiker's Guide film, people are always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be quite brutal about it because it's never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> live up to their expectations."Stephen Mangan, writing a BBC blog on the programme stated [...] "In my opinion, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency and The Long Dark Tea-Time Of The Soul are unfilmable as written...too much happens, there are too many ideas".|$|R
5000|$|Heritage Action {{launched}} a campaign in August 2013 to link the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, {{also known as the}} ACA or [...] "Obamacare," [...] with laws to keep the federal government open or to increase the federal debt limit. The organization played an instrumental role in the government shutdown of October 2013. While the shutdown was ongoing Heritage Action continued to urge lawmakers not to negotiate a measure to fully fund the government without dismantling the ACA. The strategy of Heritage Action in tying the ACA to the shutdown, according to Needham, was to make President Obama [...] "feel pain" [...] because of the shutdown. Senator Orrin Hatch criticized Heritage for warning legislators not to vote for the Senate budget compromise during the government shutdown of 2013: [...] There's a real question on the minds of many Republicans now—I am not just speaking for myself, for a lot of people: Is Heritage <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go so political that it really doesn't amount to anything anymore? I hope <b>not.</b> I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help it survive and do well. Right now I think it's in danger of losing its clout and its power around Washington, D.C.|$|R

No songs by the band to date concern love because Radke stated that, [...] "...I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lie ... and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but {{there will be a lot}} of songs about just what I've been through."
