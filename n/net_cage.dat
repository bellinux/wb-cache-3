In a 3 Ã— 2 factorial experiment, three stocking densities (1, 3 and 5 ind m âˆ’ 2), two types of rearing units (<b>net</b> <b>cages</b> or earthen pond) were used. Megalopae were grown to juvenile stage for 30 days in <b>net</b> <b>cages</b> set inside a 4000 m 2 brackishwater pond and fed brown mussel (Modiolus metcalfei). Crab juveniles were then transferred to either <b>net</b> <b>cages</b> (mesh size of 1. 0 mm) or earthen ponds at three stocking densities. After 1 month, no interaction between stocking density and rearing unit was detected so data were pooled for each stocking density and rearing unit. There {{were no significant differences in}} the growth or survival rate of crab juveniles across stocking density treatments. Regardless of stocking density, survival in <b>net</b> <b>cages</b> was higher (77. 11 Â± 6. 62 %) than in ponds (40. 41 Â± 3. 59 %).

40|$|As {{the numbers}} of fish farms are increasing, the {{problems}} with lice are becoming of greater importance. The lice cause diseases and death, leading to loss in profit for the fish farms as well as reduction of the wild stock. To deal with this problem, many solutions have been introduced. For example, placing the fish farms on land or make the fish farms as floating concrete structures. However, these suggestions are costly. Another idea is to put a watertight skirt, a Permaskirt, around {{the upper part of}} the <b>net</b> <b>cage.</b> However, the introduction of such a skirt would increase the loads and responses on the structure. This thesis shows how to calculate these forces and displacements, and how they are increased when a watertight skirt is placed around the <b>net</b> <b>cage,</b> by using the finite element analysis software AquaSim by Aquastructures. The program is used to calculate the drag and net displacements when current forces influence the structure. Results are compared to results from model experiments and calculations done by the program FhSim. The introduction of such a skirt will also influence the pressure and flow distribution around the <b>net</b> <b>cage.</b> An investigation regarding the flow distribution, to see if the flow travels under the skirt, will therefore be of importance to evaluate the effect of Permaskirt. In order to investigate these effects, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations has been performed, using the Ansys software. The analysis shows that the AquaSim program overestimates the forces and displacements, compared with experimental values. Possible solutions to obtain correct calculations in AquaSim, by using varying solidity for the skirt, has been presented and shows good results compared with experimental values.

Two sampling stations {{were placed in}} the affected lateral arm and other two in a cageless lateral arm. Neither abiotic variables nor phytoplankton biovolume presented significant differences between the treatments. Only temporal changes were confirmed by the analysis performed. Both lateral arms were classified as oligotrophic, reflecting low influence of the <b>net</b> <b>cages.</b> Phytoplankton growth seems to be limited by nitrogen. Biovolume values were, in general, low and five major functional groups were recognized (E, F, G, K and P).

In winter phytoplankton was mainly composed by Bacillariophyceae taxa from P group. G group was also restricted to winter and E group occurred in winter and summer. The variations recorded in phytoplankton structure appear to have been mainly influenced by seasonal changes in temperature, precipitation and nutrients availability.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this PhD project {{was to develop a}} method for {{non-linear}} strength analysis of net structures applied in the aquaculture and fishing industries, e. g. net cages and trawls. The work focused on the aquaculture <b>net</b> <b>cage,</b> which was applied in experiments and analyses, and included research to establish knowledge within material properties and failure modes of traditional netting materials for aquaculture. It was chosen to focus on tensile properties and to study elastic and plastic behaviour, fracture, creep behaviour and cod bite damage. The project consisted of three main activities: tensile testing of netting materials, studies and testing of cod bite damage and resistance, and structural analysis of aquaculture net cages. Net cages are built as a system of ropes and netting. They are designed to transfer and carry all major forces through the ropes. Loads from current, waves, weights and handling induce forces in the <b>net</b> <b>cage,</b> which must be dimensioned to withstand this. Analyzing an aquaculture <b>net</b> <b>cage</b> is both complex and time consuming due to non-linear effects, detailed geometry and dynamic loads. The behaviour of the <b>net</b> <b>cage</b> is dominated by very large deformations and displacements, and materials with non-linear properties. There is a need for verified analysis methods and specific guidance on how to reduce the complexity of a <b>net</b> <b>cage</b> analysis. In order to perform a strength analysis of a <b>net</b> <b>cage,</b> it is crucial to know the material properties of the netting material. Traditionally, the material property of major interest for the aquaculture industry has been the tensile breaking strength of netting (mesh) and ropes, and comparatively little focus has been on their detailed stiffness properties and general behaviour prior to fracture. A new test method was established to determine the uniaxial tensile properties of knotless netting materials. It was applied on a variety of netting materials and stress-strain relations were developed. Data on temporary creep properties, recovery of strain post creep and post creep tensile properties of a selection of Raschel knitted netting materials was presented. Post creep tensile testing showed that the length and force at break were not significantly affected by the creep load history. Cod farmers have reported that cod interact with the cage netting through biting and thereby create wear and tear. The nature of the cod bite attack on traditional, multifilament netting materials was described based on studies of cod interaction with traditional knotless netting and resulting fracture damage on netting fibres. Field experiments were performed, subjecting panels of netting to cod bite in commercial cod cages. In addition, a test method was developed to simulate damage on traditional netting from cod bite, and a prototype bite-jig was designed and assembled. It was concluded that netting materials for cod aquaculture must be resistant to cod bite or be repellent or uninteresting for cod. A method for numerical analysis of net cages in constant uniform current was developed and verified for limited solidity, deformations and current velocities. Various new designs for aquaculture net cages were presented and compared to a traditional <b>net</b> <b>cage</b> with regard to stresses in the netting material and deformation of the <b>net</b> <b>cage.</b> PhD i konstruksjonsteknikkPhD in Structural Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the influence of a <b>net</b> <b>cage</b> tilapia culture on the environment, water quality parameters were investigated during the period between December, 2005 and November, 2007. Three sampling stations were established in the reservoir of Nova Avanhandava (Zacarias, São Paulo State) as follows: upstream of <b>net</b> <b>cage</b> area (P 1), in the rearing place (P 2) and downstream of <b>net</b> <b>cage</b> area (P 3). The mean values of the parameters examined in the water sampling stations were within the standards of water quality recommended by resolution no. 357 / 2005 of the Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente for class 2 freshwater bodies. A significantly higher mean concentration of total phosphorus (p - 1) {{was the result of the}} uneaten feed and feces of fish. The average concentration of total phosphorus in P 3 was lower (0. 015 mg L - 1), which was assimilated by the aquatic ecosystem. The frequent monitoring of the water parameters is fundamental, so the producer can adjust the management according to environmental conditions, by reducing fish density or changing feeding rates for example, to mitigate or avoid water quality deterioration.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Author abstract]Trials of rearing young {{bluefin tuna}} and bonito in a wire <b>netting</b> <b>cage</b> were made. The {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} at Oshima near Kushimoto, Wakayama Prefecture. The fish experimented with were captured {{by a kind of}} trap net set near the coasts of Oshima and Tsuyashima Islands. Forty-two young fish of bluefin tuna captured on August 26 to October 5, 1972, were soon transferred to a round wire <b>netting</b> <b>cage</b> provisionally set near the west coast of Oshima Island. The cage is 8 m in diameter and about 6 m in depth. The fish were fed with such fishes as anchovy, mackerel, sand eel and saury pike. The fish captured on August 28 to September 2 were 33. 4 - 41. 0 cm in total length and weighed 500 - 890 g, but grew to about 60 cm and 3500 g on January 31 next year. The survival rate of these fish was 35. 7 percent on January 31, 1973, five months after they were fished. Thirty-three young fish of bonito captured on August 31 to October 1, 1972, were soon transferred to the same wire <b>netting</b> <b>cage</b> together with bluefin tuna and were fed with the same baits as for bluefin tuna. The fish captured on September 29 to October 2 were about 40 cm in total length and weighed 675 g, but were found to be about 50 cm and 1, 500 g on January 31 next year. The survival rate of these fish was 54. 5 percent on January 1, 1973, four months after they were fished. The growth and survival rates of young bluefin tuna and bonito were higher in the wire <b>netting</b> <b>cage</b> than in the fiber <b>netting</b> <b>cage.</b> [著者抄録] 1. 直径 8 m、深さ約 6 mの金網いけすを和歌山県串本町大島の沿岸に設置し、クロマグロおよびハガツオの幼魚を収容して 1972 年 8 月から 1973 年 1 月まで飼育実験を行なった。 2. クロマグロは収容時の 8 月下旬～ 9 月下旬全長 33. 4 ～ 41. 0 cm、体重 500 ～ 890 gであったが、翌年 1 月末には全長 60 cm内外、体重 3, 500 g内外に成長した。 3. ハガツオは収容時の 9 月下旬～ 10 月上旬全長 40 cm内外、体重 675 g内外であったが、翌年 1 月末には全長 50 cm内外、体重 1, 500 g内外に成長した。 4. 収容尾数に対する 1 月末の生残率は、クロマグロ 35. 7 %ハガツオ 54. 5 %と推定されるが、ほとんどの死亡はいけすに馴致されるまでの 1 週間に生じ、その後はクロマグロで 3 尾死亡、ハガツオでは全く死亡が認められなかった。 5. 金網いけすには生物の付着が少なく、網交換の要なく、また流れに対して網の形が崩れないので、クロマグロやハガツオのように摩擦によって外傷を受けやすい魚類の飼育に適していると考えられる...|$|R
40|$|One {{generation}} of mass selection {{based on the}} collimation procedure (early culling of large fry) was applied on Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus L., in <b>net</b> <b>cages</b> set in Laguna de Bay, Philippines. The objective was to test {{the effectiveness of a}} low-cost, small-scale broodstock improvement procedure in this culture environment. Directional selection was performed in two steps after initial removal of large fry at 21 days. Selection of parents and testing of the offspring were also conducted in hapa <b>net</b> <b>cages</b> set up in Laguna de Bay. The selection resulted in a significant positive response of 3 % relative to the control, which represents a projected 34 % gain over 5 years in Laguna cage culture.
