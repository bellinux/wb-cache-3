40|$|Deciding which {{areas to}} protect, {{and where to}} manage and how, are <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> <b>tasks.</b> Many {{protected}} areas were established opportunistically under strong political and economic constraints, which may have resulted in inefficient and ineffective conservation. Systematic conservation planning has helped us move from ad-hoc decisions to a quantitative and transparent decision-making process, identifying conservation priorities that achieve explicit objectives in a cost-efficient manner. Here we use Finnish butterflies to illustrate different modeling approaches to address three different types of situations in conservation planning at three different spatial scales. First, we employ species distribution models at the national scale to construct a conservation priority map for 91 species at the resolution of 10 × 10 km. Species distribution models interpolate sparse occurrence data to infer variation in habitat suitability and to predict species responses to habitat loss, management actions and climate change. Second, at the regional scale we select the optimal management plan to protect a set of habitat specialist species. And third, at the landscape scale, we use a metapopulation approach to manage a network of habitat patches for long-term persistence of a single butterfly species. These different modeling approaches illustrate trade-offs between complexity and tractability and between generality and precision. General correlation-based models are helpful to set priorities for multiple species at large spatial scales. More specific management questions at smaller scales require further data and more complex models. The vast numbers of insect species with diverse ecologies provide {{a source of information}} that has remained little used in systematic conservation plannin...|$|R

Ryan was incensed at quasi-Fascist Blueshirt leader Eoin O'Duffy organising an Irish Brigade to fight with the Fascists, and in open letters to the papers criticised Cardinal McRory for raising funds at church collections to support Franco. The Congress started publicising the Spanish Republican cause in public meetings. This was <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task,</b> given the strength of pro-Franco feeling at the time, which was whipped up by sections of the Catholic Church and the Irish Independent.

25|$|The {{border patrol}} mission started with DH-4s and Curtiss JN-4 Jennies, with both {{eventually}} replaced with updated Dayton-Wright DH-4Bs. Most {{of the first}} planes were not properly equipped for field service. Not knowing what turn events on the border might take, the Army wanted the planes ready for any eventuality. Colonel James E. Fechet, Air Service Officer at the Southern Department, found it <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task</b> to obtain bomb racks, machine gun mounts, cameras, and other equipment. There was a delay, for example, in installing synchronized Martin guns because parts supplied with the guns did not fit the planes on the border. The radios on some planes could send only in code and could not do that very well. Compasses were unreliable, maps sketchy and of little use. The country over which the men had to fly was wild and rough and sparsely populated, with few places for safe emergency landings.|$|E
25|$|But {{his enemies}} were not merely those whose errors he had exposed and whose hostility he had {{excited by the}} {{violence}} of his language. The results of his method of historical criticism threatened the Catholic controversialists and the authenticity {{of many of the}} documents on which they relied. The Jesuits, who aspired to be the source of all scholarship and criticism, saw the writings and authority of Scaliger as a formidable barrier to their claims. Muret {{in the latter part of}} his life professed the strictest orthodoxy, Lipsius had been reconciled to the Church of Rome, Isaac Casaubon was supposed to be wavering, but Scaliger was known to be an irreconcilable Protestant. As long as his intellectual supremacy was unquestioned, the Protestants had the advantage in learning and scholarship. His enemies therefore aimed, if not to answer his criticisms or to disprove his statements, yet to attack him as a man and to destroy his reputation.

25|$|The King {{knew that}} he had to take Paris if he stood any chance of ruling all of France. This, however, was <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task.</b> The Catholic League's presses and {{supporters}} continued to spread stories about atrocities committed against Catholic priests and the laity in Protestant England (see Forty Martyrs of England and Wales). The city prepared to fight to the death rather than accept a Calvinist king. The Battle of Ivry, fought on March 14, 1590, was another victory for the king, and Henry's forces went on to lay siege to Paris, but the siege was broken by Spanish support. Realising that his predecessor had been right {{and that there was no}} prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in Catholic Paris, Henry reputedly uttered the famous phrase Paris vaut bien une messe (Paris is well worth a mass). He was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1593 and was crowned at Chartres in 1594.|$|E

The ground floor window (which is larger than the others) and the door are offset from the upper windows. Pinch designed very similar terraces elsewhere in Bath, such as Raby Place (Bathwick Hill). Four houses (Nos. 3-6) were built in this style and completed c. 1827 and a further two houses (Nos. 7 and 8) were built slightly later and completed c. 1835. By this time the demand for town houses was dropping and no more houses were built in Nelson Place.|$|E
25|$|It wasn’t {{until the}} Wall Street {{stock market crash}} of 1929 that the roaring 20’s era of glitz and glamour came to an end, and with it, the flapper dress.

A sudden serious tone washed over the public {{with the appearance of}} The Great Depression. Transitioning into the thirties was <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> <b>task.</b> Campaigns such as the “Make do and Mend” slogan were becoming prevalent to ensure there was no overconsumption throughout society. Fabric choices were among the many items to be cut back on during this poverty-stricken time. Artificial fabrics were used instead of elegant fabrics, like silk, which were so popular in the early 1900s. No longer were party dresses adorned with decorative embellishments or made brightly colored. Instead, women headed to work to take over men’s roles while they were at war. The physically demanding jobs called for the creation and social acceptance of women’s pants in society. Although the era of the flapper had vanished almost overnight, its symbol for women’s liberation would live on. No longer would a woman have to be a homemaker. The freedom to choose her role in society was created. Even though many opposed the radical era, one can see how the flapper dress helped bridge a gap between genders in society, ultimately leading in the direction of women’s rights.|$|E

Although organised along American lines, its units had French titles. The non-white units were transferred out. The remainder of 2e DFL became the Regiment de Marche du Tchad (RMT), 2e DB's motorised infantry regiment.

40|$|Thesis (D. Litt. et Phil. (Biblical Studies)) The Fertile Crescent, {{due to its}} {{geographical}} characteristics, {{has always}} been an area troubled with conflict and warfare. The men who participated in these wars, from ca 2000 BCE to 1000 BCE operated from an ethos which was governed by a system of rules, all which were conceived to be the creation of divine will, to which kings and their warriors (keymen) were subject. The cuneiform texts from Mari, Ugarit, Ebla, Amarna and others, have not only thrown light on the political, social, religious and military aspects of those turbulent times, but have also given insight into the formation of armies as well as the commanders who led those armies and the royal officials who governed cities and provinces, all appointed by the monarch in order to effect the smooth running of his kingdom. They also shed light on the formation of coalitions and alliances in order to promote peace, arrange marriages to the daughters of other ruling powers and to promote trade relations. These were <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> <b>tasks,</b> considering the diversity of peoples, the birth and fall of kingdoms and empires, and the ever shifting and changes of loyalties of greedy kings and their men, to attain power and conquest for themselves [...] However, these texts also give glimpses of the human side of the king and the close relationships between himself and his men of authority, whilst the women of the court also played their role in some areas of the social field. The responses, of these people towards matters and events, whether they were confrontations, marriage alliances, trade ventures or hunting expeditions, occurred within an ever changing world yet, it was also a world with an ethos of ancient traditions, which did not disappear but instead remained, albeit in adapted or altered form, {{to be a part of}} their contextual reality.
