5000|$|Judge Brian Pope gave a {{positive}} review saying, [...] "Pretty but approachable, smart but funny, cool but sweet, Ringwald represented everything most high-school girls wanted to be: {{the girl next}} door who always got the guy without compromising her values. Small wonder she is still regarded as an icon of '80s teen cinema. It wasn't until Ringwald began dipping her toes into slightly more adult roles that she lost her footing. Take 'For Keeps', for instance. This movie dared to suggest that even a popular honors student is capable of making wrong decisions that result in life-changing consequences. More crucially, Ringwald suggested to her fans that the qualities they found so endearing in her aren't always adequate substitutes for <b>natural</b> <b>maturity.</b> Perhaps that was a bitter pill for her fans to swallow, but it's not such a bad message, and, more than 15 years after its release, 'For Keeps' isn't such a bad movie." ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{pineapple}} sector of Benin, poor fruit quality prevents pineapple producers {{to enter the}} European market. We investigated effects of common cultural practices, flowering and maturity synchronisation, (1) to quantify the trade-offs of flowering and maturity synchronisation for pineapple quality {{and the proportion of}} fruits exportable to European markets, and (2) to determine the effect of harvesting practice on quality attributes. Four on-farm experiments were conducted during three years using cultivars Sugarloaf and Smooth Cayenne. A split-split plot design was used in each experiment, with flowering induction practice as main factor (artificial or natural flowering induction), maturity induction practice as split factor (artificial or <b>natural</b> <b>maturity</b> induction) and harvesting practice as the split-split factor (farmers' harvest practice or individual fruit harvesting at optimum maturity). Artificial flowering induction gave fruits with lower infructescence weight, higher ratio crown: infructescence length, and a lower proportion of fruits exportable to European markets than natural flowering induction. The costs of the improvements by natural flowering induction were huge: the longer durations from planting to flowering induction and harvesting, the higher number of harvestings of the fruits increasing the labour cost and the lower proportion of plants producing fruits compared with crops from artificially flowering-induced plants. Artificial maturity induction decreased the total soluble solids concentration in the fruits compared with <b>natural</b> <b>maturity</b> induction thus decreasing the proportion of fruits exportable to European markets, at a benefit of only a slightly shorter time from flowering induction to harvesting. Harvesting individual fruits at optimum maturity gave fruits with higher total soluble solids in naturally maturity induced fruits compared with the farmers' harvest practice. Given the huge costs of natural flowering induction, options to use artificial flowering induction effectively for obtaining high fruit quality are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Proactive coastal wetland {{restoration}} addresses historical {{losses and}} is not for compensatory regulation. Such restoration requires a net benefits economic framework. This dissertation, in three manuscripts, addresses three aspects necessary to implement this net benefits framework. ^ The first manuscript used a dynamic analytical model to show that restoration should start {{at a high level}} and decline {{to take advantage of the}} <b>natural</b> <b>maturity</b> in wetland attributes. The model identifies needed information which is not currently available, including information on the maturity relationships between wetland attributes and wetland functions, the public 2 ̆ 7 s marginal values for wetland functions and the marginal costs of alternative restoration actions. ^ The second manuscript used a ratings survey of 73 wetland professionals to estimate the relative change in wetland habitat functions due to restoration for 10 wetland species groups (including birds, fish and shellfish). The models showed a strong agreement among respondents on the importance of size and share of marsh that is covered by Spartina spp. for all species groups, with higher levels of these attributes resulting in an increased probability that the wetland would be rated as having a moderate to high habitat potential. An example shows how the results can be used to estimate the change in habitat potential due to restoration; the results can be used to estimate the economic benefits due to restoration. ^ The third manuscript examined the cost-effectiveness of three eelgrass restoration techniques (mechanical seeding, broadcast seeding and TERFS transplants). A Monte Carlo simulation illustrated that ecological uncertainty regarding shoot establishment and survival had a major impact on costs. The transplant method had the lowest estimated cost per surviving shoot, followed by mechanical seeding and broadcast seeding. The study showed that while labor costs must be addressed for the mechanical seeding method, addressing low and highly variable establishment and survival rates may have a larger impact on seeding costs. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{prompted}} by the expectation that water supplies for the Las Vegas Valley, both those used currently and those additional quantities available from existing sources, cannot sustain significant further economic growth of the region beyond the year 2006. There are five parts to this study. Part I uses a regional econometric (REMI) model to project {{the growth of the}} Las Vegas region to <b>natural</b> <b>maturity,</b> essentially unconstrained by an overriding water shortage. Part II is a reinforcing cross-section analysis of metropolitan areas in the United States to learn the most common natural growth patterns and those that have produced a good quality of life with a minimum of major local disturbances. This analysis gives attention to employment, population, income, and other key economic and social indicators. We give special attention to events in cities that are nearer to or at levels of maturity still many years away for Las Vegas. Part III of this study looks at the performance of sectors of the Las Vegas economy between 1970 and 1989. In particular, we identify those sectors of the Las Vegas economy that are sensitive to variations in growth, particularly during the 1979 to 1983 recession period. Part IV examines the impact of an unrelieved water shortage after 2006 on the Las Vegas socioeconomic future, giving special attention to the fraction of employment that depends on historically high growth rates to predict the impact of rapid decline of that employment. In Part IV, we employ the depth and power of the REMI model to portray the consequences for Las Vegas of a sharp drop in growth after 2006. In this part, we simulate a sixty percent reduction in construction employment, based on the experience of other cities investigated in Part II. We trace this disruption of growth through reduced employment, population, output, and income. We measure the effect of the water shortage by comparing the values of economic variables with a water shortage with a control forecast produced under the assumption of adequate water supplies. Part IV also includes a partial analysis of a Las Vegas water shortage on rural Nevada and on the state of Nevada as a whole. Part V investigates the impact on rural areas of construction and operation of a system bringing water from outlying areas to the Las Vegas region. We are aware that final planning for such a system is not yet completed. We have used a reasonable set of expenditures, locations, and periods that can be expected to occur. These simulations provide a plausible estimate of the effects of both the construction and operation of a water-delivery system on employment and income in those rural areas. As more definite information emerges, appropriate changes can readily be made and new analysis of impacts can be quickly provided...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With {{the growing}} {{interest}} in clean energy, and the <b>natural</b> gas market <b>maturity</b> in China, {{there is a strong}} need to introduce as soon as possible a regulation system covering the mid- and downstream natural gas business to ensure a harmonized approach to gas industry development. Adopting a consistent regulation system for the mid- and downstream natural gas industry that establishes the fundamental rights, obligations and regulatory principles would provide a clear legal expression of the government’s policy and strategy for gas industry development and the ground rules for the operation of the gas industry. Such a regulation system would, therefore, help create a more stable investment and operating environment, reduce uncertainty and investment risk, and consequently lower the cost of capital...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} the source and migration direction of natural gas by geochemical characteristics of butane, the components and carbon isotopes of natural gas from major hydrocarbonbearing basins in China were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) Oil-type gas has i-C 4 /n-C 4 < 0.8, δ 13 Cbutane <− 28 ‰, δ 13 Ci-butane <− 27 ‰, δ 13 Cn-butane <− 28.5 ‰, whereas coal-type gas has i-C 4 /n-C 4 > 0.8, δ 13 Cbutane >− 25.5 ‰, δ 13 Ci-butane >− 24 ‰, δ 13 Cn-butane >− 26 ‰. (2) When δ 13 Ci-butane-δ 13 Cn-butane is greater than 0, the maturity of oil-type gas is generally more than 2.4 % and that of coal-type gas is greater than 1.4 %, whereas when the difference is less than 0, the maturity of oil-type gas is generally less than 1.1 % and that of coal-type gas is less than 0.8 %. (3) When natural gas migrates through dense cap rocks, the value of i-C 4 /n-C 4 increases, whereas when it migrates laterally along a reservoir, the value of i-C 4 /n-C 4 decreases. (4) Sapropelic transition zone gas with composition and carbon isotopic signatures {{similar to those of}} oil-type gas in the low thermal evolution stage is found to have a relatively high butane content. (5) The values of i-C 4 /n-C 4 and δ 13 Cn-butaneδ 13 Ci-butane of gas which has suffered biological degradation are significantly higher than those obtained from thermogenic and bio-thermocatalytic transition zone gas. Thus, natural gas of different genetic types can be recognized through component analysis and carbon isotopic signatures of butane, the <b>natural</b> gas <b>maturity</b> can be estimated from the difference in carbon isotopic content between isobutane and n-butane, and the migration direction of natural gas can be determined from i-C 4 /n-C 4 ratios and transport conditions, which {{can also be used to}} thermogenic and bio-thermocatalytic transition zone gas.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTest {{plots of}} sorghum were planted and cut at <b>maturity.</b> <b>Natural</b> drying {{of the cut}} {{material}} was monitored in the field. Laboratory drying tests were conducted to determine the drying kinetics of the stalks under four different configurations at 50 °C and 0. 5 m/s air velocity. These included: 20 cm long sections with sealed ends to duplicate stalks of infinite length and remove “end effects”; 20 cm long sections with open ends to account for “end effects”; and 20 cm sections with longitudinal splitting to remove {{the effects of the}} outer layer of the stalks. In addition, short sections (5 cm) were dried to determine the impact of enhanced “end effects” on drying. Mathematical models were derived from replicate laboratory trials and were used to predict the times required to reach a final moisture content of 10 % (wet basis). These times ranged from over 200 hours with the sealed ends to 15 hours with splitting of the stalks to expose the interior fully to the drying medium. Field drying of cut sorghum was found to be insufficient to adequately dry these materials for storage or use in energy production, especially under wet-weather conditions. Laboratory tests showed the need for substantial disruption of the stalk surface to promote drying. This can be achieved through mechanical maceration of the stalks. Simply cutting the stalks at ground level and relying upon open-air drying did not reduce the moisture content to acceptable levels for animal feed or energy production...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} link {{missing from}} {{our understanding of}} the nursery role of specific marine habitats is the evidence of connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats. This paper reviews and evaluates evidence of, and spatial scales for, movements from juvenile to adult habitats and it summarises the methods used to study movements. Examples include many fish families but few invertebrate taxa, and most are species of economic importance for USA and Australia. The types of juvenile habitat range from the entire estuary or shallow open coastal waters to specific habitats within estuaries or coastal waters; in some cases juvenile habitats include habitats not traditionally regarded as nursery areas (e. g. the surf zone). The duration of time spent in juvenile habitats averages 13 mo (range 8 d to 5 yr). The majority of organisms move distances of kilometres to hundreds of kilometres from juvenile to adult habitats, although the scale of movements ranged from metres to thousands of kilometres. Changes in abundance among separate habitats and the progression of size classes among separate habitats are the main methods used to infer movement and habitat connectivity. Spatial partitioning of stages of <b>maturity,</b> <b>natural</b> parasites, and a variety of artificial tagging methods have also been used. The latter will become more useful with continued developments in the miniaturisation of artificial tags. More recent studies have used natural tags (e. g. trace elements and stable isotopes) and these methods show great promise for determining movements from juvenile to adult habitats. Few studies provide good evidence for movement from specific juvenile habitats to adult habitats. Future studies need to focus on this movement to supplement data on density, growth and survival of organisms in putative nursery habitats. Such information will allow management and conservation efforts to focus on those habitats that make the greatest contribution to adult populations. Bronwyn M. Gillanders, Kenneth W.

40|$|This {{circular}} {{has been}} prepared with three major objectives in mind. [...] 1) to define {{areas in which}} tree fruit culture is possible in Alaska and [...] the types of fruit that can be grown in each, 2) to name and describe [...] the varieties that {{at the present time}} seem more desirable for planting [...] in Alaska, and 3) to point out the m?-in problems limiting tree fruit culture [...] and suggest, rather than discuss, the probable means by which they may [...] one day be solved. [...] Fulfilling the first two of these objectives was a relatively simple [...] matter, since {{it was only a matter}} of defining and description. But the [...] third objective was not-and is not-so easy of attainment. In what may [...] be an oversimplification, it has been stated that there are two main problems, [...] winter hardiness and earliness of maturity, and methods have been [...] indicated by which, it is believed, each may be overcome. [...] However the very problems themselves are not as simple as they [...] have been made to appear. That of winter hardiness is one of the most [...] widely debated and investigated subject in plant science.

40|$|This was {{the first}} interim year for the multi-annual Terms of References (ToRs) for the Working Group on Biological Parameters (WGBIOP). ToR a was the {{consolidation}} of the WGBIOP itself, ToRs b, c and e were dealing {{with the development of}} a quality assured assessment of new and existing biological parameters for both single-and in-tegrated stock assessment. ToRs d, f and g were the generic ToRs for the group han-dling the reviewing of calibration exercises on biological parameters, their outcomes and recommendations for such actions, including a continuous development of tools for facilitating such calibrations. WGBIOP addressed ToR a) both as a general plan for the group but also by agreeing on specific plans for each ToR. In terms of the remits of the WGBIOP, it was concluded that the group will not only focus on existing biological parameters but also on accu-racy in derived life-history parameters estimation which may support stock assess-ment; both single-stock and integrated ecosystem assessments. Given this rather ambitious remit, the group decided to focus the first 3 -year period on defining new (for assessments) and existing biological parameters (ToR b), their quality in terms of sam-pling and estimation (ToR c) and how these may be integrated in the general bench-mark process in ICES (ToR e). Concerning the generic ToRs (d, f and g) it was decided to follow the outlined procedure in the ToRs (i. e. continue the work on quality assur-ance of biological parameters through workshops and calibrations as previously done in PGCCDBS), and in addition have a developmental side to them. WGBIOP decided to expand the workshop/exchange review to include under the WGBIOP remits also the work performed on ichthyology, fish egg production and ichthyoplankton related issues. Discussions related to ToR b led to a specification of the broad groups of new and ex-isting biological parameters that are emerging as critical components of state-of-the-art assessment. A descriptive database was initiated including details of the necessary data providing information on the particular parameter, the types of species/ecosystems for which they are most useful, the type of stock/ecosystem models that they are typically used in, and examples of where they have been used before. The discussions on this ToR led to a draft of a “roadmap” that can guide end-users on the data collection, po-tential usefulness, and typical approaches employed when incorporating this new bi-ological information into assessment. WGBIOP addressed ToRs c and e in combination and ended up merging these into one single ToR: “Evaluation of quality of biological parameters: issues, quality indicators and guidelines”. The discussions under this new ToR were very fruitful and led to a thorough review of the issues regarding biological parameters. Issues put forward by the assessment WGs for benchmark stocks were evaluated (‘top–down’ approach) and, as an example, the WGNSSK 2015 report was screened for issues (‘bottom–up’ ap-proach). This evaluation focused on existing biological parameters already included in assessments (e. g. age, <b>maturity,</b> <b>natural</b> mortality). New biological parameters from this review were discussed under ToR b. The development of Quality Indicators was initiated for existing biological parameters...|$|R
