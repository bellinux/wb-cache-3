5|$|Dopamine {{itself is}} used as {{precursor}} in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters <b>norepinephrine</b> and epinephrine. Dopamine is converted into <b>norepinephrine</b> by the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase, with O2 and L-ascorbic acid as cofactors. <b>Norepinephrine</b> is converted into epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the cofactor.|$|E
5|$|Some of the cofactors {{also require}} their own synthesis. Deficiency in any {{required}} amino acid or cofactor can impair {{the synthesis of}} dopamine, <b>norepinephrine,</b> and epinephrine.|$|E
5|$|Tyrosine (and its {{precursor}} phenylalanine) are precursors of the catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine and <b>norepinephrine</b> {{and various}} trace amines.|$|E
5|$|In {{clinical}} research on schizophrenia, measurements of homovanillic acid in plasma {{have been used}} to estimate levels of dopamine activity in the brain. A difficulty in this approach however, is separating the high level of plasma homovanillic acid contributed by the metabolism of <b>norepinephrine.</b>|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, alpha-latrotoxin {{produces}} {{its effect}} through destabilisation of cell membranes and degranulation of nerve terminals, resulting in excessive release of neurotransmitters, namely acetylcholine, <b>norepinephrine</b> and GABA. Excess neurotransmitter activity leads to clinical manifestations of envenomation, although the precise mechanisms {{are not well}} understood. Acetylcholine release accounts for neuromuscular manifestations, and <b>norepinephrine</b> release accounts for the cardiovascular manifestations. Female redbacks have an average of around 0.08–0.10mg of venom, and experiments indicate that the median lethal dose (LD50) for mice at room temperature is 10–20% of this quantity (0.27–0.91mg/kg based on {{the mass of the}} mice used), but that it is considerably more deadly for mice kept at lower or higher temperatures. Pure alpha-latrotoxin has an LD50 in mice of 20–40µg/kg.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is at the}} centre of each adrenal gland, and is {{surrounded}} by the adrenal cortex. The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla. Approximately 20% noradrenaline (<b>norepinephrine)</b> and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or <b>norepinephrine.</b> Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and <b>norepinephrine.</b> In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter <b>norepinephrine</b> (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. <b>Norepinephrine</b> binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and <b>norepinephrine</b> (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective <b>norepinephrine</b> reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{and fitness}} levels, age, body temperature, basal {{metabolic}} rate, {{and even a}} person's emotional state can all affect the heart rate. High levels of the hormones epinephrine, <b>norepinephrine,</b> and thyroid hormones can increase the heart rate. The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of the heart rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and dehydration may increase it.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent dendritic spine growth. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as <b>norepinephrine</b> may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|The human {{dopamine}} transporter {{contains a}} high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in vitro. binding site with three coordinating residues on its extracellular face (His193, His375, and Glu396).... Thus, when Zn2+ is co-released with glutamate, it may greatly augment the efflux of dopamine.}} The human serotonin transporter and <b>norepinephrine</b> transporter {{do not contain}} zinc binding sites.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from <b>norepinephrine</b> acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of <b>norepinephrine</b> (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin <b>norepinephrine</b> reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
5|$|There {{are dozens}} of other {{chemical}} neurotransmitters {{that are used in}} more limited areas of the brain, often areas dedicated to a particular function. Serotonin, for example—the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei. <b>Norepinephrine,</b> which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus. Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.|$|E
5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of <b>norepinephrine</b> or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters <b>norepinephrine</b> and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and <b>norepinephrine,</b> the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E
5|$|The full {{profile of}} amphetamine's {{short-term}} drug effects in humans is mostly derived through increased cellular communication or neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, <b>norepinephrine,</b> epinephrine, histamine, CART peptides, endogenous opioids,C]carfentanil binding in several {{regions of the}} human brain, including the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and thalamus (Colasanti et al. 2012). Oral administration of d-amphetamine, 0.5mg/kg, 3h before carfentanil injection, reduced BPND values by 2–10%. The results were confirmed in another group of subjects (Mick et al. 2014). However, Guterstam and colleagues observed no change in carfentanil binding when d-amphetamine, 0.3mg/kg, was administered intravenously directly before injection of carfentanil (Guterstam et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that this discrepancy {{may be related to}} delayed increases in extracellular opioid peptide concentrations following amphetamine-evoked monoamine release (Colasanti et al. 2012; Mick et al. 2014).}} adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosteroids, and glutamate, which it effects through interactions with , , , , , , and possibly other biological targets.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, <b>norepinephrine,</b> or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Norepinephrine</b> reuptake {{inhibitor}}s (NRIs or NERIs) are {{a type of}} {{drug that}} acts as a reuptake inhibitor for the neurotransmitter <b>norepinephrine</b> (noradrenaline) by blocking the action of the <b>norepinephrine</b> transporter (NET). This in turn leads to increased extracellular concentrations of <b>norepinephrine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brown and {{co-workers}} {{examined the effects}} of the individual enantiomers of synephrine on α1 receptors in rat aorta, and on α2 receptors in rabbit saphenous vein. In the aorta preparation, l-synephrine gave a pD2 = 5.38 (potency relative to <b>norepinephrine</b> = 1/1000), while d-synephrine had a pD2 = 3.50 (potency relative to <b>norepinephrine</b> = 1/50000); in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD2 = 7.50 (potency relative to <b>norepinephrine</b> ≃ 1/6). No antagonism of <b>norepinephrine</b> was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10−6 M. In the rabbit saphenous assay, the pD2 of l-synephrine was 4.36 (potency relative to <b>norepinephrine</b> ≃ 1/1700), and that of d-synephrine was < 3.00; in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD2 = 5.45 (potency relative to <b>norepinephrine</b> ≃ 1/140). No antagonism of <b>norepinephrine</b> was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10−5 M.|$|E
25|$|Sympathetic {{stimulation}} {{results in}} the release of <b>norepinephrine.</b> <b>Norepinephrine</b> binding to α-adrenergic receptors will cause an increase in intracellular calcium levels leading to more fluid vs. protein secretion. If <b>norepinephrine</b> binds β-adrenergic receptors, it will result in more protein or enzyme secretion vs. fluid secretion. Stimulation by <b>norepinephrine</b> initially decreases {{blood flow to the}} salivary glands due to constriction of blood vessels but this effect is overtaken by vasodilation caused by various local vasodilators.|$|E
25|$|Low {{levels of}} <b>norepinephrine</b> cause an {{increase}} in reward dependence. When produced in normal levels, <b>norepinephrine</b> creates a sense of well-being, but low levels of <b>norepinephrine</b> cause symptoms of depression, lack of arousal and lack of motivation. In humans, this leads to then a negative feedback mechanism whereby we seek out pleasurable activities to remove the negative affect caused by the low levels of <b>norepinephrine,</b> therefore increasing our reward dependence.|$|E
25|$|Preferentially (8x over <b>norepinephrine)</b> {{inhibits}} the reuptake of serotonin but <b>norepinephrine</b> reuptake inhibition is clinically significant. Listed {{as a more}} hepatotoxic antidepressant in {{a recent}} review article.|$|E
25|$|The human {{serotonin}} transporter (SERT) and <b>norepinephrine</b> transporter (NET) are membrane {{proteins that}} are responsible for the reuptake of serotonin and <b>norepinephrine.</b> Balanced dual inhibition of monoamine reuptake can possibly offer advantages over other antidepressants drugs by treating a wider range of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} <b>norepinephrine</b> levels in gamblers found high {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) {{levels of the}} <b>norepinephrine</b> (NE) metabolite 3-methoq-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MI-IPG). This could suggest {{a relationship between the}} noradrenergic system and gambling, and gambling could be seen as a reward-dependent behavior, but according to Cloninger’s theory these gamblers should exhibit low levels of NE, not high. Cloninger suggests that had these gamblers been retested after they had refrained from gambling for a determined period, their CSF MHPG levels might have been low. A study of <b>norepinephrine</b> levels in alcoholics with high reward dependence also showed a significant decrease of MHPG in their CSF. This finding demonstrates a significant relationship between reward dependence and <b>norepinephrine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline acts {{primarily}} as a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), with strong actions on the serotonin transporter (SERT) and moderate effects on the <b>norepinephrine</b> transporter (NET). It has negligible influence on the dopamine transporter (DAT) and therefore does not affect dopamine reuptake, being nearly 1,000times weaker on inhibition of the reuptake of this neurotransmitter than on serotonin. It is metabolized to nortriptyline, a more potent and selective <b>norepinephrine</b> reuptake inhibitor, and this may serve to complement its effects on <b>norepinephrine</b> reuptake.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s, it {{was thought}} that the mode of action of tricyclics was to inhibit <b>norepinephrine</b> reuptake. However, <b>norepinephrine</b> reuptake became {{associated}} with stimulating effects. Later tricyclics were thought to affect serotonin as proposed in 1969 by Carlsson and Lindqvist as well as Lapin and Oxenkrug.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to blockade of adrenergic receptors, propranolol has very weak inhibitory {{effects on the}} <b>norepinephrine</b> transporter and/or weakly stimulates <b>norepinephrine</b> release (i.e., the concentration of <b>norepinephrine</b> is increased in the synapse). Since propranolol blocks β-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic <b>norepinephrine</b> only results in α-adrenoceptor activation, with the α1-adrenoceptor being particularly important for effects observed in animal models. Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect α1-adrenoceptor agonist in {{addition to}} potent β-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition to its effects on the adrenergic system, {{there is evidence that}} indicates that propranolol may act as a weak antagonist of certain serotonin receptors, namely the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2B receptors. The latter may be involved in the effectiveness of propranolol in the treatment of migraine at high doses.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{secretion}} {{of stress}} hormones, glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines (CAs), {{as a result}} of disease, may reduce the effect of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, <b>norepinephrine</b> and dopamine, or other receptors in the brain, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones. Under stimulation, <b>norepinephrine</b> is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express adrenoreceptors. Through stimulation of these receptors, locally released <b>norepinephrine,</b> or circulating catecholamines such as epinephrine, affect lymphocyte traffic, circulation, and proliferation, and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different lymphoid cells.|$|E
