50|$|As heating a thick fluid {{decreases}} its viscosity, {{it reduces}} losses occurring in a pipe. Therefore, the <b>net</b> <b>positive</b> <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> (pressure difference) available can be raised, decreasing {{the likelihood of}} cavitation when pumping.

50|$|In a {{steam power}} plant, {{particularly}} shipboard ones, the condensate pump is normally located {{adjacent to the}} main condenser hotwell often directly below it. This pump sends the water to a make-up tank closer to the steam generator or boiler. If the tank is also designed to remove dissolved oxygen from the condensate, it {{is known as a}} deaereating feed tank (DFT). The output of the DFT supplies the feed booster pump which, in turn, supplies the feedwater pump which returns the feedwater to the boiler so the cycle can start over. Two pumps in succession are used to provide sufficient <b>net</b> <b>positive</b> <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> to prevent cavitation and the subsequent damage associated with it.|$|E

50|$|Beside high {{mechanical}} energy, higher cleaning {{temperatures are}} one of the most effective methods of improving the cleaning results in a parts washer. In general, a 10 to 15 °F (5 to 8 °C) rise doubles the chemical reaction of the detergent. The increased chemical reaction between the greases and oils and the detergent delivers faster cleaning cycles and cleaner parts. Additionally, all greases and oils exhibit a lower viscosity at higher temperatures. Cleaning solution temperatures of 170 F and above softens or melts most oils and greases causing them to flow like water so they are easily removed resulting in faster cleaning, better results and cleaner parts. Many parts washers are not capable of maintaining this operating temperature due to the lack of amply heating systems. Additionally, careful design is required of the pumping system so it can pull in and deliver cleaning solution at temperatures that approach boiling in the parts washer. All centrifugal pumps require a <b>net</b> <b>positive</b> <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> (NPSHr) in order to be able to pump solution. As the temperature of the solution approaches the NPSHr, the pump stops pumping because the cleaning solution flashes to steam in the pump intake. Careful design of the pump is required to minimize NPSHr and allow pumping of high temperature cleaning solution.|$|E
50|$|A {{circulating}} pump - {{a device that}} causes the flow of liquid (e.g. water or aqueous solutions, mostly glycol) in circuits (primary or secondary) of heating or cooling installations. The {{circulating pump}}s are used only as centrifugal pumps. The basic elements of the centrifugal pump are coiled housing with two ports, suction and discharge, and what is more, blade rotor mounted on a shaft driven be an electric motor. The ports of the circulating pump can be arranged in one axis (in-line circulating pump, typically suitable to be built directly in the pipeline) or suction axis that can be perpendicular to the axis of discharge port (the so-called circulating radial pump). The mechanical energy delivered to the circulating pump via motor is transmitted through the rotor to the liquid flow causing the increase in pressure (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy). The energy increase of the liquid occurs only in the circulating pump rotor, {{which is the only}} element of the energy transmission. However, in the remaining parts, one type of energy changes into another e.g. kinetic energy into pressure energy. For instance, in the coiled shaped housing, part of kinetic energy changes into potential energy, which causes a further increase in the fluid pressure.Pressure generated by the pump is used to overcome resistance of the liquid flow through the heating or cooling circuit. During the pump operation, there is a drop of the liquid flow {{in the center of the}} rotor, causing the inflow of the liquid through the suction port. In the event of an excessive pressure decrease, in some parts of the rotor, the pressure can be lower than the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the pumped liquid, causing the so-called cavitation, i.e. liquid evaporation. To prevent this, the pressure in the suction port (at the inlet of the pump) should be higher than the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid temperature by the <b>net</b> <b>positive</b> <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> (NPSH).|$|E
40|$|The {{cavitation}} {{performance of}} an {{axial flow pump}} with inlet guide vanes for different flow rates is studied in this article. The effects of inlet guide vanes on pump hydraulic performance and cavitation are investigated, where the total vapor fraction of impeller zone (Ftv) is calculated to predict the critical <b>net</b> <b>positive</b> <b>suction</b> <b>head,</b> which is compared with that predicted by efficiency criterion for different flow rates. The influences {{of the development of}} cavitation on internal flow in impeller zone are also investigated. The results obtained show that the cavitation performance of axial flow pump can be improved at off-design flow conditions by adjusting angles of inlet guide vanes to positive values at low flow rates and by regulating angles of inlet guide vanes to negative values at high flow rates. As the <b>net</b> <b>positive</b> <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> decreases, the vapor fraction first increases slowly and then increases greatly, clearly presenting cavitation process from inception to full development, which can be used to predict the required <b>net</b> <b>positive</b> <b>suction</b> <b>head.</b> When <b>net</b> <b>positive</b> <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> decreases to the value around required <b>net</b> <b>positive</b> <b>suction</b> <b>head,</b> the cavitation zone from tip of blade suction side close to leading edge and the cavitation zone from hub part of the blade suction side connect together.

40|$|Even {{before the}} first flight of the Space Shuttle, it was {{understood}} low liquid hydrogen (LH 2) <b>Net</b> <b>Positive</b> <b>Suction</b> Pressure (NPSP) at the inlet to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) can have adverse effects on engine operation.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 5 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 1 - 4 July, 2007. This paper presents a theoretical model for the prediction of the incipient of cavitation in centrifugal pumps. The model includes the physical fluid parameters and the real working phenomena at off-design condition. The parameters considered in the model were flow rate ratio, pump rational speed, water temperature, thermodynamic properties of water, nuclei and gas content, relative velocity and incidence angle. The thermodynamic effect had a more complex expression compared with other parameters. The present model has been tested against extensive earlier published experimental results in centrifugal pumps at wide operating conditions. The comparison of the predicted <b>net</b> <b>positive</b> <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> at inception with the published data showed a good agreement was achieved.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1970 s, {{years before the}} Space Shuttle flew its maiden voyage, it was {{understood}} low liquid hydrogen (LH 2) <b>Net</b> <b>Positive</b> <b>Suction</b> Pressure (NPSP) at the inlet to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) could have adverse effects on engine operation. A number of failures within both the External Tank (ET) and the Orbiter Main Propulsion System (MPS) {{could result in a}} low LH 2 NPSP condition, which at extremely low levels can result in cavitation of SSME turbomachinery. Operational workarounds were developed {{to take advantage of the}} onboard crew s ability to manually throttle down the SSMEs (via the Pilot s Speedbrake/Throttle Controller), which alleviated the low LH 2 NPSP condition. Manually throttling the SSME to a lower power level resulted in an increase in NPSP, mainly due to the reduction in frictional flow losses while at the lower throttle setting. Early in the Space Shuttle Program s history, the relevant Flight Rule for the Booster flight controller in Mission Control did not distinguish between ET and Orbiter MPS failures and the same crew action was taken for both. However, after a review of all Booster operational techniques following the Challenger disaster in the late 1980 s, it was determined manually throttling the SSME to a lower power was only effective for Orbiter MPS failures and the Flight Rule was updated to reflect this change. The Flight Rule and associated crew actions initially called for a single throttle step to minimum power level when a low threshold for NPSP was met. As engineers refined their understanding of the NPSP requirements for the SSME (through a robust testing program), the operational techniques evolved to take advantage of the additional capabilities. This paper will examine the evolution of the Flight rule and associated procedure and how increases in knowledge about the SSME and the Space Shuttle vehicle as a whole have helped shape their development. What once was a single throttle step when NPSP decreased to a certain low threshold has now become three throttle steps, each occurring at a lower NPSP threshold. Additionally the procedure, which for early Space Shuttle missions required a Return-to-Launch-Site abort, now results in a nominal Main Engine Cut Off and no loss of mission objectives...|$|R
