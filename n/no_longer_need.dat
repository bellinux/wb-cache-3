5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E

She warns Brax {{that he is in}} danger and that night he is poisoned by Adam in the hospital, causing him to go into a coma. Charlie appears to Brax again and he explains that he is tired of fighting. He wishes to remain with her, saying that his brothers <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> him. Charlie tries to encourage Brax to go back and asks him about Ricky Sharpe (Bonnie Sveen). She realises that Brax loves Ricky and tells him to let go, so he can return to her.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} new plan, all housing {{must include}} between 25% and 30% {{affordable}} units to qualify for the program, with several ways for builders to meet that requirement. Previously, that affordability requirement was 20%.

25|$|For {{a typical}} {{inpatient}} hospital triage system, a triage nurse or physician will either field requests for admission from the ER physician on patients needing admission or from physicians {{taking care of}} patients from other floors who can be transferred because they <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> that level of care (i.e. intensive care unit patient is stable for the medical floor).

25|$|In this {{regulatory}} scheme, every current polluting {{facility is}} given or may purchase {{on an open}} market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.|$|E

This carries the multiplying new generations of V. cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.|$|E
25|$|A primary {{appeal of}} telepharmacy is its {{potential}} to expand access to pharmacy care in smaller rural communities, some of which cannot support a full-time pharmacist or cannot easily recruit a pharmacist to reside in their region. Telepharmacy can potentially give patients in remote locations access to professional pharmacy care {{that could not be}} received locally, which can lower costs and improve patient safety through better patient counseling, drug administration monitoring, and compliance monitoring. Sharing of pharmacists between sites can also decrease costs in existing facilities, which might <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> to employ a full-time pharmacist.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the actual}} process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes, {{apoptotic}} signals must cause regulatory proteins {{to initiate the}} apoptosis pathway. This step allows those signals to cause cell death, or the process to be stopped, should the cell <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> to die. Several proteins are involved, but two main methods of regulation have been identified: the targeting of mitochondria functionality, or directly transducing the signal via adaptor proteins to the apoptotic mechanisms. An extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies {{is an increase in}} calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity, which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease calpain.|$|E
