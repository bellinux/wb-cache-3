5|$|Subramaniam {{is a rich}} {{businessman}} managing his own construction company. He {{lives with}} his wife Shanthi and sons Sanjay and Santosh. Subramaniam cares for his family a lot and excessively dotes upon his children. Santosh, the younger son, does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> as he wants to be independent and free from his father’s guidance and control. But Santosh acts normally to avoid hurting his father. Santosh has in mind that both his career and wife should be of his choice only and not of his father. Subramaniam wants Santosh to assist him in managing the company but Santosh dreams of starting a new company on his own and does not prefer to work in his father’s company. Meanwhile, Subramaniam arranges Santosh’s wedding with Rajeshwari, daughter of his friend Ramamoorthy. Santosh is shocked as he has no other option rather than agreeing for this wedding.|$|E
25|$|As in {{the years}} before, the Belgian cyclists had {{dominated}} the entire race. The French press and audience did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and wanted the brothers Pélissier, who did not join because of a fight with the Tour organisers, to enter the race again. They would ultimately do this in 1923, when Henri won the race as the first French cyclist in eleven years.|$|E
25|$|The {{advocates of}} this anti-systematic {{interpretation}} {{do not see}} a contradiction between Plato's criticism of writing {{and the notion that}} he communicated his entire philosophy to the public in writing. They believe his criticism was aimed only at the kind of writing that expresses dogmas and doctrines. Since the dialogues are <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> but instead present their material in the guise of fictional conversations, Plato's criticism does not apply.|$|E

25|$|Just as Æthelred {{was being}} crowned, the Danish King Gormsson {{was trying to}} force Christianity onto his domain. Many of his {{subjects}} did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> idea, and shortly before 988, Swein, his son, drove his father from the kingdom. The rebels, dispossessed at home, probably formed the first waves of raids on the English coast. The rebels did so well in their raiding that the Danish kings decided {{to take over the}} campaign themselves.|$|E
25|$|Rachel's beloved mother, Ada Hobson, died in Summer 1993 (veteran actress Constance Ford {{had died}} earlier that year). Rachel needed support more than ever, {{and she found}} it in the unlikeliest source, Mac's former enemy, {{reformed}} villain Carl Hutchins. The two fell in love and became engaged. Iris did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> news one bit, and at Rachel and Carl's wedding, she planned to startle Carl by firing blanks at him. Evan (now played by Eric Scott Woods) placed real bullets into Iris's gun, causing Iris to gravely wound Carl. She was convicted of the crime and sent to prison.|$|E
25|$|The {{drinking}} straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth, usually {{a drink from}} one location to another. The first crude forms of {{drinking straw}}s were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. Marvin Stone is {{the inventor of the}} drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.|$|E

25|$|Soon a {{coach at}} the school, Gennadiy Korshunov, noticed her. She had drawn a balance beam {{in the sand and}} was practising moves on it like a real gymnast. He invited her into the school. He asked his wife, Ina, also a {{gymnastics}} {{coach at the}} school, to train Davydova in her group. Yuri Shtukman, the administrator at the school, did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> initiative by his new training staff and reprimanded the Korshunovs; however he allowed Davydova to stay in the school. It soon became apparent that she was a talented gymnast and Gennadiy took over her coaching himself. By 1972 Davydova was the best in her age group at the school.|$|E
25|$|The {{efforts of}} the Düsseldorf city council made progress. On March 6, 1888, the Düsseldorf City Council decided to build a Heine {{monument}} at a tie of eleven to eleven votes, including the vote of the Mayor Heinrich Ernst Lindemann, {{who was also a}} member of the Memorial Committee. The City Council was thus as divided as the German public, since the announcement of the monument plans sparked fierce debate. At the time of the vote, Herter already had a first plan for the monument, in that it was to contain a canopy. Since the Empress did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> design, in May 1888 two further proposals came about: one depicting Heine sitting on a pedestal, the other with the current Lorelei fountain. The designs were submitted on June 30, 1888. While Elisabeth preferred the Heine-figure, Düsseldorf preferred the Lorelei Fountain.|$|E
500|$|In February 1989, Turner Entertainment {{president}} Roger Mayer {{announced that}} work to colorize the film had been stopped due to provisions in Welles's 1939 contract with RKO that [...] "could be read to prohibit colorization without {{permission of the}} Welles estate." [...] Mayer added that Welles's contract was [...] "quite unusual" [...] and [...] "other contracts we have checked out are <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> at all." [...] Turner had only colorized the final reel of the film before abandoning the project. In 1991 one minute of the colorized test footage {{was included in the}} BBC Arena documentary The Complete Citizen Kane.|$|E

Following the Sick of It All Tour, Korn joined the Danzig 4 Tour, including Danzig and Marilyn Manson. The tour lasted 3 months and was preceded {{with the group}} touring with Megadeth, where they played to crowds of thirty-five-hundred to five thousand. They toured with Megadeth, Fear Factory, and Flotsam and Jetsam. All of this happened {{in the summer of}} 1995. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis introduced the bagpipes [...] while performing live (however many people there did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this).</b>|$|E
500|$|As filming continued, Disney and Max Allan Collins {{conflicted}} {{over the}} novelization. The studio rejected his manuscript: [...] "I wound up doing an eleventh hour rewrite {{that was more}} faithful to the screenplay, even while I made it much more consistent with the strip," [...] Collins continued, [...] "and fixed as many plot holes as I could." [...] Disney did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> version either, but accepted based on Beatty's insistence to incorporate some of Collins' writing into the shooting script, which solved the plot hole concerns. Through post-production dubbing, some of Collins' dialogue was also incorporated into the film. Principal photography for Dick Tracy ended in May 1989.|$|E
500|$|By 1980, [...] "Captain Jack" [...] had mostly {{disappeared}} from Joel's concert setlists. Nevertheless, he always played it in Philadelphia, {{because he never}} forgot the role the song and the city played in his early career. A version recorded at The Spectrum in July 1980 was used on his live album, Songs in the Attic. Joel wrote, [...] "'Captain Jack' plays with much more power and conviction when a roaring Philadelphia audience sets off a kind of internal explosion and the adrenaline screams through our veins ... When we play 'Captain Jack', we are actually committing an act of pure brutality." [...] Timothy White of Rolling Stone did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> version, calling it [...] "grating".|$|E

500|$|Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who had {{previously}} co-written and starred in The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from [...] "David and Maureen", episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. [...] "David and Maureen" [...] took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a [...] "reaction" [...] to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying that [...] "we'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, {{we thought it would}} be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> story, but you've got a different one next week." [...] As an anthology series with horror themes, Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents.|$|E
500|$|Greno and Howard wanted Flynn to {{be funny}} and sarcastic as opposed to snarky. One {{occasion}} in particular involved an animator having Flynn respond to Rapunzel's excitement by simply walking away from her in silence. The directors did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> because, according to Greno, Flynn [...] "did this reaction where [...] treated her like she's nuts". Although both directors agreed that Flynn's reaction was funny, Greno and Howard wanted the characters to [...] "connect" [...] emotionally during this scene. Screenwriter Dan Fogelman said that Flynn is [...] "at his best ... when he's playing little mind games with other people and entertaining himself along with them", likening him to English actor Cary Grant. Fogelman concluded, [...] "At his heart, he's really kind of a lost soul who doesn't quite know what he wants and who he is." [...] Howard cited fictional characters Ferris Bueller and Indiana Jones as influences because these characters, like Flynn, [...] "are skilled but have a human side to them". Flynn is considered an antihero because [...] "He is quick-witted and agile, stealing to survive" [...] and [...] "he is also extremely narcissistic".|$|E
500|$|In 1837, {{shortly after}} Scott County was formed Davenport, and rival {{neighbor}} Rockingham both campaigned {{to become the}} county seat. As stated by the Iowa Territory, the city with the most votes at the February 1838 election, would become the county seat. On {{the eve of the}} election, Davenporters secured the temporary service of Dubuque laborers so that they could vote in the election. Davenport won the election. Rockingham supporters however, did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> They protested the elections to the territorial Governor. The Governor of the territory refused to certify the results of the election. A second election was scheduled for the following August. To avoid another import of voters, the Governor set a sixty-day residency requirement. Both cities proved to be corrupt as the second election drew near. Davenport, was again the victor, by only two votes. A third election was set by the Territorial Legislature for the summer of 1840. As the August election drew nearer, Rockinghamers grew tired of the county seat cause. Antoine LeClaire's $3,000 contribution, and the efforts of other Davenporters were difficult to challenge. Davenport easily won the third election. [...] To ensure the question of county seat would not arise again, Davenport built the first county courthouse.|$|E

500|$|Takumi {{found the}} game's first defendant, Larry Butz, to be {{particularly}} difficult to write, and had to re-write him several times. Originally, Larry {{was going to be}} an [...] "average Joe" [...] type of character, who only appeared in the game's fourth episode, but after his inclusion in the first episode, Suekane and Iwamoto told Takumi to give the character [...] "some oomph". Following this, Takumi wrote him as a [...] "prickly tough-guy" [...] who had the habit of telling people he was going to kill them. Some of the higher-ups at Capcom did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> so Takumi changed him into a character who laments his lot in life, saying [...] "I'm going to die!" [...] or that the situation is killing him. The culprit of the third episode was originally going to be male, until Suekane pointed out that all villains in the game were male. The development team debated over what to do with the now female character; some staff members thought it would be odd to have a female character be the director of an action show, and some wondered what to do with the director role if she could not fill it. In the end, Takumi changed the scriptwriter character into a director, and made the culprit a [...] "strong, glamorous, fashionable, and cool-headed" [...] producer.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Independent, Neela Debnath said that [...] "critics of the {{constant}} tampering with time will <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> episode" [...] but [...] "it is a cracker {{in terms of time}} paradoxes and the hypothetical moral dilemmas caused by said paradoxes". She praised the character development of Rory and the dynamic between the trio that had not been seen with previous characters in the show, as well as [...] "some great moments of comedy". She also called it a [...] "sumptuous visual delight" [...] in the sets of the garden and the centre. IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 8.5 out of 10, praising MacRae for straying away from a complicated time travel narrative and instead give [...] "a simple yet refreshingly new examination of Amy Pond". He also praised Karen Gillan's climactic performance and director Nick Hurran. However, he criticised the [...] "iffy time travel rules" [...] and [...] "talkiness" [...] that ensured a slower pace. SFX magazine reviewer Nick Setchfield awarded [...] "The Girl Who Waited" [...] five out of five stars, praising Hurran as well as the performance of the three leads. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised MacRae's dialogue because [...] "it works so beautifully and is delivered to perfection by Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill". He also commented on Gillan's make-up job for the older Amy, which [...] "is brilliant in its subtlety" [...] but wished her hair could have been [...] "chopped or grey".|$|E
500|$|Sora {{was planned}} as an {{artificial}} intelligence from the start, but because Uchikoshi thought robots seemed cliche, and holograms {{could not move}} around to different places, {{he came up with}} the idea of her being an image shot onto people's eyes with a laser; thinking that if a layman like himself could come up with the idea of such technology, an expert in the field could have been working on developing it already, so he researched it and found out about retinal scanning display technology, and made use of it in the game's story. The full names of both the original You and her clone were taken from a name dictionary, and were initially challenged by KID's marketing team, who thought they sounded [...] "lame"; they relented after Nakazawa explained that the names had a meaning and could not be changed. Because Uchikoshi liked the film Interview with the Vampire, he conceived Tsugumi as being a vampire; the staff did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> idea, so it was scrapped, but the concept of her being immortal was kept, which led to the introduction of the Curé Virus in the story, as Uchikoshi considered the spreading of vampirism similar to a virus. Another remnant of the vampire concept was kept in Sara, who has infrared vision and can see in the dark. Sara was noted by Uchikoshi as being the otherwise single [...] "normal" [...] person in the cast, offsetting the balance; because of this, she was made into the Kid's twin sister.|$|E
