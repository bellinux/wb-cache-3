It constructs a formal model of Wittgenstein’s notion of grammar as expressed in his writings of that period, justifies the appropriateness of that model and then employs it to test Wittgenstein's claim that mathematical propositions are ultimately grammatical. Chapter 1 frames the dissertation’s topic in its historical and conceptual context. Chapter 2 traces the origins of Wittgenstein’s grammatical approach to mathematics in Frege’s philosophy of arithmetics. Chapter 3 explains {{the central role of}} calculation in Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mathematics. Chapter 4 presents Wittgenstein’s account of mathematical application [Anwendung]. Chapter 5 provides a formalized theory of grammatical analysis, and Chapter 6 applies it to a portion of language containing <b>numerical</b> <b>expressions.</b> It proves that if the object language contains the appropriate <b>numerical</b> <b>expressions,</b> the resulting grammar includes at least some rules which may be naturally interpreted as mathematical. In particular, it shows that Wittgenstein’s grammatical analysis of the ordinary use of <b>numerical</b> <b>expressions</b> yields familiar theorems of arithmetic.

Results suggest that the properties of ANEs we identified are key factors in their interpretation while symmetry is not always maintained.
