5|$|A September poll {{conducted}} by Clemson University found that 36% {{of the public}} {{had never heard of}} Joe Biden and only 44% had a favorable opinion of him. However, this was the highest awareness rating in the Democratic field outside of the frontrunners (Clinton, Obama, and Edwards) and non-declared but highly discussed Al Gore. A September 18 poll found that 56% of respondents had <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> enough about Biden to form an opinion about him.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the {{proclamation}} of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to Bábís in Iran and Iraq who had <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> of his statements, as well as asking the Bahá'ís to be united and detached from the world. He also started to write about distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E

5|$|Michel Roux {{was born}} in Charolles, Saône-et-Loire, in a room above his grandfather's charcuterie (a {{delicatessen}} specializing in meat products). He moved to Paris with his family after the war, where his father Michel set up his own charcuterie, after not taking over the family business in Charolles. His father gambled away all of the family's money, and the shop was closed {{to prevent it from}} going bankrupt. By the time Michel turned ten, his father had left the family and was <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> from again.|$|E
5|$|The first {{published}} score was the four-hand piano arrangement (Edition Russe de Musique, RV196), dated 1913. Publication {{of the full}} orchestral score was prevented by the outbreak of war in August 1914. After {{the revival of the}} work in 1920 Stravinsky, who had <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> the music for seven years, made numerous revisions to the score, which was finally published in 1921 (Edition Russe de Musique, RV 197/197b. large and pocket scores).|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1943 season, Wensloff enlisted in the United States Army and served in World War II. When the Yankees were preparing {{for the start of the}} 1944 season, the team originally had no idea where Wensloff was, as they had <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> from him. He was inactive for the 1944 season. In 1945, Wensloff was traded from the Yankees to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League for Johnny Kreevich, allowing him to simultaneously pitch professionally and continue serving in the war. In 10 games for the Padres, he won three and lost four with a 3.82 ERA. After the 1945 season and the war ended, Wensloff remained in military service, and as a result did not play in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Delius began a {{fruitful}} association with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred Hertz at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted Over the Hills and Far Away, which he gave under its German title Über die Berge in die Ferne on 13 November 1897, {{believed to be}} the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in St. James's Hall in London, which included Over the Hills and Far Away, a choral piece, Mitternachtslied, and excerpts from the opera Koanga. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> again in an English concert hall until 1907.|$|E

Before portraying Tim—a minor insignificant character—in multiple episodes, Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck, who works at the lab that mutates viruses. Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple, to whom Diane shows her botched artwork.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{ordered a}} hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, {{the case was}} <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, the case had {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Æthelwold's {{immediate}} family. Æthelred was born in about 848 and died in 871, so his sons must have been young children when he died. Æthelred's wife was probably the Wulfthryth who witnessed a charter in 868. Æthelwold {{and his older brother}} Æthelhelm are first recorded in King Alfred's will in the 880s. Æthelhelm is <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> of again, and he probably died soon afterwards. The only other record of Æthelwold before Alfred's death is as a witness to a charter that probably dates to the 890s.|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN Radio {{expanded}} its coverage by signing programming agreements in 1998 with two subscription-only satellite radio systems: CD Radio (later renamed Sirius Satellite Radio) and General Motors' XM Satellite Radio, bringing {{the station to}} a nationwide audience in 2001. Temporarily for a year during the XM and Sirius merger in 2007 and 2008, it was <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> on Sirius, {{and it is not}} currently available on radios only compatible with the older Sirius system. The station was added to XM Radio Canada on April 1, 2007. The FM range of the radio station extends as far north as Hanover, Pennsylvania, south around 15 miles beyond Fredericksburg, Virginia, west to 5 miles east of Front Royal, Virginia and east to Cambridge, Maryland. C-SPAN offers three channels of programming for listeners within the FM signal radius with HD radios, using digital technology to multicast all three channels at 90.1 FM. The three channels offer different programming: WCSP-FM's usual programming is broadcast on 90.1 HD-1; 90.1 HD-2 simulcasts C-SPAN, broadcasting coverage of the House of Representatives plus other C-SPAN programming; 90.1 HD-3 simulcasts C-SPAN2, broadcasting coverage of the Senate and audio of Book TV.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{negotiations}} in the U.S. embassy, Chen did not request asylum in the United States or considered leaving China, but instead demanded to remain {{there as a}} free man. However, soon after leaving the embassy, Chen feared that Chinese authorities would renege on their promises or take punitive actions against his family members. While in the hospital, Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him. Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving the embassy by threatening his family. U.S. negotiators stated that while in the embassy, Chen {{had been told by}} Chinese officials that if he sought asylum in the United States, his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong. However, they maintained that they had <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> of the threats from local officials that his family would be beaten, and that they had not communicated such a message to Chen. On 3 May, Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of the threats against his family after leaving the embassy, and at that point changed his mind about wishing to stay in China.|$|E
5|$|Government troops killed Jonas Savimbi on 22 February 2002, in Moxico province. UNITA Vice President António Dembo took over, but {{died from}} {{diabetes}} 12days later on 3 March, and Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba became UNITA's leader. After Savimbi's death, the government {{came to a}} crossroads over how to proceed. After initially indicating the counter-insurgency might continue, the government announced it would halt all military operations on 13 March. Military commanders for UNITA and the MPLA met in Cassamba and agreed to a cease-fire. However, Carlos Morgado, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said the UNITA's Portugal wing had been under the impression General Kamorteiro, the UNITA general who agreed to the ceasefire, had been captured {{more than a week}} earlier. Morgado did say that he had <b>not</b> <b>heard</b> from Angola since Savimbi's death. The military commanders signed a Memorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the Lusaka Protocol in Luena on 4 April, with Santos and Lukambo observing.|$|E
