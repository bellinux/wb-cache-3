We use the Theil Measure of Inequality (TMI) to compare and explain changes in 1) the between and within-region distribution of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> and 2) changes {{in the distribution of}} factor shares of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in Canada and in the U.

Results show that in Canada (1960 - 2000), <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> has become somewhat more equally distributed relative to the number of farms per province, but has varied widely from 1972 - 1988. Between-region inequality in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> accounted for from 0. 5 to 85. 5 percent of this inequality from 1960 - 2000. In the U. S. (1949 - 2000), <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> has become more unequally distributed. About half of the variation in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in the U.

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} nationality-adjusted <b>net</b> sales and <b>value</b> <b>added</b> {{framework}} proposed in Baldwin and Kimura (1996) to Japan. Despite possibly large estimation errors due to statistical deficiencies, the framework is very useful for analyzing {{the relationship of}} the Japanese economy to the world economy. We find that Japan is special in the following four aspects. First, Japanese-owned firms have become increasingly dependent on the marketing activities of their foreign affiliates, rather than depending on cross-border exports by parent firms located in Japan. Second, the much smaller activities of Japanese affiliates of foreign firms (JAFF) relative to those of foreign affiliates of Japanese firms (FAJF) are apparent in terms of sales, <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> and employment, at both the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. Third, Japanese net sales to foreigners are consistently larger than cross-border net exports of Japan. Fourth, among the activities of FAJF, the importance of commercial FAJF is particularly large; these commercial FAJF handle a large portion of Japanese exports and imports. The paper concludes by discussing a number of statistical improvements required by the Japanese government in order to apply our analytical framework more rigorously. ...|$|R

Since they have had {{an essential role in}} most cases including financial reporting, contracts and evaluation models, specifying the items and financial variables that have had a significant relationship with these two variables are expected to be of utmost importance. One example of these variables and indicators is the value added. Although this variable has an economic concept, reporting of value added to the beneficiaries of business entity as the value-added statement has been observed in the field of accounting theories for many years.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} a novel panel dataset of UK manufacturing firms {{to examine how}} innovation, proxied by R&D and intellectual property (IP, covering both patents and trade marks), increases firm performance, as measured by firm <b>net</b> output (<b>value</b> <b>added).</b> Knowledge has public good characteristics of non-depletability and non-excludability. So, even with protection using intellectual property to exclude, imitation and inventing around novel products and processes is possible by competitors. We examine the size and duration of benefits to doing R&D and obtaining IP protection through both patents and trade marks. If non-depletability within the firm is correct, this implies that their absolute R&D effort and total IP assets are important. We examine this hypothesis against the alternative of depletability, where innovative intensity relative to firm size matters. Also if IP offers only weak protection against competition, then the duration of returns to these intangible assets will be short. The empirical results support depletability within firms and poor ability to exclude imitation, which implies that firms have to continually renew their portfolios of R&D-created knowledge and their IP assets to maintain {{their position in the}} market. Splitting the sample into industries designated as "high" and "low" technology, suggests a higher intensity of competition in high-technology sectors, as an increase in the intensity of patents and trade marks commands no premium in this sector, although persistent differences between firms are positively affected by whether or not firms are acquiring these IP assets...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} Florida has large {{industries}} producing fruits and vegetables, sugar, livestock, dairy and meat products, seafood, ornamental plants, forest products, phosphate rock, {{and an array}} of associated industries that provide supporting inputs and services, and conduct processing and manufacturing. There are distinct differences in the regional distribution of Florida's agricultural and natural resource industries. Economic characteristics and impacts were evaluated for the state of Florida and for eight separate regions of Florida. Each region is comprised of a core metropolitan area and a number of surrounding counties, as defined by the US Commerce Department, Bureau of Economic Analysis, based on employee commuting patterns and other factors. The Implan input-output analysis and social accounting software and associated databases for Florida counties were used to create economic models for each region and to estimate the total economic impacts of over 100 industry sectors in agriculture, natural resource and associated value-added manufacturing. Statewide economic impacts in the year 2000, expressed in year 2002 dollars, included industry output (sales) of $ 35. 2 billion (Bn), with sales to markets outside the state (export shipments) of $ 19. 4 Bn, personal and business <b>net</b> income (<b>value</b> <b>added)</b> of $ 14. 8 Bn, and employment of 338, 253 persons. The <b>value</b> <b>added</b> represented 3. 1 percent of Florida's gross regional product. When the multiplier effects of export final demand on interindustry purchases and employee household spending are considered, the total economic impacts were estimated at $ 62. 0 Bn in output, $ 31. 0 Bn in <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> and 648, 550 jobs. Regionally, total <b>value</b> <b>added</b> impacts of the agriculture and natural resource industries were greatest in the Orlando area ($ 4. 31 Bn), followed by Miami-Ft. Lauderdale ($ 3. 61 Bn), Tampa-St. Petersburg- Clearwater ($ 2. 20 Bn), Jacksonville ($ 1. 47 Bn), Sarasota-Bradenton ($ 1. 10 Bn), Tallahassee ($ 782 million), Ft. Myers-Cape Coral ($ 701 million), and Pensacola ($ 597 million). The largest industry groups in terms of total <b>value</b> <b>added</b> impacts were fruits and vegetables ($ 2. 9 Bn), environmental horticulture ($ 2. 8 Bn), forest products ($ 2. 0 Bn), agricultural inputs and services ($ 1. 4 Bn), and other food and fiber manufacturing ($ 1. 7 Bn), with lesser impacts for dairy products, field crops, livestock and meat products, mining, seafood products, sugar and confectionary products, and tobacco products. The total <b>value</b> <b>added</b> impact was $ 1, 929 per capita, and the total employment impact was 40 jobs per 1000 residents.
