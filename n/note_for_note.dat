25|$|The French psalms {{were set}} to Gregorian and popular, secular, {{sometimes}} unpublished melodies that were harmonized and altered for congregational singing. Music for the Genevan psalter was furnished by Loys Bourgeois and others like Guillaume Franc and a certain Maistre Pierre. The composer Claude Goudimel harmonized these melodies with great variation in {{the complexity of the}} music. In some cases each part matches <b>note</b> <b>for</b> <b>note,</b> while others are contrapuntal or even motets.

25|$|It is {{commonly}} {{said that the}} tune for Kol Nidre is missinai - unchanged since Moses climbed down from Mount Sinai - In the early 17th century, Rabbi Mordechai Jaffe of Prague, known as the Levush, mentioned that all cantors knew a set melody which was traditional for Kol Nidre. Jaffe was actually complaining that the widespread and solid adherence to this melody was hampering his efforts to introduce corrections into the lyrics. And yet there are probably no two synagogues in which the melody is chanted <b>note</b> <b>for</b> <b>note</b> absolutely the same. So marked is the variation {{in the details of}} the melody that a critical examination of the variants shows an approach toward agreement in the essentials of the first strain only, with transformations of the greatest diversity in the remaining strains. These divergences, however, are not radical, and they are no more than are inherent in a composition not due to a single originator, but built up and elaborated by many in turn, and handed on by them in distinct lines of tradition, along all of which the rhapsodical method of the hazzanut has been followed.|$|E

Corgan said, [...] "The day after I wrote 'Today,' my manager heard it and said, 'It's a hit,' and I guess in a way, it was." [...] Corgan played the self-recorded demo to {{producer}} Butch Vig and {{to the rest of}} his band, all of whom responded positively. [...] "Today" [...] already had a chord progression and a melody, but Corgan felt there needed to be an opening riff to the song. One day, [...] "out of the blue, I heard the opening lick <b>note</b> <b>for</b> <b>note</b> in my head", Corgan said. [...] "When I added the opening riff, it completely changed the character of the song. Suddenly, I had a song that was starting out quiet and then got very loud." [...] Soon afterwards, Virgin Records executives were sent to check up on the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo. The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan; as a result, he recorded most of the guitar and bass guitar parts himself, including on the finished version of [...] "Today".|$|E

500|$|Though FreeStyleGames {{experimented with}} other options {{including}} a controller-less game, camera and motion detection, and social-based games, but recognized quickly that the guitar controller {{was a key}} part of the series' success. The developers recognized they wanted to have a guitar controller that players would not be embarrassed to have in their living rooms and spent time getting the look of the controller accurate to a real guitar. The design of the game's guitar controller was overhauled, using rapid prototyping to test potential guitar designs. The final design of the controller for Live utilizes a new design with six buttons arranged into two rows of three frets, designated by black and white-colored notes in-game, instead of using the traditional row of five colored frets used by previous Guitar Hero games. Jackson explained that the new layout was meant to make the game easier for new players, as the three-button layout avoids the need to use one's pinkie finger, a difficulty they recognized new players had on the traditional five-button controller. The layout was also designed to provide a new challenge to experienced players, including more realistic simulations of chords. The choice to use only three buttons also came from statistical analysis of past games, where about 80% of the players would never play harder than the Medium difficulty level which typically only required the use of three fingers with the previous five-button controllers. The initial controller iterations, presented both in-studio and to Activision, were met with skepticism but they found that players quickly adapted to the new scheme as an improvement over the older controllers. The [...] "note highways" [...] for the songs were created by both programmers and musicians using MIDI software as to map to each of the six controller buttons and the open strum bar. Note highways were developed first for the Expert difficulty level, essentially recreating the guitar part of the song <b>note</b> <b>for</b> <b>note,</b> while highways for lower difficulty levels were then constructed by removing notes while assuring the core rhythm of the song remained.|$|E

[...] "Ted and Michael became one faction against Pat and the rest of us,” Porter said in an interview.

2500|$|The band {{capitalized}} {{on the success}} of their first album with another single, [...] "I Got a Line on You". Released in November 1968, a month before their second album, The Family That Plays Together, it became their biggest hit single, reaching number 25 on the charts (number 28 in Canada). The album matched its success, reaching number 22. In December, they appeared at the Denver Auditorium, with support band Led Zeppelin, who soon after interpolated parts of Spirit's song [...] "Fresh Garbage" [...] in an extended medley based around their cover of Bob Elgin and Jerry Ragavoy's [...] "As Long As I Have You" [...] (initially popularized by Garnet Mimms) during their early 1969 concerts. Spirit also appeared with Led Zeppelin at two outdoor music festivals in July 1969. Jimmy Page's use of a theremin has been attributed to his seeing Randy California use one that he had mounted to his amplifier. Guitar World magazine stated that [...] "California's most enduring legacy may well be the fingerpicked acoustic theme of the song 'Taurus', which Jimmy Page lifted virtually <b>note</b> <b>for</b> <b>note</b> for the introduction to 'Stairway to Heaven'."

2500|$|One young {{admirer of}} the Basie {{orchestra}} in Kansas City was a teenage alto saxophone player named Charlie Parker. He was especially enthralled by their tenor saxophone player Lester Young, who played long flowing melodic lines that wove {{in and out}} of the chordal structure of the tune but somehow always made musical sense. [...] Young was equally daring with his rhythm and phrasing as with his approach to harmonic structures in his solos. [...] He would frequently repeat simple two or three note figures, with shifting rhythmic accents expressed by volume, articulation, or tone. [...] His phrasing was far removed from the two or four bar phrases that horn players had used until then. They would often be extended to an odd number of measures, overlapping the musical stanzas suggested by the harmonic structure. He would take a breath in the middle of a phrase, using the pause, or [...] "free space," [...] as a creative device. The overall effect was that his solos were something floating above the rest of the music, rather than something springing from it at intervals suggested by the ensemble sound. When the Basie orchestra burst onto the national scene with its 1937 recordings and nationally-broadcast New York engagements, it gained a national following, with legions of saxophone players striving to imitate Young, drummers striving to imitate Jo Jones, piano players striving to imitate Basie, and trumpet players striving to imitate Buck Clayton. Parker played along with the new Basie recordings on a Victrola until he could play Young's solos <b>note</b> <b>for</b> <b>note..</b>|$|E
2500|$|Rock Band 3 {{introduces}} [...] "Pro Mode" [...] to the Rock Band franchise {{for both}} guitar and bass players, where players finger specific strings and frets instead of colored buttons in Easy to Medium mode, while on Expert mode players {{are required to}} play the actual guitar chords and solos, <b>note</b> <b>for</b> <b>note.</b> [...] Two completely new guitar controllers were developed for use in this mode - both of them legitimate MIDI guitars. The first one MadCatz created {{was based on the}} bass version of the Fender Mustang, featuring 105 buttons each representing every spot possible on the neck up to 17 frets, and a [...] "string box" [...] where the player strums strings, it was made of plastic and can be a step up from the legacy five lane controllers. [...] The second takes an authentic, actual Squier Stratocaster guitar by Fender, the complete guitar with strings and up to the standard 22 frets, added a [...] "string box" [...] near the strumming area for hit detection, and rebuilt the neck to have a fret-sensing feature in order to tell the game where the player's fingers are on the fret board. [...] There is also a [...] "mute bar" [...] built into the guitar which can be raised or lowered; in the raised position the strings of the guitar are softly muted so as to not ring out. [...] This mute bar is what allows the string box to detect and translate individual string hits for the game. [...] In the lowered position, the guitar strings wont be muted and therefore lets the strings ring out for normal guitar playing outside of the Rock Band game. [...] Tuning this specialized guitar is not necessary for playing Rock Band, as for the game the guitar functions in MIDI mode and the guitar's sound comes from sound files of the actual guitar playing in the songs painstakingly designed from audio master stems of each song for the game. [...] Both of these officially made MIDI guitars utilize Pro Mode, allowing for accurate fingering while playing with the added effect of learning how to play the song for real on guitar, either alone or with friends playing the song with you on any other instrument or controller, even online. [...] Of the two Pro guitars, only the MadCatz Mustang model - with 105 buttons - was capable of playing [...] "legacy" [...] (5-lane) guitar or bass charts.
