At 15:30 and at 16:45 McCay, now under severe pressure, {{requested}} reinforcements. The second time he was informed {{there was only one}} uninvolved battalion left, the 4th, and Bridges was keeping them in reserve until more troops from the New Zealand and Australian Division had been landed. McCay then spoke to Bridges direct and informed him the situation was desperate and if <b>not</b> <b>reinforced</b> the Turks would get behind him. At 17:00 Bridges released the 4th Battalion to McCay who sent them to the south forming on the left of the 8th Battalion along Bolton's Ridge. They arrived just in time to help counter Turkish probing attacks, by the 27th Infantry Regiment, from the south.|$|E

The economic losses {{are believed to}} have been as high as two billion US dollars though the sum was not confirmed by the authorities at that time. A detailed report on the destruction the earthquake caused was never published. Most of the damage was concentrated in Romania's capital, Bucharest, where about 33 large buildings collapsed. Most of those {{buildings were}} built before World War II, and were <b>not</b> <b>reinforced.</b> After the earthquake, the Romanian government imposed tougher construction standards.|$|E

25|$|Differential {{reinforcement}} of low response rate (DRL) described by Ferster and Skinner {{is used to}} encourage low rates of responding. It is derived from research in operant conditioning that provides an excellent opportunity to measure the hyperactive child's ability to inhibit behavioral responding. Hyperactive children were relatively unable to perform efficiently on the task, and this deficit endured regardless of age, IQ, or experimental condition. Therefore, {{it can be used}} to discriminate accurately between teacher rated and parent rated hyperactive and nonhyperactive children. In this procedure, responses that occur before a set time interval has passed are <b>not</b> <b>reinforced</b> and reset the time required between behaviors.|$|E
25|$|In {{many parts}} of {{developing}} countries such as Pakistan, Iran and China, unreinforced {{or in some cases}} reinforced masonry is the predominantly form of structures for rural residential and dwelling. Masonry was also a common construction form {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, which implies that a substantial number of these at-risk masonry structures would have significant heritage value. Masonry walls that are <b>not</b> <b>reinforced</b> are especially hazardous. Such structures may be more appropriate for replacement than retrofit, but if the walls are the principal load bearing elements in structures of modest size they may be appropriately reinforced. It is especially important that floor and ceiling beams be securely attached to the walls. Additional vertical supports in the form of steel or reinforced concrete may be added.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} rails {{were replaced}} in the 1990s, from 60lbs (27.2kg) per yard (0.9m) weight, to 41kg per metre. One in every four sleepers are now steel, with a one in two ratio on curves with a radius under 120m. Some cuttings were also widened in the 1980s and 1990s. Most cuttings are in earth or rock, but some have concrete lining or stone pitching in parts. Some timber bridge components, {{such as the}} piles or headstocks of trestles, {{have been replaced by}} steel, or whole trestles have been replaced by concrete piers. There are a large number of small open concrete drains passing under the line. Early cast concrete pipes and culverts (<b>not</b> <b>reinforced)</b> along the line will be replaced with reinforced concrete pipes if the originals collapse.|$|E

This finding is based on the premise that desipramine is not self-administered, and also the fact that the NRI atomoxetine was <b>not</b> <b>reinforcing.</b> However, it was still shown to facilitate dopaminergic neurotransmission in certain brain regions such as in the core of the PFC.|$|R

25|$|Textbooks on the Nanai language, fairy tales, {{and artistic}} {{literature}} {{are used in}} Nanai language teaching. Sometimes teachers took the initiative to use oral folklore as well. However, {{there is a shortage}} of teaching and auxiliary materials, as well as difficulty in motivating students. Nanai language textbooks follow the model of Russian language textbooks aimed at native speakers, rather than emphasising instruction in the language itself, and in the theoretical/practical grammar. This model is not adequate for the situation of heritage language preservation. Moreover, the existing language teaching materials are oriented predominantly (or only) towards the development of reading habits; however, the number of publications in the Nanaian language does not exceed one-two ten, mostly collections of folklore or artistic works of the historical-biographical genre, publishing in limited print runs. Instruction in spoken language is not conducted sufficiently and is <b>not</b> <b>reinforced</b> by teaching aids.|$|E
25|$|He {{ordered his}} troopers to {{dismount}} and deploy in a skirmish line, according to standard army doctrine. In this formation, every fourth trooper held the horses for the troopers in firing position, with {{five to ten}} yards separating each trooper, officers to their rear and troopers with horses behind the officers. This formation reduced Reno's firepower by 25 percent. As Reno's men fired into the village and killed, by some accounts, several wives and children of the Sioux leader, Chief Gall (in Lakota, Phizí), mounted warriors began streaming out to meet the attack. With Reno's men anchored on their right by the impassable tree line and bend in the river, the Indians rode hard against the exposed left end of Reno's line. After about 20 minutes of long-distance firing, Reno had taken only one casualty, but the odds against him had risen (Reno estimated five to one) and Custer had <b>not</b> <b>reinforced</b> him. Trooper Billy Jackson reported that by then, the Indians had begun massing in the open area shielded by a small hill {{to the left of}} Reno's line and {{to the right of the}} Indian village. From this position the Indians mounted an attack of more than 500 warriors against the left and rear of Reno's line, turning Reno's exposed left flank. They forced a hasty withdrawal into the timber along the bend in the river. Here the Indians pinned Reno and his men down and set fire to the brush to try to drive the soldiers out of their position.|$|E

His subordinate commander, William S. Rosecrans, bitterly complained that his attack was <b>not</b> <b>reinforced</b> as McClellan had agreed.

500|$|Following {{a two-hour}} {{artillery}} barrage meant to soften up the Union defenses, the three divisions stepped off across open fields almost {{a mile from}} Cemetery Ridge. Pickett inspired his men by shouting, [...] "Up, Men, and to your posts! Don't forget today that you are from Old Virginia." [...] Pickett's division, with the brigades of Brigadier Generals Armistead, Garnett, and Kemper, {{was on the right}} flank of the assault. It received punishing artillery fire, and then volleys of massed musket fire as it approached its objective. Armistead's brigade made the farthest progress through the Union lines. Armistead was mortally wounded, falling near [...] "The Angle", at what is now termed the [...] "High Water Mark of the Confederacy". Neither of the other two divisions made comparable progress across the fields; Armistead's success was <b>not</b> <b>reinforced,</b> and his men were quickly killed or captured.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the {{convocation}} sejm of 1648 had {{elected a}} new king, Jan Kazimierz II Vasa.

[...] Wiśniowiecki faction, arguing for increase in army size, was once again marginalized by the faction that hoped for a peaceful resolution. In the end, the King and most of the szlachta were lulled into a false sense of security, and the military was <b>not</b> <b>reinforced</b> significantly. To add an insult to an injury, the coronation sejm of January–February 1649, held in Kraków, revoked Wiśniowieck's regimentarz rank.|$|E
