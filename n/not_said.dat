5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was <b>not</b> <b>said</b> to survive death.|$|E
5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had <b>not</b> <b>said</b> the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a sensitivity of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate infarction (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different MRI sequences {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction). If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland, although it is less reliable. Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans, but apoplexy is <b>not</b> <b>said</b> to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) (a pro-Israel group) {{notes that}} factual errors can be errors of omission, where {{something}} important was <b>not</b> <b>said,</b> resulting in readers being misled, or commission, where information used is not true.|$|E
25|$|Downsizing the {{importance}} of another line: “You do see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?” The line, the first sentence in the novel uttered by Raymond to his sister Carol, is <b>not</b> <b>said</b> in its entirety in the adaptation, and is not given much thought after the fact.|$|E

25|$|On 27 June 2012, Claudia Cruz, Fernando Uceda, and Leobardo Reyes (a {{group of}} {{students}} from Mexico) published a paper showing a system running on reCAPTCHA images with an accuracy of 82%.

25|$|In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic churches, {{the prayer}} {{is very common}} in the Greek form {{indicated}} above, or in translations from it. Although it is <b>not</b> <b>said</b> quite as often as in the West, {{it is well known}} and often used and appears in several canons of prayer. It is typically sung thrice at the end of Vespers during an All-Night Vigil, as well as occurring many times in the course of daily prayer.|$|E

25|$|The phrases {{used on the}} Great Feasts of the Lord (excluding Palm Sunday and Pascha) are <b>not</b> <b>said</b> on Sundays, but are {{replaced}} with the normal Sunday phrase: May He Who rose from the dead... Furthermore, on the Great Feasts of the Lord, and from Palm Sunday through Thomas Sunday (the Sunday after Easter) neither {{the patron saint of}} the church nor the saint of the day are mentioned in the dismissal.|$|E
25|$|When {{a bishop}} is serving the divine liturgy, {{one of the}} priests and the deacons and lower clergy vest and the Liturgy of Preparation is {{performed}} as normal with a few omissions which are later performed by the bishop: the other clergy who are serving are not commemorated, the concluding Prayer of Offering is <b>not</b> <b>said,</b> and the offerings are not censed. When the liturgy neither immediately follows matins nor is in conjunction with vespers, {{the reading of the}} hours generally does not commence until after the arrival of the bishop.|$|E
25|$|At Minchah, the chazzan adds Aneinu in his {{repetition}} again, as at Shacharit. In addition, {{during the}} silent Amidah, all fasting congregatants recite {{the text of}} Aneinu without its signature in the blessing of Tefillah. In addition, communities that say the shortened version of the Shalom blessing at Minchah and Maariv say the complete version at this Minchah. The chazzan also says the priestly blessing before Shalom as he would at Shacharit, unlike the usual weekday Minchah when the priestly blessing is <b>not</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{revisions}} of Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII, the Ite Missa est {{was replaced with}} Benedicamus Domino ("Let us bless the Lord") on days in which the Gloria was <b>not</b> <b>said</b> and the rubrics required the priest to wear violet vestments (i.e., Masses of the season during Advent, Septuagesima, Lent and Passiontide; vigils; certain votive Masses). In the 1962 Missal, Benedicamus Domino is said only when the Mass is followed by another liturgical action, such as the Eucharistic Processions on Holy Thursday and Corpus Christi.|$|E
25|$|She had <b>not</b> <b>said</b> {{where she}} was to be buried and the family chose what is now the Ascension Parish burial ground, as it was the nearest one to their home. There was some {{difficulty}} in getting a full-size plot, where she could be buried without being cremated first. This was not possible in the new part of the cemetery, so the site finally obtained – after negotiation with Ely diocesan authorities – was that of an old grave, corner-to-corner with the plot where Wittgenstein had been buried half a century before.|$|E
25|$|Today, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has {{the status}} of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even heard of it, and it {{essentially}} does not exist outside of Orthodox and traditional Conservative Judaism). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities Tachanun, a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is <b>not</b> <b>said.</b> There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.|$|E

25|$|On 7 June 2017, the IBF granted Joshua an {{exception}} for him to rematch Klitschko instead of fighting mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev. At this point, it was <b>not</b> <b>said</b> that the rematch would take place. Klitschko said he needed time to review his situation before agreeing to a rematch. It was only weeks after the fight, when Eddie Hearn filed the paperwork to the IBF to request {{the exception to the}} mandatory defense. IBF explained that the rematch must take place no later than 2 December 2017 and the winner must fight Pulev next with no exceptions.|$|E
25|$|The priestly blessing is {{said in the}} reader's {{repetition}} of the Shacharit Amidah, and at the Mussaf Amidah on Shabbat and Jewish Holidays. On public fast days it is also said at Mincha; and on Yom Kippur, at Neilah. It is <b>not</b> <b>said</b> in a House of Mourning. In Orthodox and some Conservative congregations, this blessing is chanted by kohanim (direct descendants of the Aaronic priestly clan) on certain occasions. In Ashkenazic practice, the priestly blessing is chanted by kohanim on Jewish Holidays in the Diaspora, and daily in the Land of Israel. In Yemenite Jewish synagogues and some Sephardi synagogues, kohanim chant the priestly blessing daily, even outside Israel.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a long-standing}} {{tradition}} of mead consumption, the beverage is a niche product in Poland. In 2013, about 600,000 litres of mead {{were sold in}} Poland, compared with 142.5 million litres of wine sold during the same period. Mead amounted to 0.5 percent of total alcohol consumption in Poland in 2013. Only nine percent of adult Poles polled that year declared that they had drunk mead {{at least once in}} the last three months; 27 percent said they had enjoyed mead in the last 12 months. Those who drank mead, did so mostly at family or social gatherings. A majority of those who did <b>not,</b> <b>said</b> there had been no occasion for it.|$|E
