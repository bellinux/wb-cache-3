The high-level plastic deformation {{on the wheel}} surface due to the combined effects of high contact stress and creepage conditions can accelerate this spheroidisation process by fracture and partial dissolution of cementite lamella in the pearlitic structure; this process is further enhanced by the increased dislocation density in the ferrite and ferrite/cementite interfaces during <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation</b> due to accelerated carbon diffusion at dislocations [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].|$|E

The offshore scarps {{are associated with the}} low-strain, compressional Kapiti-Manawatu Fault System (KMFS), which comprises high-angle (> 60) reactivated reverse and normal faults oriented NE-SW, highly oblique to the coast. Seafloor scarps range from 10 m high) and moderate to long fault seafloor rupture lengths, and those in central parts of the fault system are characterized by low scarps (10, 000 a, suggest that the seismic hazard of the Kapiti-Manawatu region is relatively low. Incorporation of these new geological data, however, is likely to increase slightly the expected seismic hazard in southern North Island.

40|$|AbstractAustenitic {{stainless}} steels represent {{a significant portion}} of the metallic components employed in the nuclear industry. In this paper, a detailed study of machining of Type 304 L steel in dry milling was performed with the aim of characterising the response of the components’ surface quality and microstructure to variations of the cutting speed, depth-of-cut, and feed-per-tooth. Surface roughness parameters were optically evaluated and X-ray diffraction (XRD) residual stress measurements were employed to measure the extent of machining abuse on the surface. In addition, deformation in the sub-surface layer was examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The experimental measurements of surface roughness and surface residual stresses were used to test a statistical model developed to optimise the selection of the process parameters. Preliminary results showed the effects of machining parameters to residual stresses and <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation</b> levels in finished components. The ultimate aim of this work is to illustrate the availability of cost-effective materials and manufacturing techniques to the nuclear industry, alongside meeting the high standards of the required properties...|$|E
40|$|Modeling {{interfacial}} phenomena {{often requires}} both a detailed atomistic description of surface interactions and accurate calculations of long-range deformations in the substrate. The latter can be efficiently obtained using an elastic Green's function if substrate deformations are small. We present a general formulation for rapidly computing the Green's function for a planar surface given the interatomic interactions, and then coupling the Green's function to explicit atoms. The approach is fast, avoids ghost forces, {{and is not}} limited to nearest-neighbor interactions. The full system comprising explicit interfacial atoms and an elastic substrate is described by a single Hamiltonian and interactions in the substrate are treated exactly up to harmonic order. This concurrent multiscale coupling provides simple, seamless elastic boundary conditions for atomistic simulations where <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformations</b> occur, such as nanoindentation, contact, friction, or fracture. Applications to surface relaxation and contact are used to test and illustrate the approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} and wear {{behavior of a}} lubricated AlSi 11 Cu 3 disk in contact with a 100 Cr 6 pin was studied by a radionuclide-assisted pin-on-disk tribometer. It {{is well known that}} shear forces change chemistry and microstructure of the near-surface material, thereby influencing {{friction and}} wear. To better understand the influences of the microstructure on the running-in behavior, disks with different silicon phase morphologies were tested under constant stressing conditions. Topography, chemistry and microstructure of pin and disk were characterized before and after tribological testing by white light interferometry, X-ray photoelectron. spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy and focused ion beam microscopy. Wear of pins was measured with a radionuclide technique to resolve ultra-low wear rates. To characterize <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformations,</b> Ga ion markers were implanted and Auger electron spectroscopy was applied to follow their shear-induced displacements. To monitor subsurface shear, the deformation of columnar markers was analyzed. The results were discussed using Godet's third body model. Furthermore, the results allowed to us extend the model to systems operated under ultra-low wear rates...|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{deformation}} {{accompanying the}} wear process in fully dense and porous metals was studied {{in order to}} develop more abradable gas path seal material systems for turbine engine applications. The finite element method was used to model high-rate viscoplastic deformation in the vicinity of a moving contact. Techniques were developed for studying such deformation in both solid (fully dense) and porous metals. Results of the analysis were verified by comparison with experimental data obtained using a pendulum-type rub test apparatus and a pin-on-disk sliding wear tester. It was found that the <b>near-surface</b> plastic <b>deformation</b> in fully dense solids was different from that for porous materials because of the compressibility of the latter. Both types of materials exhibit deformation features which can be taken advantage of in the design of more abradable material systems...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} approach is presented for the modeling of the thermomechanical interactions which occur in high speed sliding situations. These sliding contact problems which {{are characterized by}} active and interrelated thermal and mechanical phenomena could be called 'rub energetics' problems. Analytical models were developed to simulate two different rub situations: high energy braking of disk brakes and high speed rubs of gas path seals in turbine engines. The models proved to be particularly useful in predicting the severe temperatures and deformations near hot contact patches on the rubbing surfaces. The size of the hot patches is generally determined by normal load and {{the properties of the}} contacting materials. Temperatures at the contact patches can approach the melting point of the materials, especially at high sliding velocities. These high temperatures can lead to large amounts of <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation</b> and high wear rates. Decreased contact temperatures can result from using materials with increased thermal conductivity and increased heat capacity or choosing mechanical properties (decreased stiffness, yield stress or coefficient of thermal expansion) which give larger hot spot size...|$|E
40|$|The {{northern}} Upper Rhine Graben, {{situated in}} {{the central part of}} the European Cenozoic rift system, is currently characterized by low intra-plate seismicity. Historical earthquakes have not been large enough to produce surface rupturing. Moreover, the records of Quaternary surface processes and human modifications are presumably better preserved than the record of the relatively slow tectonic deformation. In order to gain information on the neotectonic activity and paleoseismicity in this setting, the geological and geomorphological records of fault movements along a segment of the Western Border Fault (WBF) were studied using an integration of techniques in paleoseismology, structural analysis and shallow geophysics. The WBF segment investigated follows a 20 km long linear scarp of unclear origin. A series of geophysical measurements were performed and the results suggested that <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation</b> structures are present at the segments' southern end. Several trenches opened at this location revealed fault structures with consistent extensional style and a maximum vertical displacement of 0. 5 m. In one trench, the deformation structures were dated between 19 and 8 ka. Assuming the deformation has been caused by an earthquake, a...|$|E
40|$|The {{interplay between}} slab {{dynamics}} and intraplate stresses in postcollisional times creates large <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation,</b> particularly in highly bent orogens with significant lateral variations in mechanical properties. This deformation is expressed through abnormal foredeep geometries and contrasting patterns of vertical movements. Intraplate folding {{is often the}} controlling mechanism, particularly when the orogenic belt is locked. The study of these tectonic processes in the SE Carpathians indicates a generalized subsidence period during latest Miocene-Pliocene times driven by the slab-pull and an intraplate folding due to an overall Quaternary inversion. The latter accommodates - 5 km ESE-ward movement of this area {{with respect to the}} neighboring units, which creates complicated three-dimensional deformation patterns potentially driven at a larger scale by the interaction between the Adriatic indentor and the entire Carpathians system. The lithospheric anisotropy inherited from the subduction times concentrates strain and induces large-scale deformation far away from the active plate margins. This anisotropy is dynamic because of deep mantle processes related to the subducted slab during postcollisional times, such as thermal reequilibration or increase in slab dip.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that {{substantial}} plastic deformation occurs on and near the contact surfaces, when two solid bodies slide against each other without lubrication. It {{has been found that}} this deformation {{plays an important role in}} the tribological behavior of the sliding contact. The present investigation has the objective to develop an analytical model to predict the <b>near-surface</b> plastic <b>deformation</b> resulting from a single pass of one metallic surface over another. A finite element viscoplasticity program was written relating velocities to forces in a two-dimensional domain. The program was employed in the study of plastic deformation during a single pass of a hardened tool steel slider over a copper rub specimen. It was found that essentially the only material set in motion by the slider was directly under the contact zone. The agreement between values obtained in the analysis and experimental data is reasonably good...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} in this paper {{that the role of}} surface and <b>near-surface</b> plastic <b>deformation</b> is {{especially}} significant in both sliding and abrasive wear of lamellar composites. Lamellar structures were produced artificially from alternate layers of pure copper and pure tin or lead foils. The resulting composites were tested in three different wear tests: single-pass abrasion by a sharp, hard abrader; multiple-pass rubbing by a hard, rounded abrader; and pin-on-disk sliding. In each case the counterface was a hard alloy steel. Tests were run with the composite lamellae in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the sliding direction. It was found that the composites had much less wear resistance and greater abradability when oriented perpendicular to the rub direction. The mechanisms for wear particle removal and the role of plastic deformation in the process were studied by plasticity analysis and by microscopic (SEM and optical) observation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{diamond-like}} carbon (DLC) films with different thicknesses on 9 Cr 18 bearing steels were prepared using vacuum magnetic-filtering are plasma deposition. Vickers indentation, nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests {{were used to}} characterize the DLC films {{with a wide range}} of applied loads. Mechanical and tribological behaviors of these submicron films were investigated and interpreted. The hardnesses of 9 Cr 18 and DLC, determined by nanoindentation, are approximately 8 GPa and 60 GPa respectively; their elastic moduli are approximately 250 GPa and 600 GPa respectively. The friction coefficients of 9 Cr 18, DLC, organic coating, determined by nanoscratch, are approximately 0. 35, 0. 20 and 0. 13 respectively. It is demonstrated that nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests can provide more information about the <b>near-surface</b> elastic-plastic <b>deformation,</b> friction and wear properties. The correlation of mechanical properties and scratch resistance of DLC films on 9 Cr 18 steels can provide an assessment for the load-carrying capacity and wear resistance...|$|R
40|$|Rifting is {{examined}} as {{the growth of}} a necking instability. A rift is nucleated by means of a small thickness perturbation imposed {{at the base of a}} strong layer which overlies a weaker substrate. The conditions for which the initial disturbance will amplify as the lithosphere extends are evaluated for a range of rheological parameters, and the associated pattern of <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation</b> is determined. It was found that this unstable lithospheric extension results in a pattern of deformation that is consistent with the major morphological characteristics of rift zones. For an initial perturbation narrower than the dominant wavelength, deformation concentrates in a zone of width comparable to the dominant wavelength; for an initial thickness perturbation wider than the dominant wavelength, deformation develops periodically at the dominant wavelength in the region above the perturbation. It is noted that the width of a rift is essentially independent of the layer/substrate strength ratio. For a power law viscous surface layer (n = 3), the dominant wavelength varies with the layer/substrate strength ratio to the one-third power and is always larger than for a plastic surface layer of the same thickness. The unstable extension of a strong viscous surface layer may be responsible for the great width of rift zones on Venus...|$|E
40|$|A {{microstructural}} characterization {{approach has}} been developed to study the mechanisms of <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation</b> under surface scratches in injection-molded polypropylene blends with over 20 % rubber modifier (thermoplastic polyolefin or TPO). The near-surface microstructure of the material before and after scratching was characterized with different techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction. It was observed that the TPO material plastically deformed by forming shear band structure under surface scratches. Materials inside shear band dilated {{and the extent of}} dilation could be measured from the characteristic angles between the shearband boundary and rubber particles. At a higher applied normal load (> 200 g for the test in this study), evidence for surface fracture was observed. At even higher loads (> 400 g), significant amounts of sub-surface voiding were observed, due to the delamination between the rubber phases and the polypropylene matrix. The observation of both the dilation of materials inside shearbands and the subsurface voiding at high normal loads advanced the understanding of scratching whitening mechanism in this kind of important materials. It was observed that the talc additives had no obvious influence on shear band nucleation and propagation. Results obtained in this study suggest that a strong interfacial adhesion between rubber phase and PP matrix is crucial to improving the scratching resistance of rubber modified polypropylene blends...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{evaluate}} the possibility that the fractal characteristics of reservoir fracture systems might be inferred from the fractal characteristics of the reservoir reflector. Results discussed in the summary below provide support for such a view. The matter will, however, remain unresolved until fracture data acquired from core or FMS logs can be compared to reflection seismic data from the core areas. A series of cross sections along the Middle Mountain syncline and Elkhorn Mountain anticline were evaluated. <b>Near-surface</b> <b>deformation</b> in the Middle Mountain and Elkhorn mountain area of the Valley and Ridge province is significant. In this area the fractal dimension of topography is linearly related to the fractal dimension of underlying structure. Comparison of the fractal variability of Valley and Ridge structures with those observed in seismic data from the Plateau indicate that the increased fractal dimension of reflection events implies greater relative abundance of higher order or smaller wavelength structures. Results from the seismic evaluation suggest that fractal analysis might provide a useful exploration tool in cases where one is interested in locating subtle detached structures or identifying fractured reservoirs. Results from the Valley and a Ridge area suggest that, in active tectonic areas, fractal analysis may provide a means to assess the relative frequency of earthquake activity over time periods that extend beyond the historical record...|$|E

Seismic activity, focal depths and fault plane solutions of earthquakes indicate kinematic reactions within the crust. A crustal deformation model which {{may account for the}} Rhine graben systems and the associated seismotectonic block movements in Europe is presented. A computer aided tomography to gravity anomalies is used in determining the crustal stresses in central Europe. Tomographical interpretations of gravity data with respect to seismic stresses are discussed.

To date, approximately 1. 9 km of P-wave data and 0. 9 km of SH-wave data have been collected. Two perpen-dicular six-fold P-wave reflection surveys have been per-formed obliquely to the axis of the KBFS to image the style and azimuth of structure associated with the deeper Creta-ceous (427 m) and Paleozoic (533 m) reflection horizons. The P-wave data also served as reconnaissance forsiting the target areas imaged by the near-surface SH-wave technique. A high-angle reverse fault has been successfully imaged 540 m in front (northeast) of the present scarp topography using P- and SH-wave techniques, indicating a broad zone of <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation.</b> The fault, along with north-dip-ping reflectors, has been traced {{from the top of}} the Paleozoic bedrock into the water-saturated, unconsolidated sand and gravel of the Quaternary alluvium. It is interpreted to be a northeast-vergent fault, striking approximately N 30 ~ This interpretation is consistent with the surface xpression of the scarp and the nature of the contemporary seismicity. The fault is also spatially consistent with historic reports of the two waterfalls created in the Mississippi River after the great 1811 - 1812 earthquakes, uggesting that the KBFS represents part of the surface rupture associated with the events...|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{ratcheting}} plays a {{key role}} in wear and rolling contact fatigue crack formation at the wheel-rail interface. Tests to examine the wear and rolling contact fatigue behaviour of rail materials over a wide range of service conditions are expensive and can be impractical. A physical simulation of the deformation behaviour associated with ratcheting is an attractive replacement for such tests. In this work, the Plane Stress Local Torsion (PSLT) test is proposed as a novel mechanical testing method to physically simulate <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation</b> in rails and to characterize the cyclic deformation behaviour of rail materials. Contrary to the orthodox mechanical tests, the proposed method is capable of producing a nonlinear strain gradient in test samples which resembles the real gradient in the rail-wheel system. The PSLT testing was performed on specimens of the nominated rail steels in a strain-controlled fashion to simulate the unidirectional as well as the fully reversing strain cycles. The test was used to examine the cyclic hardening behaviour and ratcheting characteristics of a range of high strength rail materials under cyclic loading at room temperature. The effect of the cyclic strain amplitude under symmetrical strain cycling on the cyclic hardening behaviour was investigated. Experimental torque-twist data were used to compare the plastic flow behaviour of commonly used rail materials in heavy haul applications under cyclic loading. The cyclic and ratcheting strain accumulation behaviour in the test samples was characterized based on the torque-twist data to allow a comparative study of the mechanical properties. Optical microscopy of the tested samples was also performed to compare the microstructures at the flow localization zone for different materials subjected to cyclic strain accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Geodetic slip inversions {{for three}} major (M_w > 7) strike-slip {{earthquakes}} (1992 Landers, 1999 Hector Mine and 2010 El Mayor–Cucapah) show a 15 – 60 per cent reduction in slip {{near the surface}} (depth < 2 km) relative to the slip at deeper depths (4 – 6 km). This significant difference between surface coseismic slip and slip at depth has been termed the shallow slip deficit (SSD). The large magnitude of this deficit has been an enigma since it cannot be explained by shallow creep during the interseismic period or by triggered slip from nearby earthquakes. One potential explanation for the SSD is that the previous geodetic inversions lack data coverage close to surface rupture such that the shallow portions of the slip models are poorly resolved and generally underestimated. In this study, we improve the static coseismic slip inversion for these three earthquakes, especially at shallow depths, by: (1) including data capturing the near-fault deformation from optical imagery and SAR azimuth offsets; (2) refining the interferometric synthetic aperture radar processing with non-boxcar phase filtering, model-dependent range corrections, more complete phase unwrapping by SNAPHU (Statistical Non-linear Approach for Phase Unwrapping) assuming a maximum discontinuity and an on-fault correlation mask; (3) using more detailed, geologically constrained fault geometries and (4) incorporating additional campaign global positioning system (GPS) data. The refined slip models result in much smaller SSDs of 3 – 19 per cent. We suspect that the remaining minor SSD for these earthquakes likely reflects a combination of our elastic model's inability to fully account for <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation,</b> which will render our estimates of shallow slip minima, and potentially small amounts of interseismic fault creep or triggered slip, which could ‘make up’ a small percentages of the coseismic SSD during the interseismic period. Our results indicate that {{it is imperative that}} slip inversions include accurate measurements of near-fault surface deformation to reliably constrain spatial patterns of slip during major strike-slip earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|Basaltic {{rocks are}} thought to {{constitute}} a volumetrically significant rock type on the Moon, Mercury, Mars, and Venus, {{in addition to the}} Earth. Spacecraft images of surfaces with known or suspected basaltic composition on these bodies, particularly on Venus, indicate that these rocks have been deformed in the brittle regime to form faults and perhaps dilatant cracks, in addition to folding and more distributed types of deformation. Predictions of brittle fracture or other types of deformation are made by comparing calculated stresses from a tectonic model to some criterion for rock strength. Common strength criteria used in the planetary science literature for <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation</b> include a Griffith tensile-strength criterion for intact rock, a Mohr envelope for intact basalt, and a brittle strength envelope based on Byerlee's law of rock frictional resistance. However, planetary terrains of basaltic composition consist of much more than just intact basaltic rock. The aggregate basaltic material, termed the 'rock mass,' consists of both the intact rock and the associated fracture, faults, lithologic contacts, and other discontinuous surfaces. A basaltic rock mass is the relevant material for which strength properties must be defined and calculated model stresses must be compared to in order to more accurately predict brittle deformation. For example, the various strengths of a rock mass are less than that of intact material of the same composition. This means that tectonic models which compare stresses to intact failure strengths overestimate the stresses required for fracture and so underestimate the extent and magnitude of brittle deformation predicted in these models. On the other hand, rock mass shear strength can be greater than that predicted from Byerlee's law. The concept of rock mass strength is central to many engineering design studies in which calculated stresses are used to predict brittle fracture, and this experience indicates that brittle strength envelopes which assume properties for intact rock (Griffith parabolas) or sliding along a single, continuous surface (Byerlee's law) inadequately characterize the tensile, compressive, and shear strengths of rock masses. The criterion adopted here to relate stresses to rock mass fracture is based on a Griffith-type curve for tensile normal stress and a concave downward curve for compressive normal stress. It is the only available criterion that explicitly considers the weakening effects of discontinuities within the rock mass on the stress state required for fracture...|$|E
40|$|Several {{zones of}} graben (Memnonia, Sirenum, Icaria, Thaumasia, and Claritas Fossae) extend {{radially}} {{away from the}} Tharsis rise in the southern hemisphere of Mars for distances of up to 3000 – 4000 km. These graben systems are commonly interpreted {{to be related to}} regional tectonic deformation of the Tharsis rise associated with either upwelling or loading. We explore the possibility that these giant Tharsis-radial graben systems could be the surface manifestation of mantle plume-related dike intrusion complexes. Emplacement of dikes causes near-surface stresses that can produce linear graben, and lateral dike emplacement related to plumes on Earth can produce dike swarms with lengths of many hundreds to several thousands of kilometers. We develop a Mars dike emplacement model and explore its implications. We find that the properties (outcrop patterns, widths, and depths) of the extensive Tharsis-radial graben systems are consistent with an origin through <b>near-surface</b> <b>deformation</b> associated with lateral propagation of magma-filled cracks (dikes) from plumes beneath Tharsis, particularly beneath Arsia Mons and Syria Planum. Such dikes are predicted to extend through the crust and into the upper mantle and can have widths of up to several hundred meters. Analyses of summit caldera complexes on Martian volcanoes imply that the magma supply from the mantle into shallower reservoirs is episodic on Mars, and we interpret the graben systems to be large swarms of laterally emplaced giant dikes resulting from the tapping of melt from episodically rising mantle plumes in a buffered magma supply situation. The magmatic interpretation of the Tharsis-radial graben potentially removes one of the conundrums of Tharsis tectonics in which it appeared necessary to require two distinct modes of support for Tharsis in order to explain the presence of radial graben on both the elevated flanks (attributed to isostatic stresses) and outside the rise (more consistent with flexure) : dikes capable of forming the observed graben can be emplaced under a wide range of stress fields, including zero stress. The fact that almost no eruptive features are associated with the graben further restricts the ranges of magma density to values between ∼ 3100 and 3200 kg m− 3 and crustal stress to tensions less than ∼ 30 MPa. Eruptions from giant dikes {{would be more likely to}} occur in regions where the crust was thinner, such as the northern lowlands, providing a potential mechanism for emplacement of recently documented Early Hesperian volcanic plains (Hr) there. Dike-related graben systems represent efficient mechanisms of lateral heat transfer in the crust and near-surface environments. Lateral dike intrusions could penetrate the cryosphere and cause melting and release of groundwater, as in the Mangala Valles area, and could also drive hydrothermal circulation systems. The geometries of such dike systems will create barriers which are likely to influence regional to global groundwater flow patterns, which may help to explain the abundance of outflow channel sources in eastern Tharsis. Improved knowledge of the Martian crust and mantle density structure will help to refine this analysis and to provide estimates of the magma densities for dikes underlying specific graben...|$|E
