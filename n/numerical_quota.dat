In this Plurality Opinion, Roberts wrote that the Schools at issue contend that a racially diverse {{environment}} is beneficial for education and they submit this as the reason why they consider race alone in their school assignments. However, Roberts considers that this interest is not compelling and that the use of race for this goal is not narrowly tailored, it is instead used for racial balancing, which is unconstitutional. The schools base their numbers in demographics, therefore making this goal a means to achieve a <b>numerical</b> <b>quota</b> to achieve racial balancing. Roberts concludes that racial balancing cannot be a compelling state interest.|$|E
5000|$|To {{fill the}} <b>numerical</b> <b>quota,</b> {{many of the}} prisoners at via Tasso and Regina Coeli prison who {{happened}} to be available at the time were sent to their deaths by the Nazis at the Fosse Ardeatine. Priebke put some on the list simply because they were Jewish (sending Jews to the camps, however, he said he had never done, for practical reasons: [...] "We needed the railway cars for other things").|$|E
5000|$|French cinema was {{protected}} against foreign competition by a <b>numerical</b> <b>quota</b> system {{limiting the number}} of foreign films shown per year. Between 1936 and 1940, only 188 foreign (mostly American) films were allowed each year. [...] Starting from 1940, films from non-Axis countries were banned under the German Occupation. The French cinema industry flourished under these conditions and in 1945 was the second-largest industry (in terms of employment numbers) in France, second only to the railways.Meanwhile, the overall economy of France faltered in the post-war years. The economy reached an all-time low by the summer of 1947.|$|E
50|$|After intense {{lobbying}} {{from the}} nativist movement the United States Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921. This bill {{was the first}} to place <b>numerical</b> <b>quotas</b> on immigration. It capped the inflow of immigrations to 357,803 for those arriving outside of the western hemisphere. However, this bill was only temporary as Congress began debating a more permanent bill.|$|R
5000|$|Let me {{be clear}} about what affirmative action must not mean and what I won't allow it to be. It does not mean - and I don't favor - the {{unjustified}} preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender.

In June 1937, the Politburo set a quota of 35,000enemies to be arrested in Moscow province; 5,000 of these were to be executed. In reply, Khrushchev asked that 2,000wealthy peasants, or kulaks living in Moscow be killed in part {{fulfillment}} of the quota. In any event, only two weeks after receiving the Politburo order, Khrushchev was able to report to Stalin that 41,305"criminal and kulak elements" [...] had been arrested. Of the arrestees, according to Khrushchev, 8,500 deserved execution.|$|R
50|$|The {{agreement}} {{erased the}} 2.8 billion dollars France owed the U.S., chiefly from World War I loans and loans in 1939-40. Monnet {{set out the}} French five-year plan for recovery and development. The U.S. loaned France $650 million at low interest through the Export-Import Bank. The loan was followed in 1948 by a free grant of $2.3 billion from the Marshall Plan, with no repayment. In exchange, French cinemas would replace the <b>numerical</b> <b>quota</b> with a “screen quota”. This meant that French cinemas were required to show French-made films for four weeks out of every thirteen and leave the other nine weeks of every quarter open to free competition, namely from American films.|$|E

5000|$|In 2004, the Japanese Diet {{passed a}} law {{allowing}} {{for the creation of}} graduate level law school law schools (hōka daigakuin) that offer a J.D., or Hōmu Hakushi (法務博士). The 2006 bar examination was first in Japanese history to require a law school degree as a prerequisite. In the past, although there has been no educational requirement, most of those who passed the examination had earned undergraduate degrees from [...] "elite" [...] Japanese universities such as the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University or Hitotsubashi University. With this new law school system came a new bar exam, with a 40-50% passage rate which is capped by a <b>numerical</b> <b>quota.</b> Applicants are now limited to taking the exam three times in a five-year period. Despite the much higher bar passage rate with the new exam, due to the quotas, approximately half of Japanese law school graduates will never be admitted to practice. The new system also reduced the apprenticeship period at the Legal Research and Training Institute to one year.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that public {{universities}} (and other government institutions) could not set specific numerical targets {{based on race}} for admissions or employment. The Court said that [...] "goals" [...] and [...] "timetables" [...] for diversity could be set instead. A 1979 Supreme Court case, United Steelworkers v. Weber, found that private employers could set rigid <b>numerical</b> <b>quotas,</b> if they chose to do so. In 1980, the Supreme Court found that a 10% racial quota for federal contractors was permitted.|$|R

5000|$|On September 23, 1948, the National Assembly {{revised the}} {{agreements}} so that French cinema had to reserve five weeks {{out of every}} thirteen weeks for French-made films. [...] <b>Numerical</b> <b>quotas</b> were also reintroduced. 121 dubbed American films and 65 other foreign films were permitted each year with exceptions for countries that made significant efforts to import and distribute French films. [...] The revisions also called for extra state aid to the French film industry. This request for financial aid was realized on September 23, 1948, {{with the introduction of}} a new program where taxes were imposed on movie tickets and the tax revenues were distributed to French film producers. In this way, American film sales helped the French film industry.|$|R
50|$|The Institute of International Education {{was formed}} in 1919 to protect and promote the {{interests}} of international students and exchange visitors. Lobbying by the IIE led in 1921 to the classification of students as nonimmigrants {{and the creation of}} a separate nonimmigrant visa for students, thereby exempting students from the <b>numerical</b> <b>quotas</b> placed in the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924. Starting 1918, all noncitizens started being required to obtain visas prior to entry to the United States, and in 1924, Congress enacted a provision requiring consular officers to make a determination of admissibility prior to issuing a visa. As a result, starting around this time, the majority of noncitizens coming to the United States for study did so on student visas.|$|R
500|$|Allan Bakke {{had given}} few {{interviews}} during the pendency of the case, {{and on the}} day it was decided, went to work as usual in Palo Alto. He issued a statement through attorney Colvin expressing his pleasure in the result and that he planned to begin his medical studies that fall. Most of the lawyers and university personnel who would {{have to deal with the}} aftermath of Bakke doubted the decision would change very much. [...] The large majority of affirmative action programs at universities, unlike that of the UC Davis medical school, did not use rigid <b>numerical</b> <b>quotas</b> for minority admissions and could continue. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of Bakke, the Supreme Court's decision [...] "permits admission officers to operate programs which grant racial preferences—provided that they do not do so as blatantly as was done under the sixteen-seat 'quota' provided at Davis".|$|R
5000|$|A race-conscious {{policy is}} a policy that aims to improve the {{conditions}} of racial minorities. In the United States, such policies are typically aimed at improving the status of African-Americans. Many different kinds of race-conscious policies exist, ranging from nondiscrimination policy to strict <b>numerical</b> racial <b>quotas.</b> Their main purpose is twofold: to compensate for past discrimination against the target race, and to increase equality of opportunity.|$|R
40|$|Negotiations for Chinas {{accession}} to the WTO provoked a debate between pessimists {{who believed that}} opening the economy {{would lead to a}} flood of imports and a de-nationalization of manufacturing industry, and those who believed that it would spur rationalization of state-owned enterprises, lock in domestic reforms, attract foreign investment, and open the way for trade expansion. The industry most frequently mentioned as endangered was motor vehicles, where an awkward combination of Stalinist central planning with localized autarky had resulted in a proliferation of inefficient producers. With the partial exception of two investments by Volkswagen, initial joint ventures in assembly operations failed miserably. Chinas commitments on joining the WTO banned (or at least complicated) many of the most important industrial policy tools it had used to promote the auto industry since the opening to joint ventures in the early 1980 sincluding performance requirements, high tariffs, and <b>numerical</b> <b>quotas.</b> After accession in 2001, tariffs fell steadily while output and foreign investment soared. The Chinese government moved towards a lighter-handed but more effective form of industrial policy that reduced top-down planning while expanding market incentives and scope for managerial freedom. Rather than destroying industrial policy for the auto industry, WTO accession constrained and disciplined it. When foreign auto firms and their governments pushed for more aggressive protection of trademarks and other intellectual property rights under the WTO, the Chinese government initially stalled. Continuing pressure then tilted the balance of state policy toward promotion of independent design, whether by state-owned enterprises testing the boundaries of their joint ventures with foreign multinationals, or by audacious smaller firms purchasing foreign designs and technology to complement inexpensive local parts and assembly, thereby creating the conditions for the emergence of a more competitive industry. ...|$|R
