40|$|We {{report on}} low {{temperature}} measurements in a fully tunable carbon nanotube double quantum dot. A new fabrication technique {{has been used}} for the top-gates in order to avoid covering the whole nanotube with an oxide layer as in previous experiments. The top-gates allow us to form single dots, control the coupling between them and we observe four-fold shell filling. We perform inelastic transport spectroscopy via the excited states in the double quantum dot, a necessary step towards the implementation of new microwave-based experiments.

Precise tuning of energy-level structure and electron population is demonstrated by monitoring the low-lying transitions of the electrons from the lowest quantum-dot energy shells by resonant inelastic light scattering. These findings open {{the way to the}} manipulation of single electrons in these quantum dots without the need of external metallic gates. Comment: To appear in <b>NanoLetter...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{fabricated}} dye sensitized graphene antidot superlattices {{with the}} purpose of elucidating the role of the localized edge state density. The fluorescence from deposited dye molecules was found to strongly quench as a function of increasing antidot filling fraction, whereas it was enhanced in unpatterned but electrically back-gated samples. This contrasting behavior is strongly indicative of a built-in lateral electric field that accounts for fluorescence quenching as well as p-type doping. These findings are of great interest for light-harvesting applications that require field separation of electron-hole pairs. Comment: <b>NanoLetters,</b> 201...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{electrostatic}} interaction between a sharp conducting tip {{and a thin}} one-dimensional wire, e. g., a carbon nanotube, in a scanned gate microscopy (SGM) experiment. The problem is analytically tractable if the wire resides on a thin dielectric substrate above a metallic backgate. The characteristic spatial scale of the electrostatic coupling to the tip is equal to its height above the substrate. Numerical simulations indicate that imaging of individual electrons by SGM is possible once the mean electron separation exceeds this scale (typically, a few tens of nm). Differences between weakly and strongly invasive SGM regimes are pointed out. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures. To appear in <b>NanoLetter...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} an electrically controlled high-spin (S= 5 / 2) to low-spin (S= 1 / 2) {{transition in}} a three-terminal device incorporating a single Mn 2 + ion coordinated by two terpyridine ligands. By adjusting the gate-voltage we reduce the terpyridine moiety and thereby strengthen the ligand-field on the Mn-atom. Adding a single electron thus stabilizes the low-spin configuration {{and the corresponding}} sequential tunnelling current is suppressed by spin-blockade. From low-temperature inelastic cotunneling spectroscopy, we infer the magnetic excitation spectrum of the molecule and uncover also a strongly gate-dependent singlet-triplet splitting on the low-spin side. The measured bias-spectroscopy is shown {{to be consistent with}} an exact diagonalization of the Mn-complex, and an interpretation of the data is given in terms of a simplified effective model.

40|$|Large {{aromatic}} carbon nanostructures are cornerstone materials due {{to their}} increasingly active role in functional devices, but their synthesis in solution encounters size and shape limitations. New on-surface strategies facilitate the synthesis of large and insoluble planar systems with atomic-scale precision. While dehydrogenation is usually the chemical zipping reaction building up large aromatic carbon structures, mostly benzenoid structures are being produced. Here, we report on a new cyclodehydrogenation reaction transforming a sterically stressed precursor with conjoined cove regions into planar carbon platform by incorporating azulene moieties in their interior. Submolecular resolution STM is used to characterize this exotic large polycyclic aromatic compound on Au(111) yielding unprecedented insight into a dehydrogenative intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling reaction. The resulting polycyclic aromatic carbon structure shows a [18]annulene core hosting peculiar pore states confined at the carbon cavity. Comment: Accepted for publication in <b>Nanoletter...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties of}} carbon nanotubes {{in a uniform}} transverse field are investigated within a single orbital tight-binding model. For doped nanotubes, the dielectric function is found to depend not only on symmetry of the tube, but also on radius and Fermi level position. Bandgap opening/closing is predicted for zigzag tubes, while {{it is found that}} armchair tubes always remain metallic, which is explained by the symmetry in their configuration. The bandstructures for both types are considerably modified when the field strength is large enough to mix neighboring subbands.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a fast and sensitive optomagnetic biomarker detection technology based on magnetic particles. Antibody-coated superparamagnetic particles capture biomarker molecules and form clusters with a biomarker molecule sandwiched between two particles. The particle clusters are actuated using a rotating magnetic field, which induces an oscillating light scattering cross-section (see Fig. 1 a). Sub-picomolar biomarker concentrations {{can be resolved}} by the light scattering signals [Ranzoni et al, <b>Nanoletters</b> 2011; ACS Nano 2012]. In this paper we report a method to quantify inter-particle distances with nanometer resolution. The light scattering data show high-frequency signal components (see Fig. 1 b). Simulations show that high-frequency components hold detailed information about the geometry of the particle clusters, including a strong dependence on the inter-particle distance (see Fig. 1 c). We will report the simulation results and experimental data of corresponding model cluster assays...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a non-perturbative {{framework for the}} treatment of the excitations of single walled carbon nanotubes based upon a field theoretic reduction is able to accurately describe experiment observations of the absolute values of excitonic energies. This theoretical framework yields a simple scaling function from which the excitonic energies can be read off. This scaling function is primarily determined by a single parameter, the charge Luttinger parameter of the tube, which is in turn a function of the tube chirality, dielectric environment, and the tube's dimensions, thus expressing disparate influences on the excitonic energies in a unified fashion. We test this theory explicitly on the data reported in <b>NanoLetters</b> 5, 2314 (2005) and Phys. Rev. B. 82, 195424 (2010) and so demonstrate the method works over a wide range of reported excitonic spectra. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures, 2 table...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the electronic structure of terraces of single layer graphene (SLG) by {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) on samples grown by thermal decomposition of 6 H-SiC(0001) crystals in ultra-high vacuum. We focus on the perturbations of the local density of states (LDOS) {{in the vicinity of}} edges of SLG terraces. Armchair edges are found to favour intervalley quasiparticle scattering, leading to the (3 × 3) R 30 LDOS superstructure already reported for graphite edges and more recently for SLG on SiC(0001). Using Fourier transform of LDOS images, we demonstrate that the intrinsic doping of SLG is responsible for a LDOS pattern at the Fermi energy which is more complex than for neutral graphene or graphite, since it combines local (3 × 3) R 30 superstructure and long range beating modulation. Although these features were already reported by Yang et al. <b>Nanoletters</b> 10, 943 (2010), we propose here an alternative interpretation based on simple arguments classically used to describe standing wave patterns in standard two-dimensional systems. Finally, we discuss the absence of intervalley scattering off other typical boundaries: zig-zag edges and SLG/bilayer graphene junctions...|$|R
40|$|We have {{fabricated}} air-stable n-type, ambipolar {{carbon nanotube}} field effect transistors (CNFETs), {{and used them}} in nanoscale memory cells. N-type transistors are achieved by annealing of nanotubes in hydrogen gas and contacting them by cobalt electrodes. Scanning gate microscopy reveals that the bulk response of these devices is similar to gold-contacted p-CNFETs, confirming that Schottky barrier formation at the contact interface determines accessibility of electron and hole transport regimes. The transfer characteristics and Coulomb Blockade (CB) spectroscopy in ambipolar devices show strongly enhanced gate coupling, most likely due to reduction of defect density at the silicon/silicon-dioxide interface during hydrogen anneal. The CB data in the ``on''-state indicates that these CNFETs are nearly ballistic conductors at high electrostatic doping. Due to their nanoscale capacitance, CNFETs are extremely sensitive to presence of individual charge around the channel. We demonstrate that this property can be harnessed to construct data storage elements that operate at the few-electron level.

40|$|Motivated {{in part by}} {{experiments}} {{performed by}} M. H. Pan et al. (<b>nanoletters,</b> v. 5, p 83, 2005), we have undertaken a theoretical study of the the magnetic properties of two-monolayer thick Co nanoplatelets with an equilateral triangular shape. The analysis is carried out using a microscopic Slater-Koster tight-binding model with atomic exchange and spin-orbit interactions designed to realistically capture the salient magnetic features of large nanoclusters containing up to 350 atoms. Two different truncations of the FCC lattice are studied, in which the nanoplatelet surface is aligned parallel to the FCC (111) and (001) crystal planes respectively. We find that the higher coordination number in the (111) truncated crystal {{is more likely to}} reproduce the perpendicular easy direction found in experiment. Qualitatively, the most important parameter governing the anisotropy of the model is found to be the value of the intra-atomic exchange integral J. If we set the value of J near the bulk value in order to reproduce the experimentally observed magnitude of the magnetic moments, we find both quasi-easy-planes and perpendicular easy directions. At larger values of J we find that the easy-axis of magnetization is perpendicular to the surface, and the value of the magnetic anisotropy energy per atom is larger. The possible role of hybridization with substrate surface states in the experimental systems is discussed. Comment: 15 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} exhibit exceptional {{physical properties}} {{at the individual}} scale. In order to optimize these properties at the macroscopic scale, a good control of both the dispersion and alignment of the nanotubes is required. In this work we study the dispersion and alignment of single-wall carbon nanotubes in lyotropic nematic suspensions and we use these suspensions for the elaboration of anisotropic thin films. Individual nanotubes are stabilized by denaturated DNA in aqueous suspensions. Lyotropic nematic phases are prepared by concentrating nanotubes/DNA aqueous suspensions and the nematic is shear-aligned in thin cells. At {{each step of the}} preparation, the dispersion and alignment are studied by polarized optical microscopy, photoluminescence and Raman measurements. We show that thin homogeneous anisotropic films can be prepared from wet aligned suspensions. In a first series of experiments, the nematic and the corresponding films exhibited a quite weak order parameter (S about 0. 2) [1], which was assigned to some entanglements of the nanotube network. In this talk, we will show that the order parameter of the nematic and the corresponding films can be significantly improved by controling the aspect ratio and/or the bundling of the nanotubes, for example using fractionation through controled ultra-centrifugation during the nematic phase formation.

40|$|In this study, {{we use the}} {{theoretical}} model of low-frequency noise in an adsorption-based sensor to analyze the possibility for the recognition and quantification of the analyte {{based on the measured}} fluctuations spectrum. We have developed an analytical expression for the spectral density of the fluctuations of the number of analyte particles adsorbed onto the sensing surface which takes into account the processes of mass transfer through the sensor reaction chamber, adsorption and desorption, and surface diffusion of adsorbed particles [1, 2]. The numerical calculations performed using the derived theory are in agreement with the experimental data from the literature obtained for graphene-based gas sensors [3, 4]. While analyzing the dependence of specific features in the fluctuation spectra of various parameters, we investigate which type of information about the analyte and its interaction with the graphene surface can be obtained from the experimentally obtained noise spectrum.

40|$|With {{the aid of}} ab-initio calculations, we {{have studied}} the effect of {{hydrogen}} functionalization on graphene. This new material, theoretically predicted in 2007 [1] and synthesized in 2008 [2], is known with the name 'graphane'. We have investigated the effect of hydrogen also on silicon and germanium based counterparts of graphene, polysilane and polygermyne monolayers. Our main objective {{of this study is}} to understand the effect of hydrogen in the optical absorption spectra and in the electronic affinity of such systems, in view of their possible application in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. Being the optical absorption spectrum and the electron affinity excited state properties of materials, we go beyond standard density-functional theory (DFT) calculations by introducing quasi-particle and excitonic effects within GW and Bethe Salpeter approaches. We show that upon H functionalization, graphene undergoes a metal-insulator transition, with an opening of an electronic gap at Gamma of about 6 eV. The electron affinity stays positive, at odd with hydrogen covered diamond surfaces. A smaller opening of a gap is observed in silicon and germanium 2 -D counterparts, making these materials eligible for optoelectronic applications. [1] J. O. Sofo, A. S. Chaudhari, and G. D.

40|$|The {{interest}} in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as they became reliable biomarkers for many diseases. For this reason, fast and accurate techniques of EVs size characterization are the matter of utmost importance. One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from the measurements of their diffusion constants. The crucial assumption {{here is that the}} diffusion of EVs follows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i. e. that the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD ∝ t). In this letter we show that this relation is severely violated in biological samples. In fact, at intermediate time periods MSD shows strongly sub-diffusive behavior (MSD ∝ t^α, 0 <α< 1) and for the longer periods it is affected by the boundary effects. The sub-diffusive behavior is well known in statistical physics, but most of its theoretical models do not provide the direct relation between the size of a particle and the generalized diffusion constant. We solve this problem by introducing the logarithmic model of sub-diffusion, aimed at retrieving the size data. In result we propose a novel protocol of NTA data analysis that accounts for the anomalous diffusion effects. Incorporating this aspect into analysis results in the change of the average EV diameter by 45 % in comparison to the normal diffusion models. To corroborate our analysis, we compare our results with the AFM studies of the same samples. Our methodology significantly reduces the discrepancy between the results obtained from NTA and direct imaging techniques. Comment: Submitted to <b>Nanoletters</b> on 20. 01. 1...|$|R
