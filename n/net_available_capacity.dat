25|$|The Second Generation Prius {{contains}} a 1.310kWh battery, composed of 28 modules. Each battery module {{is made of}} 6 individual 1.2V 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2V 6.5Ah module with 46Wh/kg energy density and 1.3kW/kg output power density. Each module {{contains a}}n integrated charge controller and relay. These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6V 6.5Ah battery (traction battery), {{also known as the}} energy storage system. The computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery {{only a small portion of}} its <b>net</b> <b>available</b> energy storage <b>capacity</b> is <b>available</b> for use (approximately 400Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting, while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{practical}} range of <b>net</b> power <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> from conventional and enhanced geothermal wells {{as a function}} of temperature and productivity index. For a temperature range of 100 °C to 190 °C, which is the operating temperature limit of presently available downhole pumps, wells are typically pumped and power is usually generated in a binary-cycle plant, and in rare cases in a flash-cycle or hybrid-cycle plant. In this temperature range, the net MW capacity of a well has an upper limit of about 7. 3 MW, irrespective of how high the well’s productivity index is. This capacity limit cannot be improved unless technology can be improved to allow setting pumps deeper in the well than the current limit of 457 m (1, 500 feet) and pumping at a higher rate than the present limit of about 160 ℓ/s (2, 500 gallons per minute). For resource temperatures greater than 190 °C, wells must be self-flowed, and power is generated from such wells in a flash-cycle or hybrid-cycle plant. In the temperature range of 190 °C to nearly 220 °C a self-flowing well’s net power capacity (irrespective of its productivity index) is less than the maximum of 7. 3 MW for a pumped well. Above 220 °C, the net power capacity of a well increases rapidly with increasing temperature and productivity index, and there is no practical upper limit. The maximum <b>net</b> power <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> from an EGS well depends on reservoir depth and local temperature gradient; the optimum depth being increasingly shallow for higher temperature gradients. The trend of decrease in the optimum depth with temperature gradient applies whether this optimum is defined in terms of the maximum net MW capacity of a well or the minimum drilling cost per net MW capacity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{are becoming}} widely used for its {{low energy consumption}} and low pollution. An accurate estimation of <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> for Li-ion batteries has an important utility significance to optimize its performance in the applications of EVs. The Peukert equation is applied to estimate the <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> of batteries. However, {{the fact that the}} <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> of Li-ion batteries is dependent on battery temperatures can result in errors while using the Peukert equation. To address this problem, this paper proposes an extended Peukert equation to include temperature effect. This method considers battery temperature as an input variable into the Peukert equation. Experiments based on Li-ion batteries are carried out under various current and temperatures. The comparison of the estimated and the actual <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> indicates that the proposed algorithm can provide a reliable and accurate estimation of the <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> for Li-ion batteries...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Improving the {{efficiency}} of freight transport leads {{to a reduction in}} both costs and emissions. One key aspect of efficient transport is the load factor, i. e., the load carried (required capacity) compared to the maximum load that could be carried (<b>available</b> <b>capacity)</b> in a load unit (e. g., a vehicle). Few existing articles discuss load factor from a shipper’s perspective. Also, the concept of load factor is interpreted in different ways, and there is confusion about what is 100 % full. To achieve a high load factor {{can be seen as a}} balance between required and <b>available</b> <b>capacity.</b> As a step towards identifying opportunities for shippers to improve load factor, the purpose of this paper is to structure the load factor concept based on the balance between required and <b>available</b> <b>capacity.</b> Research Approach: A conceptual model was developed based on the literature. This model was applied in the typical case of a shipper outsourcing freight transport. The data collection consisted of several semi-structured interviews with people in logistics and transport roles. Findings and Originality: This paper presents a model that structures the concept of load factor based on required and <b>available</b> <b>capacity,</b> including load factor as the balance between required and <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> at different levels. Further, required capacity for a particular time period is determined by order details, item characteristics, number of items and the consolidation of items in the load at each load factor level. <b>Available</b> <b>capacity</b> for a particular time period is determined by the type of load units and the number of load units at each load factor level. The different levels interact, and, to complement the balance at each load factor level, an overall measure comparing the required capacity at the lowest load factor level with the <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> at the highest load factor level is suggested. Research Impact: The conceptual model presented in this paper can be used to describe imbalances in shipper systems between required and <b>available</b> <b>capacity.</b> By providing structure and explaining inefficiency in terms of the imbalance between required and <b>available</b> <b>capacity,</b> the model is a step towards identifying opportunities for improving load factor. The findings are also of interest to researchers in the field of transport efficiency and green logistics. Practical Impact: Logistics managers can achieve a better understanding of the concept of load factor and at what level their required and <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> are imbalanced. Improving the load factor is of interest in terms of both reducing costs and improving environmental performance...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) has the {{potential}} to supply substantial quantities of nutrients [i. e nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S) ] for plant uptake. Yet there is little understanding of the impact of management on the nutrient supply potential in soils (particularly, P and S). To quantify N, P and S availability from SOM, surface soils (0 – 10 cm) were collected from 14 management practices across three long-term (16 – 46 years) experimental sites under semi-arid (Luvisol), Mediterranean (Luvisol) and sub-tropical (Vertisol) environments in Australia. The practices comprised conventional (CT) and reduced tillage (RT) with mixed farming, no-till with continuous cropping (NT), and perennial pasture (PP) in the semi-arid Luvisol, while in a Mediterranean direct-drilled continuous cropping system, stubble was either retained (SR) or burnt (SB). Practices on the Vertisol comprised a factorial combination of CT, NT, SR, SB with either 0 (0 N) or 90 kg urea-N ha (90 N) in a continuous cropping system. Soils were incubated under controlled soil moisture and temperature, and cumulative organic C mineralised (C), and <b>net</b> <b>available</b> N, P and S were measured over 126 days. In the semi-arid Luvisol, CT and/or RT showed significantly higher C and <b>net</b> <b>available</b> N, P and S than NT and PP. In the Mediterranean Luvisol, C and <b>net</b> <b>available</b> P were not influenced by stubble management. In the Vertisol, CT-SR (cf. CT-SB and NT-SR/SB) with or without N fertilisation significantly increased C, and CT-SR and/or -SB with N fertilisation (cf. CT-SR/SB without N fertilisation and NT-SR and/or -SB with or without N fertilisation) significantly increased <b>net</b> <b>available</b> N and P. This study found a continuous release of <b>net</b> <b>available</b> N (11 – 49 kg N ha over 126 days) across all management practices, whereas, the release of available P and S was evident only during the first 30 days (6 – 74 kg P ha, − 4 to 22 kg S ha), after which microbial immobilisation or clay fixation of P and S predominated, particularly in the Vertisol. In conclusion, the results indicate that SOM is a ready source of plant available P and S (in addition to N), and tillage and stubble retention generally enhanced SOM mineralisation and nutrient release, which varied with soil type...|$|R
