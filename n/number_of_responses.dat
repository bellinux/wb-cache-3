25|$|Variable Ratio Schedule (VR): A {{procedure}} in which reinforcement comes after a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> that is randomized from one reinforcement {{to the next}} (ex. slot machines). The lower the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> required, the higher the response rate tends to be. Ratio schedules tend to produce very rapid responding, often with breaks of no responding just after reinforcement if a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> is required for reinforcement.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} is frequently applied when analysing items on self-report instruments such as personality tests and surveys that often use rating scales {{with a small}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> options (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). The smaller the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> categories, the more a correlation between latent continuous variables will tend to be attenuated. Lee, Poon & Bentler (1995) have recommended a two-step approach to factor analysis for assessing {{the factor structure of}} tests involving ordinally measured items. This aims to reduce the effect of statistical artifacts, such as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> scales or skewness of variables leading to items grouping together in factors.|$|R

40|$|Objective. The {{present study}} uses {{simulated}} data {{to find what}} the optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> categories is to achieve adequate power in ordinal logistic regression (OLR) model for differential item functioning (DIF) analysis in psychometric research. Methods. A hypothetical ten-item quality of life scale with three, four, and five response categories was simulated. The power and type I error rates of OLR model for detecting uniform DIF were investigated under different combinations of ability distribution (θ), sample size, sample size ratio, and the magnitude of uniform DIF across reference and focal groups. Results. When θ was distributed identically in the reference and focal groups, increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> categories from 3 to 5 resulted in an increase of approximately 8 % in power of OLR model for detecting uniform DIF. The power of OLR was less than 0. 36 when ability distribution in the reference and focal groups was highly skewed {{to the left and}} right, respectively. Conclusions. The clearest conclusion from this research is that the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> categories for DIF analysis using OLR is five. However, the impact <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> categories in detecting DIF was lower than might be expected...|$|R

The monument association had legislative permission to select a site and chose the southeast corner of the Indiana Statehouse grounds at Indianapolis. The monument's foundation was laid during the winter of 1889; erection of the monument began in April 1890, but was delayed for nearly a month when several of the large granite pieces failed to arrive {{with the rest of the}} structure.

25|$|To {{investigate}} {{if people}} would help {{others in the}} presence of bystanders alone or when introducing an accountability cue, van Bommel set out to perform two experiments. For the first experiment, participants were invited to join an online forum. A sample of 86 students was used and in the forum participants saw their own name and the names of the other people that were online in the left upper half of the screen. To operationalize the accountability cue, participants' names were displayed in either red or black. Red (salient condition), utilized to attract attention and stand out, was used to raise public self-awareness while black (non-salient) was used for participants to have the same color as other bystanders. In random order, five different messages were presented to the participants. Each of these messages was a personal story of a person in distress. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants and as expected, the results showed that names in black (non-salient condition) were linked to the bystander effect with the amount of help being 2. However, when names were in the red (salient condition), the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help being 3. This exemplifies the role of self-awareness in the reversal of bystander effect.|$|E

25|$|Theoretical {{difficulties}} {{are known to}} exist with the PCI. The PCI can be computed only for scales with a neutral center point and an equal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> options {{on either side of}} it. Also a uniform distribution <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> does not always yield the midpoint of the PCI statistic but rather varies with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>responses</b> or values in the scale. For example, ﬁve-, seven- and nine-point scales with a uniform distribution <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> give PCIs <b>of</b> 0.60, 0.57 and 0.50 respectively.|$|R
25|$|Motivation is {{a factor}} that {{encourages}} a person to perform and succeed at the task at hand. In an experiment done by Roebers, Moga and Schneider (2001), participants were placed in either forced report, free report or free report plus incentive groups. In each group, {{they found that the}} amount of correct information recalled did not differ, yet in the group where participants were given an incentive they had higher accuracy results. This means that presenting participants with an encouragement to provide correct information motivates them to be more precise. However, this is only true if the perception is that success is providing correct information. When it is believed that success is the completion of the task rather than the accuracy of that completion, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> is higher, yet its accuracy is lowered. This shows that the results are dependent on how success is defined to the participant. In the referred experiment, the participants that were placed in the forced response group had the lowest overall accuracy; they had no motivation to provide accurate responses and were forced to respond even when they were unsure of the answer. Another study done by Hill RD, Storandt M, and Simeone C tested the impact of memory skills training and external reward on free recall of serial word lists. Effects similar to those reported in the previous study were seen in children—in contrast to older learners.|$|E

2500|$|However, Skinner {{recognized}} {{that a great}} deal of behavior, especially human behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of response sequences. Complex behavior often appears suddenly in its final form, as when a person first finds his way to the elevator by following instructions given at the front desk. To account for such behavior, Skinner introduced the concept of rule-governed behavior. First, relatively simple behaviors come under the control of verbal stimuli: the child learns to [...] "jump", [...] "open the book", and so on. [...] After a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> come under such verbal control, a sequence of verbal stimuli can evoke an almost unlimited variety of complex responses.|$|E
