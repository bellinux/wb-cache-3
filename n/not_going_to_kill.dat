25|$|Survivors have {{testified that}} the {{transmission}} of the HIV virus was a deliberate act by talking about how the men, before they raped them, would {{say that they were}} <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> them directly but rather give them a slow death from AIDS. Two-thirds of a sample of 1,200 Rwandan genocide widows tested positive for HIV, and the infection rates in rural areas more than doubled after the genocide. There is no data on the number of victims who died from AIDS after 1994 who had contracted the disease from having been raped during the genocide.|$|E
25|$|The British {{women and}} {{children}} were ordered {{to come out of the}} assembly rooms, but they refused to do so and clung to each other. They barricaded themselves in, tying the door handles with clothing. At first, around twenty rebel soldiers opened fire from the outside of the Bibighar, firing through holes in the boarded windows. The soldiers of the squad that was supposed to fire the next round were disturbed by the scene, and discharged their shots into the air. Soon after, upon hearing the screams and groans inside, the rebel soldiers declared that they were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> any more women & children.|$|E
500|$|Julie Benz {{initially}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Buffy Summers, but that later went to Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had previously won the part of Cordelia Chase. Benz was offered the small role of the vampire Darla in the pilot episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Her performance was so well-received that her character appeared in a few more episodes. In an interview with TheTVAddict.com, Benz said of her casting: [...] "I was supposed to die in the pilot, but about halfway through the pilot Joss Whedon was like, 'We're giving you a name and we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> you.' And he did that for a while until it finally came time to kill me, and kill me, and kill me and killed [...] me." [...] She later went on to say: ...|$|E

Those who are not able to make it, we call them inept, also {{sometimes}} the women, the inept will run away''''.He also went on to demonstrate the desensitization that accompanies military macho-violence:''''....A soldier is a soldier. He is not a civilian. Bullets are bullets. It is a war. We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> there <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> ducks. It is war. You go there to defend. The centre is no place for compassion”.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{announced}} in March 2010 that Schneider would leave Parks and Recreation {{at the end of}} the second season. Schur claimed the decision was a combination of the original conception of the character switching between the government and the private sector, as well as Schneider's increasing success in such independent films as Bright Star. In the initial announcement, Schur claimed that both the producers and Schneider were interested in having Schneider return for guest appearances in the future, including in season three. Schur said at the time: [...] "He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> remain in the world of the show in a way that not only allows but hopefully demands that he'll reenter it. He's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>killed</b> in some weird accident." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} {{featured}} in issue #17, as he leads {{a team of}} new recruits on a very dangerous, very real mission in a war-torn, riot-filled city. One of his men is wounded, and Beach Head apparently orders the man abandoned. This leads to mistrust and hostility {{on the part of}} the other soldiers. It is later revealed that Beach Head knew the wounded man was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>killed,</b> rather he would be taken to the police station, which was a mission objective. Beach Head and the others rescue their wounded comrade and attempt an escape. Beach Head himself is wounded and despite explicit orders to leave him behind, his men risk their lives to save him, and themselves. Beach Head consistently gives push-ups as punishments, even when the team is under hostile fire.|$|R
500|$|On {{the night}} of December 24, 2004 (three months after the crash of Flight 815), two members of a science team from the Kahana {{freighter}} anchored offshore—Daniel and Charlotte—who landed on the island three days earlier with a hidden agenda, sneak off to find the Tempest. [...] Juliet and the crash survivors' leader Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) notice their absence from the beach camp and pursue them. [...] After hearing the whispers, Harper approaches Juliet. [...] She tells her that Daniel and Charlotte intend to kill everyone on the island by deploying a lethal gas at the Tempest and that Ben's orders are for Juliet to kill them. [...] On a trek back to the beach in the morning, Kate encounters Daniel and Charlotte and is knocked unconscious by the latter. Jack and Juliet come across Kate and they split up: Juliet continues for the Tempest alone, as Jack minds Kate. Inside the station, Juliet finds Daniel in a hazmat suit at a computer. [...] After a standoff, Daniel and Charlotte convince Juliet that they are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> anyone; they are neutralizing the gas in case Ben decides to use it again, as he had twelve years earlier in an Others-led purge of Dharma. [...] Jack arrives at the Tempest and Juliet explains that those on the freighter came to the island to wage war against Ben and she expects him to win. [...] She fears for Jack because Ben thinks that she belongs to him, but Jack shows no worry and kisses her.|$|E
2500|$|Coleman and Brown {{returned}} {{to the home of}} Reverend and Mrs. Gay in Dayton. Reverend Gay recognized Coleman, who at this time {{was the subject of a}} huge nationwide manhunt, and Coleman accosted Millard and Kathryn with guns. Reverend Gay asked Coleman, [...] "Why you want to do us like that, like this?", and according to Gay, Coleman responded: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> you, but we generally kill them where we go." [...] Coleman and Brown took their car and headed back toward Evanston, Illinois. Along the way, they stole another car in Indianapolis and killed its owner, 75-year-old Eugene Scott.|$|E
2500|$|Arkel tells Mélisande how he {{felt sorry}} for her when she first came to the castle [...] "with the strange, bewildered look of someone {{constantly}} awaiting a calamity." [...] But now that is going to change and Mélisande will [...] "open the door to a new era that I foresee." [...] He asks her to kiss him. [...] Golaud bursts in with blood on his forehead — he claims it was caused by a thorn hedge. When Mélisande tries to wipe the blood away, he angrily orders her not to touch him and demands his sword. He says that another peasant has died of starvation. Golaud notices Mélisande is trembling and tells her he is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her with the sword. He mocks the [...] "great innocence" [...] Arkel says he sees in Mélisande's eyes. He commands her to close them or [...] "I will shut them for a long time." [...] He tells Mélisande that she disgusts him and drags her around the room by her hair. When Golaud leaves, Arkel asks if he is drunk. Mélisande simply replies that he does not love her any more. Arkel comments: [...] "If I were God, I would have pity on the hearts of men." ...|$|E
5000|$|Laura Mennell {{was cast}} as worldly {{scientist}} Charlotte Cross (formerly Erin Reid) who uncovers a possible cure to the Troubles. Eric Balfour confirmed Emma Lahana's departure due to family emergency, leading to her character being written off, a fate that was revealed in [...] "Speak No Evil" [...] {{even though she}} was originally <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>killed.</b> Kris Lemche [...] and Jason Priestley returned to guest star. In addition, Adam [...] "Edge" [...] Copeland's real-life best friend (and former WWE tag team partner) Jay [...] "Christian" [...] Reso guest starred for one episode and is slated to appear in a couple more in the second half. William Shatner appeared {{in the second half of}} season 5 in a pivotal role that has the potential to forever impact the fate of the town of Haven and its troubled residents.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now all men," [...] he went on, [...] "look for a space {{upon this}} assegai that I hold up," [...] and {{he lifted the}} bangwan of the {{deceased}} Bombyane high above his head {{so that all the}} multitude could see it. Every eye was fixed upon the broad bright spear. For a while he held it still, then he moved it round and round in a circle, muttering as he did so, and still their gaze followed it. For my part, I watched his movements with the greatest anxiety. That assegai had already been nearer my person than I found at all pleasant, and I had no desire to make a further acquaintance with it. Nor, indeed, was I sure that Indaba-zimbi was <b>not</b> really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me. I could not understand his proceedings at all, and at the best I did not relish playing the corpus vile to his magical experiments.|$|R
500|$|Libby was <b>not</b> {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>killed</b> off, {{but since}} Ana Lucia Cortez {{was considered an}} unpopular character, the producers thought her death would not generate enough sympathy from fans. They decided [...] Libby, who was well liked, should also be killed for emotional impact. Additionally the producers and writers ran out of ideas for a compelling storyline for the character. According to Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof, the writers did try to develop her story through her romance with Hurley but {{they ran out of}} possible avenues for the character. The writers also thought her story was not as dramatic when juxtaposed with the other characters.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me?" [...] she moaned, {{turning up}} her ghastly face. [...] "I can't die. I'm afraid to die. It will hurt, and I've been wicked. Oh, you are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me, are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Godfrey {{handed it}} to him. [...] "You are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> anyone, Luka? If they attack us, of course we shall shoot them down in self-defence, but I would not have anyone killed in cold blood on any account." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Tartar {{shook his}} head. [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> anyone. I {{looked into the}} tent; the gun is leaning {{by the side of}} the chief. Women and {{children}} are lying all round. Couldn't get in. I will cut a slit in skin and take gun." ...|$|E
50|$|Later Liz {{realizes that}} {{she now has}} a power: to see the future. When she touches Max she has visions that she, Max, Isabel, and Michael are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die. Michael says that Max, Liz and Isabel should leave Roswell {{separately}} because the FBI knows {{who they are and}} their life in Roswell has to be over. Maria is upset by this because she doesn't want to be left in Roswell alone without Michael or Liz. Max proposes to Liz, making the choice to be with her even if they have only 12 days. Liz says yes. They all attend their graduation and when they realize this is where they are supposed to die from one of Liz's flashes they all escape into the desert. Now Max, Liz, Michael, Maria, Isabel and Kyle decide to leave together because even though Maria and Kyle were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>killed,</b> Kyle wants <b>to</b> be with his own kind when he develops his alien powers from Max's healing and Maria wants to be with Michael. They leave Roswell that night, and go together in a van, deciding to live life using their powers to do good deeds on the road. Liz sends her father her journal, continuing the truth about everything so he can understand why she left and finally know what has been going on in her life. Liz marries Max in a beautiful country church.|$|R
5000|$|But Double Take adds a {{contemporary}} twist: [...] "You {{think all the}} way through that cinema is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>killed</b> by television or television is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> cinema or America is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Russia or Russia is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> America. But at the end, it’s the third one, the new one, the younger one, the YouTube version, that comes along and kills them all." ...|$|R
500|$|Johnson {{realized}} {{after reading}} the script for the pilot episode that his character was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be around for {{the entirety of the}} series. This became even clearer when his character's storylines began to develop quickly. While filming [...] "Obscura", Johnson was informed that his character would not be returning as a series regular for season two. Initially fearing that he had made some mistake and that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> his character off, Johnson learned that Whitney would be enlisting into the Marines. The actor has expressed his pleasure in the way the writers handled Whitney's departure, by giving the character the exit of a hero.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Estelle, {{with her}} quiet yet childlike resolution, 'they are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> {{any of us}} yet. They said so. You are so tired, poor Victorine! Now all the hubbub is over, suppose you lie still and sleep. My uncle,' as he roamed round her, {{mourning}} for his rosary, 'I am afraid your beads are lost; but see here, these little round seeds, I can pierce them if you will gather some more for me, and make you another set. See, these will be the Aves, and here are shells in the grass for the Paters.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bonteen, in his troubled spirit, {{certainly}} did misbehave himself. Among his closer friends he declared very loudly that he didn't mean to stand it. He had not chosen to throw Mr. Gresham over at once, {{or to make}} difficulties at the moment;--but he would not continue to hold his present position or to support the Government without {{a seat in the}} Cabinet. Palliser had become quite useless,--so Mr. Bonteen said,--since his accession to the dukedom, and was quite unfit to deal with decimal coinage. It was a burden to kill any man, and he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> himself,--at any rate without the reward for which he had been working all his life, and to which he was fully entitled, namely, a seat in the Cabinet. Now there were Bonteenites in those days as well as Phineas Finnites. The latter tribe was for the most part feminine; but the former consisted of some half-dozen members of Parliament, who thought they saw their way in encouraging the forlorn hope of the unhappy financier.|$|E
50|$|Outside the inn, the Enforcer and Gnatius {{acquire a}} chariot and go after Hercules. Hercules {{introduces}} Iolaus to Nemesis, {{but he thinks}} because he can see her that she is there to kill him. Hercules explains that she is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him. On the road, Hercules meets a woman who fled from the inn when the fight broke out. She tells him a monster is killing people and is after Hercules.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1971, on The Dick Cavett Show, Capote {{referred}} to the book as his [...] "posthumous novel", explaining, [...] "either I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> it, or it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me".|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} want to punk me or just humiliate me. Perhaps they feel that I will not do {{anything}} about that. They are right about that.

But as soon as I am in Iraq, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try and <b>kill</b> as many of them as possible." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2005, he also feuded with {{democracy}} activist Martha Beatriz Roque, accusing her of collaborating with security forces to provide justification {{for a further}} crackdown. Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions {{he was allowed to}} travel abroad, Payá reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: [...] "I have been told that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>killed</b> before the regime is over but I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run away." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 100th episode, [...] "Ina Paha", Wo Fat abducts Steve and tortures him {{in order}} to try to learn where he {{believes}} the U.S. government is holding his father. During the torture, he tells Steve that Doris had adopted him from the streets after her op went bad and his mother was killed. Doris raised him for some time before she was forced by the CIA to abandon him. After a long fight, Steve kills Wo Fat. His last words were, [...] "You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me. Are you... Brother?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The Kingpin and Spider-Man {{face off}} and Fisk calls Peter a [...] "chump" [...] for {{believing in the}} greater good. Fisk's taunts enrage Spider-Man {{to the point of}} nearly killing Fisk. Spider-Man tells him that he is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him, but Peter Parker is. He {{continually}} tortures Fisk, until Fisk says that if he is going to kill him, he should do it now. Spider-Man says that he will not kill Fisk yet, but he will if May dies. He leaves the prison, and Fisk and all the inmates return to their cells.|$|E
50|$|Tony, angered at Anne for {{alerting}} the police, has her {{starting to}} dig her own grave. She argues that he's {{going to kill}} her anyway and refuses to dig anymore, pleading with Tony either to let her go or shoot her. He holds a knife up to her and lets her know that he is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her. He then pushes her to the ground; she realizes what he's going to do to her and begs him to stop, but he puts the knife up to her neck, he then cuts her shirt open and rapes her.|$|E
5000|$|When they surrendered, {{they feared}} the worst. Miller held out little hope for mercy. [...] "I {{thought they were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me," [...] he said.

6000|$|She stopped weeping, {{she made}} a great effort to control herself, {{and looked at me}} steadfastly for a moment.
