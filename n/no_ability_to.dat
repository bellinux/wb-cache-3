5|$|A {{challenge}} {{to all of}} these alternative scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, Mahakala, which they found to be the most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae, more primitive than Microraptor. Mahakala had short arms and <b>no</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> glide. Turner et al. also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, and these two points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, Mahakala suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent Dromaeosaurid finds recovered the Archaeopteryx-like Xiaotingia as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is <b>no</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E

5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, direct flight muscles, and <b>no</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs functioning as a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E

Our results showed that <b>NO’s</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> modulate cholinergic responses in ovalbuminsensitizedguinea pig trachea is lost.

Because of initial reports of NO acutely reducing the extent and velocity of shortening of isolated cardiomyocytes, especially following b-adrenergic stimulation, and because of increased activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS 2) in human cardiomyopathic myocardium, numerous reports and reviews have persistently and erroneously identified NO as dele-terious for contractile function of failing myocardium. 1 Shortly after these initial reports, a rosier picture of NO’s functional myo-cardial effects emerged, highlighting <b>NO’s</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> improve lef...|$|R

Because the outfalls were so short, however, the sewage simply washed back up onto the shoreline and resulted in the seafront being coated in a slick of effluent.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} PPCM {{begins with an}} unknown trigger (possibly a cardiotropic virus or other yet {{unidentified}} catalyst) that initiates an inflammatory process in the heart. Consequently, heart muscle cells are damaged; some die or become scar tissue. Scar tissue has <b>no</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> contract; therefore, {{the effectiveness of the}} pumping action of the heart is decreased. Also, damage to the cytoskeletal framework of the heart causes the heart to enlarge, stretch or alter in shape, also decreasing the heart's systolic function or output. The initial inflammatory process appears to cause an autoimmune or immune dysfunctional process, which in turn fuels the initial inflammatory process. Progressive loss of heart muscle cells leads to eventual heart failure.|$|E
