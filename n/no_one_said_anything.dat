2500|$|Immanuel Kant {{connected}} {{the motif of}} Isis's veil with his concept of the sublime, saying, [...] "Perhaps <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> more sublime, or expressed a thought more sublimely, than in that inscription on the temple of Isis (Mother Nature)." [...] According to Kant, the sublime evoked both wonder and terror, and these emotions appeared frequently {{in the works of}} late 18th and early 19th-century authors using the motif of the veil. The ecstatic nature of ancient mystery rites themselves contributed to the focus on emotions. Friedrich Schiller, for instance, wrote an essay on Egyptian and Jewish religion that mostly copied Reinhold's work, but he emphasized the emotional buildup that surrounded the mysteries. He said it prepared the initiate to confront the awe-inspiring power of nature at the climax of the rite. Similarly, a frontispiece by Henry Fuseli, made for Erasmus Darwin's poem The Temple of Nature in 1803, explicitly shows the unveiling of a statue of Isis as the climax of the initiation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{overthrow}} of the Shah of Iran in 1979 was a major setback for the policy. The Islamic regime of Iran severed relations with Israel, and its leaders such as Ruhollah Khomeini, Ali Khamenei and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have repeatedly called it an [...] "illegal entity" [...] and even advocate its destruction. Even so, according to author Trita Parsi, the doctrine led to questionable attempts by Israel to establish {{good relations with the}} avowidly anti-zionist Islamic Republic of Iran after the Islamic Revolution. Parsi quotes professor David Menashri of Tel Aviv University, [...] "Israel's foremost expert on Iran," [...] as saying, [...] "Throughout the 1980s, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> in Israel <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> about an Iranian threat—the word wasn't even uttered." ...|$|R

5000|$|Trita Parsi {{writes that}} Israel {{supplied}} Iran with {{arms and ammunition}} because it viewed Iraq as {{a danger to the}} peace process in the Middle East. Ariel Sharon believed it was important to [...] "leave a small window open" [...] to the possibility of good relations with Iran in the future. According to David Menashri of Tel Aviv University, a leading expert on Iran, [...] "Throughout the 1980s, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> in Israel <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> about an Iranian threat - the word wasn't even uttered." [...] Parsi explained in an interview with Diane Rehm that despite the anti-Israeli rhetoric publicly displayed by Iran, in actuality, the two nations secretly depended upon the support of one another to face the formidable opposition of both Iraq and the Soviet Union. He cites as evidence the fact that this relationship endured despite the ramped up rhetoric that was brought about by the Islamic Revolution in Iran, up until the collapse of the Soviet Union and destruction of the Iraqi military by the U.S. in the Persian Gulf War, both in 1991. Though he claims that Iran long used Israel as a means to create unified pan-Islamic, anti-Israel sentiment through which all the Muslim countries in the region could be unified under Iranian leadership, Israel and Iran, he argues, only truly began to see each other as strategic rivals after the threat of Soviet Union fell away, and after Iraq no longer could serve as a power check in the region.|$|R

5000|$|... "All {{the objects}} {{that are on the}} market are stolen, period," [...] said Denny Pinkus, an antiquities dealer with a store in the 4,000-year-old Mediterranean port city of Jaffa. Pinkus was the first antiquities dealer in Israel to be {{licensed}} by the Antiquities Authority (license No. 0001), and is recommended by the Ministry of Tourism. Objects on sale at an authorized dealer should have a registration number, and customers {{should be able to get}} certificates of authenticity. There are numerous dealers in Israel, who are required to register with the Israel Antiquities Authority and keep an inventory of the artifacts they have for sale. While dealers have to keep an inventory of everything they sell, those inventories are often kept vague. A listing that says that a dealer owns a pot dated to the Bronze Age doesn’t mean very much, since many pots of that era will be in their shop. [...] A tourist who buys an artifact will get a certificate of authenticity but will often forget an export permit. Many people are unaware that they are supposed to ask for an export permit, and the law does not require the sellers to offer the buyer an export permit. Without the export permit the sale isn’t officially registered and the dealer can take the registry number and use it on a new, and often looted, antiquity. Since the inventory descriptions are kept vague it isn’t hard to find an artifact that looks similar to the one that was just sold. Material that was looted as recently as a week ago could illegally enter the legal market through an exchange of registry numbers. The tourist could, of course, be caught trying to take the antiquity out of the country without a permit. But even if they are, it’s hard to fault the dealer. After all they are under no obligation to let tourists know that they need an export permit. Dealers claim that most of their antiquities come from private collections and are purchased legally. By legal they mean from collections that were completed before 1978 when it was still legal to excavate on private property and collect artifacts. It is difficult to prove otherwise because it would take a large amount of resources to investigate the source of antiquities. [...] “I have a license in my window dated to 2001, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has ever <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> and I am not changing it until the inspector makes me” (Dealer 28). Dealers speak of a disjunction between the renewal of a license, the backlog of processing at the IAA, and the opening of antiquities shops in the Old City. “I try to capitalize on the Christmas rush of tourists. If I have to shut because the IAA hasn’t renewed my license I can lose valuable revenue. I stay open, even if I haven’t received the official license, I know it will be months before an inspector checks and by that time I will have my license. It works every year and I know that everyone does it. If everyone else were open why would you close?” ...|$|R

Harvey bade Dan take care of Uncle Salters's sea-boots and Penn's dory-anchor, and Long Jack entreated Harvey to remember his lessons in seamanship; but the jokes fell flat {{in the presence of}} the two women, and it is hard to be funny with green harbour-water widening between good friends.|$|E
