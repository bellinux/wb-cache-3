40|$|Key points: Desensitization and {{inactivation}} {{provide a}} form of short-term memory controlling the firing patterns of excitable cells and adaptation in sensory systems. Unlike many of their cousin K+ channels, cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are thought not to desensitize or inactivate. Here we report that CNG channels do inactivate and that inactivation is controlled by extracellular protons. Titration of a glutamate residue within the selectivity filter destabilizes the pore architecture, which collapses towards a <b>non-conductive,</b> inactivated <b>state</b> in a process reminiscent of the usual C-type inactivation observed in many K+ channels. These results indicate that inactivation in CNG channels represents a regulatory mechanism that has been neglected thus far, with possible implications in several physiological processes ranging from signal transduction to growth cone navigation. Ion channels control ionic fluxes across biological membranes by residing in any of three functionally distinct states: deactivated (closed), activated (open) or inactivated (closed). Unlike many of their cousin K+ channels, cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels do not desensitize or inactivate. Using patch recording techniques, we show that when extracellular pH (pHo) is decreased from 7. 4 to 6 or lower, wild-type CNGA 1 channels inactivate in a voltage-dependent manner. pHo titration experiments show that at pHo < 7 the I-V relationships are outwardly rectifying and that inactivation is coupled to current rectification. Single-channel recordings indicate that a fast mechanism of proton blockage underlines current rectification while inactivation arises from conformational changes downstream from protonation. Furthermore, mutagenesis and ionic substitution experiments highlight {{the role of the}} selectivity filter in current decline, suggesting analogies with the C-type inactivation observed in K+ channels. Analysis with Markovian models indicates that the non-independent binding of two protons within the transmembrane electrical field explains both the voltage-dependent blockage and the inactivation. Low pH, by inhibiting the CNGA 1 channels in a state-dependent manner, may represent an unrecognized endogenous signal regulating CNG physiological functions in diverse tissues...|$|R
40|$|Extended {{electron}} {{states in}} insulating oxide layers on Si and high-mobility semiconductors The electron energy band spectrum is of prime importance {{when attempting to}} engineer insulating stacks for application in metal-oxide semiconductor structures for practical applications. In particular, transition from traditional silicon to semiconductors with higher mobility (Ge, GaAs, InGaAs, InP, graphene…) poses significant challenges in terms of interface band alignment characterization as neither the role of interface dipoles nor the energy bands associated with hardly avoidable inter-layers are known at present. Moreover, scaling the insulating layers down to a thickness of a few nanometers requires understanding of general trends in the interaction of electron states originating from atoms of different sort forming a complex oxide. The investigation of these complex interfaces requires separate characterization of the density of states close {{to the edges of}} the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB), respectively. Experimentally, the latter can be achieved by studying Internal PhotoEmission (IPE) of electrons and holes from a known semiconductor crystal. In this way, the IPE spectroscopy is expected to deliver fundamental information on the development of electron bands in the insulating nano-layers grown on the surfaces of high-mobility semiconductors and, very desirably, may indicate possible ways to optimize them. The study of semiconductor interfaces requires samples of highest quality fabricated using the state-of-the-art microelectronics technology. Nowadays, two groups of materials promise gains over silicon technology sufficient to justify such technological efforts. These are the group IV semiconductors (SiGe, Ge, graphene) and narrow-gap AIIIBV alloys (GaAs, InGaAs, InP, InAs). The CB/VB offset energies and the corresponding interface band offsets are of crucial technological importance because they determine the energy barriers the charge carriers encounter at the interfaces and, in turn, the ultimate insulating performance of the semiconductor/oxide stack. The physical origin of the interface barriers include several components like bulk electron spectrum of contacting solids, the electron density of states in the interlayer(s), the interface charges and dipoles. Establishing the relative importance of the indicated factors represents the major fundamental issue to be addressed in the work. Another type of semiconductor materials emerging as areas of important innovations are the narrow-gap metal oxides like NiO and VO 2, which poses unique electronic and optical properties. The bandgap of these materials is determined by the spin-correlated electron states which enables IPE analysis of the spin-related features in the electron density of states. For instance, the metal-insulator (Mott) transition in VO 2 is observed at T= 68 °C which allows direct monitoring of the valence states evolution by electron photoemission into insulating layer (SiO 2 or Al 2 O 3). These experiments are may shed light at the fundamental mechanisms of interface barrier formation. It is currently planned to conduct the band offset determination by IPE at the interfaces of semiconductors of the mentioned types with most widely applied oxide insulators (Al 2 O 3, HfO 2, ZrO 2) as a function of surface treatment, crystallographic orientation, and interface doping with foreign atoms. These oxide insulators were extensively characterized in the past on Si surfaces that allows meaningful comparison. This research is planned in extensive international collaboration network that includes IMEC (Belgium), MDM Laboratories (Italy), Tyndall Microelectronics Center (Ireland), as well as other research establishments. Working plan: Year 1. In the first year it is planned to concentrate the analysis of interfaces of GaAs and InP with various oxides. By varying semiconductor composition and crystallographic orientation of its surface one can estimate the importance of composition-sensitive interface dipoles as compared to the contribution of bulk electron bands and interlayers. At the moment, two batches of samples on InP and GaAs with different surface orientation and treatment are fabricated using Al 2 O 3 deposition and are being in the process of IPE measurements. Year 2. In the second year the impact of interface doping with foreign atoms on the band alignment will be studied. The systems to be analyzed are the interfaces of different insulating oxides with Ge, GaAs or GaAs interfaces. Again, the possibility of interface dipole formation will be in the focus of the investigation. Year 3. In the third year, the analysis of various metal oxides (NiOx, TiOx, VOx) is planned with as major goal gaining fundamental understanding of the electronic structure in the <b>non-conductive</b> and conductive <b>states.</b> The influence of the oxide composition on the band energies will also be addressed aiming at possible chemical identification of the major factors affecting electrical behavior of the oxides. Year 4. Based on the systematic analysis of the obtained results, further exploration of electronic structure of materials will be conducted. The work can be extended to other materials like graphene provided reproducible technology of its growth on insulating substrates will become available. Preparation of the PhD thesis is planned for {{the second half of the}} year.

40|$|Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) is a light-gated cation {{selective}} channel {{from the}} unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which {{is involved in}} phototaxis and photophobic responses. As other rhodopsins, ChR 2 comprises a seven-transmembrane helix (TMH) motif and a retinal as the light-sensitive chromophore. The chromophore is covalently attached via a protonated Schiff base to the conserved lysine residue Lys 257 located in TMH 7. Based on its primary sequence and the all-trans configuration of the retinal in the ground state, ChR 2 is assigned to the type I rhodopsins, {{also referred to as}} microbial-type rhodopsins. Upon light activation, the retinal isomerizes from the all-trans to the 13 -cis form. This photoisomerization, which is accompanied by conformational changes of the protein, eventually leads to the opening of the channel and cation translocation. Cation flux during the conductive state leads to depolarization of the cell membrane and subsequent triggering of action potentials when expressed in neurons. Therefore, ChR 2 has become the most versatile optogenetic tool, enabling a non-invasive investigation of neural circuits at high spatial and temporal resolution. With the rapidly increasing importance of ChR 2 as a tool in neurobiology and cell biology, structural information is the prerequisite to an unambiguous understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this unique light-activated ion channel. The coupling between isomerization and structural alterations is well understood for other microbial-type rhodopsins, like bacteriorhodopsin (bR), halorhodopsin (HR) and sensory rhodopsin II (SRII). In case of ChR 2, the first data on light-induced conformational changes came from spectroscopic studies and structural information is still missing. However, in order to fully understand the mechanism of light transduction by ChR 2, it is necessary to determine the changes in the protein structure at specific steps in the photocycle. By the time I started my PhD thesis, there was no structural information of ChR 2 available. Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to obtain structural information of the transmembrane domain containing the first 315 amino acids of ChR 2 by cryo electron crystallography. Besides revealing the structure of membrane proteins, cryo-EM of two-dimensional (2 D) crystals is ideal for investigating conformational changes in membrane proteins induced by different stimuli. Therefore, the second objective of my thesis was the investigation of light-induced conformational changes in the slow C 128 T ChR 2 mutant. The 1, 000 times longer lifetime of the open state of the C 128 T mutant compared to the wild-type allowed to trap different intermediates that accumulate during the photocycle. In 2012, the X-ray structure of a channelrhodopsin- 1 /channelrhodopsin- 2 chimaera (C 1 C 2) at 2. 3 Å resolution in the closed dark-adapted state was published (Kato et al., 2012). The structure revealed the essential molecular architecture of C 1 C 2, including the retinal-binding pocket and the putative cation conduction pathway. Together with biochemical, spectroscopic, mutagenesis experiments, and the high-resolution model, some functionally important residues of ChR 2 have been identified. However, unambiguous explanation of the molecular determinants that contribute to activation (gating) and transport were still mostly unknown. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The first half of my theses dealt with 2 D crystallization of ChR 2. I succeeded in obtaining 2 D crystals of ChR 2 of four different types, which differed in size, crystal packing, crystal contacts and resolution, yielding structure factors up to 6 Å resolution. The crystals were grown by reconstituting the protein with different lipids at various lipid-to-protein ratios. The best crystals formed with the synthetic lipid DMPC and EPL upon detergent removal by dialysis. The projection maps calculated from these crystals revealed the overall structure of C 128 T ChR 2 at 6 Å resolution and were published in 2011 (Müller et al., 2011). Surprisingly, ChR 2 was found to be a dimer in all crystal types. The ChR 2 dimer was stable both in detergent solution and in the presence of lipids for 2 D crystallization. The monomers clearly showed the expected densities for the seven TMHs. The arrangement of the ChR 2 dimers on the four 2 D lattices was different. However, comparison of the individual rojection maps revealed no significant differences within the ChR 2 interface in the four crystal forms. The observation that the structure of the dimer was the same in all four crystal forms and in different lipids suggested strong specific contacts between the two protomers and implied that the protein was also dimeric in the native membrane. These findings were in agreement with Western blot analysis of plasma membranes from oocytes expressing ChR 2 and laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption mass spectrometry, which both showed ChR 2 as a dimer. The unusual stability of the ChR 2 dimer contrasts with other microbial rhodopsins, which exist in different oligomeric states, i. e. monomers, trimers or dimers. These observations raised the question whether the functional unit is the monomer or the dimer. The comparison of the projection map of the light-driven proton pump bR at the same resolution showed similar overall dimensions. Based on this comparison, the densities which became evident in the ChR 2 projection maps could be assigned to the corresponding seven densities in bR. The shape of the densities near the dimer interface suggested that TMHs 2, 3, and 4 are oriented more or less perpendicular to the membrane plane, while the other four helices appear to be more tilted, as in bR. Based on the high-resolution bR structure and the projection structures obtained, I have built a homology model. On the basis of this homology model, several residues found in the dimer interface were selected for mutational studies in order to disrupt the dimer interface. The investigation of light-induced conformational changes in C 128 T ChR 2 was the second part of my thesis. I designed an experimental setup for trapping light-induced conformational changes in C 128 T ChR 2. In addition, I optimized the sample preparation {{in a way that the}} different illumination conditions did not alter the quality of the crystals. I have trapped two different functional states, namely the conductive open <b>state</b> and the <b>non-conductive</b> closed dark-adapted <b>state.</b> In order to visualize the location and the extent of conformational changes, projection difference maps were calculated between the open and the closed state. Visual inspection of the difference maps between the open and the two closed states revealed three difference peaks that map to the TMHs 2, 6, and 7, indicating significant and specific rearrangements of these helices. The strong pair of positive/negative peaks at TMH 6 suggests an outward tilt movement of approximately 2 Å. Close comparison of similar work on bR revealed that this movement is likely to occur at the cytoplasmic end of TMH 6. A second highly significant negative peak is observed at TMH 7, indicating a less pronounced tilt compared to TMH 6. The third negative peak at TMH 2 indicates a loss of density in this region. No significant differences were recorded at the TMH 1, 5 and at the dimer interface formed by TMH 3 and 4. I succeeded in trapping and characterizing the open and closed state in the photocycle of ChR 2 and could demonstrate that the transition from the closed to the open state is linked to significant light-induced tilt movements of TMH 6 and 7, plus a loss of order in TMH 2. These conformational changes are likely to create a large water-filled conducting pore, which seems to be required for the conductance of up to 2, 000 ions per photocycle. The previously mentioned spectroscopic studies support the difference structures I obtained. This approach sets the stage for studying structural changes accompanying the formation and decay of other photocycle intermediates in ChR 2. Future studies will aim at three-dimensional maps of the open and closed state at higher resolution...|$|R

Although KcsA contains only a pore domain, without voltage-sensing machinery, it has the structural elements necessary for ion conduction, activation and inactivation 1 – 7.

The conductive coating consisted of a double helix backbone structure of polyaniline wrapped with an esterified polyacrylic acid strand.

The polymer is soluble in single organic solvents and was sprayed onto square AA 7075 -T 6 and AA 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy samples. ^ The coatings were investigated for corrosion protection properties using cyclic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and long term exposure in aggressive salt environments. The polymer coated samples were tested against two commercial chromate conversion coatings and uncoated alloy samples. The cyclic polarization tests show a two order of magnitude lowering of the corrosion current over the uncoated samples, a one order of magnitude lowering of I corr over {{the second type of}} chromate coating and a one order of magnitude higher I corr over the first type of chromate coating. Impedance results show a two order of magnitude higher impedance at low frequencies over the uncoated and equivalent performance for both types of chromate coatings. ^ EIS and cyclic polarization tests of the conductive state (green colored) versus a <b>non-conductive</b> <b>state</b> (blue colored) of the polymer coating shows that the electrically conductive state is more effective than the insulating state for corrosion protection.
