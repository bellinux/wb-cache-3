5|$|On 6 November 2014 Rudd {{was charged}} with {{attempting}} to procure a murder, threatening to kill, possession of methamphetamine and possession of cannabis, following a police raid on his home. The charge of attempting to procure a murder was withdrawn the following day, but the other charges remained. AC/DC released a statement clarifying that the tour promoting Rock or Bust would continue, but did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> or not Rudd would participate, or {{if he was still}} a member of the band.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Bede was sent, as a puer oblatus, to {{the monastery}} of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith. Bede does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> it was already {{intended}} {{at that point that}} he would be a monk. It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out as an oblate; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England. Monkwearmouth's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year. The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church. In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The Life of Ceolfrith, written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14.|$|E

However, in 2006, they announced new intentions to substantially alter their copper phone network {{and set up a}} Fibre to the Node (FTTN)network. This was later scrapped, with Telstra citing regulations forcing it to provide cheap wholesale access to its competitors as the reason not to invest in upgrading their network.|$|E

25|$|Eventually Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep {{the mouse}} reach the world's end, where Aslan {{appears as a}} lamb before {{transforming}} into a lion (a scene that refers to John 21:12, where Jesus appears after his resurrection and makes a breakfast of fish for his disciples). He shows Reepicheep {{the way to his}} country and helps the children return home. He tells Edmund and Lucy that, like Peter and Susan, they have become too old to return to Narnia, and that they must instead come to know him in their world—a relatively direct reference to the Christian theme of the series. He does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> Eustace will return to Narnia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the march, {{thousands}} of British troops were flown to Northern Ireland. Less than twelve hours before the Sunday 6 July march, the authorities still did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> it would be blocked. Then, at 3:30am that morning, 1500 police and soldiers swept into the nationalist area in armoured vehicles and took control of the Garvaghy Road. About 100 residents managed to get to the road and stage a sit-down protest. They were forcefully removed by the police, who were then pelted with stones and petrol bombs as they pushed residents further back from the road. Rosemary Nelson—a prominent human rights lawyer and the GRRC's legal advisor—was physically and verbally abused by police officers. From this point onward, residents were prevented from leaving their housing estates and accessing the Garvaghy Road. As residents were also unable to reach the Catholic , the local priests held an open-air mass in front of a line of soldiers and armoured personnel carriers.|$|E

The 1942 International Motion Picture Almanac claims Lee appeared in The Tunnel (for Gaumont-British), Secret Agent (for Gaumont-British) and The Terror (for Alliance); this last is almost certainly the 1940 U.S. release of the 1938 British film listed above.|$|E
500|$|Coenred was tonsured in Rome, whence he was {{accompanied}} by Offa, son of Sighere, king of the East Saxons, and became a monk [...] "at {{the threshold of the}} apostles" [...] as Bede had it; he stayed in Rome until his death, the date of which is unknown. [...] He is not recorded as having a wife or children. The Evesham Chronicle kept at Evesham Abbey, however, claim that he was an ancestor of Wigstan. They do <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> this was through Wigstan's father, Wigmund, son of Wiglaf of Mercia, or through his mother, Ælfflæd, daughter of Ceolwulf I of Mercia.|$|E
500|$|Æthelred {{was the son}} of Penda of Mercia. [...] Penda's queen, Cynewise, {{is named}} by Bede, who does not mention her children; no other wives of Penda are known and so it is likely but not certain that she was Æthelred's mother. [...] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle gives Penda's age as fifty in 626, and credits him with a thirty-year reign, but this would put Penda at eighty {{years old at the time}} of his death, which is {{generally}} thought unlikely as two of his sons (Wulfhere and Æthelred) were young when he was killed. [...] At least as likely is that Penda was fifty years old at his death, rather than at his accession. [...] Æthelred's date of birth is unknown, but Bede describes Wulfhere as a youth at the time of his accession in 658, so it is likely he and Æthelred were in their middle teens at that time. [...] The early sources do <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> Æthelred was older or younger than Wulfhere.|$|E
