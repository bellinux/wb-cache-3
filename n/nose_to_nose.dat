2500|$|Silver salts have {{antiseptic}} properties. In 1881 Credé {{introduced the}} use of dilute solutions of AgNO3 in newborn babies' eyes at birth to prevent contraction of gonorrhea from the mother, which could cause blindness. (Modern antibiotics are now used instead.) Fused silver nitrate, shaped into sticks, was traditionally called [...] "lunar caustic".

General Sir James Abbott noted in his journals that in India in 1827 it was infused by a British surgeon into wounds in his arm resulting from the bite of a mad dog to cauterize the wounds and prevent the onset of rabies. Dentists sometimes use silver nitrate infused swabs to heal oral ulcers. Silver nitrate is also used by some podiatrists to kill cells located in the nail bed.

50|$|The {{absence of}} turrets and gunners in most European Theater P-61s {{presented}} several unique challenges. The 422nd NFS kept its radar operator {{in the rear}} compartment, meaning the pilot had no visual contact with the operator. As a result, several pilots continued flying their critically damaged P-61s under the mistaken belief that their radar operator was injured and unconscious, when in fact he had already bailed out. The 425th night fighter squadron moved the radar operator to the gunner's position behind the pilot. This provided an extra set of eyes up front and moved the aircraft's center of gravity about 15 in (38 cm) forward, changing the flight characteristics from slightly <b>nose</b> up <b>to</b> slightly <b>nose</b> down which improved the P-61's overall performance.|$|R

[...] Availing himself of the respite which the inactivity of the French and the weakness of the Genoese allowed, he prosecuted his plans of civilising the people.

His own importance he never affected to undervalue.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} anthropometric parameters of lip - nose complex in 11 - 17 years old males in Mashhad using photographic analysis.   Materials and Methods: Number of 357 Fars boys (11 - 17 years old), residence in Mashhad were included in this study. They were all class. I. Some frontal and lateral photographs of natural head position were taken by a digital camera. After landmark determination, anthropometric parameters including alar width, mouth width, nose height, cupid arch width, vertical height of lips, columellar width, nasolabial angle and nasal root slope angle were determined by Smile Analyzer software while Kruskal – Wallis test was used for data analyses. Results: This study revealed that alar width, nasal height and mouth width were increasing gradually within 11 to 16 years of age. But <b>nose</b> height <b>to</b> <b>nose</b> width proportion did not show any significant differences in different age groups (P= 0. 097). Nasolabial angle in different age groups had no significant statistical differences and it was between 95. 83 and 100. 05 (P= 0. 315). However for Cph-Cph, the distance was decreasing first and then increasing with no significant differences among age groups. Conclusion: Except significant differences observed in different age groups about nasolabial angle and nasal index, there were not any other significant differences for other anthropometric parameters. It could be helpful in orthodontic and surgical treatment planning. ...|$|R

6000|$|In {{due time}} the Colonel {{and his staff}} arrived at Newcome, and resumed the active canvass which they had {{commenced}} some months previously. Clive was not in his father's suite this time, nor Mr. Warrington, whose engagements took him elsewhere. The lawyer, {{the editor of the}} Independent, and F. B., were the Colonel's chief men. His headquarters (which F. B. liked very well) were at the hotel where we last saw him, and whence issuing with his aide-de-camp at his heels, the Colonel went round to canvass personally, according to his promise, every free and independent elector of the borough. Barnes too was canvassing eagerly on his side, and was most affable and active; the two parties would often meet <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>nose</b> in the same street, and their retainers exchange looks of defiance. With Mr. Potts of the Independent, a big man, on his left; with Mr. Frederick, a still bigger man, on his right; his own trusty bamboo cane in his hand, before which poor Barnes had shrunk abashed ere now, Colonel Newcome had commonly the best of these street encounters, and frowned his nephew Barnes, and Barnes's staff, off the pavement. With the non-electors the Colonel was a decided favourite; the boys invariably hurrayed him; whereas they jeered and uttered ironical cries after poor Barnes, asking, [...] "Who beat his wife? Who drove his children to the workhouse?" [...] and other unkind personal questions. The man upon whom the libertine Barnes had inflicted so cruel an injury in his early days, was now the Baronet's bitterest enemy. He assailed him with curses and threats when they met, and leagued his brother-workmen against him. The wretched Sir Barnes owned with contrition that the sins of his youth pursued him; his enemy scoffed at the idea of Barnes's repentance; he was not moved at the grief, the punishment in his own family, the humiliation and remorse which the repentant prodigal piteously pleaded. No man was louder in his cries of mea culpa than Barnes: no man professed a more edifying repentance. He was hat in hand to every black-coat, established or dissenting. Repentance was to his interest, to be sure, but yet let us hope it was sincere. There is some hypocrisy, of which one does not like even to entertain the thought; especially that awful falsehood which trades with divine truth, and takes the name of Heaven in vain.|$|E
6000|$|Goodwood hung back; he had {{no desire}} to make his journey to Rome in Miss Stackpole's company. His {{indifference}} to this advantage was not of the same character as Gilbert Osmond's, but it had at this moment an equal distinctness. It was rather a tribute to Miss Stackpole's virtues than a reference to her faults. He thought her very remarkable, very brilliant, and he had, in theory, no objection to the class to which she belonged. Lady correspondents appeared to him a part of the natural scheme of things in a progressive country, and though he never read their letters he supposed that they ministered somehow to social prosperity. But it was this very eminence of their position that made him wish Miss Stackpole didn't take so much for granted. She took for granted that he was always ready for some allusion to Mrs. Osmond; she had done so when they met in Paris, six weeks after his arrival in Europe, and she had repeated the assumption with every successive opportunity. He had no wish whatever to allude to Mrs. Osmond; he was NOT always thinking of her; he was perfectly sure of that. He was the most reserved, the least colloquial of men, and this enquiring authoress was constantly flashing her lantern into the quiet darkness of his soul. He wished she didn't care so much; he even wished, though it might seem rather brutal of him, that she would leave him alone. In spite of this, however, he just now made other reflections--which show how widely different, in effect, his ill-humour was from Gilbert Osmond's. He desired to go immediately to Rome; {{he would have liked to}} go alone, in the night-train. He hated the European railway-carriages, in which one sat for hours in a vise, knee to knee and <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>nose</b> with a foreigner to whom one presently found one's self objecting with all the added vehemence of one's wish to have the window open; and if they were worse at night even than by day, at least at night one could sleep and dream of an American saloon-car. But he couldn't take a night-train when Miss Stackpole was starting in the morning; it struck him that this would be an insult to an unprotected woman. Nor could he wait until after she had gone unless he should wait longer than he had patience for. It wouldn't do to start the next day. She worried him; she oppressed him; the idea of spending the day in a European railway-carriage with her offered a complication of irritations. Still, she was a lady travelling alone; it was his duty to put himself out for her. There could be no two questions about that; it was a perfectly clear necessity. He looked extremely grave for some moments and then said, wholly without the flourish of gallantry but in a tone of extreme distinctness, [...] "Of course if you're going to-morrow I'll go too, as I may be of assistance to you." ...|$|E
