All Lebanese are obliged by law to carry their identity cards with them at all times and are subject to fines should they not.

25|$|The TCAs {{were used}} in the past in the {{clinical}} treatment of ADHD, though they are not typically used anymore, having been replaced by more effective agents with fewer side effects such as atomoxetine (Strattera, Tomoxetin, Attentin) and stimulants like methylphenidate (Ritalin, Focalin, Concerta), and amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine, Vyvanse). ADHD is thought to be caused by an insufficiency of dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Most of the TCAs inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, though not dopamine, and as a result, they show some efficacy in remedying the disorder. Notably, the TCAs are more effective in treating the behavioral aspects of ADHD than the cognitive deficits, as they help limit hyperactivity and impulsivity, but have little to <b>no</b> <b>benefits</b> on attention.|$|E

25|$|Color performance: There are {{multiple}} terms to describe {{different aspects of}} color performance of a display. Color gamut is the range of colors that can be displayed, and color depth, which is the fineness with which the color range is divided. Color gamut is a relatively straight forward feature, but it is rarely discussed in marketing materials except at the professional level. Having a color range that exceeds the content being shown on the screen has <b>no</b> <b>benefits,</b> so displays are only made to perform within or below the range of a certain specification. There are additional aspects to LCD color and color management, such as white point and gamma correction, which describe what color white is and how the other colors are displayed relative to white.|$|E

Lease drivers receive <b>no</b> <b>benefits</b> from the taxicab company, and often have to bribe dispatchers to get a shift. However, in some cases, cabs can also be owned by separately-incorporated small businesses that subscribe to a dispatch service, {{in which case the}} company logo on the door is that of the dispatch association.

500|$|Bede's {{account of}} the {{conversion}} is oft-cited. After Paulinus explains the tenets of Christianity, the king asks his counselors {{what they think of}} the new doctrine.

Then, an unnamed counselor stands up and addresses the king, also seeing the benefit of the new faith. Coifi speaks again and announces that they should destroy the idols and temples they had hitherto worshiped. King Edwin agrees and embraces Christianity; Coifi himself will set fire to the idols. declaring [...] "I will do this myself, for now that the true God has granted me knowledge, who more suitably than I can set a public example, and destroy the idols that I worshipped in ignorance?” Bede goes on to describe the scene as Cofi [...] "formally renounces his superstitions, and asked the king to give him arms and a stallion." [...] Armed with both a sword and spear, Cofi rides Edwin’s horse towards the idols, all within view of the crowd gathered to witness Edwin’s conversion. Upon reaching the temple, Cofi [...] "cast a spear into it and profaned it." ...|$|E
