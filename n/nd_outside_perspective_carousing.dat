5000|$|He {{works on}} {{philosophy}} {{of mind and}} {{is best known for}} inventing the explanatory gap argument [...] (cited over 1000 times on Google Scholar) and author of popular and academic philosophy books. The idea is that an unbridgeable gap exists when trying to comprehend consciousness from the perspective of natural science as a scientific explanation of mental states would require a reduction from a physical process to phenomenal experience. The property of mental states to be experienced from a subjective point of view (see Qualia) might not be reducible from the objective, i.e. <b>outside</b> <b>perspective</b> of science. In this sense there would be a gap between the <b>outside</b> <b>perspective</b> of science and the internal perspective of phenomenal experience.|$|R

40|$|Are {{there any}} {{coherent}} and defensible alternatives to liberal democracy? The author examines {{the possibility that}} a reformed democratic centralism—the principle around which China’s cur-rent polity is officially organized—might be legitimate, according to both an inside and an out-side perspective. The inside perspective builds on contemporary Chinese political theory; the <b>outside</b> <b>perspective</b> critically deploys Rawls’s notion of a “decent society ” as its standard. Along the way, the author pays particular attention to the kinds and degree of pluralism a decent society can countenance, and to the specific institutions in China that might enable the realization of a genuine and/or decent democratic centralism. The author argues that by considering both inside and <b>outside</b> <b>perspectives,</b> and the degrees to which they inter-penetrate and critically inform one another, we can engage in a global philosophy that neither pre-judges alternative political traditions nor falls prey to false conceptual barriers...|$|R

As a consequence, the email distribution grew organically and became Joyo Indonesia News. Gordon adopted an alias of Joyo, derived from Joyoboyo, a Javanese poet. The newswire was part of Internet activism in Indonesia that contributed to civil activism and a student movement that ultimately toppled down Suharto in 1998.|$|R

40|$|Workplace {{bullying}} {{is increasingly}} being {{recognized as a}} serious problem in society today; {{it is also a}} problem that can be difficult to define and evaluate accurately. Research in this area has been hampered by lack of appropriate measurement techniques. Social scientists can play a key part in tackling the phenomenon of workplace bullying by developing and applying a range of research methods to capture its nature and incidence in a range of contexts. We review current methods of research into the phenomenon of bullying in the workplace. We examine definitional issues, including the type, frequency, and duration of bullying acts, and consider the role of values and norms of the workplace culture in influencing perception and measurement of bullying behavior. We distinguish methods that focus on: (a) inside perspectives on the experience of bullying (including questionnaires and surveys, self-report through diary-keeping, personal accounts through interviews, focus groups and critical incident technique, and projective techniques such as bubble dialogue); (b) <b>outside</b> <b>perspectives</b> (including observational methods and peer nominations); (c) multi-method approaches that integrate both inside and <b>outside</b> <b>perspectives</b> (including case studies). We suggest that multi-method approaches may offer a useful way forward for researchers and for practitioners anxious to assess and tackle the problem of bullying in their organizations.
