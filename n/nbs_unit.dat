30|$|Recent {{development}} in {{wind farm control}} has enhanced the integration of wind power into power system. However, the risk of power system blackouts is also increased due to the volatility and uncertain nature of wind power generation. There has not been much research on the potential restoration function of wind farms in power systems. Since the starting time of wind turbines is shorter than non-black-start (NBS) generating units, some wind farms {{have the potential to}} function as black-start power sources in certain circumstances. The firefly optimization algorithm is used in [72] to find the optimal final sequence of <b>NBS</b> <b>unit</b> restoration, the optimal transmission path, and the optimal load pick up sequence with and without integration of wind farms in the system. Ref. [73] introduces a hybrid black-start unit containing combustion gas turbine, wind farm and static synchronous compensator and a three-level control model to achieve comprehensive functionality. A control scheme can allow variable speed wind turbines to participate effectively in system frequency and voltage regulation as Ref. [73] describes. When wind farms with adequate energy storage can be guided by suitable control strategy, they will be a great help to power system restoration.|$|E
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{have shown a}} decrease of growth and calcification of organisms at decreased pH levels but relatively few {{studies have focused on}} early life stages which are believed to be more sensitive to environmental disturbances such as hypercapnia. Here, we present experimental data demonstrating that the growth of planktonic mussel (Mytilus edulis) larvae is significantly affected by a decrease of pH to a level expected {{for the end of the}} century. Even though there was no significant effect of a 0. 25 – 0. 34 pH unit decrease on hatching and mortality rates during the first 2 days of development nor during the following 13 -day period prior to settlement, final shells were, respectively, 4. 5 ± 1. 3 and 6. 0 ± 2. 3 % smaller at pH NBS ~ 7. 8 than at a control pH NBS of ~ 8. 1. Moreover, a decrease of 12. 0 ± 5. 4 % of shell thickness was observed. More severe impacts were found with a decrease of ~ 0. 5 pH <b>NBS</b> <b>unit</b> during the first 2 days of development which could be attributed to a decrease of calcification due toslight undersaturation of seawater with respect to aragonite. Indeed, important effects on both hatching and D-veliger shell growth were found. Hatching rates were 24 ± 4 % lower while D-veliger shells were 12. 7 ± 0. 9 % smaller at pH NBS ~ 7. 6 than at a control pH NBS of ~ 8. 1. Although these results show that blue mussel larvae are still able to develop a shell in seawater undersaturated with respect to aragonite, decreases of hatching rates and shell growth suggest a negative impact of ocean acidification on the future survival of bivalve populations potentially leading to significant ecological and economical losses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. After {{installation}} of ferritic steel tiles (FSTs), fast ion losses due to toroidal field ripple {{have been reduced}} by 1 / 2 ~ 1 / 3. The increase in absorbed power at same injection power can reduce the required number of <b>NB</b> <b>units</b> to sustain a given βN, resulting in a better flexibility of torque input by increasing the available combination of tangential <b>NB</b> <b>units.</b> By making use of these advantages to sustain an internal transport barrier (ITB), the performance of long-pulse ELMy H-mode plasmas was improved in terms of sustained duration time for both high normalized beta (βN) and high thermal confinement enhancement factor (HH 98 (y, 2)). High βN> 2. 3 together with HH 98 (y, 2) ~ 1 was sustained for 23. 1 s (~ 12 τR) at q 95 ~ 3. 3, which also provide high βN·HH 98 (y, 2) ≥ 2. 2 and a bootstrap current fraction of 36 %- 45 %. βN·HH 98 (y, 2) of 2. 0 was sustained for 28. 6 s, which {{is limited by the}} maximum injection period of 30 s for NBI system. These long-pulse plasmas are possible candidates for ITER hybrid operation scenario. Improved confinement is characterized by the larger thermal components at a given density maintained by smaller heating power than in previous experiments. The strength of the ITB depends on the pedestal temperature, which varies with edge density while keeping constant the pressure (limited by type I ELMs). These long-pulse plasmas indicate that further investigation to establish high performance plasmas longer than τW with active particle control is essential to establish the operational scenarios for next step devices, where the wall pumping does not work. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{structures}} and association properties of thermosensitive block copolymers of poly(methoxyo-ligo(ethylene glycol) norbornenyl esters) in D 2 O were investigated by small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Each block is a comblike polymer with a polynorbornene (PNB) backbone and oligo ethylene glycol (OEG) side chains (one side chain per <b>NB</b> repeat <b>unit).</b> The chemical formula {{of the block}} copolymer is (OEG 3 NB) 79 -(OEG 6. 6 NB) 67, where subscripts represent the degree of polymerization (DP) of OEG and NB in each block. The polymer concentration was fixed at 2. 0 wt % and the structural changes were investigated over a temperature range between 25 and 68 °C. It was found that at room temperature polymers associate to form micelles with a spherical core formed by the block (OEG 3 NB) 79 and corona formed by the block (OEG 6. 6 NB) 67 and that {{the shape of the}} polymer in the corona could be described by the form factor of rigid cylinders. At elevated temperatures, the aggregation number increased and the micelles became more compact. At temperatures around the cloud point temperature (CPT) T) 60 °C a correlation peak started to appear and became pronounced at 68 °C due to the formation of a partially ordered structure with a correlation length ∼ 349 Å. 1...|$|R

40|$|After {{four years}} of activity, EuCARD has most of its {{objectives}} fulfilled, with some new objectives added {{and a few others}} on excellent tracks while requiring additional time. The management has been active in reinforcing the collaborative links between partners and projects, contributing to the preparation of FP 7 -EuCARD 2, initiating FP 7 -HiLumi-LHC Design Study, to favour sustained collaborations beyond EuCARD. An out-of-contract network has been successfully launched on laser plasma acceleration, to combine forces between accelerator, laser and plasma communities. Communication and dissemination activities have led to two highlights: Accelerating News, an accelerator R&D newsletter initiated by EuCARD and now common to all FP 7 accelerator projects (over 1000 subscribers) and a series of monographs on accelerator sciences that is progressively finding its public. The scientific networks have more than fulfilled their initial objectives: roadmaps are defined for neutrino facilities, submitted to the European HEP Strategy Session. The accelerator networks have so successfully become the international forum on accelerator sciences that their share and scope in EuCARD 2 have been significantly expanded. With over 40 topical workshops organized on diverse scientific and technological topics, from innovative crab cavities to roadmaps towards novel frontier accelerators, their impact is largely acknowledged in the community. The two open facilities (MICE@STFC, HiRadMat@SPS) delivered more access units than foreseen, with significant results. The JRAs have the lion’s share in EuCARD. They have had naturally tight links with networks and TA facilities, resulting in a coherent and coordinated approach. The development of an innovative Nb 3 Sn magnet with a YBCO insert, has made significant progress, confirmed by its international advisory committee, even though an extension of the study by 1. 5 years turns out to be necessary: the mechanical structure of the magnet is completed and tested at cold, and a test coil with Cu conductor was manufactured. The Nb 3 Sn cable shows excellent performance. The YBCO HTS insert solenoids were built and the dipole components are procured with completion of the insert by end 2013. The HTS electrical link demonstrator is fully operational. It will allow remote powering of magnets, avoiding risks of single event upset and easing maintenance. The new collimation collaboration organized for EuCARD fully fulfilled its plans, including an optional crystal collimation experience. Novel more robust materials were characterized for collimator jaws. The smart collimator and cryo-catcher were designed, built and successfully tested. The EuCARD contribution to linear colliders is deeply integrated in the CLIC/ILC studies. Significant progress was obtained in ultra-precise assembly and integration of RF modules, thermal stabilization, ultra-precise phase control to 20 fs and beam control. The active mechanical stabilization of magnets to a fraction of nanometer is especially impressive, as well as highly sophisticated simulations of RF break-downs, showing new microscopic mechanisms and giving directions for mitigation. The collaboration concurred to the record accelerating gradient obtained, exceeding 100 MV/m. The study of an innovative compact crab cavity gave momentum to this R&D line and went well beyond plans, with the fabrication of a bulk <b>Nb</b> sc <b>unit.</b> The progress in thin film deposition is slower, given the complexity of this highly promising technology. Better sputtering seems at hand. Progress is noted in chemical processing and cleaning strategies for sc cavities and their couplers. Two reference monographs were published. A new original RF control was built for FLASH and already showed improvement to operations. Finally, the assessment of novel accelerator technologies out of the main stream (crab waist crossing, non-scaling FFAG and diagnostics for divergent beams from laser-plasma acceleration) all met the planned goals. In summary, EuCARD contributed to significant scientific progress beyond the state-of-the-art and to a marked expansion of the collaborative dimension...|$|R
