5|$|Development on {{the project}} began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Sorkin wrote the {{screenplay}} with filming beginning in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive {{on the project}}, with editor Elliot Graham <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was working on existing footage while the film was still shooting. Daniel Pemberton served as the film's composer, with a focus dedicated to dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.|$|E

5|$|On March 18, {{two days}} before the filing deadline, Nixon filed in both the Republican and Democratic {{primaries}} under California's cross-filing system. Voorhis also filed in the two major party primaries. Under cross-filing, if the same candidate won both major party endorsements, he would be effectively elected, with only minor party candidates to stand against him. Day advanced the $200 (the current equivalent of $2,230) for Nixon's filing fees, later <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had great difficulty being reimbursed.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type was really the work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E
5|$|As it was, Nash only {{played one}} {{first-class}} game during the 1932–1933 season—for an Australian XI side against MCC at the MCG. Opening the bowling, Nash took 3/39 {{in the first}} innings and 0/18 in the second, with reporters <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> occasionally {{got a lot of}} bounce out of the wicket. By this point Nash had played 17 matches for Tasmania, scoring 857 runs at 29.55 and taking 51 wickets at 31.96. There was also talk, which proved unfounded, that Nash would be invited to join the touring team to Canada that Arthur Mailey was compiling.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{election}} date was set as September 10, national organizations {{on both sides}} of the gun-control debate started to weigh in. On the recall, pro-gun rights side was the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, while on the gun control side was the Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Mayor Bloomberg. Morse went door-to-door in an effort to gain voter support and both sides of the campaigns accused the other side of mud-slinging. Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been cleared of those allegations. Giron supporters were accused of misrepresenting the issue as a choice on women's rights and abortion.|$|E
5|$|Robinett, as a {{means to}} {{maintain}} his name on his game, included a hidden message in Adventure identifying himself as the creator, inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles. In discussing the game in 2015, Robinett considered the message {{as a means}} of self-promotion, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been paid only around $22,000 a year from Atari without any royalties, while Atari would sell a million units of a game at $25 a piece. This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.|$|E

5|$|In the 2015 {{video game}} , {{which is the}} sequel to Batman: Arkham City, while under the {{influence}} of Scarecrow's latest toxin, Batman hallucinates the Joker's shooting of Barbara Gordon after she is kidnapped by the mysterious Arkham Knight, a hallucination of Joker <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> merely got lucky when he shot Barbara as he was ignorant of her true ties to Batman, and also claimed that he had actually been aiming for Barbara's head. In addition, the DLC side story Batgirl: A Matter of Family had various similarities to the story of The Killing Joke, including Joker kidnapping and holding Police Commissioner Gordon hostage at a run-down amusement park as well as the backstory revealing that Joker had conned and murdered the original person who owned the park into granting him control.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some Like It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E
5|$|Various gliders {{are seen}} in the film and the protagonist, Nausicaä, uses a jet-assisted one-person glider-shaped machine with folding wings. According to the {{accompanying}} film book released in Japan, the glider is called , the German word meaning gull. An official scale model lists it as having an approximate wingspan of 5.8 meters (1/20 model measured to be 29cm), while the design notes indicate it has a mass of only 12kg. In 2004, the Japanese-led OpenSky Aircraft Project began attempts to build a real-life, working personal jet glider based on the glider from the film. Two full-size gliders with no power source carrying the code name M01 and M02, with a half-sized jet-powered remote controlled mock up called moewe 1/2 was built. The designer and tester of the project refused the official endorsement of the project by Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not want to}} cause trouble for them if an accident occurred. A jet powered version (registration number JX0122) was finally able to take off under its own power {{for the first time on}} 3 September 2013.|$|E

5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could raise the ride height at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but without compromising the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E
