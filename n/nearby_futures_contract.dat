Three alternative hedging strategies are considered: duration matching, least squares hedge estimator and asymmetric multivariate GARCH. Hedging performance comparisons, in terms of ex-post variance portfolio reduction, are conducted. The portfolio analysed is composed by Italian Government Bonds. The hedging instrument is the <b>nearby</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contract</b> traded on LIFFE. Eventually, a dynamic hedging strategy is proposed in which the potential risk reduction {{is more than enough}} to offset the transaction costs. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{storage in}} the presence of backwardation and the existence of the Working curve for CBOT corn, soybeans, and wheat markets and the KCBOT wheat market using recent data, 1990 - 2010. Incorporating Telser’s concept of the cost of carry, we employ two measures of the spread—the percent of full carry for futures-futures and futures-spot (maximum) spreads which are adjusted for interest and storage rates. Both spreads are calculated relative to the next <b>nearby</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contract</b> and are matched with closest weekly deliverable stock information available at the delivery locations for the contracts. Our findings indicate that storage at a loss is pervasive both in terms of the percent of observations that exhibited storage at a loss, and the magnitude of the stockholdings for those observations. The evidence for the importance of convenience yield in the Working curve is a little less systematic, with strongest support emerging in the KCBOT wheat market, CBOT wheat and corn in Toledo/Maumee, corn in Chicago, and soybeans at almost all locations.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the impact local ethanol plants have on corn basis. Basis is the {{difference}} between the local cash price and the <b>nearby</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contract</b> price, and accounts for variation in the supply and demand in the local market relative to the national market. It is predicted that the entrance of an ethanol plant into a local cash market will increase corn demand, resulting in an increased cash price relative to futures. The data employed consists of cash corn prices from 153 grain buyers in eight different Midwestern states from Fall 1999 through Summer 2009. In addition to affects from local ethanol production, it is predicted that basis is influenced to by the ratio of local to national corn production, transportation costs, storage opportunity costs, and seasonal factors. To estimate corn basis performance a spatial error component model is adopted that accounts for both spatial dependencies and panel structures in the data. Results show that ethanol production within a 50 -mile region of a county centroid has a small yet positive impact on local corn prices. The estimated impact of a 50 million gallon per year plant is a 0. 425 cent per bushel increase in basis. These findings are smaller than the impacts found in previous work using a more limited time frame, but found to be consistent with earlier work when the time series is truncated to match sample periods from previous work. This suggests that some of the local price impacts dissipate with time...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the multiperiod hedging decision in {{a framework of}} mean-reverting spot prices and unbiased futures markets.

The model is used to illustrate both hedging using a matchedmaturity <b>futures</b> <b>contract</b> and hedging by rolling over a series of <b>nearby</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contracts.</b> In each case, the paper derives the conditions under which a single period (myopic) strategy would be optimal as opposed to a dynamic multiperiod strategy.

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: In this thesis, I {{study the}} effects of {{commodity}} index rolls on <b>nearby</b> commodity <b>futures</b> returns and futures term structure. More specifically, I examine the impact of commodity index investors' and speculators' positions on roll yields of <b>nearby</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> during the "Goldman roll". In addition, I study the futures returns in the post-rolling period. Furthermore, by employing daily dollar volumes, my objective is to calculate the effect of liquidity in the rolling period. Finally, I conduct a sub-period analysis and show how the anticipation of index rolls has moved earlier within the rolling period and that the index rolls affect futures term structures in more deferred maturities. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The dataset consists of 4337 individual <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> and contains daily futures price, open interest and volume observations on each contract from January 1995 to December 2012. My sample is divided to 19 index commodities and 18 non-index commodities. In addition, I use the breakdown of weekly positions provided by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). To test the hypotheses, I estimate several panel regressions with varying set-ups. The regressions have been conducted by using Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust standard errors. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Commodity index rolls depress roll yields between nearby and second <b>nearby</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> during the rolling period. In addition, net index trader positions {{have a negative impact on}} roll yields and managed money spread positions have a positive impact on roll yields. Furthermore, as a new evidence I find that roll yields tend to revert after the rolling period to better reflect the fundamentals, supply and demand after the rolling period. Unlevered excess returns of 80 - 110 basis points can be earned each month by anticipating index rolls and reversing the position after the index rolls. No such effect exists in non-index commodities. The anticipation of index rolls by speculators and new indices with dynamic rolling methodologies have resulted in earlier timing of the rolls. In addition, due to increased investor attention the price impact anomaly is slowly disappearing and moving to other maturities outside the traditional rolling period of 5 th- 9 th business days in each month...|$|R
40|$|Procuring {{material}} from commodity spot markets can flexibly fulfil a forward production demand, but {{increase the risk}} of high procurement cost due to spot price volatility. In this paper, a dynamic stack-and-roll hedging approach using <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> is proposed. The approach aims at mitigating the procurement cost risk and optimising the terminal revenue received from the procurement and hedging activities. It separates the procurement planning horizon into multiple stages, along with varying hedging positions in the <b>nearby</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contracts.</b> Hedging positions are adjusted in response to commodity price behaviour and contemporary perceived information about forward production demand. Guided by the mean-variance criteria over the terminal revenue, dynamic programming is applied to derive a closed-form solution for optimal hedging positions in a discrete-time Markovian setting. Numerical experiments are carried out to assess the proposed approach with explicit solution in a realistic stochastic environment. The price processes are modelled by a fractal nonlinear regression model using real price data of China’s commodity market, while demand information process is modelled by Bayesian formula. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms naive hedging strategy, and effectively mitigates the procurement cost risk. postprin...|$|R

The statistical approach employs dynamic log-returns quantile regression models to forecast price densities using implied volatilities (IVs) and factors estimated through principal component analysis (PCA) from the IVs, pooled IVs and lagged returns. Extensive in-sample and out-of-sample analyses are conducted, including assessment of excess trading returns, and evaluations of several combinations of quantiles, model specifications, and NCFC's. The {{results suggest that the}} IV-PCA-factors, particularly pooled return-IV-PCA-factors, improve quantile forecasting power relative to models using only individual IV information. The ratio of the put-IV to the call-IV is also found to improve quantile forecasting performance of log returns. Improvements in quantile forecasting performance are found to be better in the tails of the distribution than in the center. Trading performance based on quantile forecasts from the models above generated significant excess returns. Finally, the fact that the single IV forecasts were outperformed by their quantile regression (QR) counterparts suggests that the conditional distribution of the log-returns is not normal...|$|R

Using data from January 2005 until July 2007, we investigate whether the surprise created by the EIA announcement, i. e. the difference between the numbers released and what was expected by a group of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, also has an influence on the volatility of natural gas futures prices. We also investigate whether the variance of the survey estimates has a significant influence on the futures price volatility. We find that volatility is higher on announcement days, especially when gas inventories are lower than expected. The magnitude of the surprise also has a significant impact on volatility on announcement days. The variance of the survey estimates, on the other hand, is rarely significant. derivatives; futures; volatility; estimates; surprises; maturity effect; storage announcements; natural gas. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays. The first essay (chapter two) looks at the impact of derivatives regulation on liquidity and mispricing of US derivatives markets. In particular, we test the hypothesis that Dodd Frank derivative provisions may improve {{the efficiency of the}} exchange traded markets due to an increase of arbitrage by traders on the exchange traded markets, as opposed to the OTC markets. We examine the impact of key Dodd Frank events on market activity for financial derivatives (<b>futures</b> and option <b>contracts</b> on US T bonds, Eurodollar futures and options, and S&P 500 <b>Futures</b> <b>contracts)</b> and on foreign exchange derivatives (<b>futures</b> and options <b>contracts</b> on EUROs, British Pounds, and Canadian dollars). First, we look at how liquidity on the markets has been affected. Next, we test for mispricing of derivatives contracts. We find that measured liquidity does fall for US financial futures and options but rises for foreign exchange futures and options subsequent to the introduction of the Treasury guidelines for OTC trading. We also find that the efficiency of the U. S. exchange traded futures markets has improved, as reflected by a reduction in mispricing in the S&P futures contracts; some improvement in pricing efficiency is also shown for <b>nearby</b> Eurodollar <b>futures</b> <b>contracts.</b> These results are consistent with an increase of arbitrage by traders on the exchange traded markets, as opposed to the OTC markets, in contrast to the “noise” model. The second essay (chapter three) provides a description and comparison between OTC and exchange-traded derivatives market activity. It compares the turnover in OTC derivatives among three regions: Americas, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. Similar analysis is also conducted for non-financial customers. The empirical results show that the growth rate of exchange-traded derivatives leads growth rate of OTC derivatives. The conclusion still holds for derivatives of different risk categories. The third essay (chapter four) examines the futures market efficiency of the VIX and the relative merits of the VIX and VIX <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> in forecasting <b>future</b> S&P 500 excess returns the future Russell 2000 excess returns, and the future small-cap premium. We find that the current VIX is significantly negatively related to S&P 500 index excess returns and positively related to the Russell 2000 index excess returns. These results suggest that the VIX predicts asset returns based on size based portfolios asymmetrically – with higher (lower) values of the VIX associated with lower (higher) values of small-cap (large cap) returns in the future. However, the VIX and VIX modeled by an ARIMA process are not significantly related to future values of the small-cap premium. In contrast, VIX futures show forecasting prowess for the S&P 500 excess return, the Russell 2000 excess return and the small-cap premium. VIX futures are significantly negatively related to these series. The results for the speculative efficiency of the VIX <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> are mixed, however. Overall, the analyses support the hypothesis of informational advantages of the futures markets relative to the spot market in the price discovery process not just for size based asset returns, but on the size premium as well...|$|R

TonsorThe {{objective}} of this analysis is to develop econometric models for forecasting fed cattle basis as well as compare these models with historic averaging methods of forecasting basis popular in existing literature. The econometric analysis also aims to identify important determinants of fed cattle basis. Both monthly and weekly models were assessed with data provided by the Livestock Marketing Information Center. All models analyzed the three regions of Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas. Monthly historic average approaches utilized historic fed cattle futures and fed cattle cash price series from January of 1995 through December of 2010. Weekly historic average approaches utilized historic fed cattle futures and fed cattle cash prices series from June of 2001 through December 2010. Data collected post mandatory price reporting implementation in 2001 was used in all econometric models. Overall lags of fed cattle basis, the spread between the <b>nearby</b> live cattle <b>futures</b> <b>contract</b> and the next deferred <b>futures</b> <b>contract,</b> and seasonality regularly proved to explain much {{of the variation in}} fed cattle basis in the econometric modeling. Multiple historic average based models were examined on both monthly and weekly frequencies. Once all competing models were estimated in-sample, out-of sample testing was conducted. The forecasting errors of all weekly models were compared to determine which methods prove to be dominant forecasters of fed cattle basis. This testing suggests historic averaging methods outperform the alternate econometric models in out-of-sample work. The econometric models helped to reveal some of the important factors determining fed cattle basis, however lags in collecting data on these factors may inhibit the forecaster’s ability to use these techniques in real time. One interesting revelation in regards to historic averages is the potential of Olympic averages as forecasters. These methods have not been explored in previous academic literature but tend to perform quite well in comparison with other methods explored...|$|R
