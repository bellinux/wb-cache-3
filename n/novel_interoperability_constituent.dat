40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a <b>novel</b> <b>interoperability</b> {{strategy}} and architecture is described that guarantees the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for applications originating in IEEE 802. 11 e based WLAN {{to a serving}} IEEE 802. 16 based WirelessMAN and vice versa. The architecture for mapping QoS requirements makes use of inherent MAC layer convergence flexibilities available in these networks along with features of MAC layer bridging as specified by IEEE 802. 1 d and IEEE 802. 1 p. Elaborate simulations are performed on NS- 2 platform to verify the efficacy of such an approach. The contribution of this work is especially significant because of its low complexity of implementation due to use of existing standards which makes it commercially feasible.

40|$|In {{the current}} quest for {{personalized}} and omnipresent healthcare required to address contemporary challenges, the typical concept {{of information systems}} interoperability is no longer expressive enough to address the complex interrelationships of the increasingly diversified technical {{environment in which the}} clinical processes occur. The traditional view of the healthcare information systems architecture considered only clinical information systems and healthcare facilities; however, as the Internet-of-Things vision becomes a reality, an exploding number of mobile devices, sensors, tags and other identifiable resources with communication and processing capabilities need {{to be added to the}} big picture. In such complex circumstances, the concept of interoperability also needs to evolve from the original concept of interoperating sets of information systems to the capability of each autonomous information system to sense, interpret, understand and act upon arbitrary messages received from potentially unknown senders. Therefore, in this paper we propose an evolved concept of interoperability as a property of a system, more suitable for the modern context of ubiquitous healthcare information systems. We define enabling factors for interoperable information systems involved in pervasive healthcare and we also attempt to assess and exemplify the impact that a <b>novel</b> <b>Interoperability</b> as a Property (IaaP) paradigm would have on the healthcare information systems’ landscape...|$|R

SoS exhibit dynamic properties called emergent behaviors, {{which are a}} global functionality that appears {{as a result of}} the <b>interoperability</b> among <b>constituents.</b> However,software architecture descriptions of SoS are often static. In turn, dynamic models such as simulation models (also adopted to specify SoS) do not use to preserve software architecture details, which can hamper the software quality. In this paper, we propose a modeltransformation approach to harmonize software architecture descriptions of SoS and simulation models to support validation ofemergent behaviors. We model a software architecture of SoS by the adoption of SosADL, a novel architectural description language(ADL) for SoS, and transform it to DEVS, a formalism for simulation of SoS. Our approach offers a dynamic view to architectural descriptions of SoS, preserving the architectural integrity of the SoS, and supporting the visualization and validation of emergent behaviors. We evaluate our proposal through a case study conducted within the context of a real SoS in operation for flood monitoring in an urban area. Preliminary results show that the transformation is feasible, generating functional simulation models that support the validation of emergent behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Formalizing the {{description}} of software systems helps to de-tect the presence of architectural mismatches that can arise when assembling software components together. In this pa-per we identify three causes of architectural mismatches: incompatibility between two components due to a single in-teraction, incompatibility between two components due to the combination of several interactions, and lack of interop-erability among a set of components forming a cyclic topol-ogy. We then show {{how to deal with}} all of them within a uniform, process algebraic framework. We begin with the first two causes by strengthening a previously defined archi-tectural compatibility check based on observational equiv-alences, in order to achieve a deadlock freedom result for the set of components interacting via a certain connection. We subsequently concentrate on the third cause by defining a <b>novel</b> architectural <b>interoperability</b> check based on obser-vational equivalences, which guarantees absence of dead-lock within a set of interacting components forming a cyclic topology.

In the last decade, enterprise interoperability has been developed and prescribed by various kinds of frameworks, methods, and techniques. However interoperability development is still not mature enough to become a science. Meanwhile, it keeps evolving according to different business requirement and market environment. Nowadays, networked environment causes unpredictable dynamical situations, thus sustainable interoperability becomes a new research dimension in the interoperability of enterprise systems and applications domain.

40|$|In this thesis, we have {{presented}} a <b>novel</b> approach to <b>interoperability</b> {{based on the}} use of biological relationships that have used relationship-based integration to integrate bioinformatics data sources; this refers to the use of different relationship types with different relationship closeness values to link gene expression datasets with other information available in public bioinformatics data sources. These relationships provide flexible linkage for biologists to discover linked data across the biological universe. Relationship closeness is a variable used to measure the closeness of the biological entities in a relationship and is a characteristic of the relationship. The novelty of this approach is that it allows a user to link a gene expression dataset with heterogeneous data sources dynamically and flexibly to facilitate comparative genomics investigations. Our research has demonstrated that using different relationships allows biologists to analyze experimental datasets in different ways, shorten the time needed to analyze the datasets and provide an easier way to undertake this analysis. Thus, it provides more power to biologists to do experimentations using changing threshold values and linkage types. This is achieved in our framework by introducing the Soft Link Model (SLM) and a Relationship Knowledge Base (RKB), which is built and used by SLM.

40|$|AbstractThe service-oriented {{paradigm}} {{promises a}} <b>novel</b> degree of <b>interoperability</b> between business processes, and {{is leading to}} {{a major shift in}} way distributed applications are designed and realized. While novel and more powerful services can be obtained, in such setting, by suitably orchestrating existing ones, manually developing such orchestrations is highly demanding, time-consuming and error-prone. Providing automated service composition tools is therefore essential to reduce the time to market of services, and ultimately to successfully enact the service-oriented approach. In this paper, we show that such tools can be realized based on the adoption and extension of powerful AI planning techniques, taking the “planning via model-checking” approach as a stepping stone. In this respect, this paper summarizes and substantially extends a research line that started early in this decade and has continued till now. Specifically, this work provides three key contributions. First, we describe a novel planning framework for the automated composition of Web services, which can handle services specified and implemented using industrial standard languages for business processes modeling and execution, like ws-bpel. Since these languages describe stateful Web services that rely on asynchronous communication primitives, a distinctive aspect of the presented framework is its ability to model and solve planning problems for asynchronous domains. Second, we formally spell out the theory underlying the framework, and provide algorithms to solve service composition in such framework, proving their correctness and completeness. The presented algorithms significantly extend state-of-the-art techniques for planning under uncertainty, by allowing the combination of asynchronous domains according to behavioral requirements. Third, we provide and discuss an implementation of the approach, and report extensive experimental results which demonstrate its ability to scale up to significant cases for which the manual development of ws-bpel composed services is far from trivial and time consuming...|$|R

They share relationships and multiple experiences that have existed for years but have never have been proven. This interoperability of building performance simulation maps building information and parametric models with energy simulation models, establishing a seamless link between Computer Aided Design (CAD) and energy performance simulation software. During the last four decades, building designers have utilized {{information and communication technologies}} to create environmental representations to communicate spatial concepts or designs and to enhance spaces. Most architectural firms still rely on hand labor, drafted drawings, construction documents, specifications, schedules and work plans in traditional means. 3 D modelling has been used primarily as a rendering tool, not as the actual representation of the project. With this innovative digitally exchange technology, architects and building designers can visually analyze dynamic building energy performance in response to changes of climate and building parameters. This software interoperability provides full data exchange bidirectional capabilities, which significantly reduces time and effort in energy simulation and data regeneration. Data mapping and exchange are key requirements for building more powerful energy simulations. An effective data model is the bidirectional nucleus of a well-designed relational database, critical in making good choices in selecting design parameters and in gaining and expanding a comprehensive understanding of existing data flows throughout the simulation process, making data systems for simulation more powerful, which has never been done before.

40|$|With {{the passing}} of the MAP- 21 (Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century) Act in 2012, the United States bridge {{industry}} has had a significant push for the use of innovative technologies to advance the highway transportation system. Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM) is emerging as an important trend in the industry, in which various technologies and software are being used in all phases of the bridge lifecycle and have been shown to have a variety of benefits. However, most software are stand alone applications and do not efficiently exchange data among other software. This lack of interoperability creates impediments for the efficient and seamless transfer of information across the bridge lifecycle. In recent years, the building industry developed standards to promote interoperability for Building Information Models (BIM). Unfortunately, these standards lack the ability to incorporate bridges. Therefore, there major need for a standard for Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM). Moreover, as technology and modeling software have been coming more prevalent in other domains (roads, geotechnical, environment systems, etc.) there is an even larger need to expand interoperability standards across multi-disciplinary domains. The purpose of this research is to develop a methodology that would enable the interoperability of multi-disciplinary information models. The scope of the methodology is for Bridge Information Models, but the approach is extendable to other domains. This research is motivated by the fundamental issues of interoperability, such as semantic, logic, and software issues. In this research, the fundamental issues of interoperability are investigated as well as an in-depth review of literature proposing solutions. Additionally, current standards for interoperability of information models are reviewed. Based on the findings of the literature review, this research develops, evaluates, and validates a <b>novel</b> methodology for <b>interoperability</b> of information models.
