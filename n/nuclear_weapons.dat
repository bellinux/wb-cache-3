5|$|In {{response}} to the incident, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and USAF conducted an investigation, the results of which were released on 19 October 2007. The investigation concluded that <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> handling standards and procedures had not been followed by numerous USAF personnel involved in the incident. As a result, four USAF commanders were relieved of their commands, numerous other USAF personnel were disciplined or decertified to perform certain types of sensitive duties, and further cruise missile transport missions from—and <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> operations at—Minot Air Force Base were suspended. In addition, the USAF issued new <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> handling instructions and procedures.|$|E
5|$|Project E was a {{joint project}} between the United States and the United Kingdom during the Cold War to provide <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> to the Royal Air Force (RAF) prior to Britain's own <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> {{becoming}} available.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to demonstrate that South Africa's decisions to develop and destroy its <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> capability were influenced by reactions to domestic security and other issues unrelated to security. South Africa obtained a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> capacity because of an incremental approach to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> decision. The threat perceptions {{in the mind of the}} decision maker were also dominant factors, especially when the final decision for a nuclear deterrent was taken. The decision to destroy the <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> capacity was not primarily influenced by the growing non-proliferation norm, but by the changing security environment regionally as well as globally and possibly a realisation that a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> capability was a significant security and financial liability for South Africa in the end.

Diefenbaker was handed a petition containing 142,000 names.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Britain {{commenced}} a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> project, {{known as}} Tube Alloys, but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged {{it with the}} American Manhattan Project. Several key British scientists worked {{as part of the}} British contribution to the Manhattan Project, but after the war the Americans ended cooperation on <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> In January 1947, a cabinet sub-committee decided, in response to an apprehension of American isolationism and fears of Britain losing its great power status, to resume British efforts to build <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> The project was called High Explosive Research, and was directed by Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, with William Penney in charge of bomb design.|$|E

5|$|The USAF {{issued a}} new policy {{directive}} regarding the handling of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and delivery systems, which prohibits the storing of nuclear armed and nonnuclear armed weapons in the same storage facility. The directive further instructs that all nonnuclear munitions and missiles must be labeled with placards clearly stating {{that they are not}} armed with nuclear warheads. Wing commanders are now charged with approving any movement of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> from weapons storage areas and must appoint a single individual as a munitions accountability system officer and weapons custodian. All units that handle <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> must develop a coordinated visual inspection checklist. The policy further directs that airmen charged with handling or maintaining <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> cannot be on duty for longer than 12 hours, unless during an emergency, when their duty period can be extended to a maximum of 16 hours. The USAF has since instituted a program of surprise inspections at nuclear-armed bases.|$|E

5|$|When the Cold War {{ended in}} 1991, {{there were more}} than 500 US <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in the UK. Of these, about 400 were bombs, 48 were Ground Launched Cruise Missiles, and {{approximately}} 100 were B57 nuclear depth bombs. The BAOR still had about 85 Lance missiles, and more than 70 W33 eight-inch and W48 155mm nuclear artillery shells. The cruise missiles were withdrawn in 1991 {{under the terms of the}} 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The United States then decided to withdraw its short-range <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> The last US warheads, including the B57s and those used by the BAOR, were withdrawn in July 1992. The only American <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> then remaining in the UK were 110 or so B61 nuclear bombs stored at RAF Lakenheath for USAF F-15E Strike Eagles, which were withdrawn by 2008. The British WE.177 nuclear bombs used by the RAF and Royal Navy were withdrawn from service in August 1998, at which point the only remaining British <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> were British warheads on the Trident missiles of the s.|$|E

5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft {{would be needed to}} deliver the various <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> then under development. At the time, <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> weighed several tons, and the need to carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers.
