25|$|An initial raid in July 1919 {{against an}} anarchist group in Buffalo, New York, {{achieved}} little when {{a federal judge}} tossed out Palmer's case. He found in {{the case that the}} three arrested radicals, charged under a law dating from the Civil War, had proposed transforming the government by using their free speech rights and not by violence. That taught Palmer that he needed to exploit the more powerful immigration statutes that authorized the deportation of alien anarchists, violent or <b>not.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> he needed to enlist the cooperation of officials at the Department of Labor. Only the Secretary of Labor could issue warrants for the arrest of alien violators of the Immigrations Acts, and only he could sign deportation orders following a hearing by an immigration inspector.|$|E
500|$|Joan O'Connell Hedman of Slant Magazine {{also gave}} a {{positive}} review feeling the episode to explore [...] "Torchwoods {{bread and butter}} topic: {{the intersection of the}} human and the alien, {{and what it means to}} be human in the aftermath." [...] She stated that the episode [...] "played to its strengths, namely Eve Myles' Gwen and how she relates to both human and alien" [...] and stated it to demonstrate [...] "how perfect Rhys is for Gwen". She felt that the episode was flawed in its [...] "cop-out" [...] ending and Jack's handling of Gwen but in her conclusion noted it be [...] "the first episode of Torchwood that left me choked up, crying with Gwen at the end". Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair felt the episode to be a vast improvement on its predecessors stating it be [...] "hard hitting, edgy and explores much bleaker and darker avenues to life in Torchwood". He also felt that the personal effect of Gwen's struggles on her domestic life was one of the most interesting aspects comparing it to the television series Angel which [...] "touched on some of these threads through the meta-story and vampire mythology" [...] but not [...] "on the scale of this [...] ". He concluded that the episode's conclusion was both to its credit and its biggest disappointment because it showed that there is [...] "no way to make everything all right" [...] but left its audience [...] "screaming for a happy ending that will never come". Jason Hughes of AOL TV was more mixed in his review. He felt that the episode was a [...] "vast improvement over last week's episode" [...] and stated that it lived up to Torchwoods reputation as [...] "the darker, more mature cousin of Doctor Who". However, he stated that the episode had [...] "some logistical problems" [...] and [...] "at least one ridiculously convenient coincidence that the emotional hook of the episode hinged on". He praised the [...] "tragic emotional impact of the moment when Jonah's mom told Gwen to promise her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to any other families" [...] and stated that he liked [...] "that there weren't any easy answers". io9's Charlie Jane Anders described [...] "Adrift" [...] as [...] "easily the best episode of the Doctor Who spin-off since the one where Martha Jones showed up". She stated that [...] "the fact that it offered no easy solutions and gave us that super-bleak ending was enough to win me over".|$|E

6000|$|It {{hurt her}} {{to hear him}} speak of Mrs. Haney in that off-hand, {{habitual}} way, and she foretold further misconception {{on the part of}} Mrs. Crego in case he should forget--as he was likely to do--and allude to [...] "Bertha" [...] in her presence.

50|$|From the {{campaign}} to ease the Third Reich's coldness towards Finland, it seemed a natural development to also promote closer relations and cooperation, especially since the much-disliked Moscow Peace Treaty had, in clear language, tried to persuade the Finns <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> exactly <b>that.</b> Propaganda in the censored press contributed to Finland's international re-orientation—although with very measured means.|$|R

60|$|For the man himself, the reader, it is hoped, {{will feel}} some compassion. He had been dragged away from London by false hopes. After so great an injury as that inflicted on {{him by the}} last change in the Squire's purpose it was hardly unnatural {{that the idea of}} {{retaliation}} should present itself to him when the opportunity came in his way. <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which justice demands is so much easier to the conscience than to commit a deed which is palpably fraudulent! At the last his conscience saved him, and Mr Apjohn will perhaps be thought to have been right in declaring that much was due to him in that he had not destroyed the will. His forbearance was recompensed fully.|$|E
