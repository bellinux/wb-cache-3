25|$|For the 1996 season, Oklahoma hired former player John Blake as head coach. Blake was the {{favorite}} to succeed Schnellenberger and {{was backed by}} Barry Switzer, Steve Owens, and former Oklahoma president George Lynn Cross. However, many were skeptical of Oklahoma's choice for the new coach. His coaching experience was very limited, especially compared to his predecessor. In his seven-year coaching career (four years at OU, three years with the Dallas Cowboys and one year at Tulsa), he had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than a position coach. The skeptics were proven right. In Blake's first season, he went 3–8. It was the worst record, percentage wise, Oklahoma had experienced since 1895 and is tied for the most losses in one year (along with Blake's 1997 squad) to this very day. In his three years at Oklahoma, Blake went 3–8, 4–8, and 5–6 for a final record of 12–22. It {{was the first time}} since 1922–1924 that Oklahoma had three consecutive losing seasons. Blake's largest contribution to the team was his recruiting. He set the stage by recruiting several players that would help lead the program's resurgence, including J.T. Thatcher, Josh Norman, Roy Williams and Rocky Calmus. Many of them got a chance to play fairly quickly, since Blake's teams were often out of games early. Blake was fired after the 1998 season.|$|E

He hailed the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870 as a triumph, and he favored the re-admission of Georgia to the Union as a matter of right, not politics. In 1871, Garfield opposed passage of the Ku Klux Klan Act, saying, [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> perplexed by a piece of legislation."

Matthew observes that it was only when one of the prince's own circle of confidantes brought him to court that the newspapers would [...] "seriously harr him... the British in the 1890s had no general wish to see their future monarch fail".|$|E
500|$|Clifton approvingly {{quoted the}} {{arguments}} in Animal Rights Without Liberation concerning animals killed in crop harvest, and observed that, {{other than a}} hypothetical openness towards ethically produced eggs and dairy, Cochrane's arguments would seem to favour veganism over vegetarianism. Clifton also showed interest in Cochrane's arguments concerned pet-keeping, writing [...] "Cochrane never mentions pit bulls, but his argument is in effect a case for prohibiting pit bull breeding: pit bulls have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 5% of the U.S. dog population, but are 20% of the dogs impounded in cruelty and neglect cases." [...] Boisseau worried that animal activists may find the imprecise positions of [...] "animal rights" [...] or [...] "animal liberation" [...] more useful than Cochrane's comparatively nuanced position, and questioned {{the extent to which}} political and legal change could be possible given continued use of animals.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Johnson {{is among those}} {{commonly}} mentioned as the worst presidents in U.S. history. According to historian Glenn W. Lafantasie, who believes Buchanan the worst president, [...] "Johnson is a particular favorite for {{the bottom of the}} pile because of his impeachment... his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy... his bristling personality, and his enormous sense of self-importance." [...] Tolson suggests that [...] "Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans". Gordon-Reed notes that Johnson, along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan, are generally listed among the five worst presidents, but states, [...] "there have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> difficult times in the life of this nation.

[...] Jamieson Cox of the Verge praised the album's string arrangements and [...] "emotional magnanimity". Andy Beta of Rolling Stone described it as [...] "a haunting, stunning triumph" [...] and Radiohead's [...] "most gorgeous and desolate album to date", praising its timbres and melodies.

500|$|When Scott {{unexpectedly}} {{married in}} 1969, {{it appeared that}} the problem might be over, but by 1970 the marriage had ended; Scott convinced himself that Thorpe was to blame. Early in 1971 Scott moved to the village of Talybont, in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones, to whom he recounted his tale of ill-treatment at the hands of Thorpe. She passed the information to Emlyn Hooson, who was MP for the adjoining Welsh constituency; Hooson precipitated the party enquiry which cleared Thorpe and left Scott feeling bitter and humiliated. After Parry-Jones's death the following year, Scott fell into a depression and for a while was quiescent. In time, however, he began to tell his story to anyone who would listen. [...] By 1974 Thorpe, at the crest of the Liberal revival, was terrified of exposure that might lose him the Liberal leadership. As Dominic Sandbrook observes in his history of the times: [...] "The stakes had never been higher; silencing Scott had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> urgent".|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{identified}} various major themes in Tenebrae. In interviews {{conducted during the}} film's production, the usually somewhat reticent Argento offered his candid views on the thematic content of the film. As biographer Maitland McDonagh noted in Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento, [...] "...Argento has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> articulate and/or analytical than {{he was on the}} subject of Tenebrae." [...] Film scholar William Hope considers the film to be devoid of classical narrative progression, and states that the characters [...] "lack a narrative function or purpose, existing only to be killed in a spectacular fashion, their death hardly moving the narrative on at all. Traditional cause and effect are seemingly forgotten or actively ignored". According to James Gracey, author of a book about Argento's work, with Tenebrae Argento [...] "explores some of his most reoccurring themes and preoccupations, such as Freudian psychology, sexual deviancy, repressed trauma, voyeurism, audience spectatorship and the fetishisation of violence and death." [...] Water is often associated visually with Neal; in almost all his scenes his appearance is followed or accompanied by a shot of water. Later, this device is used repeatedly as a clue to the ultimate killer's identity – Neal himself.|$|E

Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel.

Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E
