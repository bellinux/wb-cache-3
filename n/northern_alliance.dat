5|$|In November 2001, C and M {{squadron}} SBS had {{an extensive}} {{role in the}} invasion of Afghanistan {{at the start of}} the War in Afghanistan, notably, members of M squadron were involved in the Battle of Tora Bora. The SBS was integrated directly into Task Force Sword – a Black SOF, under direct command of JSOC, this was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was capturing or killing senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Troops from C squadron (reinforced by teams from X and Z squadron, with at least one SEAL attached to them) were tasked with several missions, some with General Dostum's <b>Northern</b> <b>Alliance</b> forces at Mazar-e-Sharif. On November 10, C squadron inserted into the recently captured Bagram Airbase, which caused an immediate political quandary with the <b>Northern</b> <b>Alliance</b> leadership which claimed that the British had failed to consult them on it before the deployment, in addition to fighting with Dostum's forces, they worked alongside TF Sword in Shah-i-Kot Valley. Members of M squadron SBS, were involved in a prison revolt during the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, members of the SBS along with US and <b>Northern</b> <b>Alliance</b> troops eventually quelled the uprising, however during one CAS mission, a misdirected JDAM bomb wounded 4 SBS personnel to various degrees. In appreciation for the SBS contribution to the battle, the CIA attempted to recognise the personnel with US decorations, but due to Military and political bureaucracy, the decorations were never awarded. The SBS continued to work with Task Force Sword and the CIA.|$|E

5|$|In {{pursuing}} the Clinton administration's energy objectives through {{construction of the}} $4.5 billion Afghanistan Oil Pipeline, Raphel created ill will with Afghanistan's <b>Northern</b> <b>Alliance,</b> then {{under the command of}} Ahmad Shah Massoud. Massoud-controlled militias blocked the pipeline's northern access route due to the longstanding civil war with Taliban forces. After Massoud was killed September 9, 2001 in a Taliban bombing, Raphel's critics accused her of collaborating with the Taliban to advance American commercial interests even as the group gave refuge to Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other senior al-Qaeda leaders in the time leading up to the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|The young Henry FitzEmpress {{returned}} to England again in 1149, this time planning {{to form a}} <b>northern</b> <b>alliance</b> with Ranulf of Chester. The Angevin plan involved Ranulf agreeing {{to give up his}} claim to Carlisle, held by the Scots, in return for being given the rights to the whole of the Honour of Lancaster; Ranulf would give homage to both David and Henry Fitzempress, with Henry having seniority. Following this peace agreement, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack York, probably with help from the Scots. Stephen marched rapidly north to York and the planned attack disintegrated, leaving Henry to return to Normandy, where he was declared duke by his father.|$|E
5|$|Born in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Coulson {{started his}} career in the youth system of his {{hometown}} club Scarborough at the age of nine. In April 2004, he went on trial with Premier League club Everton, playing in a youth academy match against Liverpool. Coulson captained the Scarborough under-19 team that won the <b>Northern</b> <b>Alliance</b> League title in the 2003–04 season. He made his first-team debut as a 16-year-old after coming on as a 79th-minute substitute at home to Accrington Stanley in a 4–0 Conference National victory on 23 October 2004, making him the second youngest player in Scarborough's history. Coulson became Scarborough's youngest goalscorer after he scored an equalising goal against Tamworth in a 2–2 home draw on 15 March 2005 with 10 minutes of the match remaining. He signed a one-year professional contract with Scarborough on 5 April 2005 and finished 2004–05, his first in senior football, with two goals in 14 appearances.|$|E
5|$|During the Boshin War of 1868-69, the Nanbu clan {{initially}} {{attempted to}} remain neutral. However, {{under the leadership}} of Nanbu Toshihisa and the karō Narayama Sado, the Nanbu clan later sided with the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei). On September 23, 1868, the Nanbu clan's troops joined in the attack on the Akita Domain, which had seceded from the alliance and sided with the imperial government. By October 7, Nanbu troops took Ōdate, one of the Akita Domain's castles. However, due to the collapse of the alliance, the Nanbu clan surrendered to the imperial army on October 29, 1868. After the war, the Nanbu clan's holdings were drastically reduced by the imperial government as punishment for siding with the <b>northern</b> <b>alliance.</b> While Hachinohe and Shichinohe Domains survived intact, a large area of what is now northeastern Aomori Prefecture was given as a resettlement zone for former samurai of Aizu Domain. The Nanbu were also briefly expelled from Morioka itself, and were assigned new lands surrounding the vacant Shiroishi Castle before being allowed to returned to Morioka a few months later. Two years after the war, as with all other daimyō, the heads of all three Nanbu branches were relieved of their offices by the abolition of the han system.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{returned}} to England in 1147, {{when he was}} fourteen. Taking his immediate household and {{a small number of}} mercenaries, he left Normandy and landed in England, striking into Wiltshire. Despite initially causing considerable panic, the expedition had little success, and Henry found himself unable to pay his forces and therefore unable to return to Normandy. Neither his mother nor his uncle were prepared to support him, implying that they had not approved of the expedition in the first place. Surprisingly, Henry instead turned to King Stephen, who paid the outstanding wages and thereby allowed Henry to retire gracefully. Stephen's reasons for doing so are unclear. One potential explanation is his general courtesy to a member of his extended family; another is that he was starting to consider how to end the war peacefully, and saw this as a way of building a relationship with Henry. Henry intervened once again in 1149, commencing what is often termed the Henrician phase of the civil war. This time, Henry planned to form a <b>northern</b> <b>alliance</b> with King David I of Scotland, Henry's great-uncle, and Ranulf of Chester, a powerful regional leader who controlled most of the north-west of England. Under this alliance, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack York, probably with help from the Scots. The planned attack disintegrated after Stephen marched rapidly north to York, and Henry {{returned to}} Normandy.|$|E
