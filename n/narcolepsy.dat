5|$|During the trial, {{evidence}} was presented that Wang often had trouble staying awake during AWACS missions. In fact, {{the problem was}} considered serious enough that the military had referred Wang to medical authorities to be checked for <b>narcolepsy.</b> Wang had also previously failed two check rides.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{with the}} onset of World War II, Jenner was {{recalled}} to active duty. Because of his <b>narcolepsy,</b> he was given shore duties in Sydney. In this capacity, he participated in undercover operations and delivered sealed orders. After the war, he left the navy and became a janitor for IBM, a technology and consulting corporation.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{problems}} are {{a feature of}} the disease and can be worsened by medications. Symptoms can manifest as daytime drowsiness (including sudden sleep attacks resembling <b>narcolepsy),</b> disturbances in REM sleep, or insomnia. REM behavior disorder (RBD), in which patients act out dreams, sometimes injuring themselves or their bed partner, may begin many years before the development of motor or cognitive features of PD or DLB.|$|E
5|$|Some Giant Schnauzers develop central {{diabetes}} insipidus, {{autosomal recessive}} hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, <b>narcolepsy,</b> cataplexy, and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common {{causes of death}} in Giant Schnauzers are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, <b>narcolepsy,</b> panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from <b>narcolepsy,</b> although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Jenner {{developed}} Parkinson's {{disease and}} therefore retired from IBM. With money that Jessie had inherited, the couple moved to Bexley in 1953, where they began attending Bexley Gospel Hall. Towards {{the end of}} his life, Jenner developed dementia and his <b>narcolepsy</b> worsened. For six months, he was confined to a bed and was treated with amphetamine. He was then diagnosed with colorectal cancer and spent a subsequent ten days at Calvary Hospital, Kogarah, New South Wales, where he died at 11:45pm on 8 May 1977 at the age of 73. Because he had befriended so many police officers towards {{the end of his}} life, his body was given a police escort to the burial, which took place at Woronora Lawn Cemetery. His wife died two years later.|$|E
5|$|Jenner would {{normally}} {{wake up to}} pray at 5am each day. In the 1940s, Jenner left the Glanton Brethren and joined the Open Brethren. For {{the rest of his}} life, Jenner attended Open Brethren churches: one on Goulburn Street in Sydney and the other in Bexley, New South Wales. At these churches, people did not understand what <b>narcolepsy</b> was and thought that Jenner was consistently falling asleep during services because he lacked respect for God. The church on Goulburn Street also disapproved of his partnership with other Christian organisations and churches; Jenner actively partnered with The Navigators, Campaigners for Christ, Baptists, Anglicans, and Methodists.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{models of}} {{naturally}} occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals {{have a natural}} propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans. Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study leukemia because their natural predisposition to FIV and Feline leukemia virus. Certain breeds of dog suffer from <b>narcolepsy</b> making them the major model used to study the human condition. Armadillos and humans are among only a few animal species that naturally suffer from leprosy; as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture, armadillos are {{the primary source of}} bacilli used in leprosy vaccines.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and <b>narcolepsy.</b> At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and <b>narcolepsy),</b> or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E
5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} {{what seems to be}} a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has <b>narcolepsy.</b> Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E
25|$|Another FDA-approved {{treatment}} {{option for}} <b>narcolepsy</b> is sodium oxybate, {{also known as}} sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). It {{can be used for}} cataplexy associated with <b>narcolepsy</b> and excessive daytime sleepiness associated with <b>narcolepsy.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the United States, it is {{estimated}} that this condition afflicts as many as 200,000 Americans, but fewer than 50,000 are diagnosed. It is as widespread as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis and more prevalent than cystic fibrosis, but it is less well known. <b>Narcolepsy</b> is often mistaken for depression, epilepsy, or the side effects of medications. It can also be mistaken for poor sleeping habits, recreational drug use, or laziness. <b>Narcolepsy</b> can occur in both men and women at any age, although its symptoms are usually first noticed in teenagers or young adults. There is strong evidence that <b>narcolepsy</b> may run in families; around 10 percent of people diagnosed with <b>narcolepsy</b> with cataplexy have a close relative with this neurological disorder. While <b>narcolepsy</b> symptoms are often confused with depression, there is a link between the two disorders. Research studies have mixed results on co-occurrence of depression in <b>narcolepsy</b> patients - the numbers quoted by different studies are anywhere between 6% and 50%.|$|E
25|$|GHB is {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in the prescription medication sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Sodium oxybate is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} cataplexy associated with <b>narcolepsy</b> and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with <b>narcolepsy.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>narcolepsy</b> is about 1 per 2,000 persons. It {{is a reason}} for patient visits to sleep disorder centers, and with its onset in adolescence, {{it is also a}} major cause of learning difficulty and absenteeism from school. Normal teenagers often already experience excessive daytime sleepiness because of a maturational increase in physiological sleep tendency accentuated by multiple educational and social pressures; this may be disabling with the addition of <b>narcolepsy</b> symptoms in susceptible teenagers. In clinical practice, the differentiation between <b>narcolepsy</b> and other conditions characterized by excessive somnolence may be difficult. Treatment options are currently limited. There is a paucity in the literature of controlled double-blind studies of possible effective drugs or other forms of therapy. Mechanisms of action of some few available therapeutic agents have been explored but detailed studies of mechanisms of action are needed before new classes of therapeutic agents can be developed. <b>Narcolepsy</b> is an underdiagnosed condition in the general population. This is partly because its severity varies, so it can be mistaken for other illnesses very easily. Some people with <b>narcolepsy</b> do not suffer from loss of muscle control.|$|E
25|$|Cataplexy {{associated}} with <b>narcolepsy.</b> Which is a TGA and MHRA-labeled indication for clomipramine.|$|E
25|$|Another gene locus {{that has}} been {{associated}} with <b>narcolepsy</b> is EIF3G (rs3826784).|$|E
25|$|It can be {{difficult}} to differentiate between cataplexy brought on by <b>narcolepsy</b> and true sleep paralysis, because the two phenomena are physically indistinguishable. The best way to differentiate between the two is to note when the attacks occur most often. <b>Narcolepsy</b> attacks are more common when the individual is falling asleep; ISP and RISP attacks are more common upon awakening.|$|E

25|$|People with <b>narcolepsy</b> can be {{substantially}} helped, but not cured. Treatment is {{tailored to the}} individual, based on symptoms and therapeutic response. The time required to achieve optimal control of symptoms is highly variable and may take several months or longer. Medication adjustments are frequently necessary, and complete control of symptoms is seldom possible. While oral medications are the mainstay of formal <b>narcolepsy</b> treatment, lifestyle changes are also important.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{may occur}} {{in those who}} are otherwise healthy, those with <b>narcolepsy,</b> or may run in families {{as a result of}} specific genetic changes. The condition can be triggered by sleep deprivation, psychological stress, or abnormal sleep cycles. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a dysfunction in REM sleep. Diagnosis is based on a person's description. Other conditions that can present similarly include <b>narcolepsy,</b> atonic seizure, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{relatively}} easy when all the symptoms of <b>narcolepsy</b> are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. It is also possible for cataplexy to occur in isolation. Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing <b>narcolepsy</b> are the polysomnogram, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and administration of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist. The polysomnogram involves continuous recording of sleep brain waves {{and a number of}} nerve and muscle functions during night time sleep. When tested, people with <b>narcolepsy</b> fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may often awaken during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.|$|E
25|$|HLA DR2 is {{strongly}} {{positively correlated with}} Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, <b>narcolepsy</b> and multiple sclerosis, and negatively correlated with DM Type 1.|$|E
25|$|The primary genetic {{factor that}} has been {{strongly}} implicated {{in the development of}} <b>narcolepsy</b> involves an area of chromosome 6 known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. Specific variations in HLA genes are strongly correlated with the presence of narcolepsy; however, these variations are not required for the condition to occur and sometimes occur in individuals without <b>narcolepsy.</b> These genetic variations in the HLA complex are thought to increase the risk of an auto-immune response to orexin-releasing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus.|$|E
25|$|The only common medical use for GHB {{today are}} in the {{treatment}} of <b>narcolepsy</b> and more rarely alcoholism. It is sometimes used off-label for the treatment of fibromyalgia.|$|E
25|$|Some {{supplemental}} melatonin users {{report an}} increase in vivid dreaming. Extremely high doses of melatonin increased REM sleep time and dream activity in people both with and without <b>narcolepsy.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, “there is no {{evidence}} that the pathophysiology or therapeutic response is substantially different for hypersomnia with or without SOREMPs on the MSLT.” Given this currently understood overlap of idiopathic hypersomnia and <b>narcolepsy,</b> the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) is also updating its classification of the primary hypersomnias. It reclassifies <b>narcolepsy</b> without cataplexy as major somnolence disorder (MSD). Additionally, MSD will encompass all syndromes of hypersomnolence not explained by low orexin concentrations, including idiopathic hypersomnia (with and without long sleep time) and long sleepers (people requiring >10hours sleep/day).|$|E
25|$|<b>Narcolepsy</b> has its typical onset in {{adolescence}} and young adulthood. There is an average 15-year delay between onset and correct diagnosis which {{may contribute substantially to}} the disabling {{features of the}} disorder. Cognitive, educational, occupational, and psychosocial problems associated with the excessive daytime sleepiness of <b>narcolepsy</b> have been documented. For these to occur in the crucial teen years when education, development of self-image, and development of occupational choice are taking place is especially devastating. While cognitive impairment does occur, it may only be a reflection of the excessive daytime somnolence.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy: Lesions {{along the}} PPT/LDT nuclei are {{associated}} with <b>narcolepsy.</b> There is a significant down-regulation of PPN output {{and a loss of}} orexin peptides, promoting the excessive daytime sleepiness that is characteristic of this disorder.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, {{the first}} symptom of <b>narcolepsy</b> to appear is {{excessive}} and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. The other symptoms may begin {{alone or in}} combination months or years after {{the onset of the}} daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with <b>narcolepsy</b> experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not. A rare subset of narcoleptics also experience a heightened sense of taste and smell known as the supertaster phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Though no large {{trials have}} taken place which focus on the {{treatment}} of sleep paralysis, several drugs have promise in case studies. Two trials of GHB for people with <b>narcolepsy</b> demonstrated reductions in sleep paralysis episodes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Narcolepsy</b> is a {{long-term}} neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Symptoms include periods of excessive daytime sleepiness that usually last from seconds to minutes and may occur at any time. About 70% of those affected also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength, known as cataplexy. These spells can be brought on by strong emotions. Less commonly there may be inability to move or vivid hallucinations while falling asleep or waking up. People with <b>narcolepsy</b> tend to sleep {{about the same number}} of hours per day as people without, but the quality of sleep tends to be worse.|$|E
25|$|The main {{treatment}} of {{excessive daytime sleepiness}} in <b>narcolepsy</b> is central nervous system stimulants such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, modafinil, and armodafinil. In late 2007 an alert for severe adverse skin reactions to modafinil was issued by the FDA.|$|E
25|$|The neural {{control of}} normal sleep {{states and the}} {{relationship}} to <b>narcolepsy</b> are only partially understood. In humans, narcoleptic sleep {{is characterized by a}} tendency to go abruptly from a waking state to REM sleep with little or no intervening non-REM sleep. The changes in the motor and proprioceptive systems during REM sleep have been studied in both human and animal models. During normal REM sleep, spinal and brainstem alpha motor neuron hyperpolarization produces almost complete atonia of skeletal muscles via an inhibitory descending reticulospinal pathway. Acetylcholine {{may be one of the}} neurotransmitters involved in this pathway. In <b>narcolepsy,</b> the reflex inhibition of the motor system seen in cataplexy has features normally seen only in normal REM sleep.|$|E
