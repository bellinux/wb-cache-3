The exact date of its discovery is not known; evidence of burnt animal bones at the Cradle of Humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before 1 Ma; scholarly consensus indicates that Homo erectus had controlled fire by between 500 and 400 ka.

25|$|Increased {{nitrogen}} uptake by marsh species {{into their}} leaves can prompt greater rates of length-specific leaf growth, {{and increase the}} herbivory rates of crabs. The burrowing crab Neohelice granulata frequents SW Atlantic salt marshes where high density populations can be found among populations of the marsh species Spartina densiflora and Sarcocornia perennis. In Mar Chiquita lagoon, north of Mar del Plata, Argentina, Neohelice granulata herbivory increased as a likely response to the increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>value</b> of the leaves of fertilised Spartina densiflora plots, compared to non-fertilised plots. Regardless of whether the plots were fertilised or not, grazing by Neohelice granulata also reduced the length specific leaf growth rates of the leaves in summer, while increasing their length-specific senescence rates. This may have been assisted by the increased fungal effectiveness on the wounds left by the crabs.|$|E
25|$|The {{nutritional}} requirements of cattle are usually divided into maintenance requirements, which {{depend on the}} cow’s weight; and milk production requirements, which in turn depend on the volume of milk the cow is producing. The nutritional contents of each available feed are used to formulate a diet that meets all nutritional needs in the most cost effective way. Notably, cattle must be fed a diet high in fiber to maintain a proper environment for the rumen microbes. Farmers typically grow their own forage for their cattle. Crops grown may include corn, alfalfa, timothy, wheat, oats, sorghum and clover. These plants are often processed after harvest to preserve or improve <b>nutrient</b> <b>value</b> and prevent spoiling. Corn, alfalfa, wheat, oats, and sorghum crops are often anaerobically fermented to create silage. Many crops such as alfalfa, timothy, oats, and clover are allowed to dry in the field after cutting before being baled into hay.|$|E

2500|$|Kudzu {{can be used}} by grazing animals, as it is high {{in quality}} as a forage and {{palatable}} to livestock. [...] It can be grazed until frost and even slightly after. [...] Kudzu had been used in the southern United States specifically to feed goats on land that had limited resources. [...] Kudzu hay typically has a 15–18% crude protein content and over 60% total digestible <b>nutrient</b> <b>value.</b> [...] The quality of the leaves decreases, however, as vine content increases relative to the leaf content. [...] Kudzu also has low forage yields despite its rate of growth, yielding around two to four tons of dry matter per acre annually. [...] It is also difficult to bale due to its vining growth and its slowness in shedding water. [...] This makes it necessary to place kudzu hay under sheltered protection after being baled. [...] Kudzu is readily consumed by all types of grazing animals, yet frequent grazing over three to four years can ruin stands. [...] Thus, kudzu only serves well as a grazing crop on a temporary basis.|$|E

30|$|Investigating {{traditional}} ecological knowledge (TEK) by {{the scientific}} approach is a useful way to develop sustainable rangeland management. Numerous trials have been done on plant species compositions and biomass, but little testing {{has been done on}} the TEK of plant productivity and <b>nutrient</b> <b>values,</b> which are important for proper rangeland management. In this study, we tested the TEK of pastoralists living in Bulgan, northern Mongolia, regarding plant productivity and <b>nutrient</b> <b>values.</b> We examined biomass, growth form, plant productivity, and crude protein amounts along grazing gradients. The results showed that biomass declined and the number of erect-form plants decreased as grazing intensity increased, although plant productivity and crude protein amounts did not differ along the grazing gradient. This indicates that the pastoralists' evaluation of pastures dominated by narrow plants (Mongolian: nariin ovs) accurately reflects the productivity of the land, suggesting that their evaluation is reasonable in terms of the carrying capacity. This assessment of the ecological status of Mongolian rangelands provides a foundation for ecologically sound and culturally appropriate rangeland management.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince {{nutrient}} {{composition of}} pork {{has changed over}} the past two decades, a collaborative study was conducted by scientists at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Texas Tech University and the National Pork Board to determine current <b>nutrient</b> <b>values.</b> The purpose was to obtain analytical nutrient data for three highly consumed fresh pork products in the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) and to compare the results to data obtained in 1992. Bone-in baby back ribs (BKR), boneless sirloin roast (SRB), and bone-in blade chops (BCB) were purchased from 12 retail outlets using a nationwide sampling plan developed for USDA's National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>values</b> for proximate, cholesterol, and minerals were determined by commercial laboratories using validated methodology including quality control procedures. The 1992 data used for comparison were derived from analyses of samples of raw fresh pork retail cuts which were obtained from supermarkets in 15 cities across the US in a nation-wide market basket study. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>values</b> from 1992 and 2010 for equivalent cuts were statistically evaluated using a paired two-tailed T-test (critical value p< 0. 05). Comparing 2010 values to 1992 values, moisture was significantly higher (p< 0. 001) while total fat was lower (p< 0. 001) in all three cuts. Cholesterol was significantly less in two of the three cuts. Sodium values for 2010 were higher in all three cuts by 7 - 24 % but still below 90 mg/ 100 g. Phosphorus was higher (p< 0. 05) in 2010 whereas iron was lower (p< 0. 001). Values for potassium, calcium, and zinc varied between the two data sets.

50|$|Before the {{construction}} of the High Dam, the Nile deposited sediments of various particle size - consisting of fine sand, silt and clay - on fields in Upper Egypt through its annual flood, contributing to soil fertility. However, the <b>nutrient</b> <b>value</b> of the sediment has often been overestimated. 88 percent of the sediment was carried to the sea before {{the construction}} of the High Dam. The <b>nutrient</b> <b>value</b> added to the land by the sediment was only 6,000 tons of potash, 7,000 tons of phosphorus pentoxide and 17,000 tons of nitrogen.
