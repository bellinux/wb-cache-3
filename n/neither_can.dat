5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> be controlled or stopped.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} phase (July 2010 to December 2012), only the forestry sector {{will be able}} to convert the NZUs allocated to them to Assigned amount units that can be sold to overseas buyers.

5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the gun that killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter in a barrel of {{hydrofluoric}} acid. During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neither</b> <b>can</b> the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E
5|$|Stace {{was praised}} for his clarity and ambitious aims in Time and Eternity by Abraham Kaplan who {{believed}} {{the book was}} one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for the appropriateness of religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels of being in the manner of Samuel Alexander. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.|$|E
50|$|In Western chess, {{stalemate}} {{is achieved}} when no legal moves are possible. However, the stalemate {{is not a}} draw in janggi. The player must skip the turn when all the moves are impossible. If <b>neither</b> player <b>can</b> move legally, or if <b>neither</b> player <b>can</b> win because <b>neither</b> player has enough pieces, the game ends in a draw.|$|R

5|$|There {{are small}} {{enclosed}} chambers {{to either side}} of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with an imitation pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there is a window on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so neither are strictly speaking altars, and <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> be used for a Eucharistic service.|$|E
5|$|While being {{examined}} {{to increase his}} ninja rank, Naruto meets the legendary ninja Jiraiya and learns how to summon toads to aid him in battle, and to control part of the Nine Tails's chakra energy. The exams are interrupted by the invasion of Konohagakure by the criminal Orochimaru and the ninja of Sunagakure. Naruto defeats the sand village's One Tail Jinchuriki Gaara and convinces him {{there is a better}} way to live. Shortly afterward, Naruto discovers the Akatsuki, a criminal organization that seeks to extract the Nine-Tails from his body. Though Jiraiya drives them off during this first meeting, learning its member Itachi is both Sasuke's brother, and the man who killed their family, the Akatsuki still plan to kidnap Naruto. While accompanying Jiraiya to find a new village leader, Naruto also learns the Rasengan, a sphere of chakra for offensive purposes. When Sasuke leaves the village to join Orochimaru's forces to obtain the power to kill Itachi, Naruto becomes part of a rescue team to retrieve him. Naruto and Sasuke ultimately have a one-on-one battle, though <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> bring himself to finish off the other. The two go their separate ways, but Naruto does not give up on Sasuke, leaving Konoha with Jiraiya to prepare himself for his next encounter with Sasuke and the Akatsuki.|$|E

Niqabi women, just like women wearing hijab, cannot work as public servants, <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> they continue studies at schools, including the private schools.

25|$|In this formula, what {{constitutes}} benefit or harm largely varies by {{personal and cultural}} values, but general conclusions can still be drawn. For example, if the only expected effect of a medical test is to make one disease more likely than another, but the two diseases have the same treatment (or <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> be treated), then ri = 0 and the test is essentially without any benefit for the individual.|$|E
25|$|Article 14 {{does not}} define the offence of {{contempt}} and hence by necessary implication it {{is left to}} the courts to define it. Justice Loh stated that, in defining the offence, judges must be cognizant that the definition must be circumscribed by Article 14, to ensure {{a balance between the}} freedom of speech and the offence. <b>Neither</b> <b>can</b> be defined in a way that renders the other otiose.|$|E
25|$|Sverdlov {{approaches}} the question from a morphological standpoint. Noting that the modifying component in Germanic compound words {{can take the}} form of a genitive or a bare root, he points to behavioural similarities between genitive determinants and the modifying element in regular Old Norse compound words, such as the fact that <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> be modified by a free-standing (declined) adjective. According to this view, all kennings are formally compounds, notwithstanding widespread tmesis.|$|E

25|$|This {{question}} about what comes first (the functions or the constellation) is not an inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (dependency and constituency grammars) is not narrowly limited to the traditional views. Dependency and constituency are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, be they dependency- or constituency-based, will likely reject {{the notion that the}} functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. They will take both to be primitive, which means <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> be derived from the other.|$|E
25|$|Abrahams {{reached the}} {{conclusion}} that the only solution was to end the status of resident native, leaving him free to quit the estate or to stay there on terms satisfactory both to himself and the landlord, substituting contractual for statutory rights. The 1948 Land Planning Committee of senior civil servants did not wholly agree with Abraham’s recommendations, holding the view that 'African and European enterprise in Nyasaland are complementary and inter-dependent; <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> progress without the goodwill of the other; both must be prepared to co-operate for their mutual benefit and progress'. Under this two-fold policy land could still, under certain conditions, be alienated to non-Africans.|$|E
25|$|Structuration is {{very useful}} in synthesising micro and macro issues. On a micro scale, one of individuals' {{internal}} {{sense of self}} and identity, consider the example of a family: we are increasingly free to choose our own mates and how to relate with them, which creates new opportunities but also more work, as the relationship becomes a reflexive project that has to be interpreted and maintained. Yet this micro-level change cannot be explained only by looking at the individual level as people did not spontaneously change their minds about how to live; <b>neither</b> <b>can</b> we assume they were directed to do so by social institutions and the state.|$|E
