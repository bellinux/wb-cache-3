5|$|When Bart, Lisa and Maggie {{come home}} from trick-or-treating, Marge {{switches}} out the candy with dental hygiene products and asks Homer to deliver the candy to a drive for the troops overseas. Homer instead runs off with the bag to eat its contents in privacy at a canyon cliff. Unfortunately, Homer trips and falls {{to the bottom of}} the canyon with his arm pinned. Fueled by his <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> out-of-reach bag of candy, and reluctant to wait twenty minutes for help, Homer is forced to chew off his arm. Though he manages it after a few tries, Homer learns that he was carrying a bag of vegetables, as Bart, Lisa and Maggie had secretly stolen back their candy, inciting an upset Homer to scream in rage.|$|E
5|$|Tizard put his {{thoughts}} in a 27 April 1936 letter to Hugh Dowding, {{who was at}} that time the Air Member for Research and Development. He also sent a copy to Watt, who forwarded it to the researchers who were moving to their new research station at Bawdsey Manor. In a meeting at the Crown and Castle pub, Bowen pressed Watt for permission to form a group to study the possibility of placing a radar on the aircraft itself. This would mean the CH stations would only <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> fighter into the general area of the bomber, the fighter would be able to use its own radar {{for the rest of the}} interception. Watt was eventually convinced that the staffing needed to support development of both CH and a new system was available, and the Airborne Group was spun off from the CH effort in August 1936.|$|E

The London Fire Brigade told Newsnight the first attendance procedure for tower fires has now been changed from four engines to five engines plus a high ladder unit.

25|$|The coxswain {{would then}} call, 'Boat manned,' to the {{telephone}} operator at the loading station, who, in turn, reported to the 'LC' Control Room. The coxswain would then warn the troops to mind the pulleys {{at the ends of}} falls fore and aft, which could wave freely about when the craft had been set in the water. The task of hooking on and casting off from the ship required skill and seamanship from the coxswain, bowman, and sternsheetsman. The snatch blocks used were heavy steel and difficult to handle. The bowman and sternsheetsman stood by his respective block, as the craft was lowered into the water. At a time when there was sufficient slack in the falls both had to cast off at the same instant, and the blocks had to be released while there was slack in the falls. If the boat was not freed at both ends at once {{the rise and fall of}} the sea could cause the boat to tip, swamp, and perhaps capsize with loss of life. Casting-off was done in all sorts of sea conditions, and the sea might be rising and falling a metre or more (6' swells were not uncommon on D-Day). A combination of skill and luck could redeem a failure to cast-off, nevertheless. On D-Day, an LCA of Royal Marine 535 Flotilla, LSI Glenearn, released all but its after falls, which were jammed, and the craft tilted alarmingly to 45 degrees. The coxswain kept his head, calming the passengers, while seamen worked to free the falls. Once free, the coxswain <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> LCA away to prevent colliding with the towering side of the LSI as it rose and fell with the swells.|$|E

500|$|Charlie's {{sexuality}} was sidelined and {{she began}} a relationship with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz). Throughout their romance Charlie played out various family oriented plots and was described as having strong feelings for him. Their romance was portrayed to be wayward and unstable. In 2011, their relationship ended after producers felt {{there were no more}} storylines to give to the pair. Charlie later develops feelings for Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke). Another notable storyline for Charlie saw her reveal that her supposed sister, Ruby, was in fact her daughter. Anderson said the filming process was challenging as they felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> story right. Viewers sympathised with Charlie and saw a [...] "beautiful element" [...] in the portrayal. The revelation ruined the on-screen relationship between Charlie and Ruby, and was never repaired.|$|E

2500|$|Spurrier {{had been}} {{considered}} for the starting quarterback position leading up to his sophomore year of 1964, but a serious knee injury suffered during spring drills caused him to lose practice time and allowed returning senior starter Tommy Shannon to keep the job. Coach Ray Graves still felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> future star on the field, {{so he decided to}} alternate his two quarterbacks as the flow of the game dictated. Spurrier entered the season opening game against SMU [...] in the second quarter. After two unsuccessful running plays called from the sidelines left the Gators in a third down and long situation, Coach Graves told Spurrier to call the next play himself. The young quarterback responded by completing a fifty-six yard screen pass on his first collegiate attempt and a touchdown on his second pass. Spurrier would add another touchdown pass {{during the second half of}} his varsity debut. The following week on the road at Mississippi State, Spurrier entered a tied game late in the fourth quarter and led the Gators down the field for a game-winning field goal.|$|E

2500|$|... {{on behalf}} of some 132 cosponsors, {{introduced}} this measure. I {{would also like to}} thank Mr. Lampson from Texas as the Chairman of the Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, and Mr. Ose from the State of California, who have devoted much of their time to raising our level of awareness of the growing problem of international child abduction. [...] We are taking action on this measure {{on behalf of}} the parents of our abducted and wrongfully retained children. These left-behind parents have put their faith and trust in an international agreement, The Hague Convention, which is clear and explicit on the obligation of signatory governments to return an abducted or wrongfully retained child to his or her country of habitual residence. Nevertheless, we have found that in a number of nations, for a variety of reasons, this does not occur, and the resultant frustration, heartbreak and outrage has led us to act on the measure before us today. [...] I should also add that we need to have our State Department do more to promote compliance with The Hague Convention. The return of an abducted or illegally retained child should be on the top of the Secretary’s meetings with any official of a country involved in such cases. [...] This is not a problem that should be handled as a routine exchange of diplomatic notes or phone calls by junior U.S. officials to their foreign counterparts. We need to see some concern and some concrete actions by the highest levels of our government to redress what is, evidently, a growing international problem. [...] It is our hope that by adopting this resolution, and sending it to the floor for speedy action, we will send a strong signal that this is an issue that we care deeply about. We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> attention of the Governments of Germany, Sweden, Austria, Mexico, and Honduras that they cannot expect The Hague Convention to be a one-way street.|$|E
