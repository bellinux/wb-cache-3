2500|$|It {{takes over}} one hour for Marinol to reach full {{systemic}} effect, compared to seconds or minutes for smoked or vaporized cannabis. Some people accustomed to inhaling just enough cannabis smoke to manage symptoms have complained of too-intense intoxication from Marinol's predetermined dosages. Many people using Marinol {{have said that}} Marinol produces a more acute psychedelic effect than cannabis, {{and it has been}} speculated that this disparity {{can be explained by the}} moderating effect of the many non-THC cannabinoids present in cannabis. For that reason, alternative THC-containing medications based on botanical extracts of the cannabis plant such as nabiximols are being developed. Mark Kleiman, director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at UCLA's School of Public Affairs said of Marinol, [...] "It wasn't any fun and made the user feel bad, so it could be approved without any fear that it would penetrate the recreational market, and then used as a club with which to beat back the advocates of whole cannabis as a medicine." [...] Mr. Kleiman's opinion notwithstanding, clinical trials comparing the use of cannabis extracts with Marinol in the treatment of cancer cachexia have demonstrated equal efficacy and well-being among subjects in the two treatment arms. United States federal law currently registers dronabinol as a Schedule III controlled substance, but all other cannabinoids remain Schedule I, except synthetics like <b>nabilone.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the U.S., the FDA has {{approved}} two oral cannabinoids {{for use as}} medicine: dronabinol and <b>nabilone.</b> Dronabinol, synthetic THC, is listed as Schedule III, meaning it has some potential for dependence. <b>Nabilone,</b> a synthetic cannabinoid, is Schedule II, indicating high potential for side effects and addiction. Both received approval {{for sale in the}} U.S. in 1985. Nabiximols, an oromucosal spray derived from two strains of Cannabis sativa and containing THC and CBD, is not approved in the U.S., but is approved in several European countries, Canada, and New Zealand as of 2013.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nabilone</b> {{entered the}} clinic in 1981 as an {{antiemetic}}. Synthetic THC (marinol, dronabinol) entered the clinic in 1985 as an antiemetic {{and again in}} 1991 as an appetite stimulant.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nabilone</b> is a {{synthetic}} cannabinoid with therapeutic {{use as an}} antiemetic and as an adjunct analgesic for neuropathic pain. It mimics tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound found naturally occurring in Cannabis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nabilone</b> was {{approved}} in Austria to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea in 2013; {{it was already}} approved in Spain for the same indication and was legal in Belgium to treat glaucoma, spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis, wasting from AIDS, and chronic pain.|$|E
50|$|The FDA in the USA has {{indicated}} <b>nabilone</b> for chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting. In other countries, such as Canada, {{it is widely}} used as an adjunct therapy for chronic pain management.

50|$|The {{cannabinoid}} <b>nabilone</b> {{is sometimes}} used off-label for nightmares in PTSD. Although some short-term benefit was shown, adverse effects are common {{and it has}} not been adequately studied to determine efficacy. Additionally, there are other treatments with stronger efficacy and less risks (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants, adrenergic inhibitors). The use of medical marijuana for PTSD is controversial, with only a handful of states permitting its use for that purpose.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} of THC analogs (synhexyl, <b>nabilone,</b> nabitan, nantradol) featured slight variations of the THC molecule, such as esterifying the phenolic hydroxy group, extending and branching of the pentyl side chain, or substituting nitrogen for oxygen in the benzopyran ring. These analogs can be grouped into classical (HU-210), bicyclic (CP-55,940), and tricyclic (CP-55,244). Tritium-labelled cannabinoids such as ³HCP-55,940 were instrumental in discovering the cannabinoid receptors in the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Levonantradol (CP 50,556-1) is a {{synthetic}} cannabinoid analog of dronabinol (Marinol) developed by Pfizer in the 1980s. It is around 30x more potent than THC, and exhibits antiemetic and analgesic effects via activation of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Levonantradol is not currently used in medicine as dronabinol or <b>nabilone</b> are {{felt to be}} more useful for most conditions, however it is widely used in research into the potential therapeutic applications of cannabinoids.|$|E

There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions for the utility of the cannabinoids <b>nabilone</b> and nabiximols. There are some in vitro studies indicating the beneficial effect of erythropoietin on the diabetic neuropathy; however, one nerve conduction study in mild-moderate diabetic individuals showed that erythropoietin alone or in combination with gabapentin does not have any beneficial effect on progression of diabetic neuropathy.|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} {{cannabis}} derivatives {{for medical use}} (Sativex, Marinol and <b>Nabilone)</b> were approved by the Danish Medicines Agency in 2011, but require prescription. These are primarily prescriped as a relief of pain and nausea in cancer patients, or to alleviate muscle stiffness in multiple sclerosis patients. Cannabis in other forms such as hashish and the raw plant are illegal, but from 2018 this and other variants will be prescribed on a trial basis to some patients with cancer, multiple sclerosis, spinal injury and chronic pain. Initially it was planned that the cannabis would be imported from other countries (notably the Netherlands) as it was illegal to grow in Denmark, but in 2017 {{it was decided that}} Danish farmers would be allowed to grow the plant under secured condition with a special permit. A poll shows that 88% of Danes support cannabis for medicinal use.|$|E
50|$|Apart from a {{synthetic}} cannabinoid called <b>Nabilone,</b> the only cannabis-based medicine licensed for medical prescription in the UK is Sativex. This medication can be prescribed {{by a doctor}} to treat nausea and vomiting caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy; the latter is indicated only {{for the treatment of}} spasticity caused by the degenerative, incurable and rare neurological-condition multiple sclerosis. For other indications approval needs to be first sought from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. EU residents prescribed medical products containing cannabis are permitted to be in possession of cannabis whilst freely travelling throughout the United Kingdom. Although it is possible to use all kinds of cannabis for medicinal purposes, some are more appropriate for specific conditions than others. However, this does not apply to UK-resident patients, who may not travel to the UK in possession of medicinal cannabis even if they managed to acquire a prescription in a country where it is legal.|$|E
50|$|Medical {{cannabis}} can {{be administered}} {{using a variety}} of methods, including liquid tinctures, vaporizing or smoking dried buds, eating cannabis edibles, taking capsules, using lozenges, dermal patches or oral/dermal sprays. Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription drugs in some countries; examples include: dronabinol and <b>nabilone.</b> Recreational use of cannabis is illegal {{in most parts of the}} world, but the medical use of cannabis is legal in certain countries, including Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands (where it is also legal recreationally), Portugal and Spain. Australia has passed laws to allow the use of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes in some states. In the United States, 29 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation permitting the possession, use, and distribution of medical cannabis in some form. Although cannabis remains prohibited for any use at the federal level, the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment was enacted in December 2014, limiting the ability of federal law to be enforced in states where medical cannabis has been legalized.|$|E
