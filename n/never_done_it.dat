He made his Test debut at Headingley in 1952, opening the innings, {{though he had}} <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> before this tour. He was among the four victims (others being Pankaj Roy, Vijay Manjrekar and Madhav Mantri) in India’s miserable 0–4 start in the second innings of the Headingley Test of 1952 with Fred Trueman playing havoc. His West Indies tour {{in the next year}} was {{terminated}} abruptly during the second Test when he collided with Vijay Hazare while going for a catch and dislocated his shoulder.|$|E

The band members {{did not wish to}} change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, [...] "There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something." ...|$|E

But there's only so much you can preach to someone if you've <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> I thought I could have someone like Janice because she's so outrageous." [...] Banks stated that she thought Dickinson provided a warning to models not to follow the path she had taken because it had proved dangerous:" [...] When she's telling a girl, 'Don't do this,' she's saying, 'Don't do this because it didn't work for me.' I {{thought it was a good}} balance." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} the final episode, [...] "These Are The Voyages..." [...] was mostly negative. For example, the Wisconsin State Journal described it as [...] "hands down the worst series finale ever". The episode featured a holodeck simulation on the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) from [...] during {{the events of the}} episode [...] "" [...] and the return of Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis). It was written by Berman and Braga, who responded to negative criticism of the episode by saying [...] "You have to remember that under normal circumstances most people probably would have thought this was a very cool episode because it has a great concept driving it". Berman later said that [...] "I would have <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> if I had known how people were going to react." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers were {{impressed}} with the way Lessing tackled the subject of sexual politics in the book. Paul Gray remarked in a review in Time magazine, that contrary to appearances, The Marriages is not a feminist parable, but added that while Lessing often wrote about gender conflict, she has <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> [...] "with more sweetness, compassion and wisdom" [...] as she has in this novel. Leonard commended Lessing for considering boths sides of the gender divide, for being both critical and forgiving of Ben Ata and Al•Ith. Leonard said that never before has Lessing written [...] "a gentler book", adding that her 1973 novel, Summer Before the Dark comes a close second. A reviewer in Kirkus Reviews also complemented Lessing on her handling of sexual conflict. While the review was critical of Lessing's prose style, and called her descriptions of the Zone Four war economy [...] "a silly cartoon sketch", it said that [...] "there is a... generosity about this work not quite like anything she has done".|$|E
500|$|Swanigan {{had several}} teams recruit him and offer scholarships; Arizona, Kentucky, Cal, and Duke {{were among the}} schools that gave Swanigan an offer. Caleb Swanigan {{verbally}} committed to Michigan State on April 10, 2015, but decommitted on May 7. He said, [...] "I just {{felt like it was}} better basketball-wise for me." [...] Similar to his high school decision, Barnes said, [...] "He wants to win a national championship and said he wants {{to do it in the}} state of Indiana and wanted to do it at a place he's <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> before." [...] Some people believe Barnes had ulterior motives in adopting Swanigan, to which Barnes said, [...] "Maybe if I wanted to develop the next hot-dog-eating champion, the next Joey Chestnut, people would have a legitimate gripe." [...] Swanigan had not consulted Barnes before he committed to Michigan State, and some believe that since Barnes played sports at Purdue he was a major influence in Swanigan decommitting from Michigan State. Barnes said that was not the reason Swanigan switched, and the primary reason for Swanigan choosing Purdue was the presence of two centers that were taller than 7', Isaac Haas and A.J. Hammons, which allowed Swanigan to play the 4 spot.|$|E

500|$|The record reached {{number one}} on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., where it sold 215,000 copies in its first week, which was a {{shortened}} three days. The album remained at {{number one on}} the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart for three weeks. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at #1, selling 79,770 copies in its first week and it has sold over 600,000 copies to date. In Canada, the album debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 30,000 copies in its first week. The album debuted at the top of sales charts in twenty four total countries, including a peak of {{number one on the}} European Top 100 Albums. 21st Century Breakdown was only released in a Parental Advisory version containing explicit lyrics and content; Walmart refuses to sell albums with a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members responded by stating: [...] "There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no.

The cat also smells so bad that Ellie no longer wants him in her room at night. Jud confirms that this condition is the rule, rather than the exception, for animals who have been resurrected in this fashion.

2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{difficulties}} with sampling, {{the band and}} production team eventually became comfortable with it, even sampling Mullen's drumming, the Edge's guitar riffs, Clayton's bass lines, and Bono's vocalisations. Howie B sampled almost anything he could {{in order to find}} interesting sounds. He created sequenced patterns of the Edge's guitar playing, which the guitarist, having <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> before, found very interesting. Howie B explained, [...] "Sometimes I would sample, say, a guitar, but it wouldn't come back sounding like a guitar; it might sound more like a pneumatic drill, because I would take the raw sound and filter it, really destroy the guitar sound, and rebuild it into something completely different." [...] Although sequencing was used, mostly on keyboards, guitar loops, and some percussion, it was used sparingly out of fear of becoming overreliant on it.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{first hit}} single, {{a cover of}} Neil Sedaka's and Howard Greenfield's [...] "Love Will Keep Us Together", reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart nine weeks after its 1975 debut, {{and went on to}} win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. It sold over 1 million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on July 1, 1975. Tennille paid tribute to Sedaka in the {{recording}} when she sang the overdub [...] "Sedaka is back" [...] during the single's outro. The duo successfully mined the Sedaka songbook a number of times over their chartmaking career. Two of their other hit singles were the Sedaka co-writes [...] "Lonely Night (Angel Face)" [...] and [...] "You <b>Never</b> <b>Done</b> <b>It</b> Like That". Their Spanish recording of [...] "Love Will Keep Us Together", [...] "Por Amor Viviremos", also charted in 1975; it was the first time two versions of the same single charted simultaneously. Tennille and Dragon included renditions of several other Sedaka songs on their albums.|$|E
2500|$|A {{controversy}} ensued as {{to whether}} the rope had actually been cut, but a formal investigation could not find any proof, and Peter Taugwalder was acquitted. The rope had snapped between Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. Whymper asked Taugwalder to see the rope and to his surprise he saw that it was the oldest and weakest of the ropes they brought and it was only intended as a reserve. All those who had fallen had been tied with a Manila rope, or with a second and equally strong one, and consequently it had been only between the survivors and those who had fallen where the weaker rope had been used. Whymper also had suggested to Hudson that they should have attached a rope to the rocks on the most difficult place, and held it as they descended, as an additional protection. Hudson approved the idea, but it was <b>never</b> <b>done.</b> <b>It</b> can be deduced that Taugwalder had no other choice but to use a weaker rope as the stronger rope was not long enough to connect Traugwalder to Douglas. The account of Whymper's attempts on the Matterhorn occupies the greater part of his book, Scrambles amongst the Alps (1871), in which the illustrations are engraved by Whymper himself. [...] The accident haunted Whymper: ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} started afresh {{in early}} 2012, returning to Droste's mother's home in Cape Cod, where the band had previously recorded its second studio album, Yellow House (2006). Commenting {{on the return}} to Yellow House, Droste noted, [...] "It's so funny that we went back there in the end. It's my grandmother's house, we know it, and we can use it for free. And {{as soon as we}} got there, things started happening. [...] We just sat by the fire, Dan strumming, me singing, and it happened. Some of the best songs on the record, like [...] "Speak in Rounds" [...] and [...] "Half Gate", came out of that. We stayed there in isolation for two months straight." [...] Droste stated that he and Rossen decided to [...] "'try writing from the bottom up. We've <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> before.' There's a little bit of fear there because it's a new process we've never tried. We've never sat side by side and said, 'Let's literally, out of the ether, start writing songs together.' A couple of songs came that way, and that's why they're verse me, chorus Dan. [...] Suddenly the synergy hit, and the momentum struck, and then everyone got excited. And that's when the ball started to roll, and then we just started playing around, and people were much more open."" ...|$|E
