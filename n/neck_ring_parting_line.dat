Note to Practitioners — Molding {{is the process of}} manufacturing a part by shaping a pliable raw material, such as molten plastic or metal, using a rigid mold. The material hardens and sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. To remove the part from the mold without destroying the mold, the mold must be made of multiple pieces. In the simplest case, a two-part mold is used, and these parts are separated in opposite directions. The curves {{on the surface of the}} part where the pieces of the mold meet are called ‘parting lines’. For a manufacturing perspective, a smooth <b>parting</b> <b>line</b> is more applicable than a theoretically correct <b>parting</b> <b>line.</b> We give a novel method to compute such a <b>parting</b> <b>line</b> in this paper.

Rose-ringed parakeets measure on average 40 cm in length, including the tail feathers, {{a large portion of}} their total length. Their average single-wing length is about 15 - 17.5 cm. In the wild, this is a noisy species with an unmistakable squawking call. It is herbivorous and not migratory.|$|R
5000|$|The South Ndebele {{peoples of}} Africa also wear <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> {{as part of}} their {{traditional}} dress and as a sign of wealth and status. Only married women are allowed to wear the rings, called dzilla. Metal rings are also worn on different parts of the body, not just the <b>neck.</b> The <b>rings</b> are usually made of copper or brass. Although it can vary from person to person whether the removal of <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> can cause pain, if they are removed incorrectly this may result in death. The custom requires that the girls who do choose to wear the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> start before puberty {{in order to get the}} body used to them. These heavy coils can weigh as much as 11 pounds (before puberty, as they will add more rings later down the line.) The <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> put a huge strain on the body. Once a persons  neck has adjusted to the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> they have to leave the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> on permanently. Because the rings have been on these women for such a long time, this weakens the neck muscles causing the neck to essentially not being able to support itself. The neck muscles will tire quickly  and not be able to carry the weight of the head in other words; when the neck is no longer able to fulfill its function it is very likely that it will collapse, thus resulting in suffocation.|$|R
