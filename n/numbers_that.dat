5|$|Interstate, U.S., {{and state}} routes have {{maintenance}} road <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> {{often do not}} match their signed route numbers. For instance, DE 261 in New Castle County is designated as Road 203. In Sussex County, several state routes largely have matching maintenance road numbers; for example, {{the entire length of}} DE 24 is designated Road 24. Some routes in Sussex County have maintenance road <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> reflect former route designations; an example is the section of US 9 between Laurel and Georgetown which is designated Road 28, reflecting the former DE 28 designation along this stretch of road.|$|E
5|$|A {{convenient}} {{means of}} determining {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E

5|$|The SSEM {{represented}} negative numbers using two's complement, as most computers still do. In that representation, {{the value}} of the most significant bit denotes the sign of a number; positive numbers have a zero in that position and negative numbers a one. Thus the range of <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> could be held in each 32-bit word was −231 to +231−1 (decimal: −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647).|$|E

5|$|A {{large part}} of Mercator's income came from the sales of his {{terrestrial}} and celestial globes. For sixty years they {{were considered to be}} the finest in the world, and they were sold in such great <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> there are many surviving examples. This was a substantial enterprise involving making the spheres, printing the gores, building substantial stands, packing and distributing all over Europe. He was also renowned for his scientific instruments, particularly his astrolabes and astronomical rings used to study the geometry of astronomy and astrology.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas. Individuals {{found in the}} west of its geographic range (areas like the Great Lakes and the Midwest United States) have a paler complexion {{on the inside of}} the legs and underside of the neck than ones found in the east (places including the Appalachian Mountains, New York, and Pennsylvania). Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount of diversity considering the decline in <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E

5|$|Case No. 1 {{contained}} {{a selection of}} lamps that represented the basics of the technology involved {{in the early stages}} of the electric light bulb development. The case displayed actual physical light bulbs made by Thomas Edison and others from 1878 to 1883. Edison's earliest steps in the bamboo filament and graphite filament lamps are displayed in this case. The first lamp made in a pear shape was in this display, which was the universal shape for electric light bulbs for decades. These in this display case contained <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> ranged from 1 – 109.|$|E
5|$|Feeding almost {{exclusively}} on octopuses and other cephalopods, the Australian weasel shark mostly hunts near the sea floor. It is viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished through a placental connection and born after a six-month gestation period. This species is productive for a shark, with females bearing litters of 1–19 pups usually twice per year. The Australian weasel shark is caught by trawl {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnet and longline fisheries, though not in such <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> its population is threatened. Thus, it has been listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{pelicans}} {{can usually}} {{cope with their}} lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. The pouch louse Piagetiella peralis, which occurs in the pouch and therefore cannot be removed by preening, is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> it covers the whole interior of the pouch, but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host. The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes Contracaecum multipapillatum and C. mexicanum and the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island. In May 2012, hundreds of Peruvian pelicans {{were reported to have}} perished in Peru from a combination of starvation and roundworm infestation.|$|E

5|$|In April 2015, fans mistook random <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> {{were placed}} by Cawthon into the source {{code of the}} game's {{official}} website to be coordinates that pointed to a location significant to the games. Fans entered these numbers into Google Maps and consequently discovered a pizzeria in Virginia. Mass phone calls {{were made to the}} pizzeria by fans, attempting to discover if the company had a connection to the upcoming installment, Five Nights at Freddy's 4. It was later confirmed by Cawthon that this pizzeria had no connection with the Five Nights at Freddy's series.|$|E
5|$|In May 1871, Grant ordered {{federal troops}} to help marshals in arresting Klansmen. That October, Grant {{suspended}} habeas corpus {{in part of}} South Carolina and sent federal troops {{to enforce the law}} there. After prosecutions by Akerman and his replacement, George Henry Williams, the Klan's power collapsed; by 1872, elections in the South saw African Americans voting in record <b>numbers.</b> <b>That</b> same year, Grant signed the Amnesty Act, which restored political rights to former Confederates. Lacking sufficient funding, the Justice Department stopped prosecutions of the Klan in June 1873; civil rights prosecutions continued throughout Grant's second term but with fewer yearly cases and convictions. Additionally, Grant's Postmaster General John Creswell, using his patronage powers, integrated the postal system and appointed African American postmasters across the nation.|$|E
5|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, {{journalist}} Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), {{co-owner of}} Millennium magazine, {{has lost a}} libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family's compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing {{a list of names}} and <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> no one has been able to decipher.|$|E
50|$|Tax profit or {{taxable profit}} {{is used to}} {{distinguish}} between accounting profit or earnings (the <b>number</b> <b>that</b> is generally referred to in financial results for public companies and quoted in the press).

50|$|In {{the same}} way that when summing the squares of the digits (and working in base 10) each number above 243(=3*81) {{produces}} a <b>number</b> <b>that</b> is strictly smaller, when summing the cubes of the digits each number above 2916(=4*729) produces a <b>number</b> <b>that</b> is strictly smaller.|$|R
50|$|Mexico granted 975 Venezuelans {{permanent}} identification {{cards in}} the first 5 months of 2014 alone, a <b>number</b> <b>that</b> doubled that of Venezuelans granted ID cards altogether in 2013 and a <b>number</b> <b>that</b> would have represented 35% of all Venezuelan Mexicans in Mexico in the year 2000.|$|R
5|$|In {{the uniform}} cost model (suitable for {{analyzing}} {{the complexity of}} gcd calculation on <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> fit into a single machine word), {{each step of the}} algorithm takes constant time, and Lamé's analysis implies that the total running time is also O(h). However, in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers, the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as O(h2). In this case the total time for all of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a telescoping series, showing that it is also O(h2). Modern algorithmic techniques based on the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up, leading to quasilinear algorithms for the GCD.|$|E
5|$|Other {{pressures}} on O'Neill's colonization plan were {{the high cost}} of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the 1979 oil crisis. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. Eventual accounting of the full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight.|$|E
5|$|Recent extinctions can be {{directly}} attributable to human influences. The IUCN characterizes 'recent' extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500, and around 80 mammal species have gone extinct since that time and 2015. Some species, such as the Père David's deer are extinct in the wild, and survive solely in captive populations. Other species, such as the Florida panther, are ecologically extinct, surviving in such low <b>numbers</b> <b>that</b> they essentially have {{no impact on the}} ecosystem. Other populations are only locally extinct (extirpated), still existing elsewhere, but reduced in distribution, as with the extinction of gray whales in the Atlantic.|$|E
