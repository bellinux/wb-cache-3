The B.C. forest sector has had a large reduction in the amount of GHG from use of fossil fuels used in deforestation, going down from 4 million tons of carbon emissions in 1990 to 1.8 million tons in 2006. The reduction in deforestation B.C. has had over the years has been favourable to the reduction in carbon emissions, as forests clean the air by collecting both carbon and pollutants.|$|E

With landowners facing increasing regulatory complexity, increasing demand for a diversity of forest outputs, and economic pressures to convert to <b>non-forest</b> <b>uses,</b> it is important to understand the financial principles that drive economic viability. A fundamental principle is that the value of money is time-sensitive such that present costs and benefits carry greater weight than those in the future. This has profound implications given the long-term nature of forestry investments. The principles of compounding and discounting allow for equivalent comparisons of costs and benefits occurring at disparate times. These principles are the key to understanding the economic value of land and timber, and they allow for analysis of economic optimization relative to both timber and non-timber values. Likewise they allow for analysis of the economic impacts of policy measures such as taxes and regulations, providing important insights to help policymakers to better achieve goals and avoid unintended consequences. ...|$|R

Furthermore where they are sufficiently sophisticated as to make explicit forecasts of future valuation parameters such as log prices at harvest date as is the case for discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis they do so with unavoidable imprecision. These shortcomings - as well of those of even less sophisticated methodologies such as cost- or transaction-based valuations - become telling when attempting to assess the impacts of long-term climate change policies on forest values. This paper presents an alternative approach using real options analysis that captures enough complexity to meaningfully model the impacts of climate change policies on forest value while remaining relatively straightforward to implement using Monte Carlo simulation. It shows that foresters' discretions as to when and if to harvest or to convert to <b>non-forest</b> land <b>uses</b> give rise to real options whose value is captured by real options analysis but ignored by conventional {{forest valuation}} methodologies. It furthermore shows how forest values differ and conversion rates vary over time depending on which climate change policies or policy uncertainties are assumed. In short Kyoto forests (those first planted after 1989) are more valuable when carbon credits and harvest liabilities under the Kyoto Protocol are devolved by the Crown to their owners. Non-Kyoto forests (those planted before 1990) are more valuable when deforestation liabilities are not devolved to their owners.

Results are consistent with existing economic theory and empirical evidence of forest landowner program participation: landowners prefer larger per acre annual incentive payments, they prefer to commit to shorter contract duration, and they require extra compensation to engage in ecosystem production-enhancing forest management. The value of development option (however far removed into the future) is confirmed: landowners strongly dislike permanent conservation easement programs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} analyzing tropical deforestation and reforestation using the von Thunen model as its starting point: land is allocated to the use which yields the highest rent, and the rents of various land uses are determined by location. Forest cover change therefore becomes a question of changes in rent of forest versus <b>non-forest</b> <b>use.</b> While this is a simple and powerful starting point, more intriguing issues arise when this is applied to analyze real cases. An initial shift in the rent of one particular land use generates feedbacks which affect the rent of all land uses. For example, a new technology in extensive agriculture should make this land use more profitable and lead to more forest clearing, but general equilibrium effects (changes in prices and local wages) can modify or even reverse this conclusion. Another issue is how a policy change or a shift in broader market, technological, and institutional forces will affect various land use rents. The paper deals with three such areas: technological progress in agriculture, land tenure regimes, and community forest management. The {{second part of the}} paper links the von Thunen framework to the forest transition theory. The forest transition theory describes a sequence over time where a forested region goes through a period of deforestation before the forest cover eventually stabilizes and starts to increase. This sequence {{can be seen as a}} systematic pattern of change in the agricultural and forest land rents over time. Increasing agricultural rent leads to high rates of deforestation. The slow-down of deforestation and eventual reforestation is due to lower agricultural rents (the economic development path) and higher forest rent (the forest scarcity path). Various forces leading to these changes are discussed and supported by empirical evidence from different tropical regions.

40|$|Abstract]: Land use {{change from}} forest to <b>non-forest</b> <b>use</b> {{is a major}} source of {{greenhouse}} gases in Australia. From 1996, the Queensland Government provided incentives for landholders to plant ex-pasture and cropping areas with hardwood plantations through the Southeast Queensland Regional Forest Agreement program. Spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora subspecies Variegata) was a target hardwood species for Southeast Queensland (SEQ); however, the long-term viability of timber-alone plantations relative to cropping and livestock production, in the medium to low rainfall areas of SEQ, and elsewhere in Australia, is questionable. Carbon credits resulting from additional carbon sequestration may change the relative profitability of these land uses. The aim of this research was to compare spotted gum plantations with peanut-maize cultivation and beef pasture in low rainfall areas, incorporating carbon values. This study covers all variable costs and benefits, and different sources and sinks of three major greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. For the case study of three land use systems (maize-peanut cropping, pasture, and spotted gum plantations in the Kingaroy district of SEQ), production, carbon sequestration and emissions data were supplemented by formal and informal interviews with landholders, agronomists, sawmill staff and government extension personnel. Forest inventory, biomass and soil sampling, and stakeholder interviews were used as sources of primary data. The costs and benefits of all land use systems were converted into monetary terms and discounted to produce net present values. If the comparison of net present values is limited to traditional benefits (i. e. income from crops and hay in cultivation, beef in pasture and timber in plantation), cultivation is the most profitable option, followed by pasture and plantations. Even after the inclusion of beef value, plantations could not compete with other land use systems. After the inclusion of greenhouse gas value, plantations were the most profitable option, followed by pasture and cultivation. However, if the carbon price was reduced from the price assumed in this thesis of 10. 5 t- 1 CO 2 e to 4. 3 t- 1 CO 2 e, cultivation would remain the most profitable option. If the currently used nominal (pre-text) discount rate (six percent) increased to seven or eight percent, the optimal rotation of plantation would reduce from 34 to 31 years and 29 years, respectively. At a seven percent discount rate, plantations would be a less profitable than pasture, but marginally more profitable than cultivation. If the discount rate were eight percent, plantations would be less profitable than both pasture and cultivation. These findings have some implications for attempts to increase the plantation estate to three million hectares by 2020, through policy frameworks such as the Australian Government’s ‘Vision 2020 ’. Therefore, this study has recommended several measures to increase the benefits from plantations. ...|$|E

In the East, there is growing concern that the dissection of regional forests {{and the creation of}} small forest islands surrounded by <b>non-forest</b> <b>uses</b> (e. g., agriculture) may be affecting plant species richness and developmental patterns of vegetation (Levenson 1976), as has already been noted in the tropics (Gomezpompa et al. 1972).

The effect of distance in altering seed exchange between forest islands has not been directly tested. However, the use of forest islands as study sites has provided some clues about the effects of distance (isolation) on dispersal and forest composition. Scanlan (1975), Tramer and Suhrweir (1975), and Levenson (1976) all noted that the species richness of forest stands in Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin, respectively, was inversely proportional to the degree of isolation from neighboring stands.

40|$|A major {{constraint}} {{to current}} REDD+ initiatives is the arbitrariness of the operational definition of ‘forest’. The UN-REDD+ framework ignores the high potential of other (tree containing) land uses for carbon sequestration and {{the generation of}} co-benefits, {{in contrast to a}} whole landscape approach known as ‘Reducing Emissions from All Land Uses’ (REALU). To indicate this potential, carbon stocks and biodiversity were assessed at the landscape scale around Jimma, SW Ethiopia. Notwithstanding the indigenous forests’ high carbon stocks per hectare (336. 96 ± 120. 6 Mg C ha 1), 80 % of the total carbon stock of the 106 ha assessed landscape window was found to be stored in <b>non-forest</b> land <b>uses.</b> Especially local agroforestry systems, such as managed semi-forest coffee production fragments (179. 92 ± 38. 5 Mg C ha 1), homegardens (106. 26 ± 16. 8 Mg C ha 1) and pole wood plantations (112. 36 ± 23. 9 Mg ha 1) store large amounts of carbon. Together with local maize fields (69. 45 ± 12. 3 Mg C ha 1), teff fields (69. 51 ± 6. 5 Mg C ha 1) and grazing lands (76. 90 ± 10. 3 Mg C ha 1) these <b>non-forest</b> land <b>uses</b> {{play an important role in}} a prospective ‘high-carbon-stock rural-development’ under a REALU framework. A REDD+ approach, applying a stringent forest definition that disqualifies for agriculture and a 30 % canopy cover threshold, would only account for 24 Gg C in the 106 ha landscape window. Applying the canopy cover threshold alone, would triple the amount to 72 Gg C, while a REALU project would account for the whole 116 Gg landscape carbon. The biodiversity assessment, based on tree community composition and Hill’s diversity indices, indicated important biodiversity co-benefits under a REALU approach. Biodiversity indices such as the Hill’s N 1 diversity of abundant tree species showed a strong positive correlation with local carbon stocks (R 2 = 0. 56). Since the cover of indigenous forest is reduced to only 7 % of the landscape window’s area, most of the remaining trees and biodiversity can be found within the surrounding landscape mosaic. Semi-forest coffee production fragments for example still harbour almost half of all encountered native tree species. An interesting result of the simultaneous biodiversity assessment was that a regrouping of plots based on tree biodiversity provides a more precise and cost efficient way to assess carbon stocks, reducing the number of plots needed with 23 %, to achieve the same precision level. status: publishe...|$|R

This study was conducted in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. The objectives of the study are: (i) to analyze changes in land use and land cover in forest areas, (ii) to model changes in land use and land cover, focusing on production forests, the area of forest where land cover should be maintained, and (iii) to formulate policy recommendations based on the two previous objectives. Changes in land use and land cover were analyzed using a series of Landsat imageries from 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2014. The supervised classification imagery analysis was performed using image interpretation software.

Two components of the bird and butterfly communities were investigated: species richness (α-diversity) and community dissimilarity (β-diversity). We recorded the community composition of each taxon at multiple sites and modelled species richness as a function of seven environmental predictors. Endemic bird richness was greatest in mature forest at high altitudes whereas endemic butterfly richness peaked at mid-altitudes in disturbed forest. There was low cross-taxon congruence between areas with high endemic richness; less than 2 % of the island represented areas of overlap between endemic bird and butterfly diversity hotspots.

It calls for developing countries to take part in a second commitment period for a post- 2020 climate change regime under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and outside the UNFCCC. The goal of REDD+ is that host countries will receive, inter alia, financial compensation if they choose to conserve their forests rather than convert them to <b>non-forest</b> land <b>use.</b> Such compensation is for significant emission reductions which are reasonably attributable to human activities. This implies that REDD+ implementation at a domestic level will require allocation of burdens and benefits.

Against this background, this thesis questions: what is the optimal (and feasible) model legislative framework sufficient to implement REDD+? It argues that REDD+ should be defined as a self-regulatory system. This view directs attention toward a distinctive regulatory framework. Thus the thesis suggests that one possible legal framework that holds that potential in Tanzania and Indonesia is reflexive law.

We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and <b>non-forest</b> land <b>use,</b> and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests.

The establishment of a 5 ha minimum mapping unit affected the ability of the segmentation methods to detect small or irregularly-shaped land cover change and, combined with aggregation rules that favour forest, added bias to the automated results. However, the OBIA methods provided an efficient means of processing over 11, 000 sample sites, 33, 000 Landsat 20 × 20 km sample tiles and more than 6. 5 million individual polygons over three epochs and adequately facilitated human expert review, revision and conversion to a global forest land-use product...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{fragmentation}} divides forest areas {{into smaller}} discontinuous fragments, increasing the forest edge area that experiences different environmental conditions from interior areas [1]. According to one study, logging and deforestation generate ~ 32, 000 and 38, 000 km of new forest edge {{each year in}} the Brazilian Amazon [2]. Nearly 20 % of the world?s forests are within 100 m of agriculture, urban, or other <b>non-forest</b> land <b>uses</b> [3]. Forest edges suffer changes in microclimate, with reduced moisture and increased variability of temperature compared to the forest interiors. In addition, winds cause greater structural damage near the forest ends and affect other ecological processes such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. The extent of forest edges in the Brazilian Amazon grows each year, caused by deforestation and forest degradation from human activity. However, the extent of edge forests, and the changes in carbon stock resulting from alterations in microclimate and disturbance near forest edges are difficult to quantify. Previous studies have used multispectral remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) analysis to quantify fragmentation and the effect of edges [2]. We used lidar (light detection and ranging) measured canopy heights as a proxy variable to quantify forest edge effects across a degraded forest landscape of the Amazon in the Paragominas Municipality in Para State, Brazil. To our knowledge no previous study has used variability in forest height from lidar data to quantify changes in forest structure near edges in tropical forests. Lidar provides data with sub-meter vertical and horizontal accuracy, greatly improving forest structure quantification compared to traditional field studies. 201...|$|R
40|$|Forest to <b>non-forest</b> land <b>use</b> {{change is}} one of the major causes of {{environmental}} degradation. Queensland government is encouraging people for hardwood plantation in inland (low rainfall) area of Southeast Queensland (SEQ). However, the economic viability of the plantation is suspicious. Since the carbon sequestration is payable in the Kyoto context, this study has compared the total soil carbon and its long-term in-/decreasing rate in scrubland, pastureland, cropping land and spotted gum land in Krasnozem soil of Kingaroy, an inland SEQ. We have demonstrated how the timeline of land use transformation could be useful to triangulate the soil carbon trends efficiently and effectively. Isoprime isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to a Eurovector elemental analyser was used for soil analysis. The lowest amount of soil carbon was found in cropping land (77. 39 t/ha up to 110 cm), which was even bit lower than the global average of similar land use types (80 t/ha up to 100 cm). The soil carbon under the mature spotted gum (306 tC/ha) was found much higher than the world average soil carbon amount of similar region's forest and was closer to the world richest soil carbon boreal forest. The annual decreasing rate of soil carbon in cropping land was found 2. 6811166 percent which was almost similar to the ROTHC modelled value. The annual increasing rate of soil carbon under the pasture and spotted gum plantation was 0. 575841948 and 0. 926507307 percent respectively. Thus, the current cropping practices of Kingaroy are not favourable for carbon sequestration but the spotted gum plantation has considerable potential of sequestrating soil carbon. ...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to determine at what level biomass and forest area obtained from 2, 3, 4, or 5 panels of forest inventory data compares well with forested area and biomass estimates from the national inventory data. A subset of 2605 inventory plots (100 % forested, 100 % <b>non-forested)</b> was <b>used</b> to classify the land cover and model the biomass in South Carolina. Mixed plots containing both forest and non-forest conditions have been excluded. Forest inventory data have been further subdivided into four datasets containing the most recent 5, 4, 3, and 2 panels of data. Separately, each of these four datasets was used in a decision tree classification process applied to MODIS satellite data (250 -meter resolution) and ancillary data to classify the land cover and model the forest biomass. The satellite, ancillary, and plot data have been subdivided into three mapping zones 54, 58, and 59 for processing in See 5 and Cubist software. Classification results for trials with 2, 3, 4, and the entire cycle of 5 panels show that overall classification accuracy for the percent of pixels correctly classified (%PCC) increased from 72. 3 % to 79. 2 %. Comparison between classified forest area with 4 and 5 panels and the inventory forest area shows less than 2 % difference. The forest/non-forest single layer classification from each trial was used to mask out non-forested areas for the forest biomass classification. Accuracy of modeled forest biomass was compared with plot data estimates of forest biomass. Biomass obtained from Cubist models with 3, 4, and 5 inventory panels {{when compared to the}} biomass from the published plot data estimates show a difference of 29. 2 %, 11. 0 % and respectively 1. 6 %...|$|R
40|$|Agroforestry {{is a way}} to {{reconcile}} biodiversity conservation, food production and the delivery of other ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. One such a key ecosystem service, especially in the light of climate change mitigation, is carbon storage. Increasing human disturbance and management intensification, however, are known to affect the carbon storage potential of forests. In this study we assessed how carbon stocks in Ethiopian Afromontane forests co-varied with their biodiversity, and with increasing management intensity for the production of Arabica coffee. We also broadened our scope to the whole landscape and assessed the biodiversity conservation and carbon storage potential of all land uses. We quantified above- and belowground carbon stocks across a gradient of agricultural intensification ranging from natural forest, over two different coffee agroforestry systems, to intensified shade plantations. Ground beetle and woody plant diversity was defined based on the same plots. We found that carbon stocks in natural forests (413 ± 55. 6 Mg ha- 1) and in the most extensively managed agroforestry systems (387 ± 50. 0 Mg ha- 1) were significantly higher than those in the more intensified agroforest system (258 ± 39. 4 Mg ha- 1) and in shade plantations (219 ± 22. 8 Mg ha- 1). Diversity of woody plants, but not of ground beetles, declined with increasing management intensity and decreasing carbon stocks. The carbon account of the 106 ha studied landscape window emphasized the importance of <b>non-forest</b> land <b>uses,</b> storing 80 % of the total carbon stock. Agroforests were found to harbour almost half of all encountered native tree species. To keep these extensive land use systems economically viable, which is required to avoid management intensification and associated carbon and biodiversity losses, we advocate payments for ecosystem services (PES) at the landscape scale. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ERS 1 and ASAR imagery {{were used}} for mapping the forest area of French Guiana for 1992 / 1993 and 2003 / 2004, respectively. For the 1993 map 61 ERS 1 {{precision}} images were received. The ASAR data for the 2004 map were 107 VV polarization images of swath IS 4 (incidence angle 33 degrees). The ERS data sets included multi-temporal acquisitions of two to five dates from the same location whereas the minimum number of overlapping images in the ASAR set was four and maximum six. The imagery was ortho-rectified using the digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Three features were computed using the SAR data: average texture, average amplitude of the overlapping images, and temporal variability of the backscattering. A classification to forest and <b>non-forest</b> was done <b>using</b> a combination of unsupervised and supervised techniques. Reference data to estimate forest area and its confidence intervals and to validate the SAR based maps were collected by making a point sample from two Landsat image mosaics, from 1990 and 2000. The overall forest and non-forest accuracy at the sample points was 90 percent in the ERS map and 94 percent in the ASAR map. 1...|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{forestry}} in Indonesia {{is facing}} challenges {{in terms of}} sustainability and the survival of its inhabitant, indigenous people, not least because the perception of policymakers is that, since the 1970 s, forests have provided a major solution to economic development by producing timber, conversion forest land for agriculture, mining, and other <b>non-forest</b> land <b>use.</b> Consequently, the forest and its resources have been undervalued and its monetary potential has been underestimated. This has led to overexploitation and conversion, which ultimately results {{in the loss of}} biodiversity and threatens the survival of indigenous people. This study, conducted in a small forest protection area in Gunung Lumut in the Pasir District of East Kalimantan, focuses on the poor indigenous people in this region and reveals the crucial role that the forest plays in both the economic and non-economic dimensions of the lives of the indigenous people of Paser. Indeed, the forest contributes to the Paser household economy in almost all aspects of life. Forests are so much more than trees and timber, and the Gunung Lumut protection forest goes far beyond providing food and materials for construction. It is the backdrop for the Paser people’s spirits and cosmovision. This study suggests that conversion or other land use options for forest land should begin with an evaluation process, in order to reveal the ‘true’ value of the forest – economically and environmentally – for the livelihoods of indigenous people. These values must be part of the toolkit for developing policies for land and forest use. In addition, such an evaluation process boosts the negotiating capacity of the indigenous people to prevent further losses from forest conversion. This study shows that monetary valuation also benefits forest management by preventing unnecessary conversion of forest land and further loss of biodiversity in tropical forests. It provides indigenous people with a bargaining tool in the context of compensation for the loss of their resources. Promotor: G. A. Persoon, Co-promotor: H. H. de IonghWith summary in Dutc...|$|R
