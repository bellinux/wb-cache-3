5|$|Lydiard {{remained}} cruising off Havana, and on 15 September sighted the French 84-gun Foudroyant. The Foudroyant, {{carrying the}} flag of Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, had been dismasted in a storm and was carrying a jury-rig. Despite the superiority of his opponent and the <b>nearness</b> of the shore Lydiard attempted to close on the French vessel and opened fire. Anson came under fire from the fortifications at Morro Castle, while several Spanish ships, including the 74-gun San Lorenzo, came out of Havana to assist the French. After being unable to manoeuvre into a favourable position and coming under heavy fire, Lydiard hauled away and made his escape. Anson had two killed and 13 wounded during the engagement, while the rigging was badly cut. Foudroyant meanwhile had 27 killed or wounded.|$|E

Under Browne, Hermes first captured an American vessel {{laden with}} stores for the Brest fleet {{and then two}} vessels from New York and Baltimore. On 24 September, while near Cape La Hève (Le Havre), Hermes recaptured the Prussian brig Anna Maria which had been bound for London from Lisbon. A privateer managed to escape because of the <b>nearness</b> of the French coast.|$|E
25|$|Order of precedence: {{even without}} showy display, {{a group of}} people walking forward may be said to form a {{procession}} if their order and placement clearly visualize a hierarchy or symbiotic relationship. For instance, one's <b>nearness</b> to the king or others of high rank had important political connotations when the royal family walked to or from chapel services at the palace of Versailles. Similarly, precedence came into play when the grandest Edwardian parties progressed from the sitting room to the dining room, and the stylized movement and hierarchy of marching military units clearly sets up a formal procession.|$|E
25|$|The Somali Region and the Danakil Depression in the Afar Region have a hot, {{sunny and}} dry climate {{producing}} fully desert or semi-desert conditions. The terrain {{in the lower}} basin of the Sobat is hot, swampy and malarious. However, over {{the greater part of}} Ethiopia as well as the Oromia highlands the climate is very healthy and temperate. The country lies wholly within the tropics, but its <b>nearness</b> to the equator is counterbalanced by the elevation of the land. In the deep valleys of the Tekezé and Abay, and generally in places below , the conditions are tropical and diseases such as malaria are prevalent.|$|E
25|$|The town itself lies {{mostly on}} the east bank of the old river, {{with a small amount}} to the west. A portion of the west bank is cut off from the rest by the new river, forming an islandlike piece of land known as Island Carr. Due to <b>nearness</b> of the river, the town {{regularly}} suffers minor flooding, and concerns over flood plain development are a major issue in local planning. The only other watercourse of reasonable size is Candley Beck, which runs through the very southern parts of the town. There are also about half a dozen clayponds along the riverside in Brigg where clay was formerly extracted for brickmaking.|$|E
25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the <b>nearness</b> of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E
25|$|Situated on {{the mouth}} of the River Shannon, Limerick has been an {{important}} gateway city for over 800 years. Due to the city's location on the midpoint of the Atlantic Corridor, <b>nearness</b> to Shannon Airport (12 Miles) and good supply of reasonably priced hotels it {{has become something of a}} base city for tourists travelling along the west coast of Ireland, although the city has many attractions in its own right. King John's Castle in the medieval quarter of the city is arguably the best known attraction in the city, dating back to 922AD. The old city walls of Limerick surround a small bit of the site, although most of the walls have collapsed.St Marys cathedral also in the medieval quarter is a must see.Its a completely restored 12th century cathedral with stunning views over the city. The Hunt Museum in the city hosts one of the world's greatest private collections in the world, winning the Museum of the year award many times over the years. The museum has a wide collection of both ancient and medieval pieces of art and sculpture, originating from varied locations and civilisations around the world including Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt and the Olmec Civilisation. Artists' works in the museum include Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jack B. Yeats and Henry Moore.|$|E

There, the two lived in Bear House at the river's edge with their pet dachshunds. Davies' cherished dachshund named Gandhi, 15 years old, fell gravely ill during this time; a veterinarian was called and the animal put down by injection. Distraught, Davies raged through Bear House, later writing: [...] "I broke everything I could lay my hands on."

500|$|At {{an early}} stage in his priesthood Lang decided to lead a celibate life. He had no {{objection}} to the institution of marriage, but felt that his own work would be hindered by domesticity. Years after Lang's death, his sexual orientation was questioned; [...] journalist Michael Gove and historian David Starkey suggested that Lang was a repressed homosexual. He had close friendships with colleagues such as Dick Sheppard, and with Wilfrid Parker, his one-time domestic chaplain to whom he wrote admitting his personal loneliness, and of his need for [...] "someone in daily <b>nearness</b> to love". He enjoyed the company of women and confessed in 1928, after {{a visit to the}} Rowntree's chocolate factory, that the sight of the girls there had [...] "stirred up all the instincts of my youth... very little subdued by the passage of years".|$|E

500|$|The {{northern}} part of the watershed is underlain by a network of faults capable of producing earthquakes at any time, and many small quakes have been recorded in the basin since the mid-19thcentury. In 1993, the Scotts Mills earthquake—the largest recent earthquake in the valley, measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale—was centered near Scotts Mills, about [...] south of Portland. It caused $30million in damage, including harm to the Oregon State Capitol in Salem. Evidence suggests that massive quakes of 8 or more on the Richter scale have occurred historically in the Cascadia subduction zone off the Oregon coast, most recently in 1700CE, and that others as strong as 9 on the Richter scale occur every 500 to 800years. The basin's high population density, its <b>nearness</b> to this subduction zone, and its loose soils, which tend to amplify shaking, make the Willamette Valley especially vulnerable to damage from strong earthquakes.|$|E
500|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{state that}} human beings have a [...] "rational soul", and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's status and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to {{have a duty to}} recognize God through his messengers, and to conform to their teachings. Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Bahá'í writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bahá'í belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of <b>nearness</b> or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.|$|E

500|$|During 2010–11 Mehldau held Carnegie Hall's Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair, {{the first}} jazz {{musician}} to do so. In 2011 he toured with von Otter again, and played and recorded piano duets with Kevin Hays, and piano–mandolin duets with Chris Thile. The Hays collaboration was on arrangements by Patrick Zimmerli, with whom Mehldau had attended high school. One piece from their album, Modern Music, featured the pianists playing a composed left-hand part while improvising {{with the other}} hand; [...] "to do both at once is a real test. The brain feels like it's split in half", commented Mehldau. A series of duet concerts with Redman took place in Europe in 2011, and six pieces were released five years later on the album <b>Nearness.</b> In 2012 Mehldau and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra performed his [...] "Variations for Piano and Orchestra on a Melancholy Theme" [...] in Europe.

500|$|Ripley and {{his wife}} Sophia formed a joint stock company in 1841 along with 10 other initial investors. He sold shares of the company $500 apiece with a promise of {{five percent of the}} profits to each investor. Shareholders were also allowed a single vote in {{decision-making}} and several held director positions. The Ripleys chose to begin their experiment at a dairy farm owned by Charles and Maria Mayo Ellis in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, near the home of Theodore Parker.

500|$|LoPiccolo {{composed}} the game's score—called [...] "dark", [...] "electronic" [...] and [...] "cyberpunk" [...] by the Boston Herald—on a Macintosh computer and inexpensive synthesizer, using Audio Vision. It dynamically changes {{according to the}} player's actions, a decision made {{in keeping with the}} team's focus on emergent gameplay. Each track was [...] "written at three different intensity levels", which change depending on the player's <b>nearness</b> to enemies; and certain events, such as victory in combat, trigger special music. The game's tracks were composed of four-bar segments that could be rearranged dynamically in reaction to game events, with [...] "melodies through-composed on top". LoPiccolo noted that, when using this method, it is necessary to write music that [...] "still flows with the overall theme and doesn't jump around". Because the score was closely tied to the gameplay, LoPiccolo had to work closely with Church and Rob Fermier, the latter of whom wrote the [...] "interactive scoring module" [...] that allowed for dynamic music. After recording the music, LoPiccolo recorded all of the game's sound effects. He later recalled visiting an automobile repair shop with [...] "portable recorder and a mic", and [...] "having [...] mechanic [...] hit things with wrenches and so forth, just to get the raw material". He developed the game's audio over 16 months, working on a contractual basis until Tribe disbanded in May 1994; Ned Lerner gave him a full-time job as audio director the next day.

500|$|Critics at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century believed that the poem's use of sound and tone made it great. The French critic Louis Cazamian claimed in 1927 that Gray [...] "discovered rhythms, utilised the power of sounds, and even created evocations. The triumph of this sensibility allied to so much art is to be seen in the famous Elegy, which from a somewhat reasoning and moralizing emotion has educed a grave, full, melodiously monotonous song, in which a century weaned from the music of the soul tasted all the sadness of eventide, of death, and of the tender musing upon self." [...] I. A. Richards, following in 1929, declared that the merits of the poem come from its tone: [...] "poetry, which has no other very remarkable qualities, may sometimes take very high rank simply because the poet's attitude to his listenersin view of what he has to sayis so perfect. Gray and Dryden are notable examples. Gray's Elegy, indeed, might stand as a supreme instance to show how powerful an exquisitely adjusted tone may be. It would be difficult to maintain that the thought in this poem is either striking or original, or that its feeling is exceptional." [...] He continued: [...] "the Elegy may usefully remind us that boldness and originality are not necessities for great poetry. But these thoughts and feelings, in part because of their significance and their <b>nearness</b> to us, are peculiarly difficult to express without faults... Gray, however, without overstressing any point composes a long address, perfectly accommodating his familiar feelings towards the subject and his awareness of the inevitable triteness of the only possible reflections, to the discriminating attention of his audience. And this is the source of his triumph." ...|$|E
