500|$|Roz Laws {{writing for}} the Sunday Mercury felt there was [...] "plenty of chemistry" [...] present between Gilly and Steph. Their {{relationship}} was frequently commented on by the Daily Mail Jaci Stephen in her weekly soap column. She expressed disinterest in Steph and Cheryl's rivalry over Gilly, and found it implausible that Jem and Steph would quarrel over him. When the two finally admitted their feelings for one another in May 2010, Stephen accurately predicted that their happiness would be short-lived. She bemoaned the lack of subtlety in the scripting of the lead-up to their wedding, observing: [...] "Of course, {{you know that the}} moment she says that <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to stop her marrying Gilly, the Grim Reaper will be pulling up in his hearse, shortly behind the wedding car." ...|$|E
500|$|Steph's {{relationships}} were {{a focal point}} of many reviews. The Daily Mirror Nicola Methven and Polly Hudson found a 2004 love triangle between Steph, her sister Debbie and love interest Dan Hunter (Andrew McNair) [...] "surprising compelling". Grace Dent of The Guardian observed of her failed engagement to Fernando: [...] "With the best will in the world, I don't feel that marriage {{was ever going to}} last". Dent had previously named Steph singing the Sugababes' [...] "About You Now" [...] at Max's funeral one of her four favourite soap moments of 2008. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury felt there was [...] "plenty of chemistry" [...] between Steph and Gilly.

60|$|It {{seemed to}} Steve that <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> right these days. Here was he, chafing at his {{inability}} to open his heart to Mamie. Here was Kirk, obviously in trouble. And--a smaller thing, but of interest, as showing how universal the present depression was--there was Bailey Bannister, equally obviously much worried over something or other.|$|R

2500|$|Conversely, {{writing for}} the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick Lasalle bluntly noted that the motion picture starts out [...] "bad" [...] and later [...] "gets worse". He summed up his displeasure by stating, [...] ""Sunshine" [...] has nothing to offer, and this <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be offered relentlessly and earnestly, like a holy missive." [...] In a {{primarily}} negative review, Joanne Kaufman writing for The Wall Street Journal, called the film [...] "a warmed-over stew of sci-fi and gothic horror". Unenthusiastic, she affirmed, [...] "There are the predictable malfunctions that compromise the space craft, the banal speechifying {{about the fate of}} mankind, the issue of who will live and who will die. Who cares? The characters are so sketchily drawn that it's hard to keep them straight, let alone get worked up about their survival." [...] Also describing an unfavourable opinion, Marrit Ingman of The Austin Chronicle professed the film exhibited [...] "problems which arise in the film's third act" [...] which causes [...] "a profoundly implausible plot turn that sends the movie skidding into bogeyman horror. It cheapens the sentiment, and the film doesn't recover." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{place where}} they {{extracted}} the saccharine matter was under an immense shed of bamboos. Here we saw several clumsy pieces of machinery for breaking the cane; also great kettles for boiling the sugar. But, at present, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on. Two or three natives were lounging {{in one of the}} kettles, smoking; the other was occupied by three sailors from the Leviathan, playing cards.|$|R
5000|$|My {{favorite}} part was {{the energy of}} a crowd out to see some music. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to stop them from}} seeing music. They <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to see all the music. That sheer determination converted me: I slipped into the crowd and immediately abandoned all pretense of maintaining an academic disinterest in the bands I'd only heard of peripherally. It swept away my staunch decision to maintain no bias when seeing a band I kind of love right now.|$|R

6000|$|Florence's {{story of}} the lost mine fired Madeline's guests with the fever for gold-hunting. But after they had tried {{it a few times}} and the glamour of the thing wore off they gave up and {{remained}} in camp. Having exhausted all the resources of the mountain, such that had interest for them, they settled quietly down for a rest, which Madeline knew would soon end in a desire for civilized comforts. They were almost tired of roughing it. Helen's discontent manifested itself in her remark, [...] "I guess <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen, after all." ...|$|E

You're going to a rich brother, Miss Keene, who has friends of his own, and who won't care to know a poor fellow whom you tolerated on the passage, but who don't move in Mrs. Brimmer's set, and whom Mr. Banks wouldn't indorse commercially." ...|$|E

60|$|Now {{there we}} have {{instances}} of three prominent ostensible civilisations working the silent-assertion lie. Could one find other instances {{in the three}} countries? I think so. Not so very many perhaps, but say a billion--just so as to keep within bounds. Are those countries working that kind of lie, {{day in and day}} out, in thousands and thousands of varieties, without ever resting? Yes, we know that to be true. The universal conspiracy of the silent-assertion lie is hard at work always and everywhere, and always in the interest of a stupidity or a sham, never in the interest of a thing fine or respectable. Is it the most timid and shabby of all lies? It seems to have the look of it. For ages and ages it has mutely laboured in the interest of despotisms and aristocracies and chattel slaveries, and military slaveries, and religious slaveries, and has kept them alive; keeps them alive yet, here and there and yonder, all about the globe; and will go on keeping them alive until the silent-assertion lie retires from business--the silent assertion that <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on which fair and intelligent men are aware of and are engaged by their duty to try to stop.|$|E

50|$|Act 2 {{opens with}} Squire Wouldbe reading {{the letter that}} he has written to Urina asking for her love. When his wife, Dowdy, enters, he hides the letter from her. She {{does not believe that}} <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, as he says, and begins to cry. After an {{argument}} about their marriage and trust, he convinces her that <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on and that he should go on with his business for the day. After he leaves Mrs. Beldam, Dowdy's mother, comes, upset with her son-in-law for the way he treats her daughter, and then departs on her own business for the day. In a different part of town, Sir Charles and Sir Roger talk and sing about the women that they love or have yet to love. Charlotte and Juliana enter the park dressed in men's clothes discussing the matter at hand with their love lives. In a tavern, Freedman, Urina, and Doll prepare the meal for the guests while discussing their lives and the problem with trust in the relationship between Freedman and Urina.

25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made.
