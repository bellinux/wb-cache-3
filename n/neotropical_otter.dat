5|$|The {{giant otter}} shows {{a variety of}} adaptations {{suitable}} to an amphibious lifestyle, including exceptionally dense fur, a wing-like tail, and webbed feet. The species prefers freshwater rivers and streams, which are usually seasonally flooded, and may also take to freshwater lakes and springs. It constructs extensive campsites close to feeding areas, clearing large amounts of vegetation. The giant otter subsists almost exclusively on a diet of fish, particularly characins and catfish, but may also eat crabs, turtles, snakes and small caiman. It has no serious natural predators other than humans, although it must compete with other species, including the <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> and caiman species, for food resources.|$|E
25|$|Fauna {{include the}} brown howler (Alouatta guariba), locally {{threatened}} with extinction, <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra longicaudis), margay (Leopardus wiedii) and migratory birds {{such as the}} buff-breasted sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis) and tropical kingbird (Tyrannus melancholicus).|$|E
50|$|<b>Neotropical</b> <b>otters</b> have an {{interesting}} phylogenic relationship to other otter species. They are most similar to Lontra feline and Lontra provocax, which is not surprising considering these two species are found in South America. However, <b>neotropical</b> <b>otters</b> are relatively distantly related to Pteronura brasiliensis, which is surprising considering they have nearly identical ecological niches and home ranges.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{regarding}} {{reproduction of}} Lontra longicaudis is lacking. We present the first experience of <b>Neotropical</b> river <b>otters</b> born in captivity in Colombia. Of three parturitions registered, only one was successful. The gestation period for L. longicaudis {{was estimated at}} 86 days, with no evidence of delayed implantation. This kind of pregnancy can be classified as short and variable. We recommend further research efforts regarding behaviour and reproduction of <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otters</b> in captivity...|$|R
30|$|The {{present results}} add new {{information}} about morphometric skull variation in L. longicaudis.

40|$|Abstract The {{detection}} of pathogenic microorganisms in aquatic environments is extremely relevant {{in terms of}} public health. As these laboratorial methodologies are usually difficult, expensive and time-consuming, they are frequently replaced by the assessment of fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli. This study aimed to assess the presence of E. coli in fecal samples from <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otters,</b> to evaluate its potential as fecal indicator to be applied to the determination of water microbiological quality in areas where otters’ populations are high. Twenty-six otter fecal samples, collected in Alto Paranapanema river basin, São Paulo State, Brazil, were analyzed for the presence of E. coli, using conventional bacteriological methods. Only 8 scat samples (30 %) were E. coli positive, indicating that this microorganism is not a suitable fecal indicator to assess water fecal contamination by <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otters,</b> and should not be used to infer the presence of otter related pathogens in waters...|$|R
50|$|<b>Neotropical</b> <b>otters</b> are {{threatened}} by habitat degradation associated with: agriculture, soil compaction, pollution, roadways, and runoff. Also, when forests are cleared for cattle grazing, heavy vegetation (which is the otter's preferred habitat) near streams is also cleared or trampled by cattle. This species {{is a very important}} ecological indicator because they prefer ecologically rich, aquatic habitats and have a low reproductive potential.|$|R
50|$|The <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter's</b> diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} fish and crustaceans making up 67% and 28%,respectively, of its total diet. The otter will also occasionally feed on mollusks and small mammals. This otter is known to occasionally attack fishnets for a source of prey, hindering fishing productivity.Otters living near marine habitats can have a much higher proportion of crustaceans in their diets.|$|R
50|$|Even if without direct predation, {{the giant}} otter must still {{compete with other}} predators for food resources. Duplaix {{documented}} interaction with the <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter.</b> While the two species are sympatric (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, {{there appeared to be}} no serious conflict.

50|$|The <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> {{is listed}} as Near Threatened by the IUCN. The species is {{currently}} protected in Argentina and many other South American countries. Heavy hunting for its fur in the 1950s-1970s resulted in much local extinction over the otter's range. Illegal hunting, habitat destruction through mining and ranching, and water pollution still affect {{the population of the}} <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter.</b> Although there have been attempts at captive breeding, they are largely unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|New {{data on the}} {{distribution}} of the <b>Neotropical</b> river <b>otter</b> (Lontra longicaudis) as well as new records of the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) in Uruguay are provided. The information presented was gathered from other sighting surveys completed by Uruguayan researchers, wildlife technicians and environmentalists. New localities for both species, comments on on the behaviour and data about the habitats used by the <b>Neotropical</b> river <b>otter</b> were obtained. The information about distribution was completed by an examination of records from zoological collections and literature. This survey confirms that the <b>Neotropical</b> river <b>otter</b> is at least fairly common in Uruguay. The conservation status of the giant otter is uncertain. Although considered extirpated for many years, a recent sighting of two individuals has been reported. This information has to be confirmed...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that giant otters {{excavate}} dens for breeding and resting. One family of giant otters which we have observed on the Brazilian Pantanal, also use a long cave in a rocky cliff, particularly when raising cubs. The cave is not above the highest flood level, but does not usually flood, unlike excavated dens, which are very susceptible to flooding. Nearby caves were used by <b>Neotropical</b> <b>Otters</b> (Lontra longicaudis) and Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) ...|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>otter</b> species, <b>neotropical</b> <b>otters</b> {{will mark}} their {{territory}} with scratching or spraint (feces) in obvious places like rocks and under bridges. Signs of marking {{may be most}} concentrated around their dens. They tend to only mark in {{certain areas of the}} den, separate from the activity center of the den. In caves, where a water sources may leak through the walls and wash away the scent, the resident may mark areas inside their den.|$|R
50|$|The niches and {{ranges of}} the Giant river otter and the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> overlap widely. Both species are diurnal and mainly piscivorous. The Giant otter {{is less of}} a generalist in habitat, preferring slow-moving water and {{overhanging}} vegetation, but where the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> may also occur. The Giant otter is much larger and hunts in groups, so it can take larger prey. Some areas, like the Pantanal, have high enough productivity, so both otter species can exists with little or no competition. Additionally, Neotropical otters prefer deeper and wider streams than Giant otters.|$|E
50|$|The <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> or neotropical {{river otter}} (Lontra longicaudis) is an otter species found in Central America, South America {{and the island}} of Trinidad. It is {{physically}} similar to {{the northern and southern}} river otter, which occur directly north and south of this species' range. The length of the <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> can range from 90 - 150 cm, of which the tail comprises about a third. Body weight ranges from 5 - 15 kg. Otters are members of the family Mustelidae, the most species-rich (and therefore diverse) family in the order Carnivora.|$|E
50|$|The <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> has {{the widest}} {{distribution}} {{of all the}} lontra species. Their habitat can range from northwest Mexico to central Argentina. They prefer clear and fast-flowing rivers and are rarely known to settle in the sluggish, silt-laden lowland rivers. While mostly occurring at 300 to 1500 m above sea level they have been found settled at 3000 m. They require abundant riparian vegetation and abundant den sites, {{but other than that}} the <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> is very versatile and tolerant to environmental change. The otter will prefer sites that are solid, high, dry, and in proximity to deep water. The <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> is the greatest generalist of all otter species. It can inhabit formidable habitats such as wastewater treatment plants, rice and sugar cane plantations, drainage ditches, and swamps. It can inhabit cold, glacial lakes in the Andes of Ecuador. It can also live on the shorelines of marine environments hunting marine species and playing in the highly saline water.|$|E
50|$|Breeding occurs {{mostly in}} spring. Gestation will last 56 days {{and produce a}} litter of 1-5 pups. The pups are born blind yet fully furred. They will emerge from their mother's nest when about 52 days and begin {{swimming}} at 74 days. They are raised completely by their mother, as males do not provide any parental care. The male will only spend a single day with the female during breeding season. The female must keep her pups safe from predation by other <b>neotropical</b> <b>otters.</b> In one captive breeding situation, cannibalism by the mother may have occurred, {{though it was not}} confirmed.|$|R
50|$|The {{park has}} around 150 species of birds, and {{many species of}} animal {{including}} capybara, caymen, foxes armadillos jaguars and brown howler monkeys. Endangered species include maned wolf <b>neotropical</b> river <b>otter</b> and marsh deer.|$|R
50|$|In an ecologically healthy area, {{there are}} many {{possible}} shelters so an individual can choose its preferred den. However, studies show that not all possible shelters are occupied and not all shelters are equally utilized by <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otters.</b> Otters visit different shelters with varying frequencies, from once or few times per up to many times per year. One factor that influences their preference for a den {{has to do with}} the water level, especially during flood season, when a den near water level can easily be washed away. A den may be at the water level, near the bank, or more than 1.5 meters about the water level.|$|R
50|$|Some of the mammals {{found in}} this area are: the red brocket, the Guayaquil squirrel, the <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter,</b> the white-tailed deer, the mantled howler, the white-fronted capuchin, the ocelot and the jaguar.|$|E
50|$|Endangered fauna on the {{plateaus}} of {{the park}} include the red-spectacled amazon parrot, the maned wolf, and the cougar. On the slopes, the <b>neotropical</b> <b>otter,</b> ocelot and the brown howling monkey can be found.|$|E
50|$|Dens {{may have}} more than one opening, so the otter can easily exit to forage for food while staying safe from predators. There are many classifications of dens that Neotropical otters may use. A cavity among stones or under tree roots is preferred. In certain parts of South America, an otter may come across a {{limestone}} dissolution cavity or a cavity in a rocky wall. Though lacking a source of light, the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> can make great use of this sturdy home. As a last resort, an otter expend energy to excavate a space among vegetation or a river bank, though those homes are less sturdy. Vegetative cover is also very important for the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otter.</b> In comparison to other otter dens, the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otter</b> dens do not have holes directly into the water, they do not use plant material as bedding, and will live in caves without light. They are elusive creatures and prefer undisturbed forests without signs of human activity. When humans clear forests for agricultural land, the number of available otter habitats plummets.|$|E
50|$|Most {{negative}} feelings about otters arise from fishermen who {{compete with the}} otter for fish. More data {{is needed to determine}} how much overlap exists between the fishermen's desired catch and the otter's diet. The highest competition between <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otters</b> and fishermen occurs during drought conditions. Fishermen may move out of their regular fishing areas, into deeper pools where the otter usually hunts in the absence of people. In a study on local fishermen's attitudes, the study revealed that fishermen's knowledge aligned with scientific data about the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>otter's</b> behavior, body description, and other data. Because the fishermen's facts aligned with scientific knowledge, scientists could then trust the fishermen's first-hand accounts about problems they experience with otters. Fishermen reported that otters will damage their fishing gear, but do not damage crab and shrimp nets. The locals have varying opinions about the otters' presence, from understanding they have to share space with the otters to wanting to kill the otters. Fishermen's knowledge and frequent contact with this elusive species might qualify them as the best managers of the species. There have been proposals to subsidize their fish profits lost to otters. However, it might be more beneficial to pay them to collect data on the species. This would benefit fishermen economically, improve fishermen's attitude toward the animal, and build on to currently insufficient data about this species. Fishermen usually have the greatest knowledge of the resource. Otters are rarely victims of being caught in gillnets, themselves, and very rarely die from the same cause.|$|R
40|$|A ariranha (Pteronura brasiliensis) e a lontra neotropical (Lontra longicaudis) são duas espécies de carnívoros mustelídeos pertencentes à subfamília Lutrinae, que se alimentam principalmente de peixes. Essas duas espécies coexistem no Parque Nacional do Jaú, na Amazônia Central brasileira, sendo que a suposta semelhança na dieta poderia gerar interações ecológicas importantes entre elas. O presente trabalho visou caracterizar e comparar as dietas de ariranhas e lontras no trecho {{inferior}} dos rios Jaú e Carabinani, por meio da análise de amostras fecais coletadas entre os anos de 2006 e 2008 (82 de ariranhas e 75 de lontras). A maior parte das amostras (cerca de 85 %) foram obtidas durante a seca, o que restringiu o alcance da interpretação dos resultados a esse período do ciclo hidrológico. A ariranha se alimentou principalmente de peixes das famílias Cichlidae (Frequência de ocorrência= 91, 5 %), Erythrinidae (74, 4 %) e Characidae (29, 3 %), enquanto que a lontra consumiu principalmente peixes das famílias Doradidae (75, 3 %), Loricariidae (26, 7 %) e Cichlidae (25, 3 %). As duas espécies apresentaram baixa similaridade na dieta (Índice de Pianka= 0, 16), o que possivelmente reflete o uso de diferentes microhabitats e táticas de forrageamento e à grande abundância e riqueza de peixes na Amazônia. A ariranha captura peixes maiores e mais ativos (por exemplo, anostomídeos e grandes caracídeos) do que a lontra, a qual provavelmente vasculha o substrato em trechos rasos de rios em busca de peixes mais lentos, de hábitos sedentários ou noturnos (principalmente pequenos bagres). Outras presas que não peixes (répteis, roedores e macroinvertebrados aquáticos), apesar de pouco comuns na dieta de ambas as espécies, foram mais frequentes na alimentação da lontra do que na da ariranha. Além disso, as ariranhas consumiram peixes de uma maior diversidade de famílias do que a lontra. Neste sentido, a lontra parece ser mais especializada na captura de certos tipos de peixes, mostrando nítida preferência pelo consumo de pequenos bagres da família Doradidae. Os resultados obtidos indicam pequena sobreposição na dieta, porém sem indicação de interações tróficas significativas entre ariranhas e lontras no Parque Nacional do Jaú. The {{giant otter}} (Pteronura brasiliensis) and the <b>neotropical</b> river <b>otter</b> (Lontra longicaudis) are {{two species of}} carnivorous mustelids belonging to the Lutrinae subfamily, which feed mainly on fish. These two species coexist in the Jaú National Park, in Central Brazilian Amazon, and the supposed similarity in the diet could generate interactions between them. This study describes and compares the diets of the giant <b>otter</b> and the <b>neotropical</b> river <b>otter</b> in the lower Jaú and Carabinani rivers, through the analyses of fecal samples collected between 2006 and 2008 (82 giant <b>otter</b> and 75 <b>neotropical</b> river <b>otter).</b> About 85 % of the samples were collected during the dry season, which limited the analyses to the low water period. The giant otter feeds mainly on fish of the Cichlidae (frequency of occurrence = 91. 5 %), Erythrinidae (74. 4 %) and Characidae (29. 3 %) families, while the <b>neotropical</b> river <b>otter</b> consumed mainly fish of the Doradidae (75. 3 %), Loricariidae (26. 7 %) and Cichlidae (25. 3 %) families. The two otter species showed low similarity in their diets (Pianka’s Index = 0. 16), which possibly reflects the use of different microhabitats and foraging tactics and the abundance and richness of fish in the Amazon. The giant otter catch larger and more active fish (eg. anostomids and large characins) than the <b>neotropical</b> river <b>otter,</b> which probably scans the substrate in shallow river parts in search of slower, sedentary and nocturnal (mainly small catfish) fish. Other than fish prey (reptiles, rodents and aquatic invertebrates), although uncommon in the diet of both otter species, were more frequent in the diet of the <b>neotropical</b> river <b>otter</b> that in the giant otter. Moreover, the giant otter ate a greater diversity of fish families than the <b>neotropical</b> river <b>otter.</b> In this sense, the <b>neotropical</b> river <b>otter</b> {{seems to be more}} specialized in capturing certain types of fish, showing a clear preference for the consumption of small catfish of the Doradidae family.
