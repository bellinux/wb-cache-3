40|$|Towards a More Complete Picture: Dissimilatory Metal Reduction by Anaeromyxobacter Species The {{overarching}} {{goal of this}} 3 -year {{project is}} to explore uranium reduction in Anaeromyxobacter species. Specifically, we explore the physiological requirements of available Anaeromyxobacter isolates, design molecular biology tools to detect and quantify Anaeromyxobacter in pure cultures, consortia, and environmental samples, assess their diversity, distribution, and abundance in the environment, including DOE sites, and attempt the isolation of additional Anaeromyxobacter species from the Oak Ridge Field Research Center (FRC). The performers on this project include Frank Loeffler (PI), Robert Sanford (Co-PI), Qingzhong Wu (postdoc), Sara Henry (graduate student with fellowship, <b>no</b> <b>charges</b> to NABIR project), Ivy Thomson (graduate student, <b>no</b> <b>charges</b> to NABIR project), and Ryan Wagner (''Special Topics'' bioinformatics undergraduate student, <b>no</b> <b>charges</b> to NABIR project).

5|$|The benevolence of the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury also {{extended}} to the ownership and use of Lough Neagh, {{which is the largest}} freshwater lake in the British Isles and ranks among the 40 largest lakes of Europe. Five of the six counties of Northern Ireland have shores on the lough (only County Fermanagh does not), and its area is split among them. The lake is the source of 40percent of Northern Ireland's drinking water. While this ownership could feasibly increase the financial outlook of the family estate, at Shaftesbury's insistence, water continues to be extracted from the lough at <b>no</b> <b>charge</b> to either the citizens or civic government of Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO beginning with season 46, which premiered on January 16, 2016. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with <b>no</b> <b>charge</b> to the stations for airing the content. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix; on August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; the service will remain in operation, likely with its offerings reduced to a slate content available for free or serving as a portal for Sesame Streets website. The deal came in the wake of cutbacks that had affected the series in recent years, the changing viewer habits of American children in the previous ten years, and Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales.|$|E
5|$|TSN {{offered to}} {{broadcast}} her funeral live {{and to make}} the signal available to any other stations at <b>no</b> <b>charge.</b> Her husband, Shannon England, agreed to the broadcast on the condition that the family would not be shown during the service. CBC also broadcast the service, marking the first time a Canadian athlete's funeral had been televised live on two networks. The Brier was just getting underway and games in the afternoon draw were delayed to allow curlers and fans to watch the funeral, which was broadcast on screens at the rink. Regina's Agridome and Schmirler's home Caledonian Curling Club also opened to show the funeral. Nine hundred people attended the service at the Regina Funeral Home, thousands watched at satellite locations around the province, and hundreds of thousands watched on television. The funeral was conducted by the Rev. Don Wells, and Sandra was eulogized by Brian McCusker, teammate Joan McCusker's husband.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO (which had not aired any original children's programming since 2005) in late 2015. Sesame Workshop sought the deal because of declining revenue from viewer donations, and decreases in distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales (particularly through Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales), with the intent to having the show remain on PBS in some fashion (HBO already had involvement in public television {{at the time of the}} deal, providing funding for the talk show Charlie Rose); the deal also came in the wake of changing viewer habits of American children over the previous ten years. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series starting with season 46, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with <b>no</b> <b>charge</b> to the stations for airing the content; however, HBO has not announced whether first-run episodes will air on the pay service's main channel or its multiplex channel HBO Family. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix. On August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; instead of shutting it down entirely, it intends to scale back its offerings to either provide access to a reduced slate of free content or act as a portal for Sesame Streets website.|$|E
