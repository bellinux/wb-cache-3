5|$|Mitoxantrone is an {{immunosuppressant}} {{also used}} in cancer chemotherapy which was approved for MS in the year 2000; whereas <b>natalizumab</b> is a monoclonal antibody that was initially approved in 2004. Both are given by intravenous infusion at monthly intervals {{in the case of}} <b>natalizumab</b> and every three months in the case of mitoxantrone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Natalizumab</b> and {{mitoxantrone}} {{are considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. <b>Natalizumab</b> halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, eleven disease-modifying {{medications}} {{have been}} approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). They are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, <b>natalizumab,</b> fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, and ocrelizumab.|$|E
5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as <b>natalizumab,</b> have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking <b>natalizumab.</b> While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. <b>Natalizumab</b> reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with <b>natalizumab</b> (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
5|$|There are no {{official}} guidelines {{yet on the}} use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development. While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking <b>natalizumab</b> who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. Dimethyl fumarate is potentially {{one of the most interesting}} oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile.|$|E
25|$|<b>Natalizumab</b> is an anti-integrin {{monoclonal}} antibody that has shown utility as induction and maintenance treatment for {{moderate to severe}} Crohn's disease. <b>Natalizumab</b> may be appropriate in patients who {{do not respond to}} medications that block tumor necrosis factor-alpha, such as infliximab.|$|E
25|$|In January 2008, the FDA {{approved}} <b>natalizumab</b> {{for both}} induction of remission {{and maintenance of}} remission for moderate to severe Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 3 large {{randomized}} controlled trials {{have demonstrated that}} <b>natalizumab</b> is effective in increasing rates of remission and maintaining symptom-free status in patients with Crohn's disease.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after its}} {{approval}} <b>natalizumab</b> was {{withdrawn from the}} market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare but hazardous neurological condition called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is an opportunistic infection with neurological progressive symptoms caused by the replication of the JC virus in the glial cells of the brain. All 3 initial cases were taking <b>natalizumab</b> in combination with interferon beta-1a. After a safety review the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program. As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported, all [...] in patients who had taken <b>natalizumab</b> {{for more than a}} year. While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between 3 and 4-fold. The estimated prevalence of PML is 1.5 cases per thousand <b>natalizumab</b> users. Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, while most of the remaining are importantly disabled.|$|E
500|$|Medications {{approved}} by the FDA include currently eleven medications: interferons beta-1a and [...] beta-1b, four monoclonal antibodies: <b>natalizumab,</b> alemtuzumab, daclizumab and ocrelizumab, and five immunomodulators: glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, [...] fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate.|$|E
500|$|Mitoxantrone {{has shown}} {{positive}} effects {{in people with}} a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression {{of the disease and}} the frequency of relapses in people after two years. In 2007 it was the only medication approved in the USA for both secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; however, it causes dose-dependent cardiac toxicity which limits its long-term use. It is also not approved in Europe. <b>Natalizumab</b> has shown efficacy and has been approved for secondary progressive MS with relapses. Studies on the use of Interferon-beta-1b in secondary progressive and progressive relapsing [...] MS do not support that it slows progression of the disease, although it is effective in reducing the number of relapses.|$|E
500|$|Medications are {{modestly}} {{effective at}} decreasing {{the number of}} attacks in RRMS and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments. Nevertheless, not all the patients are responsive to these therapies. It is known that 30% of MS patients are non-responsive to Beta interferon. [...] One of the factors related to non-respondance {{is the presence of}} high levels of interferon beta neutralizing [...] antibodies. Interferon therapy, and specially interferon beta-1b, induces the production of [...] neutralizing [...] antibodies, usually in the second 6 months of treatment, in 5 to 30% of treated patients. Moreover, a subset of RRMS patients with specially active MS, sometimes called [...] "rapidly worsening MS" [...] are normally non-responders to immunomodulators and are treated with either mitoxantrone or <b>natalizumab.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Natalizumab</b> {{has also}} been linked to PML (though only when used in {{combination}} with interferon beta-1a). [...] The label also recommends monitoring of liver enzymes due to concerns over possible damage or failure.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{two other}} {{recombinant}} medications {{were reported to}} have benefit in moderate to severe Crohn's disease. [...] Certolizumab is a Fab fragment of a humanized anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody that is attached to polyethylene glycol to increase its half-life in circulation. [...] It was found to have efficacy over placebo medications for 10 weeks in the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease in one large trial. [...] <b>Natalizumab</b> is an anti-integrin monoclonal antibody that shown utility as induction and maintenance treatment for moderate to severe Crohn's disease. [...] However, it has been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a usually fatal viral infection of the brain, that may limit its use.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{randomized}} controlled trials {{have demonstrated that}} <b>natalizumab</b> is effective in increasing rates of remission and maintaining symptom-free status in patients with Crohn's disease. <b>Natalizumab</b> may be appropriate in patients who {{do not respond to}} medications that block tumor necrosis factor-alpha such as infliximab, with some evidence to support combination treatment of Crohn's disease with <b>natalizumab</b> and infliximab may be helpful in inducing remission. [...] Treatment of adolescent patients with <b>natalizumab</b> demonstrates an effectiveness similar to that of adult patients.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Natalizumab</b> {{appears to}} {{interact}} with other immune-modulating drugs to {{increase the risk of}} progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an often-fatal opportunistic infection caused by the JC virus. In 2005, two people taking <b>natalizumab</b> in combination with interferon beta-1a developed PML. One died, and the other recovered with disabling sequelae. A third fatal case initially attributed to an astrocytoma was reported in a patient being treated for Crohn's disease. [...] Though the patient was being treated with <b>natalizumab</b> in combination with azathioprine, corticosteroids and infliximab, indications of PML infection appeared only after <b>natalizumab</b> monotherapy was re-introduced. [...] No deaths from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy have been linked to <b>natalizumab</b> when it was not combined with other immune-modulating drugs and other rates of opportunistic infections are not increased in patients taking <b>natalizumab</b> possibly due to the drug’s mechanism of action. [...] Other than a prior history of PML, there is no known method to identify patients at risk of developing PML. Natalizumab's label indicates that it is contraindicated for immunosuppressed individuals or those with a history of PML. Due to the uncertain risk of PML, <b>natalizumab</b> is only available through a restricted distribution program. [...] As of June 2009, ten cases of PML associated with <b>natalizumab</b> have been reported. [...] At least one of them had not previously taken any other inmunomodulator therapy. [...] By January 21, 2010 the United States Food and Drug Administration reported a total of 31 confirmed cases of PML associated with <b>natalizumab.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Natalizumab</b> {{can also}} induce neutralising {{antibodies}} 4 to 6 months after treatment initiation. Fetuin-A (alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein) and circulating CD49 expression are emerging biomarkers for the therapeutic efficacy of <b>natalizumab</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Natalizumab</b> was {{originally}} approved {{for treatment of}} multiple sclerosis in 2004, through the FDA's accelerated Fast Track program, due to the drug's efficacy in one-year clinical trials. In February 2005, four months after its approval, <b>natalizumab</b> was withdrawn voluntarily by the manufacturer after two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Groups representing individuals with MS lobbied to have the drug returned to the US market and in June, 2006, after recommendation by an advisory committee and a review of two years of safety and efficacy data, the FDA re-approved <b>natalizumab</b> for patients with all relapsing forms of MS (relapse-remitting, secondary-progressive, and progressive-relapsing) as a first-line or second-line therapy. Patients taking <b>natalizumab</b> must enter into a registry for monitoring. [...] <b>Natalizumab</b> is the only drug after alosetron withdrawn for safety reasons that returned to the US market.|$|E
50|$|The boxed {{warning for}} the drug <b>natalizumab</b> (Tysabri, marketed by Elan and {{developed}} by Biogen Idec) includes a statement that JC virus resulted in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy developing in three patients who received <b>natalizumab</b> in clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|In April, 2006 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use {{recommended}} authorizing <b>natalizumab</b> {{to treat}} relapsing-remitting MS, and {{several weeks later}} the European Medicines Agency approved <b>natalizumab</b> in the European Union for highly-active relapsing remitting MS.|$|E

50|$|<b>Natalizumab</b> is a humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody against the {{cell adhesion molecule}} α4-integrin. <b>Natalizumab</b> {{is used in the}} treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease. It is co-marketed by Biogen and Élan as Tysabri, and was previously named Antegren. <b>Natalizumab</b> is administered by intravenous infusion every 28 days. The drug is believed to work by reducing the ability of inflammatory immune cells to attach to and pass through the cell layers lining the intestines and blood-brain barrier. <b>Natalizumab</b> has proven effective in treating the symptoms of both diseases, preventing relapse, vision loss, cognitive decline and significantly improving quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis, as well as increasing rates of remission and preventing relapse in Crohn's disease.|$|E
50|$|Mitoxantrone is an {{immunosuppressant}} {{also used}} in cancer chemotherapy which was approved for MS in the year 2000; whereas <b>natalizumab</b> is a monoclonal antibody that was initially approved in 2004.

5000|$|<b>Natalizumab</b> was {{evaluated}} in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials {{in people with}} multiple sclerosis. The studies enrolled individuals with MS who experienced at least one clinical relapse during the prior year and had a Kurtzke EDSS score between 0 and 5. In these trials <b>natalizumab</b> was shown to reduce relapses in individuals with MS by 68% vs. placebo, a margin far greater than had been seen for other approved MS therapies. [...] <b>Natalizumab</b> also slowed the progression of disability in patients with relapsing MS. In combination with interferon beta-1a (IB1A), relapsing and disability progression were reduced more than IB1A alone. [...] Other benefits of <b>natalizumab</b> use by patients with relapsing MS included reduced visual loss, {{a significant increase in}} the proportion of disease-free individuals, significantly improved assessments of health-related quality of life in relapsing individuals, reduced cognitive decline of a portion of individuals with MS, reduced hospitalizations and steroid use, and prevention of the formation of new lesions. [...] Approximately 6% of individuals receiving <b>natalizumab</b> have been found to develop persistent antibodies to the drug, which reduces its efficacy and produce reactions during the infusion of the drug, as well as hypersensitivity. [...] <b>Natalizumab</b> is approved in the United States and the European Union. It is indicated as monotherapy (not combined with other drugs) for the treatment of highly active relapsing remitting MS in spite of prior treatments. <b>Natalizumab</b> offers a limited improvement in efficacy compared to other treatments for MS, but due to the lack of information about long-term use, as well as potentially fatal adverse events, reservations have been expressed over the use of the drug outside of comparative research with existing medications.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{the small}} number of cases precludes {{conclusion}} on the ability of <b>natalizumab</b> alone to induce PML, its black box warning states that the drug has only been linked to PML when combined with other immune-modulating drugs and <b>natalizumab</b> is contraindicated for use with other immunomodulators. Corticosteroids may produce immunosuppression, and the Tysabri prescribing information recommends that people taking corticosteroids for the treatment of Crohn's disease have their doses reduced before starting <b>natalizumab</b> treatment. [...] The risk of developing PML was later estimated to be 1 in 1,000 (0.1%) over 18 months though the longer term risks of PML are unknown.|$|E
