500|$|<b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> the gay {{community}} considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and {{many members of the}} Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the [...] "screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap."

500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s McNallen used The Runestone {{to promote his}} theory of [...] "metagenetics"; the idea that spirituality or {{religion}} was encoded in genetic material and thus passed down to one's descendants. In formulating this concept he was influenced by his reading of Jungian psychology with its concept of archetypes existing within a collective unconscious. Accordingly, he described [...] "Ásatrú {{as an expression of}} the soul of our [...] race", and thought that it was a [...] "real mistake" [...] for anyone not of Northern European ancestry to follow Heathenry. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> the AFA embraced this theory, with it being rejected for instance by prominent AFA member Robert Stine, although it would later be developed in new directions by the Heathen Edred Thorsson.

500|$|Since the 1990s, {{there has}} been a steep {{increase}} in the number of recognized lemur species and subspecies through the discovery of new species, the elevation of existing subspecies to full species status, and the recognition of new species among previously known populations that were not even distinct subspecies. [...] Currently living lemur species are divided into five families and 15genera. [...] If the extinct subfossil lemurs are included, three families, eight genera, and 17species would be added to the count. [...] The recent rise in species numbers is due to both improved genetic analysis and a push in conservation to encourage the protection of isolated and distinct lemur populations. [...] <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> the scientific community supports these taxonomic changes, with some preferring instead an estimate of 50living species.|$|E

But around 20 people had entered apartment 5A before it was closed off, according to Chief Inspector Olegário de Sousa of the Polícia Judiciária.

2500|$|During {{the run-up}} to the German general {{election}} in 2005, which was held ahead of schedule, Stoiber created controversy through a campaign speech held in the beginning of August 2005 in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg.

2500|$|The liberal {{constitution}} {{to which the}} king had sworn loyalty was in effect {{only for a few}} months. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> Portugal supported liberalism, and an absolutist movement arose. On , in Trás-os-Montes, Francisco Silveira, Count of Amarante, proclaimed an absolute monarchy; this did not immediately have an effect, and new agitations followed. On 27 May, the infante Dom Miguel, instigated by his mother Dona Carlota, led another revolt known as the Vilafrancada, with the intent of restoring absolutism. John changed the game by supporting his son to avoid his own deposition (which was desired by the party of the queen) and appeared in public on his birthday alongside his son, who wore a uniform of the National Guard, a military corps that had been disbanded by the liberals, receiving the applause of the militia. The king personally went to Vila Franca to better administer the uprising, ultimately returning to Lisbon in triumph. The political climate was undecided, and even the staunchest defenders of liberalism feared to take a strong stand on its behalf. Before its dissolution, the Cortes protested against any change in the recently approved constitution, but the absolute regime was restored, the queen's rights re-established, and the king acclaimed for a second time on [...] John repressed demonstrations against this restoration, deported some of the liberals and arrested others, ordered the restoration of judiciary and institutions more in line with the new political orientation and created a commission to draft a basis for a new charter to replace the constitution.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2008, Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based analyst of {{military}} affairs, wrote in Novaya Gazeta that the Russian plan {{was for the}} “Ossetians to intentionally provoke the Georgians” so that “any response, harsh or soft, would {{be used as an}} occasion for the attack”. He noted that Russia's invasion of Georgia had been planned in advance, with the final political decision to complete the preparations and start the war in August apparently having been made back in April. The war was planned to start no later than the second half of August, because in the following months the weather would deteriorate. The goal of the war was to expel all Georgians from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, to free Tbilisi from Saakashvili, and to force NATO and Americans to abandon the Caucasus region. If the Georgians had not responded to South Ossetian attacks, then Abkhaz separatists would have started the operation to reclaim the Kodori Gorge. But Saakashvili succeeded in destroying the Ossetian militia and Moscow had no other option rather than to confront Georgia itself openly. Felgenhauer also argued in another English-language article that a heavy mortar bombardment of Georgian villages in South Ossetia on 7 August provoked Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to order a major assault. The war was not an improvised Russian reaction to a sudden Georgian military offensive in South Ossetia, and [...] "The invasion was inevitable, no matter what the Georgians did." [...] Earlier, on 7 August, Felgenhauer claimed that while Kokoity and other Ossetian officials seemed to be provoking a major Russian intervention into South Ossetia, <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> Moscow was [...] "ready to plunge headlong into war." [...] Felgenhauer had predicted in June 2008 that Vladimir Putin would start a war against Georgia in Abkhazia and South Ossetia supposedly in late August 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Having safely {{withdrawn}} {{his army}} to Dalton, Georgia, General Bragg directed Cleburne's exhausted troops to camp at nearby Tunnel Hill, a town bearing {{the same name}} as the spot where they had made their stand atop Missionary Ridge. Private Matthews reports that the 33rd Alabama was given [...] "some cabins... above the tunnel... some were of round oak poles, others of split oak log, their cracks daubed with clay." [...] Captured shelter halves were used as doors, and the men wintered there as best they could. He writes that those who died here were buried nearby; the regiment would accompany them to their final resting place [...] "with arms [...] reversed, and sounded taps; however, [...] did not always fire blank cartridges from our guns, for fear of exciting other sick men in camp." [...] Though they worried about the nearly worthless currency they were being paid in, [...] "there was not as much complaint as one might suppose, as all realized that the [...] Government was doing all it could for us." [...] Matthews blamed [...] "hospital rats" [...] {{for most of the}} grumbling, and observed that troops in winter quarters played cards, dominoes, dice or keno; those who had a dollar, said he, could go to minstrel shows. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> the camp had the best interests of their comrades at heart: [...] "two or more sharpers," [...] said he, would accost soldiers doing various chores and seek to con them out of their earnings. One regiment was assigned to twenty-four hours of guard duty every day; whenever the 33rd Alabama drew this duty, they would pack up their gear and march a mile or so to the front lines, leaving behind sick soldiers and a guard over their other property.|$|E
