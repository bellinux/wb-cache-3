5|$|In December 2013, a court denied Rajab {{early release}} {{after he had}} served three {{quarters}} of his sentence.

5|$|Lord Keith {{stated in}} the {{judgement}} that there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why this reasoning could not apply in English law. He stated that following the Matrimonial Causes Acts, the definition of marriage had moved from Hale's time from where the wife was subservient to her husband into a contract of equals.|$|E
5|$|Manuel José Reyes {{stated that}} he found <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to depose the Viceroy, {{and that it would}} be enough to appoint a junta headed by Cisneros. His {{proposal}} had nearly 30votes. Another 30votes supported Cisneros, with no change to the political system. A small group supported the proposal of Martín José de Choteco, who also supported Cisneros.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then we have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> for assuming that {{they are also the}} consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E
5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kirk, {{played by}} John Belushi, orders {{the ship to}} outrun the strange craft. Unable to do so, he orders phasers and photon torpedoes to destroy the craft. Unfortunately, all of the ship's {{equipment}} fails for <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> and the Enterprises systems break down. Suddenly, Dr. Leonard McCoy, played by Dan Aykroyd, runs onto the bridge saying that the aliens are on the ship. He says they did not beam aboard, but merely walked {{out from behind the}} curtains.|$|E

5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to believe that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the crime was burglary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott {{organised}} the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott saw <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to believe that his effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.|$|E

5|$|Not only {{is there}} <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> {{to get rid of}} the Viceroy, but even if no part of Spain {{remained}} unsubdued, the Spaniards in America ought to take it back and resume command over it. America should only be ruled by the natives when there is no longer a Spaniard there. If even a single member of the Central Junta of Seville were to land on our shores, we should receive him as the Sovereign.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} Copperhead is unclear. The visit was {{reported}} up the German chain of command, and some double agents later received {{requests for information}} about Montgomery's movements. There {{is no indication that}} Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this {{to the fact that the}} deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing that there would be <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion.|$|E

5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to dispute those statements.|$|E
