40|$|A s {{reported}} byMorse et al. (1), <b>night-eating</b> <b>syndrome</b> (NES) {{is likely}} toproduce an adverse outcome in pa-tients with type 2 diabetes. NES {{is defined as}} a circadian delay in daily food intake distinguished by evening hyperphagia (25 % daily food intake consumed after the eveningmeal) and/or nighttime awak-enings to eat at least three times per week (2). In addition to eating greater amounts of food in the evening hours, patients with NES often choose disproportionately large quantities of fat- and carbohydrate-rich foods at night (3 – 5). Here, we ob-served that a late dinner and a short interval between dinner and bedtime, which are characteristics different fro...|$|E
40|$|The {{circadian}} clock synchronizes {{the activity}} level of an organism to the light-dark {{cycle of the}} environment. Energy intake, as well as energy metabolism, also has a diurnal rhythm. Although {{the role of the}} clock genes in the sleep-wake cycle is well characterized, their role in the generation of the metabolic rhythms is poorly understood. Here, we use mice deficient in the clock protein mPer 2 to study how the circadian clock regulates two critical metabolic rhythms: glucocorticoid and food intake rhythms. Our findings indicate that mPer 2 −/− mice do not have a glucocorticoid rhythm even though the corticosterone response to hypoglycemia, ACTH, and restraint stress is intact. In addition, the diurnal feeding rhythm is absent in mPer 2 −/− mice. On high-fat diet, they eat as much during the light period as they do during the dark period and develop significant obesity. The diurnal rhythm of neuroendocrine peptide αMSH, a major effector of appetite control, is disrupted in the hypothalamus of mPer 2 −/− mice even though the diurnal rhythm of ACTH, the αMSH precursor, is intact. Peripheral injection of αMSH, which has been shown to enter the brain, restored the feeding rhythm and induced weight loss in mPer 2 −/− mice. These findings emphasize the requirement of mPer 2 in appetite control during the inactive period and the potential role of peripherally administered αMSH in restoring night-day eating pattern in individuals with circadian eating disorders such as <b>night-eating</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which is also associated with obesity...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the direct {{measurement}} of food intake in man is described. This method {{provides a means}} for independently studying many of the variables which are thought {{to operate in the}} control of food intake. A liquid diet from a hidden reservoir was ingested through a straw during a 20 -min. breakfast or lunch meal. Subjects were tested at the same time each day for several weeks. Stable ingestion patterns emerged after four or five trials. The ingestion of a constant amount of liquid diet at various intervals before the test meal depressed intake {{as a function of the}} time interval. Subjective hunger ratings correlated well with rate and amount ingested and were reduced appropriately by ingestion prior to the test meal. R,. ECENT clinical studies of eating be-havior in man have revealed a variety of disordered patterns, such as the <b>night-eating</b> and binge-eating <b>syndromes</b> of the obese, 15 and the often bizarre eating patterns in anorexia nervosa. 2 In addi-tion, new experimental techniques used in the study of man have demonstrate...|$|R
