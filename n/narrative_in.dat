5|$|Although {{set in the}} 12th and 13th centuries, Penman {{sets the}} {{characters}} and <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> her novels in medieval sites that still exist and can be visited, including castles, churches and archeological areas. Areas such as Aber Falls and Dolwyddelan Castle have important scenes in Penman's novels. In Devil's Brood, Penman sets the characters in scenes {{in a variety of}} medieval royal residences, castles and abbeys, in England and present day France, many of which still exist such as the Château de Chinon, Fontevrault Abbey, and Chateau de Loches.|$|E
5|$|Another likely {{literary}} {{source is}} the plague <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> the Book of Exodus, in which Egypt {{is covered by}} darkness for three days.

Commentators have also drawn comparisons with the description of darkness in the Genesis creation narrative, with a prophecy regarding mid-day darkness by Jeremiah, and with an end-times prophecy in the Book of Zechariah.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Literacy studiesThis {{thesis is}} a study of people’s {{preferences}} towards the engagement <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels and films, with The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson as the main <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> focus. The study {{is based on a}} survey {{in the form of a}} questionnaire, three in depth interviews, and different scholars’ theories on the topic. The study includes a sample population of 84 participants, and the answers provided by three interview subjects. 	 The data collected from the survey was carefully analyzed and it presents examples of the participants’ attitudes, habits and engagement patterns towards the experiences of <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels and films. The interviews are more profound individual investigations of the subjects’ thoughts and personal experiences towards the <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> focus, and towards <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels and films in general. The first chapter of this thesis offers an introduction to the thesis as well as an overview of the background of the two <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> focus, including the main plot differences between the two forms of each narrative. The theory chapter provides a presentation of some of the theories different scholars hold towards the engagement <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels and films, including theories based on empirical studies. This is followed by a methodology section, where the design of the methods, the participants, the procedures and the analysis processes of the studies are presented. The results of this study indicated that in the sample population of the survey, as well as amongst the interview subjects, there was a general preference towards engagement <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels over <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> films However, it was clear that further research needs to be done in order to provide any accurate answers to this issue. On the other hand, the results showed that there was a genuine interest in the engagement in both versions, and that depending on the different aspects of both experiences, there are differences that affect the experiences of the two forms. In the discussion section the results from the studies were discussed in relation to theories by several scholars, including Gerrig’s (1993) theory of being transported. Some central aspects of the discussion are the process of being lost in a book, the different components included when engaging <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> the forms of novels and films, the necessary considerations and challenges met when investigating the experience of different forms of the same narrative, and the emotional and psychological factors which function as motivators towards the engagement <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels and films...|$|R

5|$|As the {{tradition}} of Troilus the warrior advances through time, the weaponry and the form of combat change. Already in Dares he is a mounted warrior, not a charioteer or foot warrior, something anachronistic to epic <b>narrative.</b> <b>In</b> later versions he is a knight with armour appropriate {{to the time of}} writing who fights against other knights and dukes.

5|$|The {{character}} of Ulysses (in Greek, Odysseus) has been explored widely in literature. The adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (c. 800–700 BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer's <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson's Ulysses recalls Dante's Ulisse in his Inferno (c. 1320). In Dante's re-telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for {{his pursuit of}} knowledge beyond human bounds and for creating the deception of the Trojan horse.|$|E

Although {{the nature of their}} sexual flexibility is not explicitly discussed, the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation, with The Sun describing all of the characters on Torchwood as bisexual.|$|E

5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> the terms of remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of}} the Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Penang was {{established}} as a port by the British {{at the end of}} the 18th century, Vietnamese junks began to visit the area for trade at the instruction of the Vietnamese emperor in Hue. An early account in the late 1790s showed Nguyen Anh's (who became Emperor Gia Long) merchant ship docking in Penang carrying cargoes of sugarcane en route to India. Soldiers referred to Penang in its Sino-Vietnamese terminology, Tân Lang dữ (Chinese character: 檳榔嶼); a royal <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> 1810 showed the Vietnamese began to refer to Penang as Cù lao Cau, meaning Palm Island. Vietnamese Catholics travelled to Penang for seminary studies from the 1840s; these included illuminary Pétrus Ky. ethnic Chinese from Cochinchina sailed to the east in the Sultanate of Terengganu to trade in poultry and rice; some also settled there and assimilated with the local Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{relied on}} a change of locale to inspire him to write Pi and Requiem for a Dream. For The Fountain, Aronofsky {{was inspired by a}} research trip he took to Guatemala with Handel to learn about Mayan history and philosophy. The script for The Fountain was influenced by the accounts of Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano, who wrote examples of myth from an indigenous perspective, particularly Galeano's Genesis trilogy. The film Once Upon a Time in America also served as an influence on the script. Aronofsky, influenced by Bernal Díaz del Castillo's The Conquest of New Spain, applied the <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> writing the film's conquistador scenes.|$|E

5|$|There {{were several}} {{differences}} between Sullivan's adaptation and Stevenson's novella. Stevenson used multiple narrators and a circular narrative (allowing material {{presented at the}} end to explain material presented at the beginning), but Sullivan wrote a linear <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> chronological order. This linear approach and the onstage action conveyed a stronger impression of realism, eliminating uncertainties in Stevenson's narrative. Although making the story more straightforward and less ambiguous was not necessary for a theatrical adaptation, Sullivan's approach {{was typical of the}} era's stage melodramas and made the material more acceptable to audiences. The stage presentation's realism also allowed Sullivan to drop the novella's scientific aspects. Although Stevenson used science to make the Jekyll-Hyde transformation plausible to readers, Sullivan could rely on the onstage transformation.|$|E
5|$|This {{narrative}} {{has been}} disputed by the historian Steven Newton, who dedicated {{a section of}} his 2002 publication about Operation Citadel to refuting it. Using first-hand accounts of German officers that executed Operation Citadel and scrutinizing Glantz and House's sources, Newton contended that the plan for the 4th Panzer Army to swing from the Oboyan direction to Prokhorovka was decided as early as May 1943, well before Operation Citadel even commenced, as German planners of Army Group South had always expected an encounter between the 4th Panzer Army and Soviet reserves that would arrive at the Psel River and Prokhorovka. Other historians have corroborated these conclusions. Newton also asserts that {{this has always been}} the accepted <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> post-war literature.|$|E
5|$|According to Daniel Joseph Singal, Faulkner's {{literary}} style gradually {{developed from}} 19th century Victorian to modernist, with Light in August more firmly {{grounded in the}} tradition of the latter. The novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polaritieslight and dark, good and evilthe burden of history on the present, and the splintering of personal identity. The plot is also divided into dual currents, one focusing on Lena Grove and the other on Joe Christmas, a technique that Faulkner continued to use in other works. The narrative is not structured in any particular order, as it is often interrupted by lengthy flashbacks and constantly shifts from one character to another. This lack of organization and narrative continuity was viewed negatively by some critics. As in his other novels, Faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling, allowing different characters to lend voice to the <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> their own distinct Southern idiom. Unlike some of the other Yoknapatawpha County novels, notably The Sound and the Fury, Light in August does not rely solely on stream-of-consciousness narration, but also incorporates dialogue and an omniscient third-person narrator that develop the story.|$|E
