40|$|Abstract- Line {{simplification}} is {{a process}} <b>of</b> reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> segments to represent a polyline. This reduction in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> segments and vertices can improve the performance of spatial analysis applications. The classic Douglas-Peucker algorithm developed in 1973 has a complexity of O(mn), where n denotes the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> vertices and m the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> segments. Its enhanced version proposed in 1992 has a complexity of O(nlogn). In this paper, we present a parallel line simplification algorithm using a parallel Multipleinstruction-stream Associative Computing model (MASC). Using one instruction stream of the MASC model, our algorithm has a parallel complexity of O(n) in the worst case using n processing elements. remaining set <b>of</b> <b>line</b> segments to reconstruct the polyline (O(n 2) searches) ...|$|R

5|$|There are {{two kinds}} of stichometry. Total stichometry is the {{practice}} of reporting the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> in a work. Partial stichometry is the practice of including a series of numerals in the margins of a text, usually to mark every hundredth line.|$|E
5|$|As {{the site}} of the Necropolis station had been {{intentionally}} chosen to abut the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted as an obstacle to any increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to permit the expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E

30|$|The {{computation}} of the ellipses, {{modeling the}} line segments, is performed in two steps: an iterative split process, where points are modeled by a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> segments {{represented by the}} major axes of the corresponding ellipses and an iterative merge process, where small line segments are merged to reduce the model complexity. The split process tries to minimize the modeling error while the merge process decreases the model complexity, i.e., the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> segments compared to the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> points in the set.|$|R
5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts. New and refurbished rolling stock was gradually introduced on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> with automatic sliding doors {{along the length of}} the carriages instead of manual end gates, reducing boarding times. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded to such an extent that a large, new headquarters building designed by Charles Holden was constructed at 55 Broadway over St. James's Park station.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> included. Thus {{a collection of}} two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines {{may or may not}} relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E
5|$|Stichometry {{existed for}} several reasons. Scribes were {{paid by the}} line and their fee per line was {{sometimes}} fixed by legal decree. Authors occasionally cited passages {{in the works of}} other authors by giving their approximate line number. Book buyers used total line counts to check that copied texts were complete. Library catalogs listed the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> in each work along with the title and author.|$|E

The Bay State Street Railway took over operations in 1911 and joined the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway in 1919. Trolley service in Lynn lasted until 1938.|$|E
5|$|The {{libraries}} of Europe contain many medieval {{copies of}} ancient Greek and Latin texts. Many of these contain short notes or 'subscriptions' {{on the final}} page that, in hundreds of cases, give the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> in the work. In texts of classical authors such as Herodotus and Demosthenes, these totals are expressed in the older, acrophonic numerals {{that were used in}} Athens during the classical period but abandoned sometime during the Hellenistic period. Thus these stichometric totals are thought to descend, along with the content of the texts, from very early editions.|$|E
5|$|Despite the World War I, {{significant}} {{extensions of}} rail lines were carried out, {{particularly in the}} wheat growing areas in the north west and west. The new lengthy parallel lines {{were considered to be}} cheaper to operate than the numerous short spurs such as those in the Goulburn Valley. By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely complete, with the best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW.

5|$|Rutherford's Liberals self-identified as {{the party}} of free enterprise, in {{contrast}} to the public ownership-supporting Conservatives. Despite this, they made a limited number of large-scale forays into government operation of utilities, the most notable of which was the creation of Alberta Government Telephones. In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies. Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies. The largest of this latter group was the Bell Telephone Company, which held a monopoly over service in Calgary. Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907. The government constructed a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines,</b> beginning with one between Calgary and Banff, and also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.|$|E
5|$|Three or {{four months}} before the release of Little Busters!, {{it was decided that}} an adult version of the game would be {{developed}} titled , or Little Busters-EX for short.

Lines from the original game were rewritten as well for Ecstasy, and the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> with spoken dialogue comes to 43,347 lines. The total word count in Ecstasy exceeds that of Clannad by about 4,000 words, making it Key's longest work, and carries so much data that Ecstasy was released on two DVDs instead of one for the original release.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|E

5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E
