In recent times his {{research was}} on quantum groups and <b>non-commutative</b> <b>geometry,</b> subjects of importance both for mathematics and physics. He authored more than 70 original mathematical papers, singly or with colleagues in Ireland, Europe and North America. He {{will also be}} remembered for his book, , {{which was published in}} 1990 to worldwide acclaim.|$|E
25|$|On foot of his {{expertise}} {{he was invited}} in the mid 1990s {{to participate in the}} EU Operator Algebras Network, {{and as a result of}} his involvement he succeeded in attracting substantial funding from the EU which enabled him to organise the first of a series of major conferences on Operators Algebras in UCC in 1995, which attracted mathematicians from all parts of the world, and to fund several postdoctoral research assistants to work under his direction. His membership of this network allowed him to establish an internationally recognised centre of excellence in UCC in operator algebras and <b>non-commutative</b> <b>geometry,</b> a legacy that will endure.|$|E
25|$|Universal {{enveloping}} algebras {{are used}} in the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. For example, Verma modules can be constructed as quotients of the universal enveloping algebra. In addition, the enveloping algebra gives a precise definition for the Casimir operators. Because Casimir operators commute with all elements of a Lie algebra, they can be used to classify representations. The precise definition also allows the importation of Casimir operators into other areas of mathematics, specifically, those which have a differential algebra. They also {{play a central role in}} some recent developments in mathematics. In particular, their dual provides a commutative example of the objects studied in <b>non-commutative</b> <b>geometry,</b> the quantum groups. This dual can be shown, by the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, to contain the C* algebra of the corresponding Lie group. This relationship generalizes to the idea of Tannaka-Krein duality between compact topological groups and their representations.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the non-commutativity in quantum Hall system may get modified.

We explicitly perform an exact calculation using a singular interaction and show that, when projected to a certain Landau level, the emergent <b>non-commutative</b> <b>geometries</b> of the projected coordinates belong to a one parameter family. There is a possibility of obtaining the filling fraction of fractional quantum Hall effect by suitably choosing {{the value of the}} self-adjoint extension parameter. Comment: 5 pages, revte...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{results from}} formal theory have {{demonstrated}} that <b>non-commutative</b> <b>geometries</b> naturally appear wihin the context of string/M-theory. One consequence of this possibility is that QED takes on a non-abeian nature due {{to the introduction of}} 3 - and 4 -point functions. In addition, each QED vertex acquires momentum depedent phase factor. We parameterize the effects of non-cmmutative space-time co-ordinates and show that they lead to observable signatures in several QED 2 → 2 processes in collisions.
