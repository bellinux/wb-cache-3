The contribution of this study is three-fold. First, we explicitly include variables representing <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> and soil characteristics of farmland. Second, we employ a quantile regression approach to examine potentially heterogeneous impacts of <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> and soil characteristics at different quantiles of farmland values. Third, we utilized data from a nationwide survey of farm household to examine findings in studies using regional data are consistent at a national scale. Our quantile regression analysis offers some insightful results. <b>Natural</b> <b>amenity</b> is positively correlated with farmland values and its impact is often more pronounced at a higher price range of farmland.

40|$|Urban {{displacement}} - when {{a household}} {{is forced to}} relocate due to conditions affecting its home or surroundings - is frequently caused by rising housing costs, particularly in wealthy, prosperous cities. However, its dynamics are complex and often difficult to understand. This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) of urban settlement, agglomeration, displacement, and sprawl. New human settlements form around a <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> that draws initial, poor settlers to subsist on the resource. As the settlement grows, subsequent settlers of varying income, skills, and interests are heterogeneously drawn to either 1) the <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> or 2) the emerging human agglomeration. As the agglomeration grows and densifies, land values increase, and the initial poor settlers may be displaced away from the <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> on which they relied. Through path dependence, high-income residents remain clustered around this <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> for which they have no direct use or interest. The agent-based model presented here explores the dynamics of this process. In particular, it reveals how urban displacement and gentrification can be sensitive to income inequality, density, and varied preferences for different types of spatial amenities.

40|$|Examining committee: Michael Hibbard, chairMany rural {{communities}} in the American West are in transition from natural resource extraction based economies to new forms of development. Those located in <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> rich areas are experiencing an influx of visitors and newcomers that drive increases in the demand for residential, retail, and service sector development. Despite the potency of <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> led development, planning theory concerned with employing amenity migration on behalf of community development is in its infancy. The Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Act is an important response {{to this type of}} development and serves as a case study of the evolving approach of the Federal Government in guiding the rural restructuring of the West. Through a combination of interviews and policy review this project explores the question: Has the National Scenic Act contributed to a new natural resource based economy, in which environmental protection has become the driver for nearby {{rural communities}}? The findings of this research suggest that the National Scenic Act has been implemented quite differently by Washington and Oregon; and these differences have contributed to significantly varying outcomes {{on opposite sides of the}} Columbia River. In particular, these findings imply that limiting economic growth to strictly defined urban areas can serve to protect agricultural economies, but may have substantial impacts on housing affordability. Overall, <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> led development is impacting all aspects of rural life and must be carefully planned if it is to result in a sustainable form of development for rural communities...|$|R

40|$|The new {{economic}} geography (NEG) {{has become a}} mainstay of regional science {{in the last two}} decades, as signified by the awarding of Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize. Yet, most American regional scientists and urban/regional economists do not use NEG in determining regional growth patterns. Instead, they rely on factors such as <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> migration, whose roots lie back to the work of Philip Graves in the mid 1970 s. Conversely, two of the world's leading economic geographers - Allen Scott and Michael Storper - have strongly argued that job availability not household amenities have determined US regional dynamics. Given the disparity of views over the largest developed economy in the world, we hold a competition to determine which of these leading contenders accurately predict US interregional growth dynamics over the last 40 - 60 years. The runaway winner of the duel is <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> led growth with the crown going to Graves. Implications are drawn for both empirical research and EU economic integration.

Our analysis focuses on three propositions implicit in much of the amenity migration literature in the USA: land management policies that reduce commodity produc-tion and/or increase environmental protection (1) improve the <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> values of public lands; (2) increase amenity migration to communities near public lands; and (3) stimulate economic development and increase socio-economic well-being in these communities. Our findings indicate that all three propositions are problematic and demonstrate the importance of community-scale analysis for understanding the relation between land management policies, amenity migration, and community well-being. We discuss the implications of our findings for public land management and rural community development...|$|R

National Forest Service owns and manages close to 200 million acres of land and has an annual budget in excess of $ 5. 5 billion. This study seeks to understand the manner and extent to which national forests influence an area's population and employment densities. This study specifically evaluates changes in national forest timber sales, recreation and <b>natural</b> <b>amenity</b> values. Nearly 75 percent of the Forest Service lands are located in 11 western states. Thus, this study will focus on all 477 counties in those states. National Forest timber harvest reports are available starting in 1977 so the study period starts then and continues through 2007. This study thus captures the period when extractive uses, e. g. timber harvesting decreased and non-extractive uses, e. g. tourism, increased, to become more equal. The Carlino and Mills model was used to track changes in population and employment densities. Several metrics for <b>natural</b> and recreational <b>amenities</b> such as precipitation and skiing facilities were found to be significantly related to population densities. However, changes in timber sales and the amount of land owned by the Forest Service were not found to be significantly related to employment densities...|$|R
