40|$|This study {{provides}} a conceptual {{overview of the}} literature dealing with the process <b>of</b> <b>citing</b> documents (focusing on the literature from the recent decade).

The core elements are presented in a schematic representation. The overview can be used to find answers on basic questions about the practice <b>of</b> <b>citing</b> documents. Besides understanding of the process <b>of</b> <b>citing,</b> it delivers basic information for the proper application of citations in research evaluation. Comment: 40 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

30|$|If {{we look at}} the {{subgraph}} {{identified by}} the aggregated flow (ID 9503097), we can clearly see two communities <b>of</b> <b>cited</b> articles in the layer network (Fig.  16, right) corresponding to the two separated branches <b>of</b> <b>citing</b> articles (Fig.  16, left). One community of layer nodes is also almost separated in two. One subgroup of layer nodes correspond to a smaller group of three publications, two citing another third. A small investigation on this group of publications actually shows that they all have one author in common (M. Gasperini), and that a fair amount of the corresponding subgroup <b>of</b> <b>cited</b> articles have been also published by this author: this may be a case of excessive self-citations.|$|R

40|$|The paper draws {{together}} central {{research on}} scientific {{problem solving and}} scientific documentation {{from a number of}} fields and demonstrates its latent potential for a general theory <b>of</b> <b>citing.</b> Specifically, two philosophical works on scientific problem solving facilitate the clarification of how research traditions work as solution constrainers. The interdisciplinary field of diffusion research is shown to deal with issues related to the issue concerning scientists’ choice of problems, theories, and methods. A number of empirical composition studies dealing with the act <b>of</b> <b>citing</b> are examined and shown to contradict the mentalist assumption that scientific documentation is an act of private consciousness. The paper concludes with a preliminary outline of a general theory <b>of</b> <b>citing</b> and suggestions for further developments...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the perceptions {{and behavior of}} Chinese tourism researchers citing foreign language sources in (for) their own studies. Theoretically sensitized to notions of dissemination of knowledge and science communication, and departing from the ongoing measurement of citation impacts, the study adopts a qualitative approach to the scrutiny of citer perceptions and behavior in the instances <b>of</b> <b>citing</b> sources from other languages. Observations and narratives from in-depth interviews with 24 active Chinese tourism researchers amply speak of the dynamics, politics, subjectivity, and at times irrationality <b>of</b> <b>citing</b> from foreign languages. In particular, the inductive analysis complements traditional scientometric perspectives on citation impacts and provides insights into the motivation, perceived benefits, facilitation, and constraints, as well as (re) presentations <b>of</b> <b>cited</b> ideas in the observed instances of science communication in tourism.
