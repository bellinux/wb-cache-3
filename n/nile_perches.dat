We examined competing hypotheses to explain <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> invasion and show that suppression of juvenile <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> by cichlids may cause the system to have two alternative stable states: one with only cichlids and one with coexistence of cichlids and <b>Nile</b> <b>perch.</b> Without cichlid predation on <b>Nile</b> <b>perch,</b> alternative stable states did not occur.

We tested the hypotheses that (i) <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> distribution is regulated by the same environmental factors on a local scale (Mwanza Gulf) and on a regional scale (Mwanza Gulf, Speke Gulf and the open lake in Sengerema district), and (ii) driving factors act differently on different <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> size classes.

Before the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> upsurge, specialised shrimp eaters and piscivores, among the haplochromine cichlids, only took adult shrimps, whereas we assume that most haplochromines used to include juvenile shrimps into their diet.

40|$|<b>Nile</b> <b>perch,</b> a large predatory fish, was {{introduced}} into Lake Victoria in 1954. The upsurge of <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> in Lake Victoria was first {{observed in the}} Nyanza Gulf, Kenya, in 1979.

The delay in the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> boom led to a hunt for triggers of the sudden boom and generated several hypotheses regarding its growth at low abundances – all hypotheses having important implications for the management of <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> stocks. We use logistic growth as a parsimonious null model to predict when the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> invasion should have been expected, given its growth rate, initial stock size and introduction year. We find the first exponential growth phase can explain the timing of the perch boom at the scale of Lake Victoria, suggesting that complex mechanisms are not necessary to explain the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> invasion or its timing. However, the boom started in Kenya before Uganda, indicating perhaps that Allee effects act at smaller scales than that of the whole Lake. The <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> invasion of other lakes indicates that habitat differences may also have an effect on invasion success. Our results suggest there is probably no single management strategy applicable to the whole lake that would lead to both efficient and sustainable exploitation of its resources. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} eutrophication, {{the introduction}} of <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> (Lates niloticus) and the increasing fishing pressure has changed Lake Victoria tremendously the last century. Since the 1960 s, eutrophication increased primary production, enabling an increase in fish production. However, eutrophication also created hypoxia pockets, which reduced the available habitats for fish. In addition, the endemic haplochromines declined, whereas the introduced <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> boomed in the 1980 s. The <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> boom and increased fish production resulted in the largest freshwater fisheries of the world. However, {{it is unclear whether}} fish production can still increase with further eutrophication as maximum primary production rates may have been reached. Fish stocks fluctuate since the 1980 s and in order to manage these, {{it is important to understand}} how eutrophication and fisheries affect the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> population. The present study investigates the bottom-up effects of eutrophication on the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> and food-web dynamics in south-east Lake Victoria. We analysed the level of eutrophication along an eutrophication gradient in the Mwanza Gulf. Phytoplankton biomass varied spatially and seasonally and was limited by nutrients in deep water and by light in shallow water. Fish distributions were dynamic, with environmental factors depth and temperature influencing <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> size structure and distribution patterns similarly on small and large spatial scales. Although prey densities of haplochromines and Caridina nilotica shrimp did not explain <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> distributions, ontogenetic diet shifts and composition were related to prey densities, suggesting an opportunistic feeding behaviour of <b>Nile</b> <b>perch.</b> Small <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> however, showed some preference to shrimp and <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> preferred haplochromines above Dagaa (Rastrineobola argentea) and juvenile <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> as fish prey. On a food-web level, the base of the food web was spatially and seasonally highly dynamic. The onset of rains caused a spatial differentiation in littoral/benthic and pelagic carbon sources, affecting the whole food web. Trophic levels of fish were related to the spatial variation in diet compositions. Although a large heterogeneity was found in water quality, fish distributions and food-web structure, bottom-up processes affected the food web similarly. Despite the ongoing nutrient load in Lake Victoria, water quality has improved since the 1990 s. Climate forcing through increasing wind speeds increased visibility and oxygen levels. Global climate change will therefore be an important driver of the water quality and fish distributions of Lake Victoria.  ...|$|R
40|$|Lakes Victoria, Kyoga and Nabugabo had {{a similar}} native fish fauna of high species diversity. stocks {{of most of the}} native species {{declined}} rapidly and some completely disappeared after <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> was introduced and became well established. Although, overexploitation of the fish stocks, competition between introduced and native tilapiines and environmental degradation contributed to the reduction in fish stocks, predation by the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> has contributed much to the recent drastic reductions in fish stock and could even drive the stocks to a total collapse. <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> is also currently the most important commercial species in Lakes victoria, Kyoga and Nabugabo and the stability of its stocks is important in the overall sustainability of the fisheries of these lakes. The question that was to be examined in this paper was whether the fisheries of Lakes Victoria, Kyogaand Nabugabo would stabilize and sustain production in the presence of high predation pressure by the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> or whether the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> would drive the fish stocks including itself to a collapse.

2500|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, it was {{proposed}} to introduce a large pelagic predator such as the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> to improve the fisheries in the lake.

These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia O. esculentus, as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as [...] "thrash fish" [...] or even a vermin by the British colonial authorities. In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it. The first introduction of <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the British Colonial rule) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954.

Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> began being caught in Lake Victoria. As the species was already present, there were few objections when more <b>Nile</b> <b>perch</b> were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962—63.
