Despite an increased need for coins in an improving economy, merchants made it past the 1964 holiday season without severe shortages, though the half dollar had stopped circulating. Most Fed facilities reported sufficient supplies of cents and nickels, with some still short on dimes and quarters, and shortages of half dollars everywhere—one Fed official wrote that his branch had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> half dollar deposited by a bank in eight months.|$|E

5|$|Some {{time after}} 7:00pm, a Woodsville, New Hampshire {{resident}} {{heard a loud}} thump outside of her house. Through her window she could see a car up against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. The car pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. She telephoned the Grafton County Sheriff's Department at 7:27pm to report the accident. According to the 911 log, the woman claimed to have seen a man smoking a cigarette inside the car. However, the woman later stated that she had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> man nor a person smoking a cigarette, but rather had seen {{what appeared to be}} a red light glowing from inside the car, potentially from a cell phone. At about the same time another neighbor saw the car as well as someone walking around the vehicle. She witnessed a third neighbor pull up alongside the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{headquarters}} {{itself has}} <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> deployment, {{even though all}} subordinate units have been deployed for several support missions. The 96th CA Battalion deployed units {{in support of the}} Iraq War in mid-2007. The brigade also had troops deployed in support of special operations units in Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan. The brigade suffered several casualties in Iraq, including two soldiers killed by improvised explosive devices. One of these soldiers, a Major, prompted the State of California to fly its flags at half staff. It also suffered several casualties which were rehabilitated through the new Wounded Warrior Project. The 98th Civil Affairs Battalion also had soldiers deployed to Iraq before its activation in 2008. Soldiers of this battalion also saw deployments to Africa as well as other areas in support of the Global War on Terrorism.|$|E

Much of South Florida's {{sensitive}} vegetation was severely damaged. The region had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> storm of such power in decades.

25|$|On 11 August, {{after her}} counsel {{maintained}} that Siddiqui had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> doctor since {{arriving in the}} US the previous week, US Magistrate Judge Henry B.

Prosecutors maintained that Siddiqui had received adequate medical care for her gunshot wound but could not confirm whether she had been seen by a doctor or paramedic. The judge postponed her bail hearing until 3 September. An examination by a doctor the following day found no visible signs of infection; she also received a CAT scan.|$|E

25|$|Harold Macmillan link: On 26 November 1950 His Grace The 10th Duke of Devonshire {{had a heart}} attack. Adams tended him and was by {{his side}} when he died, 13 days {{after the death of}} Morrell. The coroner should have been notified, since the Duke had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> doctor in the 14 days before his death. Because of a {{loophole}} in the law, Adams, though present at death, could sign the death certificate to state that the Duke died naturally. The Duke's sister was married to Harold Macmillan, and some have argued that Macmillan, who became Prime Minister during preparations for the trial, might not have wanted this case to be investigated further: The Attorney-General, Manningham-Buller, attended Cabinet meetings regularly.|$|E
25|$|More {{than any}} other player in his era, McEnroe was {{responsible}} for reviving U.S. interest in the Davis Cup, which had been shunned by Jimmy Connors and other leading U.S. players, and had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> top U.S. player regularly compete since Arthur Ashe. Connors's refusal to play Davis Cup in lieu of lucrative exhibitions became a source of enmity between him and Ashe. In 1978, McEnroe won two singles rubbers in the final as the U.S. captured the cup {{for the first time}} since 1972, beating Great Britain in the final. McEnroe continued to be a mainstay of U.S. Davis Cup teams for the next 14 years and was part of U.S. winning teams in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1992. He set numerous U.S. Davis Cup records, including years played (12), ties (30), singles wins (41), and total wins in singles and doubles (59). He played both singles and doubles in 13 series, and he and Peter Fleming won 14 of 15 Davis Cup doubles matches together.|$|E
25|$|The current station {{house was}} rebuilt around 1910, {{although}} some sources claim {{it was in}} 1927. Regardless of the correct date, it was designed {{in a manner similar}} to stations such as those in Riverhead, Bay Shore, Manhasset, and Mineola. It also served as the south end of a trolley Line into Northport from 1902 to 1924. A freight house from Camp Upton was moved to Northport Station in April 1922, after the railroad station there was dismantled. High-level platforms and a pedestrian bridge were added during the late-20th Century. Northport Station features two large parking lots. One south of the tracks and the biggest is north of the tracks. A pedestrian bridge is set up between the lots. It is wide enough for the after mentioned south platform to be constructed. Northport is one of the most elaborate LIRR stations. the current station is just east of the Northport Spur, which branched off the main and headed north to the seaport village of Northport, even though the Northport Station is in East Northport. The spur has <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> passenger train since 1899. Afterward, the spur was entirely used for freight service. freight service ended in 1978. The track lay abandoned until 1985, when it was torn up in preparation for the unbuilt Babylon Northport Expressway.|$|E

500|$|On 10 January, one {{of their}} lawyers, Manohar Lal Sharma, said in a media {{interview}} that the victims {{were responsible for the}} assault because they should not have been using public transportation and, as an unmarried couple, they should not have been on the streets at night. He went on to say: [...] "Until today I have <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> single incident or example of rape with a respected lady. Even an underworld don would not like to touch a girl with respect." [...] He also called the male victim [...] "wholly responsible" [...] for the incident because he [...] "failed in his duty to protect the woman".|$|E

500|$|In this episode, {{the sports}} {{announcer}} states he had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> [...] "beating like that since Rodney King", referencing to {{an incident in}} 1991 where King was beaten by six LAPD police officers. The incident sparked tensions in LA that {{eventually led to the}} 1992 LA Riots. When Pip is tackled later, the commentator states that he has not seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant. This references Grant's arrest in June 1995, when he was caught performing a lewd act in public with a Hollywood prostitute. Grant was fined $1,180, placed on probation for two years, and was ordered to complete an AIDS education program. The announcer makes an incomplete remark about a tackle, [...] "I haven't seen so many children molested since...". This was rumored to have been followed by a line, [...] "since Michael Jackson came to town", which was supposedly censored after the broadcast premiere, but {{there is no evidence of}} this.|$|E
500|$|McGovern then {{returned}} to his alma mater, Dakota Wesleyan, and became {{a professor of history}} and political science. With the assistance of a Hearst fellowship for 1949–50, he continued pursuing graduate studies during summers and other free time. The couple's third daughter, Teresa, was born in June 1949. Eleanor McGovern began to suffer from bouts of depression, but continued to assume the large share of household and child-rearing duties. McGovern earned a Ph.D. in history from Northwestern University in 1953. His 450-page dissertation, The Colorado Coal Strike, 1913–1914, was a sympathetic account of the miners' revolt against Rockefeller interests in the Colorado Coalfield War. His thesis advisor, noted historian Arthur S. Link, later said he had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> better student than McGovern in 26 years of teaching. McGovern was influenced not only by Link and the [...] "Consensus School" [...] of American historians but also by the previous generation of [...] "progressive" [...] historians. Most of his future analyses of world events would be informed by his training as a historian, as well as his personal experiences during the Great Depression and World War II. Meanwhile, McGovern had become a popular if politically outspoken teacher at Dakota Wesleyan, with students dedicating the college yearbook to him in 1952.|$|E
