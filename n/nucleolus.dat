5|$|The <b>nucleolus</b> is a {{discrete}} densely stained structure {{found in the}} nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the <b>nucleolus</b> are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the <b>nucleolus</b> depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the <b>nucleolus</b> results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n=50. Although the banding patterns on the chromosomes of all slow lorises are similar, this species may be distinguished from the Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis) by distinct differences in the number and location of <b>nucleolus</b> organizer regions.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the nuclear}} {{membrane}} is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear pores {{are required to}} regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression {{and the maintenance of}} chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound sub compartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of sub-nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the <b>nucleolus,</b> which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the <b>nucleolus,</b> ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.|$|E
5|$|Besides the <b>nucleolus,</b> {{the nucleus}} {{contains}} {{a number of}} other non-membrane-delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.|$|E
5|$|In eukaryotes, {{modifications}} of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA; 60–300nt), {{found in the}} <b>nucleolus</b> and cajal bodies. snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA. These enzymes then perform the nucleotide modification. rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs can also be the target of base modification. RNA can also be methylated.|$|E
5|$|McClintock's {{breakthrough}} publications, {{and support}} from her colleagues, led to her being awarded several postdoctoral fellowships from the National Research Council. This funding allowed her to continue to study genetics at Cornell, the University of Missouri, and the California Institute of Technology, where she worked with E. G. Anderson. During the summers of 1931 and 1932, she worked at Missouri with geneticist Lewis Stadler, who introduced her {{to the use of}} X-rays as a mutagen. Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural background level, making it a powerful research tool for genetics. Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified ring chromosomes, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after radiation damage. From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability. She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused variegation in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion. During this period, she demonstrated the presence of the <b>nucleolus</b> organizer region on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the <b>nucleolus.</b> In 1933, she established that cells can be damaged when nonhomologous recombination occurs. During this same period, McClintock hypothesized that the tips of chromosomes are protected by telomeres.|$|E
5|$|Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the {{catalytic}} {{component of}} the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the <b>nucleolus,</b> and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time. Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} exosome {{contains}} a six-membered ring structure to which other proteins are attached. In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex {{is present in the}} cytoplasm, nucleus, and especially the <b>nucleolus,</b> although different proteins interact with the exosome complex in these compartments regulating the RNA degradation activity of the complex to substrates specific to these cell compartments. Substrates of the exosome include messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, and many species of small RNAs. The exosome has an exoribonucleolytic function, meaning it degrades RNA starting at one end (the 3′ end in this case), and in eukaryotes also an endoribonucleolytic function, meaning it cleaves RNA at sites within the molecule.|$|E
5|$|When {{observed}} {{under the}} electron microscope, the <b>nucleolus</b> {{can be seen}} to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost fibrillar centers (FCs), surrounded by the dense fibrillar component (DFC), which in turn is bordered by the granular component (GC). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear lamina is {{composed}} mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later {{transported to the}} nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the <b>nucleolus</b> and is present during interphase. Lamin structures {{that make up the}} veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both scleroderma and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the <b>nucleolus</b> of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E
5|$|The exosome is {{involved}} in the degradation and processing {{of a wide variety of}} RNA species. In the cytoplasm of cells, it {{is involved}} in the turn-over of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. The complex can degrade mRNA molecules that have been tagged for degradation because they contain errors, through interactions with proteins from the nonsense mediated decay or non-stop decay pathways. In alternative fashion, mRNAs are degraded as part of their normal turnover. Several proteins that stabilize or destabilize mRNA molecules through binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs interact with the exosome complex. In the nucleus, the exosome is required for the correct processing of several small nuclear RNA molecules. Finally, the <b>nucleolus</b> is the compartment where the majority of the exosome complexes are found. There it plays a role in the processing of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA (the first identified function of the exosome) and of several small nucleolar RNAs.|$|E
25|$|Description: This {{paper is}} written in support of Moore and Robinson’s {{previous}} interpretation that, {{in regards to the}} spermatogenesis of Periplanata americana, the <b>nucleolus</b> of the first spermatocyte is the homologue of one or two spermatogonial chromosomes. They attribute the elongate form to mechanical influences and believe it to usually have a spherical shape like the <b>nucleolus.</b> In place of Periplanata americana, Foot and Strobell studied the spermatogenesis of Anasa tristis. The original paper asserts that Anasa tristis has 22 chromosomes, but they confirmed Paulmier and Montgomery’s assessment that Anasa tristis has 21 chromosomes after the paper was sent to press.|$|E
25|$|In {{bacterial}} cells, ribosomes are synthesized in the cytoplasm {{through the}} transcription of multiple ribosome gene operons. In eukaryotes, the process takes place {{both in the}} cell cytoplasm and in the <b>nucleolus,</b> which is a region within the cell nucleus. The assembly process involves the coordinated function of over 200 proteins in the synthesis and processing of the four rRNAs, as well as assembly of those rRNAs with the ribosomal proteins.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{polymerase}} I (Pol I) catalyses {{the transcription}} of all rRNA genes except 5S. These rRNA genes are organised {{into a single}} transcriptional unit and are transcribed into a continuous transcript. This precursor is then processed into three rRNAs: 18S, 5.8S, and 28S. The transcription of rRNA genes {{takes place in a}} specialised structure of the nucleus called the <b>nucleolus,</b> where the transcribed rRNAs are combined with proteins to form ribosomes.|$|E
25|$|Anti-PM-Scl {{antibodies}} {{are found}} in up to 50% of polymyositis/systemic sclerosis (PM/SSc) overlap syndrome. Around 80% of individuals with antibodies present in their blood serum will have the disorder. The presence of the antibodies is linked to limited cutaneous involvement of PM/SSc overlap syndrome. The antigenic targets of the antibodies are components of the RNA-processing exosome complex in the <b>nucleolus.</b> There are ten proteins in this complex and antibodies to eight of them are found at varying frequencies; PM/Scl-100 (70–80%), PM/Scl-75 (46–80%), hRrp4 (50%), hRrp42 (21%), hRrp46 (18%), hCs14 (14%), hRrp41 (10%) and hRrp40 (7%).|$|E
25|$|Cell nucleus: A cell's {{information}} center, {{the cell}} nucleus {{is the most}} conspicuous organelle found in a eukaryotic cell. It houses the cell's chromosomes, and {{is the place where}} almost all DNA replication and RNA synthesis (transcription) occur. The nucleus is spherical and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, DNA is transcribed, or copied into a special RNA, called messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific protein molecule. The <b>nucleolus</b> is a specialized region within the nucleus where ribosome subunits are assembled. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the cytoplasm.|$|E

500|$|As {{usual in}} Myotis species, M. alcathoe has a {{karyotype}} consisting of 44 chromosomes, with the fundamental number of chromosomal arms equal to 52. However, a 1987 study already found that M.alcathoe (then called [...] "Myotis sp. B") differs from both M.mystacinus and M.brandtii {{in the pattern}} of active <b>nucleolus</b> organizer regions on the chromosomes. M.alcathoe also differs from other Myotis species in the sequences of the mitochondrial genes 12S rRNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 by at least 5% and 13%, respectively.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} step of {{ribosome}} assembly, [...] a protein called RNA polymerase I transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into the subunits 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA. The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the <b>nucleolus,</b> aided by small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) molecules, some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger RNAs encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores.|$|E
500|$|Paraspeckles are dynamic {{structures}} that are altered {{in response to}} changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent {{and in the absence}} of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components [...] (PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI(m)68, and PSF) form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the <b>nucleolus.</b> This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.|$|E
500|$|The {{whiskered bat}} (Myotis mystacinus) and similar species in Eurasia (collectively known as [...] "whiskered bats") are {{difficult}} to distinguish from each other; for example, the distantly related Brandt's bat (Myotis brandtii) was not recognized as distinct from M.mystacinus until the 1970s. Small, unusual M.mystacinus-like bats were first recorded in Greece in the 1970s, {{but it was not}} until the advent of genetic studies that these bats could be confirmed as representing a distinct species, named Myotis alcathoe. In 2001, the species was described by German zoologists Otto von Helversen and Klaus-Gerhard Heller on the basis of specimens from Greece and Hungary. Although it also differs from other whiskered bats by morphological characters, Myotis alcathoe is most clearly distinct in its genetics, including DNA sequences and the location of the <b>nucleolus</b> organizer regions. Two studies used microsatellite markers on European whiskered bats: the first one used western European samples and recovered three well-defined species clusters for M. alcathoe, M. brandtii and M. mystacinus; the other one, conducted in Poland, suggesting a high level of hybridization with other whiskered bats that would further complicate attempts to identify M.alcathoe morphologically.|$|E
500|$|In 1906 Charles E. Lewis {{studied and}} {{illustrated}} {{the development of}} the basidia in order to compare the nuclear behavior of the two-spored with that of the four-spored forms. Initially (1), the young basidium, appearing as a club-shaped branch from the subhymenium, is filled with cytoplasm and contains two primary nuclei, which have distinct nucleoli. As the basidium grows larger, the membranes of the two nuclei contact (2), and then the membrane disappears at the point of contact (3). The two primary nuclei remain distinct for a short time, but eventually the two nuclei fuse completely to form a larger secondary nucleus with a single secondary <b>nucleolus</b> (4, 5). The basidium increases in size after the primary nuclei fuse, and the nucleus migrates {{towards the end of the}} basidia (6, 7). During this time, the nucleus develops vacuoles [...] "filled by the nuclear sap in the living cell". Chromosomes are produced from the nucleolar threads, and align transversely near the apex of the basidium, connected by spindles (8–10). The chromosomes then move to the poles, forming the daughter nuclei that occupy different positions in the basidium; the daughters now have a structure similar to that of the parent nuclei (11). The two nuclei then divide to form four nuclei, similar to fungi with four-spored basidia (12, 13). The four nuclei crowd together at some distance from the end of the basidium to form an irregular mass (14). Shortly thereafter, the sterigmata (slender projections of the basidia that attach the spores) begin to form (15), and cytoplasm begins to pass through the sterigmata to form the spores (16). Although Lewis was not able to clearly determine from observation alone whether the contents of two or four nuclei passed through the sterigmata, he deduced, by examining older basidia with mature spores, that only two nuclei enter the spores (16, 17).|$|E

2500|$|These {{composite}} snoRNAs {{have been}} found to accumulate in a subnuclear organelle called the Cajal body and are referred to as small Cajal body-specific RNAs. This is in contrast to the majority of C/D box or H/ACA box snoRNAs, which localise to the <b>nucleolus.</b> These Cajal body specific RNAs are proposed {{to be involved in the}} modification of RNA polymerase II transcribed spliceosomal RNAs U1, U2, U4, U5 and U12. [...] Not all snoRNAs that have been localised to Cajal bodies are composite C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs.|$|E
2500|$|One or more SRP {{proteins}} bind to the SRP RNA {{to assemble}} the functional SRP. The SRP proteins are named according to their approximate molecular mass measured in kilodalton. Most bacterial SRPs are composed of SRP RNA and SRP54 (also named Ffh for [...] "Fifty-four homolog"). The Archaeal SRP contains proteins SRP54 and SRP19. In eukaryotes, the SRP RNA combines with the imported SRP proteins SRP9/14, SRP19, and SRP68/72 in a region of the <b>nucleolus.</b> This pre-SRP is transported to the cytosol where it binds to protein SRP54. The molecular structures of the free or SRP RNA-bound proteins SRP9/14, SRP19, or SRP54 are known at high resolution.|$|E
2500|$|In most organisms non-coding genes (ncRNA) are {{transcribed}} as precursors that undergo further processing. [...] In {{the case}} of ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), they are often transcribed as a pre-rRNA that contains one or more rRNAs. The pre-rRNA is cleaved and modified (2′-O-methylation and pseudouridine formation) at specific sites by approximately 150 different small nucleolus-restricted RNA species, called snoRNAs. SnoRNAs associate with proteins, forming snoRNPs. While snoRNA part basepair with the target RNA and thus position the modification at a precise site, the protein part performs the catalytical reaction. In eukaryotes, in particular a snoRNP called RNase, MRP cleaves the 45S pre-rRNA into the 28S, 5.8S, and 18S rRNAs. The rRNA and RNA processing factors form large aggregates called the <b>nucleolus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The two Lsm2-8 snRNPs (U6 and U6atac) {{have the}} key catalyic {{function}} in the major and minor spliceosomes. [...] These snRNPs {{do not include the}} Sm ring, but instead use the heteroheptameric Lsm2-8 ring. [...] The LSm rings are about 20 times less abundant than the Sm rings. [...] The order of these seven LSm proteins in this ring is not known, but based on amino acid sequence homology with the Sm proteins, it is speculated that the snRNA (in the 5' to 3' direction) may bind first to LSm5, and precedes sequentially clockwise to the LSm7, LSm4, LSm8, LSm2, LSm3, and exiting at the LSm6 subunit. [...] Experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) mutations suggest that the Lsm2-8 ring assists the reassociation of the U4 and U6 snRNPs into the U4/U6 di-snRNP. [...] (After completion of exon deletion and intron splicing, these two snRNPs must reassociate for the spliceosome to initiate another exon/intron splicing cycle. [...] In this role, the Lsm2-8 ring acts as an RNA chaperone instead of an RNA scaffold.) [...] The Lsm2-8 ring also forms an snRNP with the U8 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) which localizes in the <b>nucleolus.</b> [...] This ribonucleoprotein complex is necessary for processing ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA to their mature forms. The Lsm2-8 ring is reported to have a role in the processing of pre-P RNA into RNase P RNA. [...] In contrast to the Sm ring, the Lsm2-8 ring does not permanently bind to its snRNA and snoRNA.|$|E
6000|$|Section 52. Now if {{the student}} will compare Section 35, he will {{see that in the}} white blood corpuscles we have a very {{remarkable}} resemblance to the amoeba; the contractile vacuole is absent, but we have the protoplasmic body, the nucleus and <b>nucleolus,</b> and those creeping fluctuations of shape through the thrusting out and withdrawal of pseudopodia, which constitute [...] "amoeboid" [...] motion.

6000|$|Section 138. The ovum (ov.), is now large, and its nucleus and <b>nucleolus</b> (the {{germinal}} vesicle and spot) {{are very}} distinct. The {{wall of the}} follicle consists, in the mammal, of several layers of cells, the membrana granulosa (or [...] "granulosa" [...] simply); the ovum lies on its outer side embedded in a mass of cells, discus proligerus, separated from actual contact with the ovum by a zona pellucida. The ripening follicle moves {{to the surface of}} the ovary and bursts, the ovum falls into the body cavity. In Figure 2, a ripe Graafian follicle (G.F.), projects upon the ovary.|$|E

The protoplasm of the ovum, except at {{that part of the}} surface where the germinal vesicle lies, is packed with a great amount of food material, the yolk granules. This yolk is non-living inert matter. An ovum such as this, in which the protoplasm is concentrated towards one pole, is called telolecithal.|$|E
60|$|Besides {{the free}} calciferous cells {{in which no}} nucleus was visible, other and rather larger free cells were seen on three occasions; and these {{contained}} a distinct nucleus and <b>nucleolus.</b> They were only so far acted on by acetic acid that the nucleus was thus rendered more distinct. A very small concretion was removed from {{between two of the}} lamellae within an anterior gland. It was imbedded in pulpy cellular matter, with many free calciferous cells, together with a multitude of the larger, free, nucleated cells, and these latter cells were not acted on by acetic acid, while the former were dissolved. From this and other such cases I am led to suspect that the calciferous cells are developed from the larger nucleated ones; but how this was effected was not ascertained.|$|E

How petty do such researches seem when compared with this one which strikes at the very roots {{of life and the}} nature of the soul! I had always looked upon spirit as a product of matter. The brain, I thought, secreted the mind, as the liver does the bile. But how can this be when I see mind working from a distance and playing upon matter as a musician might upon a violin? The body does not give rise to the soul, then, but is rather the rough instrument by which the spirit manifests itself. The windmill does not give rise to the wind, but only indicates it. It was opposed to my whole habit of thought, and yet it was undeniably possible and worthy of investigation.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have good}} reason to believe that several gemmules are {{requisite}} for the development of one and the same unit or cell; for we cannot otherwise understand the insufficiency of a single or even of two or three pollen-grains or spermatozoa. But we are far from knowing whether the gemmules of all the units are free and separate from one another, or whether some are from the first united into small aggregates. A feather, for instance, is a complex structure, and, as each separate part is liable to inherited variations, I conclude that each feather generates a large number of gemmules; but it is possible that these may be aggregated into a compound gemmule. The same remark applies to the petals of flowers, which are sometimes highly complex structures, with each ridge and hollow contrived for a special purpose, so that each part must have been separately modified, and the modifications transmitted; consequently, separate gemmules, according to our hypothesis, must have been thrown off from each cell or unit. But, as we sometimes see half an anther or a small portion of a filament becoming petali-form, or parts or mere stripes of the calyx assuming the colour and texture of the corolla, it is probable that with petals the gemmules of each cell are not aggregated together into a compound gemmule, but are free and separate. Even in so simple a case as that of a perfect cell, with its protoplasmic contents, nucleus, <b>nucleolus,</b> and walls, we do not know whether or not its development depends on a compound gemmule derived from each part.

60|$|PINGUICULA VULGARIS.--This plant {{grows in}} moist places, {{generally}} on mountains. It bears {{on an average}} eight, rather thick, oblong, light green leaves, having scarcely any footstalk. A full-sized leaf is about 1 1/2 inch in length and 3/4 inch in breadth. The young central leaves are deeply concave, and project upwards; the older ones towards the outside are flat or convex, and lie close to the ground, forming a rosette from 3 to 4 inches in diameter. The margins of the leaves are incurved. Their upper surfaces are thickly covered with two sets of glandular hairs, differing {{in the size of}} the glands and in the length of their pedicels. The larger glands have a circular outline as seen from above, and are of moderate thickness; they are divided by radiating partitions into sixteen cells, containing light-green, homogeneous fluid. They are supported on elongated, unicellular pedicels (containing a nucleus with a <b>nucleolus)</b> which rest on slight prominences. The small glands differ only in being formed of about half the number of cells, containing much paler fluid, and supported on much shorter pedicels. Near the midrib, towards the base of the leaf, the [page 369] pedicels are multicellular, are longer than elsewhere, and bear smaller glands. All the glands secrete a colourless fluid, which is so viscid that I have seen a fine thread drawn out to a length of 18 inches; but the fluid in this case was secreted by a gland which had been excited. The edge of the leaf is translucent, and does not bear any glands; and here the spiral vessels, proceeding from the midrib, terminate in cells marked by a spiral line, somewhat like those within the glands of Drosera.|$|E
