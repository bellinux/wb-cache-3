25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>again.</b> Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E

500|$|While her {{siblings}} were on hiatus {{to raise their}} families, Andrea launched a solo career. She released her first album, Ten Feet High, on 25 June 2007. It was produced by Nellee Hooper, {{who has worked with}} Gwen Stefani and Madonna; Bono was an executive producer. Her first single, [...] "Shame on You" [...] was an up-tempo pop song about men and women going to war and leaving behind partners they may <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>again.</b> It received positive reviews from music critics; IndieLondon described the song as a [...] "slick package" [...] that was [...] "polished, well produced and with a message that's difficult to ignore". Losing Todays David Adair gave the song a strong review, writing that Corr's vocals were [...] "crisp and uplifting". Liverpool's Daily Post gave the song a three-star rating, commenting that it was [...] "deceptively upbeat", which masked its [...] "heavier message about conscription and war".|$|E
500|$|Various music journalists, {{critical}} theorists, {{and authors}} have deemed Madonna {{the most influential}} female recording artist of all time. She topped VH1's [...] "100 Greatest Women in Music" [...] list and The Daily Telegraphs [...] "20 Greatest Female Artists" [...] list. Author Carol Clerk wrote that [...] "during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon." [...] Rolling Stone of Spain wrote that [...] "She became the first viral Master of Pop in history, years before the Internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookshops. A pop dialectic, never seen since The Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep {{on the edge of}} tendency and commerciality." [...] Laura Barcella and Jessica Valenti in the book Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop (2012) wrote that [...] "really, Madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look du jour, and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) say, do, or accomplish in the public eye." [...] William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Madonna has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to." [...] Alan McGee from The Guardian felt that Madonna is a post-modern art, the likes of which we will <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>again.</b> He further asserted that Madonna and Michael Jackson invented the terms Queen and King of Pop.|$|E
