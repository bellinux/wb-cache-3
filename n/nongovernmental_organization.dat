25|$|In 2008, {{authorities}} arrested 16 {{persons and}} prosecuted another 27 persons for alleged NSL violations. Of those prosecuted, four were found guilty; the remaining 23 were on trial as of year's end. In August authorities indicted a secondary school teacher {{on charges of}} violating the NSL for distributing materials related to the May 1980 Kwangju uprising. At {{the end of the}} year he was awaiting trial without physical detention. In another case four members of a <b>nongovernmental</b> <b>organization</b> (NGO) were detained and charged in September with illegal contact with Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) agents and distribution of North Korean press material for the purpose of exalting DPRK leader Kim Jong-il. The NGO claimed the government used falsehoods against the four and filed a defamation claim for damages. At year's end the four were in detention awaiting trial, and the defamation claim had not been settled.|$|E
500|$|Yet {{another option}} is to create the UNPA as a <b>nongovernmental</b> <b>organization</b> of democratically elected legislators. This would have the {{advantage}} of not requiring the cooperation of (sometimes dictatorial) national governments or world parliamentary organizations with dictatorial members, so only democratic legislators, parliaments and countries would be represented. The World Constitution and Parliament Association and other NGOs have attempted to set up workable parliaments. Dieter Heinrich critiqued this approach by saying, [...] "If it did succeed on any scale, it would divert resources from pressuring governments on thousands of specific issues, which citizens are good at, into the operation of a pan-global institutional structure, which citizens' groups are ill equipped to do...And the resulting assembly would always be of doubtful legitimacy (who does it really represent?) and of unlikely value as an evolutionary starting point for a real world parliament." ...|$|E
