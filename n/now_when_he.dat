500|$|In 1888 Henson {{was ordained}} priest. Shortly {{afterwards}} All Souls appointed him vicar {{of a church}} in its gift: St Margaret's, Barking, in east London, a large, working class parish, {{with a population of}} 12,000, and increasing. At twenty-five he was the youngest vicar in the country, and had a large staff of curates to manage. An All Souls colleague Cosmo Lang, himself {{on the brink of a}} Church career, visited Henson at Barking and noted, [...] "He came six months ago to a parish dead– 250 a good congregation in the church; and <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> preaches, every seat is filled– 1100!" ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1896, Hogan {{received}} {{an offer to}} manage the Youngstown (Ohio) Puddlers, a minor league team associated with the Interstate League. [...] The Vindicator reported that the outfielder refused the offer. [...] "Hogan expects to play again with the St. Louis team in the National League", the Vindicator stated. [...] The paper went on to quote an article that supposedly appeared in the Cincinnati-based Commercial Gazette: [...] "St. Louis fans {{are opposed to the}} idea of selling Marty Hogan, the fast out-fielder, who played with the Indianapolis team last season, having been loaned by the Browns". [...] In the spring of 1896, however, Hogan attempted to extricate himself from remaining contractual obligations to the St. Louis Browns. [...] Sporting Life reported, in May 1896, that Hogan was unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain a final release from the Browns, who retained him as an [...] "extra" [...] right fielder. [...] "Marty has not been given any kind of trial by the manager of the Browns, although he stood high in batting and base running in the Western League last year", the article stated. [...] "He is in fine condition, and is anxious to play, but does not prepare to be shifted about at the will of alleged managers". [...] The paper added that Hogan had returned to St. Louis in March 1896, prepared to [...] "purchase" [...] his release, [...] "but he has been held onto until <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> could have secured $1550 for his services in the Western League". [...] Hogan appeared especially confident of his baserunning abilities. [...] The article noted that the outfielder had [...] "offered to match himself to run 100 yards for $500 a side against any player in the National League". [...] Meanwhile, his batting evidently continued to improve. On May 24, 1896, an article in the St. Paul (Minnesota) Globe indicated Hogan performed exceptionally well at the bat during a contest between the Hoosiers and the St. Paul Saints. [...] "Marty Hogan...through an inadvertent mix-up of pugilism and baseball...tried to hammer the face off the ball, which had tantalized the other Hoosiers", the article stated, [...] "and when Marty's work was done, the ball was out of the lot and he was on second base".|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{began as}} soon as the band entered Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles on March 6, 2002. Much of Sea Change was {{recorded}} live, with extra effects (including bells and strings) added later. In order to capture the immediacy of the material, the artists worked quickly and spontaneously, frequently laying second takes of songs to disc. During production, Beck realized his singing voice had gotten significantly deeper. [...] "Before we recorded," [...] said Godrich, [...] "We listened to Mutations, and his voice sounded like Mickey Mouse. His range has dropped. <b>Now</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> opens his mouth, a canyonesque vibration comes out. It's quite remarkable. He has amazing tone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aguirre {{describes}} the SEC as an agency created {{to protect the}} public from Wall Street, but now protects Wall Street from the public, and calls it a revolving door, where people move from SEC positions to highly lucrative positions on Wall Street and also in reverse. [...] "All the agencies have to some extent or another a revolving door [...] But at the SEC, what you rotate into is an enormous salary leap. SEC managers may make $200,000. That same person may make $2 million as a starting salary on the outside and can move up from there. <b>Now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> leaves, I'm not sure he's worth $2 million as a lawyer, but he takes his Rolodex with him and that Rolodex is gold. The system maintains itself, because those that stay know their turn will come if they play the game. They see a director or associate director move onto a $2 million job with a Wall Street law firm. Then, the departed employee calls back to his former colleagues and says, 'you know I really don't think there is much of a case against so-and-so, I'd like for you {{to take a look at}} it.' And the case goes away; the system goes on in perpetuity." [...] Two of Aguirre's supervisors left the SEC for lucrative positions at private law firms. Paul Berger works at Debevoise and Plimpton. After failing to investigate the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, Linda Chatman Thomsen left her position as SEC Enforcement Director to become a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell, where according to the Wall Street Journal, she would be part of its [...] "white-collar defense group". Robert Khuzami, who succeeded her, worked as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan's Southern District of New York, then went to Deutsche Bank for several years before returning being named SEC Enforcement Director.|$|E
