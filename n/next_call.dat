5|$|In {{the early}} days of the service, {{lifeboat}} launch and recovery was usually undertaken by women. There were deeply-held views about women actually crewing the boats themselves – it was considered extremely bad luck. Along all parts part of the coastline, women supported their men on the lifeboat crews by working together to get the lifeboat afloat and then later recovering it from the water in readiness for when the <b>next</b> <b>call</b> came. While lifeboat crew are still predominantly male (92%), the first female (inshore) crew member was Elizabeth Hostvedt in 1969, and Frances Glody was the first woman crew member on an all-weather lifeboat, at Dunmore East Lifeboat Station, in 1981. Lauren McGuire, at the age of 27, became the RNLI's youngest station manager in 2011, at Clovelly, Devon.|$|E
25|$|Siebert {{spent the}} next six months on the run. He was apprehended in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, after placing a phone call to a friend who {{reported}} him to the police. His <b>next</b> <b>call</b> was traced to a phone booth near a restaurant where he was working and he was arrested the following day when he showed up for work.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} sought tenders for conveying {{mail from}} England to Melbourne via Southampton, Alexandria, and Suez. P tendered, but {{lost to the}} European and Columbian Steam Navigation Company, which then {{changed its name to}} European and Australian Royal Mail Co. P sold Larkins and the coal she was holding in 1857 to European and Australia, but European and Australian collapsed in 1858. At the <b>next</b> <b>call</b> for tenders on the route P's bid won. Larkins then reverted to P's ownership.|$|E
50|$|Walker-Pearlman is {{preparing}} to film his <b>next</b> <b>called</b> Dawana.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Carne was <b>next</b> <b>called.</b> He {{testified to}} being summoned while {{dressing}} by {{the cries of}} the servants, and to having found his sister lying dead.|$|R
60|$|Amy Hill, shop assistant, was <b>next</b> <b>called,</b> and deposed {{to having}} sold a will {{form on the}} {{afternoon}} of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener at Styles.|$|R
25|$|Van Doesburg wrote Dada poetry {{himself in}} De Stijl, {{although}} under a pseudonym, I.K.Bonset, {{which was only}} revealed {{after his death in}} 1931. 'Together' with I.K.Bonset, he also published a short-lived Dutch Dada magazine called Mécano (1922–3). Another Dutchman identified by K. Schippers in his study of the movement in the Netherlands was the Groningen typographer H. N. Werkman, who was in touch with van Doesburg and Schwitters while editing his own magazine, The <b>Next</b> <b>Call</b> (1923–6). Two more artists mentioned by Schippers were German-born and eventually settled in the Netherlands. These were Otto van Rees, who had taken part in the liminal exhibitions at the Café Voltaire in Zürich, and Paul Citroen.|$|E
25|$|On Philadelphia's next drive, {{the referees}} made two suspect decisions. The {{first was a}} non-call on a very obvious {{facemask}} on Brian Westbrook {{that would have given}} the Eagles a first down. The <b>next</b> <b>call</b> in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54.|$|E
60|$|I shifted my work {{nearer to}} the telephone-table {{so as to}} be ready for the <b>next</b> <b>call.</b> I had heard that Vincent Jopp had only been married three times, but you never knew.|$|E
50|$|Suisun <b>next</b> <b>called</b> at Saipan and Guam before {{returning}} to Sangley Point on 2 July 1950. In the meantime, the Korean War had broken out on 25 June 1950.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Ellison was <b>next</b> <b>called.</b> Her {{evidence}} {{as to the}} robbery was a mere repetition of that given by the squire. The counsel {{then turned to the}} question of the poisoning.|$|R
6000|$|Lawrence Cavendish was <b>next</b> <b>called.</b> His {{evidence}} was quite unimportant, being a mere repetition of {{that of his}} brother. Just {{as he was about}} to step down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he replied, [...] "I'm {{ready to}} stand by what I said, and I'll add that if I had any shares I'd give them away to anybody who would {{register}} as their owner before the <b>next</b> <b>call</b> is made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's easily figured out. He'd {{head for}} Mrs. Calvert's, and {{probably}} stay {{an hour or}} two there; then he'd go on to Brayton's place--they're friends--at night. Jardine's would be his <b>next</b> <b>call,</b> and he'd be striking west away from the larger settlements when Dave came across him." ...|$|E
60|$|The boy was on {{the streets}} again long before the time {{appointed}} for his <b>next</b> <b>call</b> at Horace Kelsey's offices. Having nothing to do, he mounted to the bridge, and took a walk across to Brooklyn and return. This gave him a splendid view of both cities, and afforded him a means of enjoyment {{until it was time}} to make the call.|$|E
50|$|A {{man named}} Reed, took up {{residence}} <b>next,</b> <b>calling</b> it Reed's Ranch. In 1857 a woman was killed on his ranch when the great Fort Tejon earthquake struck the area and collapsed {{the roof of his}} adobe house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, so long, brother," [...] Philadelphia Red <b>next</b> <b>called</b> to me. [...] "So long. Be good, an' {{love the}} Warden. An' {{if you see}} 'em, just tell 'em that you saw me but that you didn't see me saw." ...|$|R
6000|$|From Mr. Julius Tupp, of the Sunnybrook Steam Laundry, Twickenham, upon whom our {{representative}} <b>next</b> <b>called,</b> we {{have been}} unable to obtain much assistance, Mr. Tupp replying to all questions put to him by the one formula, [...] "Not talking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{never was}} so much off my own mind, nor on other people's:' and the {{recollection}} of all he owed to Mrs. Ponsonby's kindness rushing over him, he looked so much affected, that Mary was afraid of his giving way, and spoke of other matters; her mother responded, and he came away quite reassured, and believing Mrs. Frost's augury that at the <b>next</b> <b>call,</b> the invalid {{would be in the}} drawing-room.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile the gallant {{men of the}} coastguard, rejoicing in {{the feeling}} that they have done their duty so well and so successfully, though wet and weary from long {{exposure}} and exertion, pack the rocket apparatus into its cart, run it back to its place of shelter, to be there made ready for the <b>next</b> <b>call</b> to action, and then saunter home, perchance to tell their wives and little ones the story of the wreck and rescue, before lying down to take much-needed and well-earned repose.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hae twa boons to crave,' {{answered}} the sibyl, speaking low and hastily: 'one, {{that you will}} never speak {{of what you have}} seen this night; the other, that you will not leave this country till you see me again, and that you leave word at the Gordon Arms where you are to be heard of, and when I <b>next</b> <b>call</b> for you, be it in church or market, at wedding or at burial, Sunday or Saturday, mealtime or fasting, that ye leave everything else and come with me.' ...|$|E
50|$|Caddis was <b>next</b> <b>called</b> {{up for a}} {{friendly}} against the Czech Republic on 24 March 2016, again as a late replacement. This time, he made his senior debut as an 88th-minute substitute for goalscorer Ikechi Anya as Scotland completed a 1-0 win.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>next</b> <b>called</b> {{attention}} to the difficulties to be faced by natives in [...] reporting irregularities. The number of civil officials is too small; [...] the practical impossibility of reaching those that do exist--the [...] native having first to ask permission of the rubber agent.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first moment}} of {{recollection}} brought to her mind the danger which had overpowered her senses; the <b>next</b> <b>called</b> to remembrance {{that of her}} father. She looked around; he {{was nowhere to be}} seen. [...] "My father, my father!" [...] was all that she could ejaculate.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is likely}} {{enough that they}} will come this way," [...] Sir Eustace said as he and Jean Bouvard talked the matter over. [...] "Assuredly Arras will be too strong for them to attempt. The {{straight}} line would take them to St. Pol, but the castle {{there is a very}} strong one also. They may sack and burn Avesne and Auvigni, and then, avoiding both St. Pol and Arras, march between them to Pernes, which is large enough to give them much plunder, but has no force that could resist them. As Pernes is but four miles away, their <b>next</b> <b>call</b> may be here." ...|$|E
60|$|Martin drew {{that piece}} of money from his pocket, and tossed it towards him. Mr Tigg caught it, looked at it to assure himself of its goodness, spun {{it in the air}} after the manner of a pieman, and buttoned it up. Finally, he raised his hat an inch or two from his head with a {{military}} air, and, after pausing a moment with deep gravity, as to decide in which direction he should go, and to what Earl or Marquis among his friends he should give the preference in his <b>next</b> <b>call,</b> stuck his hands in his skirt-pockets and swaggered round the corner. Martin took the directly opposite course; and so, to his great content, they parted company.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't require beer, Molly," [...] said Dashwood with a smile, as {{he retired}} {{into the large}} closet; [...] "at my time o' life a man must be a miserable, half-alive sort o' critter, if he can't git along without Dutch courage. The sight o' your face and May's there, {{is better than a}} stiff glass o' grog to me any day. It makes me feel {{stronger}} than the stoutest man in the brigade. Good night, lass, or good mornin'. I must make the most o' my time. There's no sayin' how soon the <b>next</b> <b>call</b> may come. Seems to me as if people was settin' their houses alight on purpose to worry us." ...|$|E
60|$|The captain {{then made}} a sign to the natives to approach, and {{bestowed}} a necklace of smaller beads upon each. He <b>next</b> <b>called</b> to the sailors, and bade them come ashore, bringing with them only their hangers; for {{there was no doubt}} that the natives were friendly.|$|R
6000|$|The Coroner <b>next</b> <b>called</b> {{the only}} witness {{of the actual}} tragedy, [...] "Reuben Allen." [...] The man did not move nor change his position. The summons was repeated; a {{policeman}} touched him on the shoulder. There was a pause, and the officer announced: [...] "He has fainted, your Honor!" ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>next</b> open <b>call</b> for {{applications}} will be February 2012.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} enough," [...] said the honest sailor--"give me your hand; I'll {{see you as}} well through this {{business}} as I can, though it is but an unpleasant one after all--But what of that? our own honour has the <b>next</b> <b>call</b> on us after our country;--you are a lad of spirit, and I own I think Mr. Hector M'Intyre, with his long pedigree and his airs of family, very much of a jackanapes. His father was a soldier of fortune as I am a sailor--he himself, I suppose, is little better, unless just as his uncle pleases; and whether one pursues fortune by land, or sea, makes no great difference, I should fancy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will give}} you a letter before I enlist, Jim; and I will get you, when you are exchanged, to go down with it {{yourself}} to Weymouth, and tell them what became of me, and why I went into the French army. Don't let them think that I turned traitor. I would shoot myself rather than run the risk of having to fight Englishmen. But when it is a choice between fighting Russians and going out of my mind, I prefer shouldering a French musket. I will write the letter to-day. There is no saying when they may <b>next</b> <b>call</b> for volunteers; for, as you know, those who step forward are taken away at once, so as to prevent their being persuaded by the others into drawing back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{the enemy}} are really ready, the {{fighting}} will be desperate. 'Tis true that the Vendeans {{have a good}} cause--they fight for their religion and their freedom, while the enemy will fight only because they are ordered to do so. There is another thing--every victory we win will give us more arms, ammunition, and cannon; while a defeat will mean simply that the peasants will scatter to their homes, {{and be ready to}} answer the <b>next</b> <b>call</b> for their services. On the other hand, if the Blues are defeated they will lose so heavily, both in arms and stores; and will suffer such loss of life, from their ignorance of our roads and lanes, {{that it will be a}} long time before they will again be able to advance against us." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>next</b> reset, <b>called</b> Epic Edition, was {{released}} in August 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Tshobdun (Chinese Caodeng 草登; {{along with}} Zbu, <b>next,</b> also <b>called</b> Sidaba) ...|$|R
50|$|Upendra {{directed}} a horror suspense thriller <b>next</b> <b>called</b> Shhh! in 1993. The film featured his mentor Kashinath {{and a young}} producer and actor named Kumar Govind. The film was a major box office success and Upendra came out as an independent director. Shhh! is considered {{as one of the}} best horror/thriller movies in Kannada Cinema.|$|R
