5|$|Greece's mountainous terrain {{favored a}} {{defensive}} strategy {{and the high}} ranges of the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities. However, air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles. Although an invading force from Albania could be stopped by a relatively small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>troops</b> positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern {{part of the country}} was difficult to defend against an attack from the north.|$|E
5|$|In the East, {{under cover}} of ground fog the field army {{successfully}} withdrew from the Grebbe Line to the East Front without being bombed as had been feared, and disengaged from the gradually pursuing enemy troops. The new position had some severe drawbacks: the inundations were mostly not yet ready and the earthworks and berms needed because trenches would be flooded in the peat soil {{had not yet been}} constructed, so defences had to be improvised to accommodate the much larger <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>troops.</b>|$|E

5|$|Modern historians {{generally}} dismiss {{these numbers}} as exaggerations. One approach {{to estimate the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>troops</b> is to calculate the number of marines carried by 600 triremes. Herodotus tells us that each trireme in the second invasion of Greece carried 30 extra marines, {{in addition to a}} probable 14 standard marines. Thus, 600 triremes could easily have carried 18,000–26,000 infantry. Numbers proposed for the Persian infantry are in the range 18,000–100,000. However, the consensus is around 25,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{diminishing}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>troops</b> {{available to}} Vang Pao demanded their replacement by {{growing numbers of}} Thai volunteers (Project Unity), who increasingly took over the ground war in the north. By the end of 1971, the entire 55-man battalion of Thais were in action, whose total numbers were 6,000–8,000 men. During the following year, those numbers had ballooned to 17,800. The total force eventually deployed was three artillery and 27 infantry battalions.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} 300,000 has been doubted, {{along with many}} of Herodotus' numbers, by many historians; modern {{consensus}} estimates the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>troops</b> for the Persian invasion at around 250,000. According to this consensus, Herodotus' 300,000 Persians at Plataea would self-evidently be impossible. One approach to estimating {{the size of the}} Persian army has been to estimate how many men might feasibly have been accommodated within the Persian camp; this approach gives figures of between 70,000 and 120,000 men. Lazenby, for instance, by comparison with later Roman military camps, calculates the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>troops</b> at 70,000, including 10,000 cavalry. Meanwhile, Connolly derives a number of 120,000 from the same-sized camp. Indeed, most estimates for the total Persian force are generally in this range. For instance, Delbrück, based on the distance the Persians marched in a day when Athens was attacked, concluded that 75,000 was the upper limit for the size of the Persian army, including the supply personnel and other non-combatants. In his battle account of Plataea, Delbrück estimated the Persian army, including allied Greeks, as amounting to 40,000.|$|E

5|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>troops</b> which Xerxes mustered for {{the second}} {{invasion}} of Greece {{has been the subject}} of endless dispute, most notably between ancient sources, which report very large numbers, and modern scholars, who surmise much smaller figures. Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.6 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel. The poet Simonides, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that was assembled by Xerxes.|$|E
5|$|French {{security}} forces were initially {{taken by surprise}} and were unable to organize an effective response to contain the uprising. By May 1947, however, the French military had begun to counter the nationalists' attacks. Five North African battalions arrived in Madagascar {{at the end of}} July 1947, enabling the French to take the initiative. However, French army strength remained modest with soldiers numbering 18,000 in April 1947. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>troops</b> increased to about 30,000 in 1948. The French forces now included paratroopers, soldiers of the French Foreign Legion, and tirailleurs (colonial infantry) brought in from the French territories of Comoros and Senegal.|$|E

5|$|Muslim {{forces in}} this period {{comprised}} small bodies of professional troops, which were augmented by volunteers and conscripts in times of war.

The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>troops</b> available to the Syrian states was much smaller. The core of the professional troops were the ghulam or mamluk, who were trained for war since childhood.
