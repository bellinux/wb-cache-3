40|$|China {{is joining}} {{the group of}} {{countries}} that have reasonably comprehensive systems of social protection in place. In 2010, the <b>National</b> <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>Congress</b> adopted the first national Social Insurance Law, representing {{the culmination of a}} process of radical social reform. The question this paper asks is: what kind of welfare regime is being built in the <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Republic of China? China has been politically unique. It is one of only five remaining communist states, the others being Cuba, Laos, the Democratic <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Republic of Korea and Vietnam, and the only one (with some qualification for Vietnam) that has been economically successful. The characteristics of a communist state include centralized {{power in the hands of}} a party 9 lite and that this 9 lite is presumably motivated, to varying degrees, by some kind of socialist ideology of statism and social justice. While maintaining its political uniqueness, China has shed its economic uniqueness. With the reform and opening up that started in 1978, it turned its back on planned economy isolationism and has adopted an open socialist market economy. In considering what kind of welfare state is emerging in China, the paper looks at two hypotheses: is China producing a welfare state of its own kind, possibly a "socialist" welfare state? Or, if it is reproducing a conventional welfare state, what kind of previous experience elsewhere is it replicating...|$|R

40|$|State high-risk {{insurance}} pools serve {{people who}} have been denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or who don’t have access to employer based coverage. There are 35 state high-risk insurance pools across the country serving approximately 200, 000 <b>people.</b> The U. <b>S.</b> <b>Congress</b> is considering various proposals to expand high risk pool coverage as part of health care reform to cover people with pre-existing conditions. However, data suggest that high risk pools as currently proposed will not adequately meet the needs of those with potentially serious health conditions. Many risk pool enrollees fall into a gray area between being chronically ill, but able to work at least part-time, and being disabled to the point of qualifying for federal disability programs and their accompanying health care coverage. As Congress astutely noted in its 1999 Ticket to Work legislation, moving just one half of one percent of people off of disability programs and back into the workforce would result in $ 3. 5 billion in federal savings. Preventing one-half of one percent of people from being added to the disability rolls would result in an additional net savings of $ 3. 5 billion to the federal government. 1 Current High Risk Pool Costs and Coverage In 2008, lawmakers called for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine the abilit...|$|R
