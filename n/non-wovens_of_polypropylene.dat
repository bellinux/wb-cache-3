The effects of treating parameters on separator’s properties were studied. The IR and SEM {{were used to}} analyze the chemical composition and the surface morphology. Using electrical chemical property measurement, the electrical chemical prop-erty was measured and analyzed. The results show that the hydrophilic group was imported on the surface <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene</b> after Hollow Cathode Remote Plasma modification, so that the wettability <b>of</b> the <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene</b> secondary battery separator and the property of secondary battery were greatly improved...|$|R

The effect of the main experimental parameters on styrene grafting de-gree (absorbed dose, monomer concentration, reaction time) was investigated. It was found that sulfona-tion degree of the grafted polystyrene chains with 5 % chlorosulfonic acid at room temperature depends on the reaction time and reaches 80 % for the samples with a medium value of styrene grafting degree. Sorp-tion active polypropylene fabrics with sulfonic acid group densities of 3. 5 – 5 meq/g were obtained...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene</b> covers on plant growth and development, frost protection, tuber yield and {{quality and the}} economic effectiveness in early potato production. A high income from early potato production is possible under conditions assuring early setting and rapid gain of tuber yield and its marketing when the price is highest. The application <b>of</b> <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene</b> covers accelerates plant emergence by 28 days and the growth and development of plants in the later period, and results in an earlier new potato harvest by up to 2 - 3 weeks. It also increases the tuber yield and reduces the yield variability in all years. Accelerating plant growth using non-woven polypropylene covers affects not only tuber yield quantity, but also contributes to improvement of the tuber quality, especially {{by an increase in}} dry matter, potassium and phosphorus content of tubers and decrease nitrate concentration. Such a method of potato production requires higher incurred input. Increasing the production inputs is effective when the value of the tuber yield increase obtained as a result of plant covering is higher than the costs incurred. A higher productive effect of covering is usually obtained in years with a cold spring and a very early potato harvest date. A considerable tuber yield increase in cultivation under non-woven polypropylene cover results in decreased unit costs and, consequently, the cost-effectiveness of production is higher than without covering. In conditions favouring rapid potato growth, the production costs of 1 kg tuber under cover are higher, which makes production less profitable than cultivation without plant covering...|$|R
50|$|The HydroSack and the HydroSnake {{are made}} up of an outer fabric {{consisting}} <b>of</b> <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene</b> with a hydrophilic finish. The internal pads are composed of pads containing wood pulp and a superabsorbent polymer (SAP). In this form, the HydroSack or HydroSnake weighs 0.5 kg. The HydroSack measures 60 by 48 cm and the HydroSnake measures 20 by 120 cm. When a HydroSack or a HydroSnake comes into contact with water, the SAP crystallizes and absorbs the water. HydroSacks take approximately 2-3 minutes to reach full capacity. The HydroSack and the HydroSnake are very absorbent. Full capacity is between 15 - 20 L of water. It retains this weight for up to six months. HydroSacks can be stacked together to form a strong ballast. It is used as a form of flood control and can be used to minimize the damage that flooding can cause. The HydroSack has a three-section structure with handles. When a HydroSack is no longer needed, the insides can be emptied into the earth after use, without any harmful effects.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{constitutive}} model for predicting the impact rates response <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene.</b> Impact rates, as used here, refer to strain rates greater than 1000 1 /s. The {{model is a}} physically based, three-dimensional constitutive model which incorporates {{the contributions of the}} amorphous, crystalline, pseudo-amorphous and entanglement networks to the constitutive response <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene.</b> The model mathematics is based on the well-known Glass-Rubber model originally developed for glassy polymers but the arguments have herein been extended to semi-crystalline polymers. In order to predict the impact rates behaviour <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene,</b> the model exploits the well-known framework of multiple processes yielding of polymers. This work argues that two dominant viscoelastic relaxation processes – the alpha- and beta-processes – can be associated with the yield responses <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene</b> observed at low-rate-dominant and impact-rates dominant loading regimes. Compression test data on polypropylene have been used to validate the model. The study has found that the model predicts quite well the experimentally observed nonlinear rate-dependent impact response <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene...</b>|$|R
