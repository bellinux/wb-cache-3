We {{completed}} a serological survey of hantavirus infection in rural inhabitants of Turvo County, {{in the southern}} State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, in which seropositivity for hantavirus was correlated to previous disease in the participants.

40|$|An {{epidemiologic}} and seroprevalence {{survey was}} conducted (n= 830) to assess the proportion of persons exposed to hantavirus in IX Region Chile, which accounts for 25 % of reported cases of hantavirus <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This region has three geographic areas with different disease incidences and {{a high proportion of}} aboriginals. Serum samples were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against Sin Nombre virus N antigen by strip immunoblot assay against Sin Nombre, Puumala, Río Mamoré, and Seoul N antigens. Samples from six patients were positive for IgG antibodies reactive with Andes virus; all patients lived in the Andes Mountains. Foresting was also associated with seropositivity; but not sex, age, race, rodent exposure, or farming activities. Exposure to hantavirus varies in different communities of IX Region. Absence of history of pneumonia or hospital admission in persons with specific IgG antibodies suggests that infection is clinically inapparent. Hantaviruses, RNA-containing viruses, compose a genus within the family Bunyaviridae. The natural reservoirs of the pathogenic New World hantaviruses are rodents of the family Muridae, subfamily Sigmodontinae, in which a chronic and asymptomatic infection develops (1). Hantavirus is a zoonosis transmitted from rodents to humans by inhaling contaminated aerosols from feces, urine, and saliva of infected mice (2). Human infection with hantaviruses have been associated with two diseases. One is the hemorrhagic fever with a renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Hantaan, Puumala, Seoul, and Dobrava/Belgrade viruses, first recognized during the Korean War in 1950 to 1953. HFRS occurs mainly in Asia and Europe; death rates range from 0. 1 % to 15 % (3, 4). The other disease, a severe respiratory illness known as hantavirus <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HCPS), occurs in the Americas and has a death rate of 40 % (1, 5 – 7).

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purposes}} of this study are to evaluate the outcome of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in a subgroup of patients with Hantavirus <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>syndrome</b> who had a predicted mortality of 100 % and to assess the complications associated with this treatment modality and with different cannulation techniques. MethodsThirty-eight patients with severe Hantavirus <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>syndrome</b> were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between April 1994 and June 2006. Cannulation of the femoral vessels was performed on an emergency basis by a percutaneous approach in 15 (39. 5 %) and by an open technique in 23 (60. 5 %) patients. Duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation averaged 132 hours (range: 5 – 276 hours). ResultsComplications from percutaneous cannulation occurred in 4 (26. 6 %) of 15 patients: retroperitoneal hematoma in 2 (13. 3 %) and lower extremity ischemia in 2 (13. 3 %) patients, which resolved after insertion of a distal perfusion cannula. Complications from open femoral cannulation occurred in 8 (34. 8 %) of 23 patients: severe bleeding in 7 (30. 4 %) patients and lower extremity ischemia in 1 (4. 3 %) patient who required a leg amputation. The overall survival was 60. 5 % (23 / 38 patients). Six (40 %) of the 15 patients cannulated percutaneously and 9 (39. 1 %) of 23 patients who had open cannulation died. All survivors recovered completely and were discharged from the hospital after a mean hospital stay of 20. 8 days (range: 10 – 39 days). ConclusionsAlmost two thirds of the patients with severe Hantavirus <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>syndrome</b> who were supported with extracorporeal circulation survived and recovered completely. The complications associated with both types of femoral cannulation may be attributed to the fact that all patients were in shock or in full cardiac arrest, and the procedure had to be done expeditiously.

40|$|Hantavirus <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>syndrome</b> is an {{emerging}} zoonosis in Brazil. Human infections occur via inhalation of aerosolized viral particles from excreta of infected wild rodents. Necromys lasiurus and Oligoryzomys nigripes {{appear to be}} the main reservoirs of hantavirus in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes. We estimated and compared ecological niches of the two rodent species, and analyzed environmental factors influencing their occurrence, to understand the geography of hantavirus transmission. N. lasiurus showed a wide potential distribution in Brazil, in the Cerrado, Caatinga, and Atlantic Forest biomes. Highest climate suitability for O. nigripes was observed along the Brazilian Atlantic coast. Maximum temperature in the warmest months and annual precipitation were the variables that most influence the distributions of N. lasiurus and O. nigripes, respectively. Models based on occurrences of infected rodents estimated a broader area of risk for hantavirus transmission in southeastern and southern Brazil, coinciding with the distribution of human cases of hantavirus <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>syndrome.</b> We found no demonstrable environmental differences among occurrence sites for the rodents and for human cases of hantavirus. However, areas of northern and northeastern Brazil are also apparently suitable for the two species, without broad coincidence with human cases.

40|$|Hantaviruses cause 2 {{zoonotic}} diseases, {{hemorrhagic fever}} with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Infection is usually initiated after inhalation of virus-contaminated rodent excreta. In {{addition to the}} zoonotic infection route, growing evidence suggests personto-person transmission of Andes virus. For this reason, we studied whether saliva from HFRS patients contained hantavirus. During an outbreak in northern Sweden of nephropathia epidemica (NE), a milder form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, we collected saliva and plasma from 14 hospitalized NE patients with verified Puumala virus (PUUV) infection. PUUV RNA was detected in saliva from 10 patients (range 1, 530 – 121, 323 PUUV RNA copies/mL) by quantitative reverse transcription–PCR. The PUUV S-segment sequences from saliva and plasma of the same patients were identical. Our data show that hantavirus RNA could be detected in human saliva several days after onset of disease symptoms and raise the question whether interhuman transmission of hantavirus may occur through saliva. Members of the family Bunyaviridae cause severe and often fatal human diseases in a large and increasing number of persons worldwide each year (1). This family contains 5 genera, and the genus Hantavirus causes 2 febrile illnesses: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia and hantavirus <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HCPS) in North and South America. Hantaviruses are rodent-borne pathogens. In Sweden, Finland, Norway, Russia, and parts of central Europe, Puumala virus (PUUV) is endemic in bank voles (Myodes glareolus).

Three strains from O. nigripes were identified by the sequencing of the complete S segment and compared to previous studies of JUQV available in GenBank.

Two HCPS survivors initially given drotrecogin alpha (activated) (DAA) for presumed bacterial septic shock are described. Vasoactive medications were required for a maximum of 52 h, whereas creatinine levels and platelet counts normalized within seven to nine days. Given the similar presentations of HCPS and bacterial septic shock, empirical DAA therapy will likely be initiated before a definitive diagnosis of HCPS is made.

40|$|Hantaviruses are {{distributed}} worldwide {{and can cause}} a hemorrhagic fever or a <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>syndrome</b> in humans. Mature virions consist of RNA genome, nucleocapsid protein, RNA polymerase, and two transmembrane glycoproteins, G 1 and G 2.

Here we show by NMR, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and mutagenesis that a highly conserved cysteine/histidine-rich region in the G 1 tail of hantaviruses forms two CCHC-type classical zinc fingers. Unlike classical zinc fingers, however, the two G 1 zinc fingers are intimately joined together, forming a compact domain with a unique fold.
