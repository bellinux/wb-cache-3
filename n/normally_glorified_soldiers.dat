2500|$|Post World War II, {{there was}} a high demand for Buddhist priests who <b>glorified</b> fallen <b>soldiers,</b> and gave {{funerals}} and posthumous names, causing a strong revival.

5000|$|Chen {{graduated}} from the High School for Art in Shanghai in 1964, then {{graduated from}} the Shanghai Training School of Art (also called the Shanghai College of Art) in 1965 and soon after began focusing almost exclusively on oil painting. Within a year, as the Cultural Revolution gained steam, Chen {{caught the attention of}} Communist officials for his propaganda works that frequently <b>glorified</b> <b>soldiers</b> of the Communist party and portrayed grand images of Mao Zedong. Chen was soon viewed as [...] "one of the leading artists at the state-financed Shanghai Institute of Painting." [...] Chen was fortunate to gain notoriety early in his career. As the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, Chen continued doing oil paintings, now shifting his focus to a more romantic and European style. Many admire that Chen was [...] "one of the first artists {{to bridge the gap between}} the art of the Cultural Revolution and Western contemporary art".|$|R
40|$|Few {{directors}} are so {{closely associated with}} the genre of the artist biopic as Ken Russell who made several films dedicated to composers, dancers and writers. Only three of these, however, have visual artists as their protagonists: Always on Sunday (1965), Dante's Inferno (1967) and Savage Messiah (1972), dealing with Henri 'Le Douanier' Rousseau, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska respectively. There has also been relatively little critical commentary on these films compared with the discussion devoted to Russell's films dealing with the lives of composers. This article attempts to remedy this situation by considering the ways in which Russell tackles some of the thematic and formal challenges inherent to the genre of the artist biopic, such as the representation of the artist's personality, the visualisation of the process of artistic creation, and the relation between the style of the film and that of the artist portrayed. We will argue that, to a large extent, Russell's protagonists in these films conform to the romantic stereotype of the tormented and alienated artist. However, and perhaps contrary to what one would associate with the director, we will demonstrate that Russell's biopics also demystify this cult of artistic genius by focusing on the mundane or laborious activities involved in the process of artistic creation, which is at odds with genre conventions that <b>normally</b> <b>glorify</b> this process...|$|R
50|$|The stories contain certain {{characteristic}} motifs; {{to mention}} a few - courage, cowardice, patriotism, dying {{for the sake of}} one's country, noble actions, and making a cup of refreshing tea while in the face of danger, enmity turning into friendship when the going gets tough, and so on. Apart from portraying these universal qualities, Commando Comics also show soldiers in national stereotypes, <b>glorifying</b> Allied <b>soldiers,</b> but showing soldiers as a mixture of good and evil. There was usually no continuity between books; each book was a complete story with start and finish, though recently series (2 or 3 stories) of books following the same character have been published.|$|R
5000|$|Film {{commentator}} Emanuel Levy {{noted in}} his review that Wayne was not attempting to promote {{the cause of the}} Vietnam War as much as he was trying to portray the Special Forces in their unique role in the military: [...] "Wayne said his motive was to <b>glorify</b> American <b>soldiers</b> as the finest fighting men 'without going into why we are there, or if they should be there.' His 'compulsion' to do the movie was based on his pride of the Special Forces, determined to show 'what a magnificent job this still little-known branch of service is doing.' ... 'I wasn't trying to send a message out to anybody,' he reasoned, 'or debating whether it is right or wrong for the United States to be in this war.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|On The Nameless Height (На безымянной высоте, Na bezymyannoy vysote), {{also known}} as Nearby an Unfamilial Settlement (У незнакомого посёлка, U neznakomogo posyolka) is a Soviet World War II song. The text was written by Mikhail Matusovskiy in 1963, with music by Veniamin Basner, {{and is one of}} the themes of the war-based movie [...] "Silence" [...] (Тишина, Tishina), {{released}} in 1964. The song is based on true historical events and <b>glorifies</b> three lucky <b>soldiers,</b> surviving out of an eighteen-soldier infantry squad. The height concerned the one located near the Rubezhenka settlement in the Kuybyshevsky District, Kaluga Oblast while the soldiers, mentioned in song, were a part of Soviet 139th infantry division.|$|R
5000|$|Peters {{expressed}} {{sympathy for}} POW Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl's family, but speculated (Fox News, July 19, 2009) that Bergdahl might be [...] "an apparent deserter ... if {{he walked away}} from his post and his buddies in wartime - I don't care how hard it sounds - as far as I'm concerned the Taliban can save us a lot of legal hassles and legal bills." [...] He characterized Bergdahl's description (in the Taliban produced video) of U.S. military behavior in Afghanistan as collaboration with the enemy, even if coerced. Peters hoped Bergdahl would be reunited with his family, but argued that the US media had <b>glorified</b> one captured <b>soldier</b> who Peters claimed had shamed his unit and lied, while ignoring genuine heroes and casualties (The O'Reilly Factor, July 21).|$|R
5000|$|While How to Read Donald Duck {{criticized the}} gender roles and depictions {{of women in}} Disney comics, Mooney argues that the new icons of the revolutionary culture also tended to either depict women as passive and {{domestic}} or to completely ignore them. The song [...] "Venceremos" [...] ("We Will Triumph", 1970), for example, explicitly <b>glorifies</b> male peasants, <b>soldiers,</b> and miners. Women are only mentioned in a brief afterthought. The counter-comics produced to challenge the [...] "foreign" [...] Disney Ducks and their supposed imperialist ambitions, were no better in their depictions of gender roles. They featured gendered images of strong, masculine heroes and weak, dependent women. La Firme, in particular, often featured female characters who were unable to perceive the [...] "proper revolutionary path" [...] and were contrasted to male revolutionaries. About 40 issues of La Firme were used to examine specific topics involving exploitation. Tellingly, none of them addressed the topic of exploitation of women.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} a partial {{exploration}} of the relevance and usefulness of &dquo;models&dquo; for rural development in China. Dating {{back to the days}} of the Border Regions and guerrilla bases of the 1930 s, the Chinese Communist Party has publicized the ad-vanced (xianjin) and the model (mofan) units, rewarding them symbolically and materially, and holding them up for study and emulation. Sometimes these designations are awarded to indi-viduals, sometimes to entire work units, that is, factories and industrial enterprises, agricultural teams (shengchanduz), brigades (da dui), or entire communes. There have been widespread long-term national campaigns centered on models: for example, the Lei Feng campaigns that have surfaced periodically over the past three decades, <b>glorifying</b> an ordinary <b>soldier</b> who embodies the virtues of hard work, thrift, consideration for others, dedication to the Party and the Motherland, and self-sacrifice. Or there was the two-decade-long campaign to &dquo;learn from Dazhai,&dquo; singling out a poor mountain village that reportedly followed the path of self-reliance.

5000|$|Historians {{have said}} that the [...] "Lost Cause" [...] theme helped white Southerners adjust to their new status and move forward into what was called [...] "the New South." [...] Hillyer states that the Confederate Memorial Literary Society (CMLS), founded by elite white women in Richmond, Virginia, in the 1890s, exemplifies this solution. The CMLS founded the Confederate Museum to {{document}} and defend the Confederate cause and to recall the antebellum mores that the new South's business ethos was thought to be displacing. By focusing on military sacrifice, rather than grievances regarding the North, the Confederate Museum aided the process of sectional reconciliation, according to Hillyer. By depicting slavery as benevolent, the museum's exhibits reinforced the notion that Jim Crow laws were a proper solution to racial tensions that had escalated during Reconstruction. Lastly, by <b>glorifying</b> the common <b>soldier</b> and portraying the South as [...] "solid," [...] the museum promoted acceptance of industrial capitalism. Thus, the Confederate Museum both critiqued and eased the economic transformations of the New South, and enabled Richmond to reconcile its memory of the past with its hopes for the future, leaving the past behind as it developed new industrial and financial roles.|$|R
