Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E

Although the character died {{at the end of}} Avatar, Cameron confirmed in 2010 that Lang would return in the first three sequels, stating [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga". He later stated that Quaritch would act as main antagonist once again, in all four sequels.|$|E

500|$|Rumors persisted that Clark {{was forced}} out due to his {{contentious}} relationship with some in Washington, D.C.; however, he has dismissed such rumors, calling it a [...] "routine personnel action". The Department of Defense said it was merely a [...] "general rotation of American senior ranks". However, a NATO ambassador told the International Herald Tribune that Clark's dismissal {{seemed to be a}} [...] "political thing from the United States". General Hugh Shelton would say of Clark during his 2004 campaign that [...] "the reason he came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether I'm a Republican or a Democrat. I'll just say Wes won't get my vote." [...] Shelton never elaborated further on what these issues were.|$|E
500|$|Howard was {{selected}} by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round of the 1998 NFL Draft, {{but he had a}} difficult pre-season with the Broncos in 1998, fumbling five times in two games. [...] The Broncos released him from their practice squad in September 1998, and he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars. [...] At the time, Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said: [...] "Chris Howard is a young man and he certainly still is developmental. [...] A couple weeks into our system and I think he'll be a guy who can be counted on. But I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we're done with our evaluations just yet." [...] Coughlin said of Howard's fumbles with Denver: [...] "It was carelessness. [...] Basically, we'll start from scratch with him fundamentally here." [...] Howard had professional totals of 123yards rushing on 41carries and 37yards receiving on five receptions. [...] In 2000, his final year, he fumbled twice on only 21carries in the first two games. [...] These were his final two career NFL games.|$|E
500|$|In the 1500m final race, {{with one}} lap {{remaining}} and currently in second place, Ohno {{attempted to make}} a pass on the leader Kim Dong-Sung, who then drifted to the inside and as a result, Ohno raised his arms to signal he was blocked. Kim finished first ahead of Ohno but was disqualified for impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. Fourth-place finisher of the race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the disqualification decision saying it was [...] "absurd that the Korean was disqualified". China's Jiajun Li, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: [...] "I respect {{the decision of the}} referee, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> any more". Steven Bradbury, the 1000m gold-medal winner, also shared his views: [...] "Whether Dong-Sung moved across enough to be called for cross-tracking, I don't know, he obviously moved across a bit. It's the judge's interpretation. A lot of people will say it was right {{and a lot of people}} will say it's wrong. I've seen moves like that before that were not called. But I've seen them called too".|$|E

500|$|The {{plotters}} unilaterally named Brigadier General Lê Văn Kim, {{the head}} of the Vietnamese National Military Academy, the nation's premier officer training school in Da Lat, would be their new prime minister. Kim was not a Can Lao member and was later put under house arrest after Diệm regained control. According to Kim's brother-in-law, Major General Trần Văn Đôn, Kim was willing to accept the post but was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything unless the coup succeeded. The rebels also suggested that Diệm appoint General Lê Văn Tỵ, the chief of the armed forces, be made defence minister. Diệm asked Ty, who had been put under house arrest by the plotters, if he was willing, but the officer was not. During the afternoon of November 11, the rebels used Ty as an intermediary to pass on their demands to the president. A broadcast was made over Saigon Radio, during which Ty said he had consulted with Diệm and obtained his agreement for the [...] "dissolution of the present government" [...] and that [...] "with agreement of the Revolutionary Council" [...] had given the officers the task of constituting [...] "a provisional military government".|$|E
500|$|Playing {{opposite}} Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell, {{who starred}} again {{with him a}} few months later in Marie Baumer's new play Penny Arcade. While the critics panned Penny Arcade, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic [...] "bad" [...] guy was a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of Sinners' Holiday, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: [...] "There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother's breast... was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?' I refused to say it. Adolfi said 'I'm going to tell Zanuck.' I said 'I don't give a shit what you tell him, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that line.'" [...] They took the line out.|$|E

There are laws against that in this country. But I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I mourn for it either." [...] The next day, after an {{anonymous}} caller claimed responsibility {{on behalf of the}} JDL, the group's spokesman later denied his group's involvement, but said, [...] "we support the act." [...] JDL members had often been suspected of involvement in attacks against neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and antisemites.|$|E
5000|$|The Wall Street Journal {{editorial}} page editor Paul Gigot argued in February 2016 that Iran's prohibited missile tests, capture of U.S. naval personnel, and other provocations were a sign that rapprochement hoped for by Iran's Western negotiating partners was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen, <b>saying</b> the government {{had no interest in}} accommodating U.S. interests, seeking instead to humiliate the United States and spread propaganda. Gigot noted Iran's desire to be the dominant power in the Mideast and would work to promote instability there while using the nuclear agreement as a [...] "shield" [...] to protect from criticism of its [...] "imperialist" [...] behavior.|$|R

2500|$|Herodotus will {{at times}} relate various {{accounts}} of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io. However, Herodotus will at time arbitrate between varying accounts: [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that these events happened {{one way or the}} other. Rather, I will point out the man who I know for a fact began the wrong-doing against the Greeks."

40|$|I am <b>not</b> really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} new, {{certainly not}} to the experts in the audience. Rather, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try to persuade you that a certain point of view concerning interpolation might, at times, be very convenient. With that view in hand, I then consider Hermite interpolation, as a limit of Lagrange interpolation. The particular point of view has its origin in elementary linear algebra, in {{the answer to the}} question: what is the inverse of a basis? leading to interpolation and convenient representation of interpolants, then to the limit of an interpolation process as the interpolation functionals approach a certain limit, and thence to Hermite interpolation. I start off this elementary talk with something truly basic, namely the notion of a basis of a vector space. Here is the definition of a basis, as no doubt you all have learned it, possibly already many years ago, and as it can be found in most current linear algebra textbooks. Here is a sample: Definition (Strang’ 76). A basis for a vector space is a set of vectors having two properties as once: (1) It is linearly independent. (2) It spans the space...|$|R

5000|$|Governor Kasich did {{not enter}} the {{convention}} hall or speak at the convention, despite overtures from Trump allies Priebus and Newt Gingrich - who, along with Chris Christie, lost the running mate job to Pence - and top Trump campaign advisor Paul Manafort.

As the convention began, the Trump campaign lashed out at Kasich for his failure to endorse, prompting an exchange that The New York Times called [...] "remarkably bitter" [...] and [...] "the latest extraordinary turn in a campaign that has veered sharply away from political precedent." [...] Manafort called Kasich [...] "petulant" [...] and accused him of [...] "embarrassing his party," [...] prompting Kasich chief political aide John Weaver to mock Trump and criticize Manafort for his work on behalf of foreign [...] "thugs and autocrats" [...] abroad.|$|R

Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> specifically <b>say</b> if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry."
