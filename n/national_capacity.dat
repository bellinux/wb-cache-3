25|$|Many port mills {{throughout}} the country sustained severe damage from bombing in the Second World War; almost 75 per cent of the <b>national</b> <b>capacity</b> was concentrated at the ports, which made them primary targets for air attacks. In London, Spillers' Millennium Mills as well as Rank's Premier Mills were substantially destroyed. Between 1945 and 1950 the ports underwent large-scale post-war reconstruction despite a deficit of raw materials and strict licensing. At this time Millennium Mills was rebuilt, including a windowless steel-framed infill on the west side, and was in operation by September 1953.|$|E
25|$|IU School of Medicine is {{a leader}} in the research, diagnosis, {{treatment}} and rehabilitation of traumatic brain injury and mild traumatic brain injury, known also as concussion. In 2012, federal officials designated IU School of Medicine and the Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana as a Traumatic Brain Injury Model System site, marking the partnership center as a national leader in TBI-related care and research. As only one of 16 such sites in the United States, the center received a five-year, $2 million grant to add researchers and physicians to the initiative of studying and treating traumatic brain injury {{and its impact on the}} lives of patients and their families. The center offers the highest level of comprehensive and multidisciplinary rehabilitation care and adds to <b>national</b> <b>capacity</b> for high-quality treatment and research for people with TBI. IU School of Medicine is also a leading member of the NCAA and U.S. Department of Defense CARE Consortium, a $30 million initiative to study concussions among student athletes and use that knowledge to improve safety and health of athletes, military service members and the general public. CARE Consortium research includes exploration post-concussive symptoms, performance and psychological health of student athletes and the analysis of data related to biomechanical, clinical, neuroimaging, neurobiological and genetic markers of injury. This work represents the largest and most comprehensive concussion study to date.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} issues {{identified}} in the review of civilian capacities {{is the need to}} be able to better identify and support <b>national</b> <b>capacities.</b> As the review states: “The United Nations has seen success in humanitarian operations and peacekeeping, built on a strong partnership with Member States. But the international community has had less success in supporting and enabling the <b>national</b> <b>capacities</b> that are essential for an enduring peace.”19 Civil affairs components have a key role to play in identifying and supporting <b>national</b> <b>capacities,</b> within civil society and local government, including through helping to ensure that voices from the local level are heard in nationally led peacebuilding processes.|$|R

2500|$|Morocco {{is a major}} touristic destination. Tourism is thus a major {{contributor}} to both the economic output and the current account balance, as well as a main job provider. In 2008 8 million tourists have visited the kingdom. Tourist receipts in 2007 totalled US$7,55 billion. Morocco has developed an ambitious strategy, dubbed [...] "Vision 2010", aimed at attracting 10 million tourists by 2010. This strategy provides for creating 160,000 beds, thus bringing the <b>national</b> <b>capacity</b> to 230,000 beds. It also aims to create some 600,000 new jobs.|$|E

Her continuing aim has been to preserve and strengthen the U.S. <b>national</b> <b>capacity</b> for innovation by increasing support for basic research in science and engineering. This is done in part by attracting talent from abroad and by expanding the domestic talent pool by attracting women and members of under-represented groups into careers in science.

6000|$|In America it is {{said that}} the public {{services}} are inferior in personal quality to the staffs of the great private business organizations. My own impression is that, considering the salaries paid, they are, so far as Federal concerns go, immeasurably superior. In State and municipal affairs, American conditions offer no satisfactory criterion; the Americans are, for reasons I have discussed elsewhere,[8] a [...] "State-blind" [...] people concentrated upon private getting; they have been negligent of public concerns, and the public appointments have been left to the peculiarly ruffianly type of politician their unfortunate Constitution and their individualist traditions have evolved. In England, too, public servants are systematically undersalaried, so that the big businesses have merely to pay reasonably well to secure the pick of the <b>national</b> <b>capacity.</b> Moreover, it must be remembered by the reader that the public services do not advertise, and that the private businesses do; so that while there is the fullest ventilation of any defects in our military or naval organization, there is a very considerable check upon the discussion of individualist incapacity. An editor will rush into print with the flimsiest imputations upon the breech of a new field-gun or the housing of the militia at Aldershot, but he thinks twice before he proclaims that the preserved fruits that pay his proprietor a tribute of some hundreds a year are an unwholesome embalmment of decay. On the whole it is probable that in spite of scandalously bad pay and of the embarrassment of party considerations, the British Navy, Post Office, and Civil Service generally, and the educational work and much of the transit and building work of the London County Council and of many of the greater English and Scotch municipalities, are as well managed as any private businesses in the world.|$|E
