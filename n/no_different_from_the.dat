5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we cannot speak about God, and {{proposed}} that this view is <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In {{assisted}} reproductive technology, sperm washing is {{not necessary}} for males with hepatitis B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with hepatitis B, the risk of transmission from mother to child with IVF is <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> risk in spontaneous conception.|$|E
5|$|In Brood War, the Dominion is {{invaded by}} the United Earth Directorate and Mengsk {{narrowly}} escapes capture with the reluctant help of Raynor. Faced with execution {{and the destruction}} of the Dominion as alternatives, Mengsk allies with Kerrigan and Raynor to defeat the UED, but Kerrigan eventually betrays their alliance and delivers a crippling blow to Mengsk's forces. Nevertheless, Mengsk rebuilds and the Dominion remains the dominant Terran power. In Frontline, many of the stories in the anthology paint Mengsk and the Dominion overall as tyrannical and corrupt, <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy.|$|E

50|$|As {{they did}} in the Philippine provinces of Northern Luzon and Mindanao, they quickly gained {{importance}} in the areas where they settled. Thus, the state of Hawaii became <b>no</b> less <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Philippines in terms of percentage of Ilocano speakers.|$|R
25|$|The {{notion of}} the {{criminal}} as 'Everyman', morally <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience, was then totally abandoned; the reader could comfort himself {{with the knowledge that}} he at least, unlike the criminal, was saved.|$|E
25|$|In Theravadin Buddhism, Buddhas {{are born}} as unenlightened humans, {{and are not}} rulers of any paradise or pure land. Maitreya's arising would be <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> arising of Gautama Buddha, as he {{achieved}} full enlightenment {{as a human being}} and died, entering parinibbana.|$|E
25|$|Some early {{schools of}} thought, such as Pancaratra in particular, refer to Vasudeva-Krishna (Krishna, {{the son of}} Vasudeva) {{as the source of}} all incarnations and as <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{ultimate}} and absolute reality, and as non-distinct from Vasudeva and any other manifestations of the supreme self.|$|E
50|$|According to Mamphela Ramphele {{one of the}} {{rallying}} {{cries of}} the freedom struggle was the protest against police brutality, against deaths in detention. More people are dying now in police custody than ever before. We have brutality <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> during <b>the</b> Apartheid era.|$|R
5000|$|To {{punish the}} people causes but little harm to a country, whereas {{to punish the}} king could cause great damage.... Furthermore, the common people of a kingdom often commit crimes, and the Lord uses the king as a scourge in {{punishing}} the offenders. Thus, to kill <b>the</b> king is <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> killing <b>the</b> Lord Himself.|$|R

"I will convey your Majesty's answer," [...] {{said the}} ambassador, [...] "to my most gracious master; yet, let me say, that, {{as it is}} in <b>no</b> degree <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> evasive replies which have already been {{returned}} to his just complaints, I cannot hope that it will afford the means of re-establishing peace and friendship betwixt France and Burgundy." ...|$|R
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, government, academics and the media began to revise the country's militant past, and particularly the Easter Rising. The coalition government of 1973–77, in particular the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Conor Cruise O'Brien, began to promote the view that the violence of 1916 was essentially <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> violence then taking place in the streets of Belfast and Derry.|$|E
25|$|In {{males with}} {{hepatitis}} B, The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine advises that sperm washing {{is not necessary}} in IVF to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with hepatitis B, the risk of vertical transmission during IVF is <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> risk in spontaneous conception. However, {{there is not enough}} evidence to say that ICSI procedures are safe in females with hepatitis B in regard to vertical transmission to the offspring.|$|E
25|$|In {{its basic}} operations, the Israel Lobby is <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> farm lobby, steel or textile workers’ unions, or other ethnic lobbies. There is nothing {{improper}} about American Jews and their Christian allies attempting to sway US policy: the Lobby’s activities {{are not a}} conspiracy of the sort depicted in tracts like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. For the most part, the individuals and groups that comprise it are only doing what other special interest groups do, but doing it very much better. By contrast, pro-Arab interest groups, {{in so far as}} they exist at all, are weak, which makes the Israel Lobby’s task even easier.|$|E
500|$|The CBO cost {{estimates}} were criticized because they excluded {{the effects of}} potential legislation that would increase Medicare payments by more than $200billion from 2010 to 2019. However, the so-called [...] "doc fix" [...] is a separate issue that would have existed whether or not ACA became law - omitting its cost <b>from</b> ACA was <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> omitting <b>the</b> cost of other tax cuts.|$|R

25|$|From the 1870s {{into the}} early 20th century, evangelicals came to feel {{increasingly}} marginalized as ritualism became more common place within the Church of England. As Evangelicalism continued to lose ground to the high-church party, a split became apparent between conservative evangelicals and liberal evangelicals. Liberal evangelicals led by Vernon Storr coalesced into the Anglican Evangelical Group Movement. Their position was outlined in the 1923 collection of essays Liberal Evangelicalism, which argued that Evangelicalism had been discredited and needed {{to move away from}} strict notions of penal substitutionary atonement and scriptural infallibility. Conservatives accused liberal evangelicals of being <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> older broad church liberals that evangelicals had always opposed.|$|E
25|$|For Agha Mohammad Khan, the re-subjugation and {{reintegration}} of Georgia {{into the}} Iranian Empire {{was part of}} the same process that had brought Shiraz, Esfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. He viewed Georgia, like the Safavids and Nader Shah before him, <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> provinces in mainland Iran, such as Khorasan. As the Cambridge History of Iran states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted {{in the same way as}} one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever necessary means in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah's death and the collapse of the Zands, including putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason on the part of the vali of Georgia.|$|E
25|$|In May 1989, {{one week}} before the initial {{delivery}} to the 747-400's first European customer, KLM, the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) shocked Boeing by refusing to grant regulatory certification for the aircraft, citing the upper deck cabin floor's resistance to collapse {{in the event of}} a sudden decompression. While the manufacturer asserted that the 747-400's cabin floor was <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> already-certified and in-service 747-300, the JAA maintained that the newer model would have a service life into 2020 and beyond and was thus subject to a newer, more stringent standard which had been updated to reflect the risk of explosive devices. In the days leading up to the first delivery to KLM, negotiations between Boeing, the FAA, and the JAA resulted in a compromise: a temporary operating certificate would be issued for the 747-400, provided that the manufacturer develop a structural retrofit for the aircraft within two years. The last-minute deal allowed KLM and Lufthansa to take delivery of their 747-400s without further delays.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} infusing 5 mg/h of verapamil on calcitonin release in normal males. After 60 minutes of infusion, ionized calcium and calcitonin levels were unchanged. At 60 minutes we infused 3 mg/kg of body weight of elemental calcium over 10 minutes {{and we found that}} calcitonin release was <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> when <b>the</b> subjects were receiving verapamil. These results suggest that, despite blocking calcium channels, acute hypercalcaemia produces normal calcitonin release...|$|R

500|$|... parses and executes {{successfully}} in some environments (e.g. SQLite or PostgreSQL) which unify a NULL boolean with Unknown but fails to parse in others (e.g. in SQL Server Compact). MySQL behaves similarly to PostgreSQL {{in this regard}} (with the minor exception that MySQL regards TRUE and FALSE as <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ordinary integers 1 and 0). PostgreSQL additionally implements a IS UNKNOWN predicate, {{which can be used}} to test whether a three-value logical outcome is Unknown, although this is merely syntactic sugar.|$|E
500|$|During the Nuremberg Trials, Waffen-SS personnel, such as Hausser in his {{testimony}} as a defence witness, contended {{that it was a}} purely military organisation <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wehrmacht. The prosecution at Nuremberg rejected that claim and successfully argued that the Waffen-SS {{was an integral part of}} the SS apparatus. The Tribunal found that [...] "the units of the Waffen-SS were directly involved in the killings of the prisoners of war and the atrocities in the occupied countries" [...] and judged the entire SS to be a criminal organisation.|$|E
500|$|Carl Meissner placed B.caleyi {{in series}} Quercinae in his 1856 {{arrangement}} of the genus on account of its strongly dentate, cuneate to obovate leaves. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous. Meissner also described B.caleyi variety sinuosa from material collected by James Drummond, which was reviewed by Alex George and found to be <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other collections of B.caleyi. Drummond also collected material identified as B.caleyi that was named as a distinct species—Banksia aculeata—in 1981. No subspecies of [...] B.caleyi itself are recognised.|$|E

5000|$|In {{terms of}} Christology, the Oriental Orthodox (Non-Chalcedonians) {{understanding}} is that Christ is [...] "One Nature—the Logos Incarnate," [...] of the full humanity and full divinity. The Chalcedonians {{understanding is that}} Christ is [...] recognized in two natures, full humanity and full divinity. Oriental Orthodoxy contends that such a formulation is <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> what <b>the</b> Nestorians teach.

500|$|About the {{creative}} process behind the writing, Harmon says {{that he had to}} write the show {{as if it were a}} movie, not a sitcom. Essentially, he says, the process was <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> earlier work he had done, except for the length and the target demographic. Filming the show involved a lot of improvisation, particularly from Chevy Chase. Harmon said about Chase that he [...] "tends to come up with lines that you can actually end scenes with sometimes." [...] He also mentioned Joel McHale and Donald Glover, the actor who portrays Troy, as adept improvisers.|$|E
500|$|Alito {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{commissions}} were appointed, set up, and established pursuant to {{an order of}} the President, just like the commission in Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.

[...] Alito disagreed with Kennedy's assertion that [...] "an acceptable degree of independence from the Executive is necessary to render a commission 'regularly constituted' {{by the standards of}} our Nation's system of justice", arguing that Kennedy [...] "offers no support for this proposition (which in any event seems to be more about fairness or integrity than regularity)", and further arguing that the commission in Quirin was <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> present case.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack single {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Missy Elliott, Lana Moorer, Marie Wright, Jonathan Burks, LaShaun Owens, Karriem Mack, Walter Murphy, and Gene Pistilli. Production was handled by Elliott. [...] "Fighting Tempation is an R-funk song with a fun vibe. The song samples Uncle Louie's 1979 song [...] "I Like Funky Music". Heather Phares of Allmusic wrote that the song's lyrics make {{reference}} to a [...] "celebration of ladies' night out and waiting for true love." [...] According to Dani Boobyer of the United Kingdom-based website, The Situation, [...] "Fighting Temptation" [...] has [...] "a well worn message about striving for the best and fighting against negativity." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine found that Missy notices pleasure and joy in sins that make people go to church on Sundays, but in reality, the [...] "party people" [...] are <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> churchgoers, who sin in their song and music. Lastly, the song's strong female presence is only less than the song's religious arrogance.|$|E
