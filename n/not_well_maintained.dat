5|$|Conwy Castle was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> {{during the}} early 14th century and by 1321 a survey {{reported}} it was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers. These problems persisted until Edward, the Black Prince, took {{over control of the}} castle in 1343. Sir John Weston, his chamberlain, conducted repairs, building new stone support arches for the great hall {{and other parts of the}} castle. After the death of the Black Prince, however, Conwy fell into neglect again.|$|E
25|$|Sobremonte gave a speech, {{directing}} able men to {{join the}} militias. Organization was lacking and not everybody was supplied with arms. Many muskets were supplied without proper shot or flints; swords and sabres were <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained.</b> His own officers accused him of the chaos and confusion, but did little to remedy the situation.|$|E
25|$|The two {{oldest and}} still active {{distribution}} projects started in 1993. The SLS distribution was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained,</b> so in July 1993 a new distribution, called Slackware {{and based on}} SLS, was released by Patrick Volkerding. Also dissatisfied with SLS, Ian Murdock set to create a free distribution by founding Debian, which had its first release in December 1993.|$|E

5000|$|Moti Mahal {{still exists}} and {{looks the same}} as before, {{although}} its appears to be <b>not</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>well.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has <b>not</b> been <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> {{in the decades}} since; one wing has become a hospital, another has been abandoned, and the courtyard is a rubbish dump. The poor state of the {{building has}} led to local activism {{trying to get it}} recognized and protected as a heritage landmark by the government.|$|R
25|$|The demand growth {{projections}} did not materialize, {{which left}} {{the country with a}} large excess capacity and ENEE with a heavy debt burden. As a result, the existing thermal power plants were <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained.</b> When demand eventually caught up and a severe drought occurred, many of the thermal plants were inoperational, leading to a severe energy crisis in 1993.|$|E
25|$|Totem poles are {{typically}} <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> after their installation and the potlatch celebration. The poles usually last from 60 to 80 years; {{only a few}} have stood longer than 75 years, and even fewer have reached 100 years of age. Once the wood rots so badly that the pole begins to lean and {{pose a threat to}} passersby, it is either destroyed or pushed over and removed. Older poles typically fall over during the winter storms that batter the coast. The owners of a collapsed pole may commission a new one to replace it.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{very likely}} that a new stadium would have been needed in any event, as the Met was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained.</b> By the park's final season, {{railings}} in the grandstand's third deck had become a major safety hazard. Additionally, players had begun to complain {{about the quality of the}} field; the infield in particular was considered the worst in the majors. Rumors abounded that the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, which by then had taken over the stadium from the city of Minneapolis, had deliberately let the Met go to seed in order to aid the push for the Metrodome.|$|E
5000|$|Too much {{construction}} {{causing the}} land to weaken.Government doesn’t support {{the people and their}} craft hence it has become very difficult for the artisans to earn their livelihood, therefore they don’t want their coming generations to learn this craft or come in this occupation.Temples are <b>not</b> so <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> by the authorities.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} {{historically}} notable buildings {{but they}} have generally <b>not</b> been <b>well</b> <b>maintained,</b> and the ravages of the climate hasten decay, together with several major fires, which consume the wooden structures. Preventive maintenance generally was not practised, so even the best preserved buildings date back only {{to the middle of}} the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Heading towards Wonthaggi, {{the trail}} passes through flat {{agricultural}} fields, and is <b>not</b> always <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> with grass {{being allowed to}} overgrow the path. The trail uses a few small bridges to cross the Powlett River and tributaries. The trail near Wonthaggi is packed gravel and features the heritage listed Wonthaggi station, and the historic Central Mine Reserve.|$|R
25|$|A {{very small}} portion of the roads in Isfana are covered with asphalt. The roads are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> and require major rehabilitation. Isfana is {{connected}} with other settlements in Kyrgyzstan through highways. The road that connects Isfana with Batken and Osh was not maintained after Kyrgyzstan became independent in the early 1990s. The country has received funding from the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Asian Development Bank to rehabilitate the road that connects Isfana with Batken and Osh. The distance from Isfana to the capital Bishkek is 960km and driving non-stop from Isfana to the capital takes about 20 hours.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Minnesota Vikings were unhappy with Metropolitan Stadium's {{relatively}} small capacity for football (just under 48,500). Before the AFL-NFL merger, the NFL had declared that stadiums with a capacity smaller than 50,000 were not adequate for their needs. The biggest stadium {{in the area}} was the University of Minnesota's Memorial Stadium, but the Vikings were not willing to be tenants in a college football stadium and demanded a new venue. Supporters of a dome also believed that the Minnesota Twins would benefit from a climate-controlled stadium to insulate the team from harsh Minnesota weather later in the season. The Met would have likely needed to be replaced in any event, as it was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained.</b> Broken railings and seats {{could be seen in}} the upper deck by the early 1970s, and by its final season they had become a distinct safety hazard.|$|E
2500|$|Although most of {{the prison}} has since been demolished, the {{cemetery}} still remains {{in what is now}} Glenbrook Ravine Park. After BC Penitentiary closed, the federal government ceded the cemetery to the City of New Westminster. Very few people know that the cemetery is there; it is unmarked, overgrown and <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained.</b> The cemetery is mentioned in the history section of [...] Glenbrook Ravine Park.|$|E
50|$|Other {{buildings}} are staff house quarters which {{are under the}} Ministry of Housing and also local government housing units. A majority are occupied but are <b>not</b> in a <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> state. There is need for the hospital management to plan for renovating them.|$|R
40|$|Local {{smoothing}} {{testing that}} is based on multivariate nonparametric regression estimation {{is one of the main}} model checking methodologies in the literature. However, relevant tests suffer from the typical curse of dimensionality resulting in slow convergence rates to their limits under the null hypotheses and less deviation from the null under alternatives. This problem leads tests to <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintain</b> the significance level and to be less sensitive to alternatives. In this paper, a dimension-reduction model-adaptive test is proposed for generalized linear models. The test behaves like a local smoothing test as if the model were univariate, and can be consistent against any global alternatives and can detect local alternatives distinct from the null at a fast rate that existing local smoothing tests can achieve only when the model is univariate. Simulations are carried out to examine the performance of our methodology. A real data analysis is conducted for illustration. The method can readily be extended to global smoothing methodology and other testing problems...|$|R

2500|$|One {{problem was}} Baker Bowl. [...] Once {{considered}} one of the finest parks in baseball, it was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> from the 1910s onward. [...] For instance, until 1925 the Phillies used a flock of sheep to trim the grass. [...] Fans were often showered with rust whenever one of Klein's home runs hit girders. [...] The entire right field grandstand collapsed in 1926, forcing the Phillies to move to the A's Shibe Park (five blocks west on Lehigh Avenue from Baker Bowl) for 1927.|$|E
2500|$|The Polish {{report also}} found three {{deficiencies}} regarding the Smolensk airport which {{contributed to the}} crash. One was {{a large number of}} obstacles (mostly tall trees) in the area before the runway which should have been removed to keep the protected approach airspace clear of obstructions. The second deficiency was with the approach lighting system, which was charted incorrectly and <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained.</b> Many bulbs were burned out, several others were missing their lenses, and others were obscured by shrubbery. The third concern was with the airport information received by Poland, which contained incorrect information. In addition to the lighting system not being depicted correctly, the airport's location was charted approximately [...] to the North of its actual position.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} {{includes many}} large apartments and townhouses with high population densities. As of 2009, many apartments and townhouses were <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained.</b> The pools at the complexes were <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained,</b> and trash pickup was {{not up to}} standard.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the overall}} Nidaros Cathedral restoration, {{reconstruction}} of the west front stirred the most debate. The Nidaros Cathedral had <b>not</b> been <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> and the west front {{was among the most}} deteriorated parts of the church in 1869. The difficulty in restoration was exacerbated {{by the fact that it}} was the portion of the church which was the most complex, least well documented, and most difficult to reconstruct. The initial condition was so bad that many professionals opposed any attempt to restore without major reconstruction.|$|R
50|$|The {{resort is}} served by one major road, the Lasseter Highway, which links it to {{surrounding}} roads and landmarks. The Lasseter Highway is currently being expanded {{in the area to}} help with the tourism traffic flow. The sealed Lasseter Highway extends east to meet the Stuart Highway. The roads in other directions are <b>not</b> so <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> or travelled. The Great Central Road leads west and southwest into Western Australia, but is generally only suitable for high clearance four-wheel drive vehicles. Transit permits from Aboriginal Land Councils are required to travel west of Kata-Tjuta.|$|R
50|$|There {{is another}} sanatorium, 'The Rainbow', (Ukrainian: Санаторій «Радужний»), {{within the same}} grounds as Myrhorod Kurort but with {{different}} owners. This is, in the main, frequented by wealthy Ukrainians and Russians who prefer what they regard as the 'added security' of a sanatorium that advertises itself as 'élite'.The other two resorts are much further out of town, <b>not</b> so <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> and equipped and are both rather 'tired' in appearance, both from the inside and out. One of them, the 'Hohol', (Russian/Ukrainian: Гогол) is owned by a Trades Union and seems to derive most of its clientele from its members.|$|R
50|$|Mattaur has {{a fairly}} good sewage system, {{and it does not}} display water or {{electricity}} problems, but the village needs to improve its infrastructure. Garbage dumps are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained.</b> Roads are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained.</b> The town does not have a reliable supply of potable water.|$|E

50|$|Malargüe {{is linked}} to the north of Mendoza by National Route 40. This route {{continues}} south, entering Neuquén Province, but is only partially built and <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> beyond Malargüe City.|$|E
5000|$|The {{refinery}} {{was built}} in 1934, but had <b>not</b> been <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> for several years. [...] Consulting firm Telos had examined conditions at the plant and released a report in January 2005 which found numerous safety issues, including [...] "broken alarms, thinned pipe, chunks of concrete falling, bolts dropping 60 ft and staff being overcome with fumes." [...] The report's co-author stated, [...] "We {{have never seen a}} site where the notion 'I could die today' was so real." [...] The refinery had also had five managers in the six years since BP inherited it in its 1999 merger with Amoco.|$|R
5000|$|The 18th century saw {{dramatic}} change: a new {{hall was}} built, {{and a new}} owner—a wealthy businessman from Tyneside named John Burdon—began to develop the grounds. Burdon enhanced the 17 acre ornamental lake {{on the south side}} of the hall by adding an artificial river leading to it and encircling it with a walkway. In all, he laid out 40 acre of additional ornamental features, including temples, grottoes and follies designed primarily by London architect James Paine. Although the grounds and buildings were <b>not</b> subsequently <b>well</b> <b>maintained,</b> the garden retains Pain's basic structure and is an unusual example of authentic 18th century landscape design.|$|R
2500|$|Homestead Trail (1 mile): {{part of the}} Homestead Valley Land Trust, this longer winding trail {{traverses}} {{the western}} slope of Homestead Valley itself. It is <b>not</b> <b>well</b> delineated or <b>maintained</b> in parts. It has several other trail heads that leads up into Tamalpais State Park near the [...] "four-corners" [...] intersection, as well as down into the valley via (lower portion) Ridgeview Ave. and Ferndale Ave.|$|R
50|$|The castle was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> under Danbury's ownership, and {{the roof}} has since collapsed. In 2004, Tarrywile Park Authority and The City of Danbury {{approved}} two options for renovating the castle.|$|E
5000|$|Department of Environment IPA Database. AT 3 February 2017, latest {{data file}} was 20 September 2016. Data is <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> - {{for example the}} gazetted area value for several IPAs is zero.|$|E
50|$|Despite being renovated and {{partially}} rebuilt during the Dutch colonial era, the temple currently is in poor condition. Compared to other temples nearby such as Prambanan, Sewu, and Sambisari the temple is <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>maintained.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the pilot, Maia's foster parents take her to visit the {{cemetery}} where her parents are buried. When they comment that the cemetery is <b>not</b> very <b>well</b> <b>maintained,</b> Maia tells them that they will be buried at a nicer cemetery. When they receive a brochure for the cemetery that Maia mentioned in the mail, they become shaken. They return her to the facility, which she understands. The mother warns her that she scares people by some of the things she says. Dennis attempts to question her on why she was returned, but she does not give him any specific answers, seeming to take her foster mother's warning to heart.|$|R
50|$|On June 12, 1896, a coroner's jury {{concluded}} that the tramway operator, the Consolidated Electric Railway Company, {{was responsible for the}} disaster because it allowed its streetcar to be loaded with a much greater weight of passengers than the bridge was designed to support. The city council of Victoria was found to be guilty of contributory negligence because the bridge had <b>not</b> been <b>well</b> <b>maintained,</b> and because council failed to take steps to restrict the traffic on the bridge to within safe limits. The design and construction of the bridge was also found to have been poor, especially in that the specifications called for weldless iron to be used, but the ironwork was almost all welded.|$|R
50|$|Puerto Rico Highway 189 is a 15 km long {{main highway}} which {{parallels}} very closely {{the first half}} of Puerto Rico Highway 30 from Caguas, Puerto Rico near downtown to Juncos, Puerto Rico passing through all three business centers of Caguas, Gurabo and Juncos. It ends at Puerto Rico Highway 31, and has no direct intersection with Puerto Rico Highway 198 although they are not separated by more than half a kilometer. It is not a good option to bypass the frequent traffic jams in PR-30 and is seriously damaged with holes and cracks, this being a sign of <b>not</b> been <b>well</b> <b>maintained</b> by the government agencies in the municipalities it goes through.|$|R
