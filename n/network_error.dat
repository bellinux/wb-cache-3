Several bounds in classical coding theory have been extended to <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction coding, especially the Singleton bound. In this paper, following the research line using the extended global encoding kernels proposed in zhang-correction, the refined Singleton bound of NEC can be proved more explicitly. Moreover, we give a constructive proof of the attainability of this bound and indicate that the required field size {{for the existence of}} network maximum distance separable (MDS) codes can become smaller further. By this proof, an algorithm is proposed to construct general linear <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction codes including the linear <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction MDS codes. Finally, we study the error correction capability of random linear <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction coding. Motivated partly by the performance analysis of random linear network coding Ho-etc-random, we evaluate the different failure probabilities defined in this paper in order to analyze the performance of random linear <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction coding. Several upper bounds on these probabilities are obtained and they show that these probabilities will approach to zero as the size of the base field goes to infinity. Using these upper bounds, we slightly improve on the probability mass function of the minimum distance of random linear <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction codes in zhang-random, as well as the upper bound on the field size required for the existence of linear <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction codes with degradation at most d.

How {{to deal with}} information transmission and <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction simultaneously under different rates is introduced in this paper as a variable-rate <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction problem. Apparently, linear <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction MDS codes {{are expected to be}} used for these different rates. For this purpose, designing a linear <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction MDS code based on the existing results for each information rate is an efficient solution. In order to solve the problem more efficiently, we present the concept of variable-rate linear <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction MDS codes, that is, these linear <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction MDS codes of different rates have the same local encoding kernel at each internal node. Further, we propose an approach to construct such a family of variable-rate network MDS codes and give an algorithm for efficient implementation. This approach saves the storage space for each internal node, and resources and time for the transmission on networks. Moreover, the performance of our proposed algorithm is analyzed, including the field size, the time complexity, the encoding complexity at the source node, and the decoding methods. Finally, a random method is introduced for constructing variable-rate network MDS codes and we obtain a lower bound on the success probability of this random method, which shows that this probability will approach to one as the base field size goes to infinity.

The block <b>network</b> <b>error</b> control coding framework, BNEC, is presented and {{the capability of}} the scheme to correct a mixture of symbol errors and packet erasures and to detect symbol errors is studied. The idea of syndrome-based decoding and error detection is introduced for BNEC, which removes the effect of input data and hence decreases the complexity. Next, an efficient three-stage syndrome-based BNEC decoding scheme for <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction is proposed, in which prior to finding the error values, {{the position of the}} edge errors are identified based on the error spaces at the receivers. In addition to bounded-distance decoding schemes for error correction up to the refined Singleton bound, a complete decoding scheme for BNEC is also introduced. Specifically, it is shown that using the proposed syndrome-based complete decoding, a <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correcting code with redundancy order d for receiver t, can correct d- 1 random additive errors with a probability sufficiently close to 1, if the field size is sufficiently large. Also, a complete maximum likelihood decoding scheme for BNEC is proposed.

40|$|In this thesis, <b>network</b> <b>error</b> {{correction}} {{is considered}} from both {{theoretical and practical}} viewpoints. Theoretical parameters such as network structure and type of connection (multicast vs. nonmulticast) {{have a profound effect}} on <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction capability. This work is also dictated by the practical network issues that arise in wireless ad-hoc networks, networks with limited computational power (e. g., sensor networks) and real-time data streaming systems (e. g., video/audio conferencing or media streaming). Firstly, multicast network scenarios with probabilistic error and erasure occurrence are considered. In particular, it is shown that in networks with both random packet erasures and errors, increasing the relative occurrence of erasures compared to errors favors network coding over forwarding at network nodes, and vice versa. Also, fountain-like error-correcting codes, for which redundancy is incrementally added until decoding succeeds, are constructed. These codes are appropriate for use in scenarios where the upper bound on the number of errors is unknown a priori. Secondly, <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction in multisource multicast and nonmulticast network scenarios is discussed. Capacity regions for multisource multicast <b>network</b> <b>error</b> correction with both known and unknown topologies (coherent and noncoherent network coding) are derived. Several approaches to lower- and upper-bounding error-correction capacity regions of general nonmulticast networks are given.

For these network topologies, code constructions that employ only intrasession coding are designed. These designs can be applied to streaming erasure correction code constructions...|$|E

The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm uses this approximation to the Hessian matrix in the following Newton-like update: when the scalar λ is zero, this is just Newton’s method, using the approximate Hessian matrix. When λ is large, this becomes gradient descent with a small step size. Newton’s method is faster and more accurate near an error minimum, so the aim is to shift towards Newton’s method as quickly as possible. Thus, λ is decreased after each successful step (reduction in performance function) and is increased only when a tentative step would increase the performance function.
