2500|$|On December 1, 2008, Multiven {{filed an}} {{antitrust}} lawsuit against Cisco Systems, Inc. {{in an effort}} to open up the <b>network</b> <b>maintenance</b> services marketplace for Cisco equipment, promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value. Multiven's complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes/patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services (SMARTnet) and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and anticompetitive acts designed to maintain Cisco's alleged monopoly in the <b>network</b> <b>maintenance</b> services market for Cisco networking equipment. In May 2010, Cisco accused the person who filed the antitrust suit, British-Nigerian technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye, with hacking and pressured the US government to extradite him from Canada. Alfred-Adekeye was arrested while in the middle of testifying against Cisco in an anti-trust hearing. Although he was released after 28 days on bail, the case has stretched for a year, because the U.S. Attorney's office was unable to present the evidence required for the extradition. The antitrust lawsuit has been settled 2 months after Alfred-Adekeye's arrest. In May 2011, the US extradition request has been denied. Canadian Supreme Court Justice Ronald McKinnon, who oversaw the extradition hearing, commented on the arrest saying [...] "It is simply not done in a civilized jurisdiction that is bound by the rule of law". He also stated that the real reason for the extradition proceedings was because Alfred-Adekeye [...] "dared to take on a multinational giant." [...] Judge McKinnon has also condemned the US prosecutor for hiding the fact that Alfred-Adekeye was in legal proceedings against Cisco Systems, for stating that Alfred-Adekeye had left the USA in a time period when he had not and a formal request for extradition was not filed against Alfred-Adekeye when he was taken into custody. He described the information provided by Cisco and the US prosecutor as [...] "full of innuendo, half-truths and falsehoods," [...] adding that [...] "This speaks volumes for Cisco's duplicity" [...] and accused them of [...] "unmitigated gall" [...] in using such a heavy-handed move as an unsupportable arrest and jailing to pressure Alfred-Adekeye to drop or settle his civil antitrust complaint.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 December 2011, an {{accident}} occurred during a maintenance drill involving {{one of the}} systems. While loading missiles into a launcher vehicle from a bunker at the Air Defense Network's school near kibbutz Mashabei Sadeh in the Negev, two soldiers caused twenty Tamir interceptors to {{fall from a height}} of four meters near soldiers and officers without detonating, causing no injury, but making them unserviceable. Ynetnews reported that the soldiers were never in danger because the interceptor missiles are equipped with a security mechanism that prevents premature explosions. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit said that the Air Force commander, Maj. Gen. Ido Nehushtan, appointed a committee to examine the accident and ordered an immediate stop to all Air Defense <b>Network</b> <b>maintenance</b> work until a preliminary investigation was concluded. It also said that during the following week actions would be taken to [...] "improve skills and safety awareness". A security official told Reshet Bet that the failure was twofold in that the soldiers and their commander deviated from severely strict safety protocols, and 20 costly interceptors were lost. Walla! website reported that the soldiers made a mistake in loading the missiles and they fell backwards. The website calculated the damage at $1 million USD (at $50,000 per missile). The missiles were transferred back to Rafael to determine whether they could be repaired.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Many <b>maintenance</b> <b>{{networks}}</b> {{as well as}} supply {{networks and}} virtual enterprises consist of multiple organizations. A common problem arising in these different domains is multiorganization scheduling and coordination. The traditional centralized methods are not appropriate because {{of the existence of}} private information and decision-making authorities at different organizations. Although many distributed mechanisms have been presented for supply networks and virtual enterprises, they may not be effective for <b>maintenance</b> <b>networks</b> because of the difficulties of scheduling the tightly related maintenance operations and handling the massive uncertainties involved. These difficulties as well as the heterogeneity of the distributed environment make it challenging to develop an efficient framework for <b>maintenance</b> <b>networks</b> that can obtain a high-quality solution under different conditions, schedule in a timely manner, solve large-scale problems, and so on. In this paper, a price-based multiagent scheduling and coordination framework for <b>maintenance</b> <b>networks</b> is explored, and a systematic experimental study is carried out to evaluate the effects of different factors on its performance. The results show that the framework is able to overcome these difficulties and could be a step toward the next generation of e-scheduling for <b>maintenance</b> <b>networks.</b> Index Terms—Lagrangian relaxation, <b>maintenance</b> <b>networks,</b> multiagent, multiorganization scheduling and coordination.

40|$|Abstract- In {{wireless}} sensor networks where deployment {{is expected}} to surpass the lifetime of batteries, {{a major part of}} the operation costs is expected to be consumed by maintenance costs. It is important, therefore, to identify sources of maintenance related costs and to reduce them. In this paper we propose a maintenance model to explain sources of maintenance costs in {{wireless sensor networks}}. We also introduce the concept of maintenance awareness in such networks and describe a new technique to reduce maintenance costs. Our first experimental results shows that substantial cost reduction can be achieved. Keywords- Sensor <b>networks,</b> <b>maintenance,</b> routing, GPSR. I...|$|R
