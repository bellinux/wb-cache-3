40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{four different}} mechanisms {{that lead to}} oscillations in a network of two reciprocally inhibitory cells. In two cases (intrinsic release and intrinsic escape) {{the frequency of the}} network oscillation is insensitive to the threshold voltage of the synaptic potentials. In the other two cases (synaptic release and synaptic escape) the <b>network</b> <b>frequency</b> is strongly determined by the threshold voltage of the synaptic onnections. The distinction between the different mechanisms blurs as the function describing synaptic activation becomes less steep and as the model neurons are removed from the relaxation regime. These mechanisms provide insight into the parameters that control <b>network</b> <b>frequency</b> in motor systems that depend on reciprocal inhibition...|$|E
