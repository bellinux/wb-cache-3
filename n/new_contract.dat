5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Newcastle United were linked with a £6 million bid for Brown, as a {{replacement}} for their outgoing captain Kevin Nolan. Brown stated {{that he did not want}} to leave Celtic and that he felt privileged to be the captain. He also said that he wanted to sign a <b>new</b> <b>contract</b> as his current deal was to expire at the end of the season. Internazionale and Juventus were also reportedly looking to sign him on a free transfer if he did not sign a <b>new</b> <b>contract.</b> After protracted talks, Brown announced on 29 August that he was to sign a <b>new</b> <b>contract</b> in the next few weeks. Due to his SPL suspension incurred at the end of the 2010–11 season, Brown's first match of the new campaign was Scotland's 2–1 win over Denmark on 10 August. He suffered an ankle injury in this match, but played in the next five games for Celtic and the next international match. He missed Celtic's 4–0 win over Motherwell, on 10 September, due to the injury and then the 2–0 loss to Atlético Madrid five days later.|$|E

He told the local press that he felt disrespected the way Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe had handled his contract – he had taken a pay cut to move from Derby, a 40% pay cut following relegation, and then the <b>new</b> <b>contract</b> offer was lower still than his current contract.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that a significant part of risk from poultry grow-out farm operations is due to market price of broilers. This risk is transferred to the integrator when the grower enters a production contract with the integrator. This follows from the absence of a market price variable in determining compensation in such contracts. In more recent contracts a market price clause is included in calculating compensation. We conduct welfare comparison of the old and <b>new</b> <b>contracts</b> and find that while including the market price clause increases the variability of grower income, it also raises grower expected return. Overall, under assumptions of fixed flock size and constant percentage mortality, which enables payment per-pound comparison, <b>new</b> <b>contracts</b> are welfare superior relative to the old contracts. However, when analysis is conducted on a total per-flock payment rather than on a per-pound payment, we find that welfare superiority of <b>new</b> <b>contracts</b> depends on the grower attitude towards risk. It turns out that with higher measures of risk aversion, growers prefer the old contracts relative to the <b>new</b> <b>contracts,</b> while those with lower measures of risk aversion prefer the <b>new</b> <b>contracts.</b> Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R
