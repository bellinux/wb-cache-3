5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks {{was well}} established, Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million bricks a year. It was decided that 5million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the <b>national</b> <b>network.</b> Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.|$|E

Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community, in which she says her Southern U.S. background has helped to distinguish herself from other blonde-haired actors. She has spoken of an affinity for her strong female characters and a desire to avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman. She also has worked closely with the Rape, Abuse, and Incest <b>National</b> <b>Network</b> (RAINN) after participating in a storyline in which her Private Practice character Charlotte King was raped.|$|E
5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their rights under Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting meant little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly also meant that many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous maternity leave was legally required, and a <b>national</b> <b>network</b> of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women.|$|E

Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport.

Mindful of the anti-Catholic prejudice Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger Kennedy's presidential candidacy.|$|E
5|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Winnipeg {{started in}} 1954. The federal government refused to license any private broadcaster until the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{had created a}} <b>national</b> <b>network.</b> In May 1954, CBWT {{went on the air}} with four hours of broadcasting per day. There are now five English-language stations and one French-language station based in Winnipeg. Additionally, some American network affiliates are available over-the-air. Winnipeg is home to 33 AM and FM radio stations, two of which are French-language stations. CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 broadcast local and national programming in the city. NCI is devoted to Aboriginal programming.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{considered}} a yardstick by which limited-access highway construction would be measured. Commission chairman Jones called for more limited-access roads to be built across the country for defense purposes, and the turnpike was {{a model for a}} proposed <b>national</b> <b>network</b> of highways planned during World War II. The Pennsylvania Turnpike led to the construction of other toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and (eventually) the Interstate Highway System.

It began in 1931 during the Great Depression with four Miami-area pastors and lay members of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. It employs over 600 staff and operates on an annual budget of over $38 million. In 2006, it served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties.

5|$|Despite its severe {{financial}} straits, by 1953, DuMont {{appeared to}} be {{on its way to}} establishing itself as the third <b>national</b> <b>network.</b> DuMont programs aired live on 16 stations, but it could count on only seven primary stations – its three owned-and-operated stations ("O"), plus WGN-TV in Chicago, KTTV (channel 11) in Los Angeles, KFEL-TV (channel 2, now KWGN-TV) in Denver and WTVN-TV (channel 6, now WSYX) in Columbus, Ohio. In contrast, ABC had a full complement of five O, augmented by nine primary affiliates. ABC also had a radio network (it was descended from NBC's Blue Network) from which to draw talent, affiliate loyalty and a profit stream to subsidize television operations. However, ABC had only 14 primary stations, while CBS and NBC had over 40 each. By 1951, ABC was badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy. That year, the company announced a merger with United Paramount Theaters (the former theater division of Paramount Pictures, which was spun off {{as a result of the}} United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. antitrust decision), but it was not until 1953 that the FCC approved the merger.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the {{movement}} {{began with the}} use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin. Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for its street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans: Michael Brown, resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson, and Eric Garner in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in {{the movement}} have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election.
