40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{an empirical}} {{assessment of the}} incentive effects of plant variety protection regimes in the generation of crop variety innovations. A duration model of plant <b>variety</b> protection <b>certificates</b> is used to infer the private appropriability of returns from agricultural crop variety innovations in the UK over the period 1965 - 2000. The results suggest that plant variety protection provides only modest appropriability of returns to innovators of agricultural crop varieties. The val- ue distribution of plant <b>variety</b> protection <b>certificates</b> is highly skewed with {{a large proportion of}} innovations providing virtually no returns to innovators. Increasing competition from <b>newer</b> <b>varieties</b> appears to have accelerated the turnover of varie- ties reducing appropriability further. Plant variety protection emerges as a relatively weak instrument of protection...|$|R
50|$|Plant <b>variety</b> <b>certificates</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with plant patents. The Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) and the Plant Patent Act of 1930 provide protection based on different types of plant reproductive strategies. The PVPA, which authorizes plant <b>variety</b> protection <b>certificates,</b> protects sexually reproduced and tuber propagated plants, whereas the Plant Patent Act, which authorizes plant patents, is limited to asexually reproduced plants, excluding tuber propagated plants. However, the same plant may be protected under both the Plant Variety Protection Act and the Plant Patent Act of 1930. The most appropriate means of protection may be decided by the applicant based on the applicant's business requirements.|$|R

By presenting cases of the Tohoku region - one of the main paddy rice-producing regions in Japan - the spatial distribution of <b>new</b> rice <b>varieties</b> after the 1990 s is recapitulated as follows: (1) at the regional level, distinct regional differentiation appeared with the emergence of main rice varieties in each prefecture; (2) at the prefecture level, planted areas of paddy rice decreased and the percentage of the main rice variety increased; and (3) throughout the regional and prefectural levels, the naming of <b>new</b> rice <b>varieties</b> was simplified and generalized. In the process of development and distribution of the <b>new</b> <b>varieties</b> of paddy rice, some conditions are considered as the commodification of the paddy rice-producing centers: (1) corresponding with recent market demands, <b>new</b> <b>varieties</b> with good flavor were constantly bred and spread; (2) values of some of the <b>new</b> <b>varieties</b> increased by being designated as "regional brand-name varieties"; and (3) the primary <b>new</b> rice <b>varieties</b> were introduced simultaneously by individual farms according to marketing strategies developed by prefectural and municipal administrations and agricultural cooperatives.
