Adaptive optics {{images are}} {{used to test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the explosive BN/KL outflow from the Orion OMC 1 cloud core was powered by the dynamical decay of a <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>system</b> of massive stars. Methods. Narrow-band H 2, [Fe II], and broad-band Ks obtained with the Gemini South multi-conjugate adaptive optics (AO) system GeMS and near-infrared imager GSAOI are presented. The images reach resolutions of 0. 08 to 0. 10 ", close to the 0. 07 " diffraction limit of the 8 -meter telescope at 2. 12 microns. Comparison with previous AO-assisted observations of sub-fields and other ground-based observations enable measurements of proper motions and the investigation of morphological changes in H 2 and [Fe II] features with unprecedented precision. The images are compared with numerical simulations of compact, high-density clumps moving ~ 1000 times their own diameter through a lower density medium at Mach 1000. Results. Several sub-arcsecond H 2 features and many [Fe II] 'fingertips' on the projected outskirts of the flow show proper motions of ~ 300 km/s. High-velocity, sub-arcsecond H 2 knots ('bullets') are seen as far as 140 " from their suspected ejection site. If these knots propagated through the dense Orion A cloud, their survival sets a lower bound on their densities of order 10 ^ 7 cm^- 3, consistent with an origin within a few au of a massive star and accelerated by a final multi-body dynamic encounter that ejected the BN object and radio source I from OMC 1 about 500 years ago. Conclusions. Over 120 high-velocity bow-shocks propagating in nearly all directions from the OMC 1 cloud core provide evidence for an explosive origin for the BN/KL outflow triggered by the dynamic decay of a <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>system</b> of massive stars.

40|$|File {{names are}} an ancient abstraction, {{a string of}} {{characters}} to uniquely identify a file and help users remember the con- tents of a file when they look for it later. However, they are not an ideal solution for these tasks. Names often contain useful semantic metadata provided by the user, but this meta- data is opaque {{to the rest of}} the system. The formatting of the file name is up to the user, and as a result, metadata in file names is often error-prone, inconsistently formatted, and hard to search for later. File names need to be more mean- ingful and reliable, while simplifying application design and encouraging users and applications to provide more meta- data for search.

This article is an empirical and critical account of monogamous coupledom as a privileged relational experience. Data is drawn from fourteen in-depth interviews with Australian men and women who self-identified their cross or same-sex partnerships as sexually and emotionally monogamous. Monogamy, as participants construct it, is critiqued as an action and policy that produces an exclusive and contained essence of relationships and that guards against a perceived chaotic excess that is set up in opposition to it. Such action is seen to impel a sense of mastery in relationships and selves that are properly enclosed, channelled and thereby ordered. The socio-historic binary arrangement of an ordered inside and chaotic outside is focussed on as enabling a superior monogamous order while also underpinning its precariousness and psychological frailty.

40|$|With {{the removal}} of the Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) from the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2012, several states legalized wolf hunting as part of {{wildlife}} management programs and the protection of livestock. However, the legalization of wolf hunting has created much conflict between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in the Great Lakes region. Many Anishinaabeg, or Ojibwe, in the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan object to the state-sanctioned wolf hunting because of their long-standing religious and ecological relationship to wolves as relatives. In the Anishinaabe creation story, the Creator Gitchi Manitou sent Ma 2 ̆ 7 iingan, or Wolf, as a brother and companion to the original human, where the lives of Anishinaabe peoples and wolves would forever become intertwined. While the wolf hunting conflict appears to be one between religion and the broader secular state, it is a complex issue, involving historical religious conceptions of land and power among Anishinaabe and non-Indigenous Americans. Power and traditional ecological knowledge in Anishinaabe culture originates from non-human sources, where humans must establish relationships with other-than-human beings to survive and achieve bimaadiziwin, or 2 ̆ 2 the good life. 2 ̆ 2 In a bimaadiziwin framework, wolves are a source of power, knowledge, and well-being for humans, suggesting that they and other non-human beings are valid models of potential ways in which humans may develop ecological models and environmental relations. A methodology based on Indigenous environmental theory and non-human power may provide a broader and more inclusive framework for environmental conflicts, incorporating the roles of all the beings that are indigenous in a certain area.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates three {{problems associated}} with wireless networks. First, throughput scaling in extended random access communication networks is examined. In these networks, the number of nodes and the network area increase {{in such a way}} that the density of nodes remains constant. Franceschetti et al. (2008) have shown an improvement in the per-node attainable throughput from the scaling demonstrated in the seminal paper of Gupta-Kumar (2000). This dissertation explores the dependence of this result on the new features introduced by Franceschetti: a capacity based link-rate model, hierarchical routing, and percolation based route construction. By creating a <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>system</b> attaining the same improvement, it is concluded that the improved scaling is due to percolation-based routing, which enables shorter hops and, consequently, less interference. Next, the reliability-efficiency tradeoff in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is examined. Distributed lossless source coding in WSNs offers the potential for sizable reductions in coding rates. However, joint decoding makes these schemes highly sensitive to encoder failures. To improve reliability, this dissertation considers schemes where each source is decoded using only a subset of the encoders. In comparison to previous schemes, called rigid, a new class of schemes, called flexible, is introduced. To analyze performance of these schemes, the Slepian-Wolf lossless source-coding theorem is extended to the case where encoders may fail. For an underlying field that is one-dimensional Gauss-Markov, numerical results show flexible schemes achieving significant performance gains over rigid. Finally, sensor placement and real time data gathering in WSNs is investigated. Here, each sensor observes an underlying random process at its location and communicates its observations to the collector, which then estimates the process over the entire network region. For a one-dimensional Markov process with exponential autocorrelation, it is shown that uniform placement of sensors is optimal in the mean square error sense. Next, in order to demonstrate effects of communication constraints, a simple algorithm for data gathering in a one-dimensional network is proposed. For a stationary process with a separable correlation model, the optimal density of sensors over a fixed area is shown to increase with increasing temporal correlation and/or decreasing spatial correlation...|$|E
40|$|The {{explosive}} BN/KL outflow {{emerging from}} OMC 1 behind the Orion Nebula {{may have been}} powered by the dynamical decay of a <b>non-hierarchical</b> multiple <b>system</b> ∼ 500 years ago that ejected the massive stars I, BN, and source n, with velocities of about 10 to 30 km s^- 1. New proper motion measurements of H_ 2 features show that within the errors of measurement, the outflow originated {{from the site of}} stellar ejection. Combined with published data, these measurements indicate an outflow age of ∼ 500 years, similar to the time since stellar ejection. The total kinetic energy of the ejected stars and the outflow is about 2 to 6 × 10 ^ 47 ergs. It is proposed that the gravitational potential energy released by the formation of a short-period binary, most likely source I, resulted in stellar ejection and powered the outflow. A scenario is presented for the formation of a compact, <b>non-hierarchical</b> multiple star <b>system,</b> its decay into an ejected binary and two high-velocity stars, and launch of the outflow. Three mechanisms {{may have contributed to the}} explosion in the gas: (i) Unbinding of the circum-cluster envelope following stellar ejection, (ii) disruption of circumstellar disks and high-speed expulsion of the resulting debris during the final stellar encounter, and (iii) the release of stored magnetic energy. Plausible proto-stellar disk end envelope properties can produce the observed outflow mass, velocity, and kinetic energy distributions. The ejected stars may have acquired new disks by fall-back or Bondi-Hoyle accretion with axes roughly orthogonal to their velocities. The expulsion of gas and stars from OMC 1 may have been driven by stellar interactions. Comment: 36 pages, 7 figures, 2 table...|$|R
