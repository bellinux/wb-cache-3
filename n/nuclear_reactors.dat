5|$|Titanium {{metal and}} its alloys {{have a wide}} range of applications, where the {{corrosion}} resistance, the heat stability and the low density (light weight) are of benefit. The foremost use of corrosion-resistant hafnium and zirconium has been in <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors.</b> Zirconium has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, zirconium (mostly as zircaloy) is used as cladding of fuel rods in <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors,</b> while hafnium is used in control rods for <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors,</b> because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons.|$|E

50|$|A <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> coolant is a coolant in a <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> used {{to remove}} heat from the <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> core and {{transfer}} it to electrical generators and the environment.Frequently, a chain of two coolant loops are used because the primary coolant loop takes on short-term radioactivity from the reactor.|$|R
5|$|Curium is {{produced}} in small quantities in <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors,</b> and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the 242Cm and 244Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains {{the high price of}} curium, which has been quoted at 160–185 USD per milligram, with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for 242Cm and 170 USD/g for 244Cm. In <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors,</b> curium is formed from 238U in a series of nuclear reactions. In the first chain, 238U captures a neutron and converts into 239U, which via β− decay transforms into 239Np and 239Pu.|$|E
