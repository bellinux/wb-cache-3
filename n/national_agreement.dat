5|$|A {{modicum of}} peace was {{eventually}} established, {{leading to the}} <b>National</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and {{between them and the}} National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The Boston Americans of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion. In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.|$|E
5|$|Flick {{was one of}} many star NL {{players who}} jumped to the fledgling American League (AL) after the 1901 season, playing for the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics. Flick played in 11 games for the Athletics, before the Phillies {{obtained}} an injunction from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court prohibiting any player under contract with the Phillies from playing for another team. Though this injunction named Lajoie, Bill Bernhard, and Chick Fraser only, it still applied to Flick as well. As a recourse, Flick and teammate Lajoie signed instead with the Cleveland Naps, as the Pennsylvania injunction could not be enforced in Ohio. The two players often traveled separately from their teammates for the next year, never setting foot in Pennsylvania in order to avoid a subpoena. Flick spent the remainder of his career in Cleveland, and the contract dispute was resolved when the leagues made peace in September 1903 with the <b>National</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|E

25|$|The first {{minor league}} is {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} the Northwestern League of 1883 to 1884. Unlike the earlier minor associations, it was conceived as a permanent organization. It also, along with the National League and the American Association, was a party to the <b>National</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1883. Included in this was the agreement to respect the reserve lists of clubs in each league. Teams in the National League and the American Association could only reserve players who had been paid at least $1000. Northwest League teams could reserve players paid merely $750, implicitly establishing the division into major and minor leagues. Over the next two decades, more minor leagues signed various versions of the <b>National</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Eventually, the minor leagues joined together to negotiate jointly.|$|E

For a few years there were rumors of abandoning Detroit to compete for Cincinnati or Pittsburgh but the two leagues made peace in 1903 after similar moves into St. Louis and New York.|$|E

Once approved, these units are termed Certified Emission Reductions, or CERs. The Protocol allows these projects to be constructed and credited in advance of the Kyoto trading period.|$|E

25|$|The opposition's {{call for}} {{elections}} led to Levingston's replacement by General Alejandro Lanusse, in March 1971. Faced with strong opposition and social conflicts, General Lanusse declared {{his intention to}} restore constitutional democracy by 1973, though without Peronist participation. Lanusse proposed the Gran Acuerdo Nacional (Great <b>National</b> <b>Agreement)</b> in July 1971, which was to find an honorable exit for the military junta without allowing Peronism {{to participate in the}} election. The proposal was rejected by Perón, who formed the FRECILINA alliance (Frente Cívico de Liberación Nacional, Civic Front of National Liberation), headed by his new delegate Héctor José Cámpora (a member of the Peronist Left). The alliance gathered his Justicialist Party and the Integration and Development Movement (MID), headed by Arturo Frondizi. FRECILINA pressed for free and unrestricted elections, which ultimately took place in March 1973.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-1920s, {{major league}} clubs were {{beginning}} to develop [...] "farm systems", that is, minor league teams owned or controlled by them, at which they could develop young prospects without {{the risk of the}} players being acquired by major league rivals. The pioneer in this development was Branch Rickey, who then ran the St. Louis Cardinals. As the 1921 <b>National</b> <b>Agreement</b> among the major and minor leagues which implemented Landis's hiring lifted a ban on major league teams owning minor league ones, Landis was limited in his avenues of attack on Rickey's schemes. Developing talent at little cost thanks to Rickey, the Cardinals dominated the National League, winning nine league titles in the years from 1926 to 1946.|$|E
500|$|In , the California State League, a minor league, was {{declared}} by organized baseball {{to be an}} [...] "outlaw" [...] league. [...] Organized baseball accused the league of harboring players from the Majors Leagues who had violated the reserve clause to join a number of their teams. [...] The league had become a rival to the already established Pacific Coast League (PCL), who, after being an [...] "outlaw" [...] league themselves, had signed the <b>National</b> <b>Agreement</b> with organized baseball, agreeing {{that they would not}} harbor blacklisted or banned players from the Major Leagues. A national commission decided {{that the best way to}} deal with this situation was to dissolve this outlaw league. [...] They did this by lifting the blacklist on any player already in the State League, which would create competition among all known leagues, for these players. [...] This commission enlisted Lange, who used his influence with the sports editors in the local area to speed up the process. [...] The attempt worked as the PCL successfully lured the Sacramento, California team into joining their league, with many of the players soon to follow.|$|E

500|$|For the {{remainder}} of 1902 and most of 1903, Lajoie and Flick traveled separately {{from the rest of}} the team, needing to avoid entering Pennsylvania so as to avoid a subpoena (the only team they could legally play with inside state limits was the Phillies). When the Naps went to play in Philadelphia, Lajoie and Bernhard would go to nearby Atlantic City to help pass the time. The issue was finally resolved when the leagues made peace through the <b>National</b> <b>Agreement</b> in September 1903 (which also brought the formation of the World Series). To begin the 1903 season, the club changed its name from the Bronchos to the Naps in honor of Lajoie after a readers' poll result was released by the Cleveland Press. (The team was officially the Blues in their inaugural AL season but changed to the Bronchos for the 1902 season.) The Bronchos finished the season 7763 and Lajoie finished his first full season with the club again the AL's batting champion with a [...]344 average. He also led the league in slugging percentage (.518), finished second in doubles (41), third in RBIs (93) and tied for fifth in home runs (7). In the off-season he contracted pleurisy.|$|E

2500|$|Negotiators {{reached a}} new {{contract}} on April 1, 1985, as the old agreement expired. Teamsters officials initially claimed the settlement retained a single wage scale. In fact the agreement created a two-tier pay system, with new workers receiving wages 30 percent lower than incumbent drivers. The agreement also eliminated cost-of-living increases and significantly lower wages for temporary workers. The total wage and benefit package provided an increase of 10 percent over three years, the lowest increase since a <b>national</b> <b>agreement</b> had first been established in 1964. Presser and other Teamster leaders were forced to lobby hard for passage of the agreement. [...] After a month-long ratification battle, Teamsters members narrowly ratified the contract by a 53.2 percent majority.|$|E
