50|$|The {{building}} of the new Kingaroy factory occurred {{during a period of}} modernisation for butter manufacturers. By the end of the 1920s, most Queensland butter factories had been remodelled or were new buildings of brick and concrete, replacing earlier timber structures. The emphasis on producing high grade butter saw the need for more churns within factories to maintain outputs, as the lower temperatures required meant churns were turning longer than previously. In addition to upgrading buildings and equipment, greater attention was paid to ensuring butter was of a high standard, through stricter grading and by employing processes of pasteurisation and <b>neutralisation.</b> Increasing <b>numbers</b> of trained staff were working in factories.|$|R
40|$|Charge {{neutralisation}} procedure {{based on}} a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is applied {{to a system of}} generated hadrons. The algorithm changes the charge of a randomly picked particle by shifting it within its isomultiplet. For baryons changes in both electric charge and baryon number are applied and the algorithm leads to charge and baryon <b>number</b> <b>neutralisation.</b> The procedure can thus be used to study the effects of the local charge and baryon number conservation. We attempt to study these together with the local momentum conservation and their effect on azimuthal correlator observable sensitive to local C and CP violation in quark-gluon plasma.

5000|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Murgon butter factory, operations progressively expanded, reflecting the suitability and productivity of the South Burnett district for dairying. This growth is illustrated by {{the increase in the number}} of suppliers from 250 in 1913 to 800 by 1929, and in butter production from 252 tons in its first year at Murgon, to 1644 tons in 1928. By 1929, the Wide Bay district, in which the South Burnett was included, was second only to the Moreton district in Queensland milk production.The growth of the South Burnett Co-operative's processing activities necessitated the expansion of the factory in 1929. In order to increase production capacity, the South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Company commenced the construction of a new unit of 35 tons capacity to work in conjunction with the existing unit, and a power plant capable of running both components together or independently. The objective behind the dual factory system was to apply the churning capacity of both factories to the manufacture of butter before noon, with the remainder of the day geared towards the handling and treatment of cream deliveries from suppliers. The Murgon butter factory increased the overall production capacity to 64 tons of butter a week, or 128 tons using double shifts. The dual factory system, driven by a common power plant, was claimed at the time to be [...] "unique in the history of butter production in the Commonwealth".Brisbane architect George Hutton, supervised building plans and construction and Mr H. Taylor (also of Brisbane) was the builder. The cost of the remodelling was reported as exceeding £25,000. The largest of the new buildings, built to receive, process and churn cream, was constructed of reinforced concrete with a tubular truss roof, crowned by a lantern roof. The engine/plant room was built to the rear of the larger structure. The new buildings were officially opened on 9 March 1929 by William Forgan Smith, Minister for Agriculture and Stock, with over 1000 invited guests and the township [...] "en-fete" [...] for the occasion.The building of the new Murgon factory occurred during a period of modernisation for butter manufacturers.

40|$|Despite over 25 {{years of}} research, {{the goal of}} {{producing}} an HIV- 1 vaccine able to prevent infection has not been realised. Due to the limited immunogenicity of HIV- 1 glycoproteins in vivo, this thesis explores the use of cholesterol depletion in increasing the antigenicity and immunogenicity of an whole-inactivated HIV- 1 immunogen. The primary aim was to demonstrate that cholesterol depletion of HIV- 1 could enhance antibody binding and viral neutralisation. The laboratory-adapted strain, HIV- 1 MN, was utilised to demonstrate effective cholesterol depletion of virus using the compound methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD). A range of MBCD concentrations were explored to assess the effect of removing cholesterol on viral infectivity, morphology and protein composition of the virus. A 1 mM MBCD concentration, which effected a 50 % reduction in viral envelope cholesterol with little impact on viral structure and protein composition whilst retaining viral infectivity, was chosen to explore the effect of cholesterol depletion on virus antibody binding and neutralisation. Removal of cholesterol from the viral envelope increased antibody binding and <b>neutralisation</b> using a <b>number</b> of monoclonal antibodies, soluble CD 4 (sCD 4) and HIV- 1 positive patient antisera. This concept was then extended to a pseudotyped primary isolate of HIV- 1. Cholesterol depletion of this isolate demonstrated a more restricted enhancement of antibody binding and neutralisation of virus by monoclonal antibodies, sCD 4 and homologous and heterologous HIV- 1 infected patient antisera. A number of inactivating agents were then explored in the aim of creating a cholesteroldepleted, whole inactivated HIV- 1 MN immunogen that retained key conformational gp 160 epitopes. This immunogen was then tested in a mouse model to investigate whether cholesterol depletion could enhance the immunogenicity of whole-inactivated HIV- 1 MN. Although measurement of antibody responses from pooled mouse sera indicated significant enhancement of humoral responses to cholesterol-depleted, wholeinactivated HIV- 1 MN, analysis of individual mouse responses to immunisation yielded more variable results.

40|$|Cappadocian Greek nominal {{inflection}} {{differs from}} the inflection of better-known Greek varieties in possessing a novel morphological construction that has been claimed to display a shift from the ‘inherited’ Greek fusional morphology to an ‘innovative’ type of agglutinative morphology (Thomason & Kaufman 1998; Janse 2001; Winford 2003). The construction in question {{involves the use of}} the morphemes -ju and -ja to denote genitive case and plural number respectively, on the model of Turkish (1 b.), thus marking the shift as a candidate case of contact-induced language change. Despite what is often quoted in the literature, though, the use of the two morphemes is not extended to all nouns; rather, the novel morphemes are part of a large set of inflectional endings (IEs) in the Cappadocian nominal system (1). (1) Axó Cappadocian (data from Mavrochalyvidis & Kesisoglou 1960) a. ‘shepherd’ SINGULAR Nominative piʃtiko-s Accusative piʃtiko-Ø Genitive piʃtik-u PLURAL Nominative piʃtik-i Accusative piʃtik-jus Genitive piʃtik-u b. ‘sleep’ SINGULAR Nominative jipnos-Ø Accusative jipnos-Ø Genitive jipnos-ju PLURAL Nominative jipnos-ja Accusative jipnos-ja Genitive jipnos-ju c. ‘door’ SINGULAR Nominative tira-Ø Accusative tira-Ø Genitive tira-s PLURAL Nominative tir-es Accusative tir-es Genitive tir-es-ju In this paper, based on the examination of the nominal inflections of three Cappadocian varieties (Delmesó, Axó and Ulaghátsh Cappadocian; data from Dawkins 1916; Kesisoglou 1951; Mavrochalyvidis & Kesisoglou 1960), I show that the change in Cappadocian did not involve the wholesale adoption of an agglutinative morphological pattern from Turkish. Instead, it involved the emergence of a number of IEs which do not express a feature bundle including both case and number, {{as is the case in}} Greek fusional morphology, but only one of the two features, thus displaying a one-to-one relation between form and function, typical of agglutinative languages. The -ju and -ja morphemes belong to this novel type of ‘agglutinative’ IEs. This is best illustrated in the separate expression of number and case found in the combination of two IEs in genitive plural forms like tir-es-ju in (1 c.). The emergence of these novel IEs was the outcome of the neutralisation of case and number contrasts between noun forms within the same paradigm. Witness, for example, the <b>neutralisation</b> of <b>number</b> in the genitive singular and plural forms of pitikos (1 a.) and jipnos in (1 b.) or the neutralisation of case in the nominative and accusative plural forms of jipnos in (1 b.) and tira in (1 c.). In dealing with the role contact with Turkish played in the changes observed in the Cappadocian nominal inflection, and in line with current research which calls for the integration of the psycholinguistic dimension of language change with the study of contact phenomena (Field 2002; Clyne 2003; Matras & Sakel 2007), a hypothesis can be formulated according to which the emergence of the novel ‘agglutinative’ IEs may have been the outcome, at least in part, of the employment of resolution strategies by Cappadocian-Turkish bilingual children in order to reduce the processing overload caused by the differences in the underlying representations of IEs in the two languages in terms of feature marking. However, the ‘purely’ structural factors outlined above, which undoubtedly co-acted in the process of change, raise a number of questions regarding the plausibility of processing-oriented approaches to the change, which are also briefly addressed in the present paper...|$|R
