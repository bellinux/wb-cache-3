40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explored the personal meanings of <b>needlecrafts</b> {{and their role}} in the self-management of depression. Written and spoken narratives from 39 women were studied. Respondents described themselves as experiencing chronic or episodic depression (e. g. associated with stressful work situations, bereavement or caring for an ill relative). Some had received treatment for depression but most had not. When analysing the therapeutic effects of creative activity, most women described the experience of intense concentration in the task as providing distraction from worry and relief from depressive thoughts. Creative activity was often described as enhancing self-esteem. The adaptability of the occupation to suit time available, mood and other factors facilitated a sense of empowerment or control. Creative arts activities could also challenge depression from enabling social contacts. Most respondents had taken up their favoured creative activity in adulthood, commonly in response to stressful life events and with some self-awareness of its therapeutic potential. The diversity of subjective benefits support further research into the self-management of depression through creative activities, in both patient and non-patient groups. Managin...|$|E
40|$|Knitting is the {{unlikely}} story lurking behind {{the history of}} twentieth century warfare. In the First World War the conflict prompted British civilians to knit ‘comforts’ for the troops. Official support for home-front knitting may have been driven {{by the desire to}} use wartime to reconstruct gender roles, but a widespread enthusiasm for domestic crafts also reflected the rise of volunteering, which swept Britain during the First World War. During the Second World War many men also got involved in knitting for the troops, due to the ease with which knitting could be incorporated into everyday life, and the contribution that comforts made to the war effort. Images of cheerful and patriotic knitters may be the popular face of the wartime volunteer project but war knitting challenges the sentimental image of <b>needlecrafts.</b> If the mobility and Do-It-Yourself qualities of home knitting encouraged wartime volunteer knitters, today it inspires guerrilla knitting ventures and the use of hand knitting in high fashion. Then and now, the mobility and simplicity of knitting makes it an attractive activity for both men and women. Wartime concerns about austerity, recycling and improvisation have resurfaced in the twenty-first century, which has found military-inspired knits taking on new meanings in fashion...|$|E
30|$|Needlework {{and textile}} crafts {{in general are}} long {{established}} practices, and their tools have undergone many iterations of improvements to reach their current shape (Beaudry 2006). Also, the use of electronically conductive and resistive materials has existed within the domain of textile crafts for a long time. Early descriptions of metal <b>needlecrafts</b> {{date back to the}} thirteenth century B.C. (Fürnkranz 2005). Metallic threads, prepared in numerous shapes to fit diverse textile techniques, have been used for ornamental reasons, to produce exquisite garments or textile arts for clerical, royal, and bourgeois clientele. Even though resistive and conductive properties are inherent in their material qualities, they have not been utilized for electronic functionality, and thus, electronic properties of the related tools were not relevant. If crafting for electronic functions, for example, a resistor (Kurbak and Posch 2014) or crocheting a sensor (Perner-Wilson et al 2010), one needs a crochet hook and resistive yarn to actually crochet a functional electronic part, and one simultaneously needs to be informed about the resistance value of the crochet in the making in order to know when the correct value is reached. If crafting an electric circuit, one wants to know that the ends are connected correctly, and ideally already have access to that information while making it to adapt accordingly. The two mentioned routines are standard procedures in electronics, and there are refined tools available for these precise tasks when dealing with hardware electronic components. But existing tools for measuring resistance or detecting electrical connections, as they are designed for a different making context, are mostly not compatible with textile materials. Their probes are for many tasks too big, too rough, or cannot establish good contact on textile, and are even less useable to actually create any textile artifact.|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{illness and}} {{impairment}} commonly restrict the individual's access {{to work and}} leisure activities. Furthermore, if increasingly dependent upon family care, the individual may experience loss of valued roles and self- esteem. A qualitative study was carried out on the written narratives of 35 women, aged 18 to 87 years. All had acquired a disability or chronic illness in adulthood, and although facing different health problems, they shared <b>needlecraft</b> as a common leisure pursuit. The narratives explored {{the circumstances in which}} <b>needlecraft</b> had been adopted as a leisure pursuit, and the personal benefits experienced. Most of the women had taken up this activity in adulthood to cope with the crisis of illness. Needlework activities were commonly viewed as providing a means of managing pain, unstructured time, selfimage and reciprocal social roles.
