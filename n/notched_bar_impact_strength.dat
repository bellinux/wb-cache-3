40|$|Within {{the test}} program aging {{appearances}} were verified at laser-welded joints of unalloyed ferritic-pearlitic steel in the parent metal {{close to the}} heat-affected zone. The displacement of the impact transition temperature of S 235 JRLC, S 355 M and S 355 J 2 G 3 at aged test specimens (one month aging at room-temperature) in comparison with non-aged specimens is a characteristic property. Depending on the material the transition temperature increases by approx. + 20 C. The maximum hardness increase of HV 1, after one month of aging has been between 5 and 8 %, but after a longer duration (6 to 12 months) this value {{will go back to}} the basic value. Therefore the hardness test is a important measured variable to determine the sensitivity against aging of a material, since the maximum hardness increase is correlating with the displacement of the impact transition temperature. Besides the critical behavior of the aging zone at the <b>notch</b> <b>bar</b> <b>impact</b> test a strong tensile residual stress is weaken this material zone too. The elongation measured in tension tests of the investigated test specimen is partly smaller than in the heat-affected zone and the adjacent parent metal. A complete fail of the construction because of the shown aging effects is not impossible, but more improbable since there is expected a stabilizer effect of the adjacent parent metal around the small aged zone. For selection of a metal the thermomechanical structural steel should be preferred. The here investigated steel S 355 M shows due to its small carbon content a maximum hardness of less than 250 HV 1 and since it has a very low impact transition temperature and its least loss of toughness in the aged zone it still has reserves for aging.

50|$|A Notch in {{mechanical}} and materials engineering {{refers to a}} deliberately introduced v-shaped, u-shaped or circular defect in a planar material whereby stress is concentrated.

Notches are most often found in impact testing of materials where the presence of a crack origin of controlled morphology in necessary in order to achieve standardised characterisation of fracture toughness. This is most commonly realized using the Charpy impact test , in which the impact of a pendulum hammer (striker) with a horizontal notched specimen and the height of its subsequent swing-through is used to infer the energy absorbed in fracture of the specimen. <b>Impact</b> testing of <b>notched</b> <b>bars</b> is also applied in the Izod <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> test, typically applied to a cantilever configuration with a vertically positioned specimen.

40|$|The {{state of}} stress {{in the core of}} a <b>notched</b> <b>bar</b> is {{analysed}} at the moment when pronounced plastic yielding begins. The theory is two-dimensional and an ideal plastic-rigid material is assumed. Following a general analysis of the problem, the magnitude of the constraint factor is calculated for a deep notch with a semi-circular root. The correct approach to problems of plane plastic strain is discussed, and is further illustrated by a re-examination of the classical work of Frandtl on indentation (which is closely related in principle with the <b>notched</b> <b>bar</b> problem). 1. General considerations THE paper is concerned with the {{state of stress}} in the core of a <b>notched</b> <b>bar</b> under an applied load sufficient to cause plastic flow. It is known that the fairly well-defined bend in the load-extension relation for a <b>notched</b> <b>bar</b> corresponds to a mean stress in the core that is greater than the yield stress in a tensile test of an unnotched specimen. The " investiga-tion will be directed particularly to a calculation of the magnitude of this effect in relation to the shape of the notch. The problem will be treated as one of plane strain, so that the specimen is a wide rectangular block, symmetrically notched through the thickness on two sides. The notch is shown in Fig. 1, the plane of the paper representing a plane of flow. Let it be supposed that the applied load at the ends of the specimen is statically equivalent to a tension along the central longitudinal axis. It is also supposed that a distribution of stress, suitable to ensure plane strain, is applied to the two lateral surfaces of the block which are parallel to the planes of flow. The specimen is assumed so long that the state of stress in the neighbourhood of the notch is, to any desired approximation, independent of the precise distribution of the end load. It is further assumed that the notch is of sufficient depth to ensure that the plastic region is localized in and around the core (this will be discussed more carefully later). If the curvature of the notch is greatest at the root, the yield limit is first attained at that point. As the applied end-load is further increased, the plastic region can be expected to spread in thn manner shown i...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} two {{specific}} subjects {{related to the}} fatigue strength and life of <b>notched</b> <b>bars</b> under combined torsional and axial loading. The first subject is the fatigue thresholds of materials with small defects. The fatigue threshold of materials with small defects or sharp notches is not controlled by the initiation of fatigue cracks, but by their propagation. The R-curve method is very useful to predict the fatigue thresholds of notched components. Small cracks nucleated at the notch root becomes nonpropagating when the applied stress intensity factor drops below {{the resistance of the}} material. It is important that the R curve is independent of loading conditions and only the applied stress intensity factor depends on loading conditions. In the present paper, the R-curve method was successfully applied to predict the fatigue thresholds of holed tubes made of carbon steels under in-phase and outof-phase combinations of cyclic torsion and axial loading. The second subject is an anomalous phenomenon of notch strengthening found in torsional fatigue of circumferentially <b>notched</b> round <b>bars</b> of austenitic stainless steel. In torsional fatigue of circumferentially <b>notched</b> <b>bars</b> of austenitic stainless steel, the fatigue life of <b>notched</b> <b>bars</b> was found to be longer than that of smooth bars and to increase with increasing stress concentration under the same amplitude of the nominal torsional stress. On the basis of the electrical potential monitoring of the initiation and propagation of small cracks at the notch root, the crack initiation life decreased with increasing stress concentration, while the crack propagation life increased. The anomalous behavior of the notch-strengthening effect was ascribed to the larger retardation of fatigue crack propagation by crack surface contact for the cases of sharper notches. The superposition of static tension reduced the retardation due to the smaller amount of crack surface contact, which gave rise well-known notch-weakening of the fatigue strength. The crack initiation life is controlled not by the peak strain amplitude at the notch root, but by the strain amplitude about 0. 1 mm distant from the notch root where the strain distribution was calculated by the elasticplastic finite element method using cyclic stress-strain relation. The propagation rate of cracks can be predicted using the J-integral range when the static tension is superposed on cyclic torsion. The shielding by crack face sliding contact greatly reduced the crack propagation rate under cyclic torsion without static tension...|$|R

It was observed that, the tensile strength and Young's modulus of the composites increased with increased fibre content. The flexural strength did not increase with fibre reinforcement, however, the flexural modulus of the composites increased significantly. <b>Impact</b> <b>strength</b> of the composites increased up to 20 wt. % fibre loading, however, further increased fibre loading caused a reduction of <b>impact</b> <b>strength.</b> KIc and GIc values decreased with increased fibre content...|$|R
