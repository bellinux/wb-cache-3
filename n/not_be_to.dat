5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A solution to this problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as it is in a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk. Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> easy to build.|$|E
5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E

25|$|The {{court has}} a {{discretion}} regarding the above.

25|$|A similar rite {{of sexual}} {{exhaustion}} described by Crowley leads not to spiritual communing but {{a sort of}} vampirism.

25|$|Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka {{announced}} on 16 May 2017 that ČSSD {{would most likely}} nominate its own candidate for the election instead of supporting Zeman, due to his actions during the government crisis in May 2017. Zeman's spokesman Jiří Ovčáček responded {{that this was not}} a surprise because Sobotka had always been lobbying to prevent Zeman's re-election. According to some ČSSD sources, the purpose of fielding a ČSSD candidate would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> win the election but to weaken Zeman. Some political scientists speculated that Zeman's actions during the crisis may discourage voters from voting him and damage his chances for reelection. On 25 May 2017, Sobotka mentioned Minister of Foreign Affairs Lubomír Zaorálek and Senate Speaker Milan Štěch as possible candidates. Sobotka added that ČSSD may decide on a candidate in Summer 2017. Opinion polls conducted after the crisis by Median indicated that Zeman's ratings had dropped by 2%. The same poll also showed Drahoš as Zeman's main rival.|$|E

500|$|Although {{generally}} well-received, the manga {{has also}} attracted some criticism. Eduardo M. Chavez, of Mania.com, recalls being initially {{put off by}} the title, which for him conjured images of battles more physical than emotional. After glancing through the first volume, he was surprised to find his assumption wrong, and concluded that it was appropriately named. While he gives a largely positive review, Chavez finds the series' artwork [...] "simple" [...] and unimpressive. He notes that the first volume becomes slightly repetitive, so praises the way that Kobayashi introduces new themes to the second, bringing variety to the setting. Remarking on Kobayashi's ability to draw on numerous influences, Chavez applauds the manga artist for finding fresh ways of using old themes, preventing School Rumble from becoming derivative. He reserves his highest praise for the [...] "flat" [...] chapters dealing with Yakumo. In the next two volumes Chavez approves of the mixture of comedy and romance and the way the characters [...] "grow up", although acknowledging that while the manga's style suits his personal preferences it will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> everyone's taste.

Reviewing the re-release, Jayson Napolitano of Original Sound Version called it [...] "one of the most experimental and disturbing soundtracks I've heard in a while". He praised the soundtrack despite not finding it memorable, and commented that he found it more appealing when he knew some of the plot details that were censored in the game's western release.|$|E

If the eyelids are accidentally bonded closed, release eyelashes with warm water by covering with a wet pad. The adhesive will bond to eye protein and will cause periods of weeping which will help to de bond the adhesive. Keep the eye covered until debonding is complete- usually within 1 to 3 days. Do not force the eye open. 2 • 	 The topical skin adhesive <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> wounds subject to high skin tension, or on areas of increased skin tension such as the elbows, knees, or knuckles.
