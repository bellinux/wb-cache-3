He once explained his stance towards God and religion as [...] "I do not break coconuts for Pillaiyar, (a form of worship) <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> break his idols".(Nan Thengayum udaipathillai; Pillaiyarum Udaipathillai) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I have {{no desire}} to analyze what makes Buechner's writing and preaching so extraordinary. <b>Neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> want to account for Bob Dylan's raspy mystique, the {{peculiar}} beauty of a rainbow trout in a riffle, or a thunderstorm's magnetic terror. I simply want to enjoy them. They all knock me out of analysis and smack me clear into pleasure and awe." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Eusebius of Caesarea (in his Ecclesiastical History, {{composed}} {{in the early}} 300s), Papias (circa AD 110) refers to a story of Jesus and a woman [...] "accused of many sins" [...] as being found in the Gospel of the Hebrews, which might refer to this passage or to one like it. In the Syriac Didascalia Apostolorum, {{composed in}} the mid-200s, the author, {{in the course of}} instructing bishops to exercise a measure of clemency, states that a bishop who does not receive a repentant person would be doing wrong – [...] "for you do not obey our Savior and our God, to do as He also did with her that had sinned, whom the elders set before Him, and leaving the judgment in His hands, departed. [...] But He, the searcher of hearts, asked her and said to her, 'Have the elders condemned thee, my daughter?' She said to Him, 'No, Lord.' [...] And He said unto her, 'Go your way; <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> condemn thee.' In Him therefore, our Savior and King and God, be your pattern, O bishops." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What I {{mean to say}} is, <b>I</b> didn't toil, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> spin. Ah, {{them was}} happy days! Lying on me back, plenty of tobacco, {{something}} cool in a jug--' ...|$|R
60|$|So, when I {{departed}} from them, the Book of Statute was brought, {{but what they}} said of it I know nothing at all, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> hear any more from them.|$|R

2500|$|... "A boy of {{the name}} Ellis – William Webb Ellis – a town boy and a foundationer, ... whilst playing Bigside at {{football}} in that half-year , caught the ball in his arms. This being so, according to the then rules, {{he ought to have}} retired back as far as he pleased, without parting with the ball, for the combatants on the opposite side could only advance to the spot where he had caught the ball, and were unable to rush forward till he had either punted it or had placed it for some one else to kick, for it was by means of these placed kicks that most of the goals were in those days kicked, but the moment the ball touched the ground the opposite side might rush on. Ellis, for the first time, disregarded this rule, and on catching the ball, instead of retiring backwards, rushed forwards with the ball in his hands towards the opposite goal, with what result as to the game I know not, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> know how this infringement of a well-known rule was followed up, or when it became, as it is now, a standing rule." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY CHESHIRE. I do not. <b>Neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> {{think she}} has been trapped. I think nothing. I {{understand}} nothing.|$|E
60|$|<b>Neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> {{find any}} murmuring {{on some other}} points of greater importance, where this {{favourite}} maxim is not so strictly observed.|$|E
6000|$|FRANK. <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> You are {{my first}} playmate. [He catches {{her hand to}} kiss it, but checks himself to look around first. Very unexpectedly, he sees Crofts {{emerging}} from the box hedge]. Oh damn! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No more <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> {{ever see}} Punch again till to-day, but I {{know for certain}} that my young lady never sold no dog wotsomedever to no low feller as ever walked in shoe leather or out of it!" ...|$|R
60|$|No one {{appeared}} {{to give any}} attention to me however, and then I listened for a proclamation by the town crier; but none met my ears, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> see printed notices of any kind referring to Archie.|$|R
6000|$|... "These are new notions," [...] {{said the}} old gentlewoman, shaking her head. [...] "I shall never {{understand}} them; <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> wish it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the Lady Elaine said: [...] "Messire, it was I {{who gave}} my sleeve to him, yet <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> {{know who he}} is nor whence he came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Assuredly not," [...] she replied, [...] "since to do {{so would}} be to insult you. But <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> suppose that you really meant to offer me that place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so? Well, she <b>did</b> not, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> Indeed, {{she pointed out}} that this was her trouble. Among the great of the earth she knew no such man, and, if she sought lower, then would come jealousies and war." ...|$|R
60|$|The man evidently did {{not know}} what to say, and as a matter of fact, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> I had told him some plain truths, and now I was anxious to get away from him and think out my future course of action.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> It's funny {{we should}} both sail under sealed orders {{from a man}} we don't know. He seemed an uppish old bird. His {{brothers}} of science don't seem too fond of him, either. How came you to {{take an interest in}} the affair?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I know not, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> care: {{but it must}} be {{a strange}} road, if I do not find it out before I have eaten up the monster’s carcase.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{the duke}} she did. You know {{she never did}} like the duke; and for the matter of that, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I.</b> I tell you that fairly, Master Mark!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I do {{not believe}} Dunwoodie would sell his command as Arnold wished to do; <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> think him exactly {{trustworthy}} in a delicate business like this of yours." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, indeed, was I in {{a pretty}} fix, for <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> know which avenue to follow nor when danger lay {{directly}} in my path; {{but there was nothing}} else to be done than follow one of the corridors, for I could gain nothing by remaining where I was.|$|R
60|$|<b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> what <b>I</b> {{know some}} <b>did,</b> keep the spirits {{high and hot}} with cordials and wine, and such things, and which, as I observed, one learned {{physician}} used himself so much to, as {{that he could not}} leave them off when the infection was quite gone, and so became a sot for all his life after.|$|R
6000|$|... "My Lord King," [...] cried De Montfort, {{flushing}} with anger, [...] "I called not {{upon this}} fellow, nor <b>did</b> <b>I</b> {{know he was}} within two hundred miles of Lewes until I saw him ride into {{the midst of the}} conflict that day. <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> know, until I heard his battle cry, whether he would fall upon baron or royalist." ...|$|R
60|$|You say General Geary's scouts {{report that}} they find no enemy {{this side of the}} Blue Ridge. <b>Neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I.</b> Have they been to the Blue Ridge looking for them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I really don't know," [...] Geoffrey replied. [...] "Having no time {{to waste}} in conversation, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> care. If you have {{anything}} to say to me you can say it--very briefly--here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I.</b> I {{dreamed about}} rowing, but I can't, {{for the life}} of me, {{remember}} where I went. I must have gone a good way, for I blistered my hands with the oars." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> what <b>I</b> {{know some}} did: keep the spirits always {{high and hot}} with cordials and wine and such things; and which, as I observed, one learned {{physician}} used himself so much to as {{that he could not}} leave them off when the infection was quite gone, and so became a sot for all his life after.|$|R
60|$|But I must observe here, that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not enter}} {{immediately}} into all this confidence with him neither, nor all at once; <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> let him into {{any part of}} it, but under the same solemn engagements of secrecy that he had laid upon us, nor till I was come above eighty leagues south from Lima.|$|R
60|$|The fatuousness of {{all this}} made me stare. If the man had not been somehow a {{sympathetic}} personality I would have resented it like an insult. As it was, I felt only sorry for him. Something remarkably earnest in his gaze prevented me from laughing in his face. <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> yawn at him. I just stared.|$|R
6000|$|... "'And after all, is {{it worth}} it?' I went on. 'What does life mean that it should make you sweat? What {{justification}} do you find in sweat? Now look at me. I toil not, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> spin--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wall, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I,</b> privately speakin'. I was goin' ter say," [...] went on {{the ranch}} owner slowly, [...] "when the cap'n got the letters he walked over there to the old place and tore 'em open. Maybe----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} been beyond the sight of land, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> care {{to work in a}} shop; but I have {{business}} which admits of no delay, and if you will give me the information I shall be very grateful." ...|$|E
40|$|Recently I set {{myself the}} task of {{learning}} the French language. I knew the undertaking would be fraught with frustration. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know it would provide me with insights into the demands made upon the child who is learning to read and write. <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> know it would so soundly reaffirm my belief in the whole language approach to literacy instruction...|$|R
60|$|I {{opened my}} eyes upon a strange and weird landscape. I knew that I was on Mars; not once <b>did</b> <b>I</b> {{question}} either my sanity or my wakefulness. I was not asleep, no need for pinching here; my inner consciousness told me as plainly that I was upon Mars as your conscious mind tells {{you that you are}} upon Earth. You do not question the fact; <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't much {{matter who}} it was," [...] replied the doctor. And I {{could see that}} neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I,</b> to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the {{situation}} of the island.|$|R
