50|$|Also in 1566, {{a letter}} on vestments from Bullinger to Humphrey and Sampson dated May 1 {{of that year}} (in {{response}} to questions they had posed to him) was published. It was taken as a decisive defence of conformity since it matched {{the position of the}} Marian exiles who had accepted bishoprics while hoping for future reforms. Bullinger was incensed by the publication and effect of his letter. It elicited a further nonconformist response in The judgement of the Reverend Father Master Henry Bullinger, Pastor of the church of Zurick, in certeyne matters of religion, beinge in controversy in many countreys, even where as the Gospel is taught. Based on Bullinger's Decades, this tract tried to muster support for nonconformity on vestments from five points not directly related to but underlying that issue: 1) the corrupt nature of traditions and the primacy of scripture, 2) the equality of clergy, 3) the <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>power</b> of the bishops to ordain ministers, 4) the limited scope of the authority of civil magistrates, and 5) the sole headship of Christ in the church - a re-emphasis of the second point.|$|E
40|$|It is {{reviewed}} whether cooling flows could fuel central radio {{sources in}} spheroidal galaxies as a general, universal mechanism. The radio luminosity functions of S 0, E, gE and cD galaxies show a similar scaled dependence on Lopt, demanding a <b>non-exclusive</b> radio <b>powering</b> mechanism for cD's. If cooling flows generate the central radio sources in these objects, then a non-exclusive X-ray halo formation process should occur. Gravitational accretion of {{gas from the}} intergalactic medium is identified as such a mechanism for both E+S 0 's and cD's. From studying a sample of 110 objects the author finds strong evidence for gravitationally driven cooling flows fuelling central radio sources in spheroidal galaxies...|$|R
