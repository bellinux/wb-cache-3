5|$|A <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometer</b> {{on board}} the Lunar Prospector {{spacecraft}} detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor, and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E
5|$|In years since, {{signatures}} of water {{have been found}} to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters. In 1998, the <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometer</b> on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.|$|E
25|$|A {{graduate}} of City College of New York and Columbia University, Havens worked with James Rainwater {{on the construction}} of a <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> which became the subject of his doctoral thesis.

Knowledge of the elemental composition is desirable in identifying resources and for geochemical studies and can be obtained using gamma ray and <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> Measurements with gamma ray and <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometers</b> complement each other in determining elemental abundances in a planet's surface. Various aspects of the instruments are discussed...|$|R

25|$|In 2001, NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter {{arrived at}} Mars. Its {{mission is to}} use spectrometers and imagers to hunt for {{evidence}} of past or present water and volcanic activity on Mars. In 2002, {{it was announced that}} the probe's gamma ray spectrometer and <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometer</b> had detected large amounts of hydrogen, indicating that there are vast deposits of water ice in the upper three meters of Mars' soil within 60° latitude of the south pole.|$|E

Orbital Sciences Corporation provided the spacecraft, which constituted the company's first interplanetary mission.

25|$|M3 {{detected}} absorption features near 2.8–3.0µm on {{the surface}} of the Moon. For silicate bodies, such features are typically attributed to hydroxyl- and/or water-bearing materials. On the Moon, the feature is seen as a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters. The general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit M3 data with <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometer</b> H abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of OH and H2O is an ongoing surficial process. OH/H2O production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration.|$|E

25|$|Lunar Prospector was {{the third}} mission {{selected}} by NASA for full development and construction {{as part of the}} Discovery Program. At a cost of $62.8 million, the 19-month mission was put into a low polar orbit of the Moon, accomplishing mapping of surface composition and possible polar ice deposits, measurements of magnetic and gravity fields, and study of lunar outgassing events. Based on Lunar Prospector <b>Neutron</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (NS) data, mission scientists have determined that there is indeed water ice in the polar craters of the Moon. The mission ended July 31, 1999 when the orbiter was guided to an impact into a crater near the lunar south pole in an (unsuccessful) attempt to analyze lunar polar water by vaporizing it to allow spectroscopic characterization from Earth telescopes.|$|E
500|$|Fermi's reactor group {{moved to}} the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in 1942. Rainwater {{remained}} at Columbia, where he joined the Manhattan Project's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The Manhattan Project was the Allied effort during World War II to develop atomic bombs. The SAM Laboratories' [...] primary task was the development of gaseous diffusion technology for uranium enrichment, to produce fissile uranium-235 for use in atomic bombs. Rainwater worked with William W. Havens, Jr. and Chien-Shiung Wu, mostly on studies of neutron cross sections, using the <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> After the war, a dozen papers by Dunning, Havens, Rainwater and Wu would be declassified and published. So too was his thesis, published in the Physical Review in two parts with Havens's thesis, and he was awarded his doctorate in 1946. In 1963 {{he was awarded the}} United States Atomic Energy Commission's Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, for his work on the Manhattan Project.|$|E
500|$|Rainwater then {{chose to}} {{undertake}} postgraduate studies at Columbia University. At {{the time this}} was an unusual move for a scholar from California, as Columbia was not then renowned for its physics; but this had recently changed. George B. Pegram had recently built up the physics department, and hired scientists like Enrico Fermi. At Columbia Rainwater studied under Isidor Isaac Rabi, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller and John R. Dunning. Fermi was engaged in neutron moderator studies {{that would lead to}} the construction of the first nuclear reactor, while Dunning and Eugene T. Booth had built Columbia's first cyclotron, {{in the basement of the}} Pupin Physics Laboratories. Rainwater received his Master of Arts in 1941. For his Doctor of Philosophy thesis on [...] "Neutron beam spectrometer studies of boron, cadmium, and the energy distribution from paraffin", written under Dunning's supervision, he built a <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometer</b> and developed techniques for its use. Rainwater married Emma Louise Smith in March 1942. They had three sons, James, Robert and William and a daughter, Elizabeth Ann, who died from leukaemia when she was nine.|$|E

2500|$|In 1939, Havens entered Columbia University, {{where he}} studied physics, taking classes on {{mechanics}} with George B. Pegram, atomic physics with Isidor Isaac Rabi and electromagnetism with Shirley L. Quimby. He was awarded his Master of Arts degree in 1941. He then began working on his doctorate {{under the supervision of}} John R. Dunning. Fellow graduate students in physics at the time included James Rainwater, Herbert L. Anderson and George Weil. He worked with Rainwater on the construction of a <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> His thesis, on [...] "Slow neutron cross sections of indium, gold, silver, antimony, lithium and mercury as measured with a neutron beam spectrometer", was classified.|$|E
2500|$|Fermi's reactor {{group also}} left Columbia, as Arthur Compton {{consolidated}} the Manhattan Project's reactor {{project at the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. Those that remained at Columbia became the Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories, {{under the direction of}} Harold Urey, which was mainly concerned with isotope separation for uranium enrichment. Havens and Rainwater also devised a means of measuring residual hydrogen in fluorocarbons, a subject of great interest because uranium hexafluoride gas was being considered for use in isotope separation processes. [...] Havens, Rainwater and Chien-Shiung Wu worked on the development of radiation detector instrumentation, and studies of neutron cross sections using the <b>neutron</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> This included work with plutonium. After the war ended in August 1945, a dozen papers by Dunning, Havens, Rainwater and Wu would be declassified and published.
