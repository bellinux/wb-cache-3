Moreover, persons who are <b>not</b> <b>US</b> residents and are <b>not</b> <b>US</b> persons and do not share accounts with US persons still must self-certify said status when opening a bank account outside the US at any FFI. According to the FATCA IGA, if such a person does not self-certify said status, that person cannot open a bank account at that institution. Canada and United Kingdom have interpreted the IGAs differently and believe that non-US persons who fail to self-certify shall not be refused a bank account. However, non-cooperating non-US persons shall be FATCA reported {{in the same way}} as those persons who have US indicia.|$|E

Some enemy aliens were held without trial during the entire war. The U.S. citizens accused of supporting Germany were given public trials, and often were freed.|$|E

25|$|Montgomery County, {{north of}} Houston, is a Republican stronghold, {{supported}} by voters in affluent communities on Lake Conroe and in The Woodlands. Rural {{residents of the}} county, though primarily lower- and middle-class, {{tend to be very}} socially conservative and also have a substantial Republican following. However, the city of Conroe proper, the county seat, tends to lean Democratic. Although The Woodlands is home to many corporate transplants from Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia, who tend to be of a more liberal persuasion, most of these people are <b>not</b> <b>U.S.</b> citizens, thus have little impact on the voting trends of the county.|$|E
