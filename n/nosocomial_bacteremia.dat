40|$|AIM: To {{calculate}} the incremental cost of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> {{caused by the}} most common organisms, classified by their antimicrobial susceptibility. METHODS: We selected patients who developed <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These microorganisms were analyzed because of their high prevalence and they frequently present multidrug resistance. A control group consisted of patients classified within the same all-patient refined-diagnosis related group without bacteremia. Our hospital has an established cost accounting system (full-costing) that uses activity-based criteria to analyze cost distribution. A logistic regression model was fitted to estimate the probability of developing bacteremia for each admission (propensity score) and was used for propensity score matching adjustment. Subsequently, the propensity score was included in an econometric model to adjust the incremental cost of patients who developed bacteremia, as well as differences in this cost, {{depending on whether the}} microorganism was multidrug-resistant or multidrug-sensitive. RESULTS: A total of 571 admissions with bacteremia matched the inclusion criteria and 82, 022 were included in the control group. The mean cost was € 25, 891 for admissions with bacteremia and € 6, 750 for those without bacteremia. The mean incremental cost was estimated at € 15, 151 (CI, € 11, 570 to € 18, 733). Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa bacteremia had the highest mean incremental cost, € 44, 709 (CI, € 34, 559 to € 54, 859). Antimicrobial-susceptible E. coli <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> had the lowest mean incremental cost, € 10, 481 (CI, € 8, 752 to € 12, 210). Despite their lower cost, episodes of antimicrobial-susceptible E. coli <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> had a major impact due to their high frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Adjustment of hospital cost according to the organism causing bacteremia and antibiotic sensitivity could improve prevention strategies and allow their prioritization according to their overall impact and costs.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAcinetobacter baumannii is {{considered}} {{a leading cause of}} nosocomial bloodstream infections in intensive care units (ICUs), but there is disagreement as to whether certain invasive ICU procedures increase the risk of this infection. To help address this question, we performed a systematic review of the literature on whether previous catheterization (central venous, arterial, and urinary), mechanical ventilation, nasogastric tube use, and abdominal or thoracic drainage are associated with the development of A. baumannii <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> in ICUs. MethodsTwo reviewers searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline for the period January 1999 to February 2013. For each of seven invasive procedures, patients in the included studies were classified into two groups: those who had previously undergone that procedure and those who had not. The frequencies of A. baumannii <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> were determined for each group. ResultsFive studies were included in the meta-analysis: three provided data for thoracic drainage, four for abdominal drainage, and five for the other invasive procedures. The following prior interventions were associated with an elevated risk of A. baumannii nosocomial bacteremia: mechanical ventilation (odds ratio (OR) 4. 79, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 09 – 7. 43), central venous catheterization (OR 6. 25, 95 % CI 2. 58 – 15. 11), urinary catheterization (OR 2. 55, 95 % CI 1. 49 – 4. 36), and nasogastric tube use (OR 4. 70, 95 % CI 2. 79 – 7. 91).

A total of 377 patients with K. pneumoniae bacteremia (191 community-acquired and 186 nosocomial) were retrospectively analyzed. Neoplastic diseases (hematologic malignancy and solid tumor, 56 %) were the most commonly associated conditions in patients with <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia,</b> whereas chronic liver disease (35 %) and diabetes mellitus (20 %) were the most commonly associated conditions in patients with community-acquired bacteremia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the trend in}} incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia, underlying conditions of patients, mortality rate, and factors associated with poor outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical charts of 189 consecutive episodes of P aeruginosa bacteremia, detected between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1994, were prospectively evaluated. Associated risk factors, treatment, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia represented 5. 7 % {{of the total number}} of bacteremias, 6. 9 % of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremias,</b> and 23. 6 % of <b>nosocomial</b> gram-negative <b>bacteremias.</b> There were 1. 5 episodes per 1000 discharges. These numbers were slightly lower than those recorded at our hospital 10 years earlier. Human immunodeficiency virus infection was the most frequent underlying disease (28 / 189 [15 %]). Overall mortality was 18 % (34 / 189). The presence of fatal underlying disease (P <. 001), surgery (P =. 001), pneumonia (P =. 02), and severe sepsis (P <. 001) were associated with poor prognosis, the mortality of the patients with these variables being 28 %, 28 %, 47 %, and 62 %, respectively. The presence of inappropriate definitive antimicrobial treatment became an independent factor predictive of death (P =. 04) only when the subset of patients with intravenous catheter-associated bacteremia was excluded from the analysis. The survival rate was no greater in patients who received 2 or more antibiotics active in vitro against P aeruginosa than in those who received only 1. Neutropenia was not associated with increased mortality. The use of colony-stimulating factors did not affect the outcome of the neutropenic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of P aeruginosa bacteremia is falling slightly at our hospital. The emergence of the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic has had a considerable impact on both epidemiology and mortality. The presence of severe underlying disease, surgery, pneumonia, and, especially, severe sepsis are associated with a poor outcome. With the exclusion of patients with intravenous catheter-associated P aeruginosa bacteremia, the administration of an appropriate antimicrobial therapy is essential to a good outcome.

This study provides epidemiological and antimicrobial susceptibility data for <b>nosocomial</b> Gram-negative <b>bacteremia</b> in a general intensive care unit (ICU) over a five-year period. MethodsPositive blood cultures from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2003 were reviewed for microbial etiology and susceptibilities. Patient charts were reviewed to determine the source of infection and outcome. ResultsForty-five <b>nosocomial</b> Gram-negative <b>bacteremias</b> occurred in 44 patients. Infection rates of 6. 9 / 1000 admissions and 11. 3 / 10000 patient days remained stable. Admitting diagnoses included respiratory failure, solid organ transplant, post-surgery, and multi-trauma. Seven bacterial species were identified; Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp were most common. Sources of bacteremia included pneumonia (48. 9 %), and central venous catheterization (22. 2 %). Antimicrobial susceptibilities were highest for imipenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidime, and piperacillin–tazobactam. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was inferior to imipenem, gentamicin, and tobramycin (p< 0. 05). Mortality rates were 53. 3 % in the ICU, and 60 % for overall hospitalization. Average length of ICU stay was 50. 5 days compared to 6. 13 days for all-comers.

Materials and methodsWe reviewed retrospectively the medical records of patients (under the age of 18 years) having Enterobacter bacteremia who were treated at Taipei the Veterans General Hospital from January 2001 to June 2011. ResultsIn total, 853 positive blood cultures were obtained from 620 patients during the study period. Among them, 96 episodes of Enterobacter bacteremia were found in 83 patients, accounting for 11. 3 % of all bacteremia. Eighty-two cases (98. 8 %) were nosocomial infections. Most of the cases were neonates (62 cases, 74. 7 %) and premature infants (51 cases, 61. 5 %). The common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory tract (53. 0 %), followed by intravascular catheter (10. 8 %), multiple sources (10. 8 %), and the gastrointestinal tract (8. 4 %). The overall case fatality rate was 18. 1 %, with the highest rate being reported among premature infants. The factors responsible for the deaths were leukocytosis and a higher median number of underlying diseases.

Objective: To determine whether microbiology laboratories should report {{the presence of}} ESBLs and to establish the infection-control implications of ESBL-producing organisms. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: 12 hospitals in South Africa, Taiwan, Australia, Argentina, the United States, Belgium, and Turkey. Patients: 440 patients with 455 consecutive episodes of K. pneumoniae bacteremia between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1997; of these, 253 episodes were nosocomially acquired. Measurements: The K. pneumoniae isolates were examined {{for the presence of}} ESBLs. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the molecular epidemiology of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Results: Overall, 30. 8 % (78 of 253) episodes of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> and 43. 5 % (30 of 69) episodes acquired in intensive care units were due to ESBL-producing organisms. After adjustment for potentially confounding variables, previous administration of ß-lactam antibiotics containing an oxyimino group (cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or aztreonam) was associated with bacteremia due to ESBL-producing strains (risk ratio, 3. 9 [95 % CI, 1. 1 to 13. 8]). In 7 of 10 hospitals with more than 1 ESBL-producing isolate, multiple strains with the same genotypic pattern were observed, indicating patient-to-patient spread of the organism.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> is {{associated}} with a poor prognosis. Early adequate therapy has been shown to improve outcome. Consequently, rapid detection of a beginning sepsis is therefore of the utmost importance. This historical cohort study was designed to evaluate if different patterns can be observed in either C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WCC) between Gram positive bacteremia (GPB) vs. Gram negative bacteremia (GNB), and to assess the potential benefit of serial measurements of both biomarkers in terms of early antimicrobial therapy initiation. Methods A historical study (2003 – 2004) was conducted, including all adult intensive care unit patients with a <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia.</b> CRP and WCC count measurements were recorded daily from two days prior (d - 2) until one day after onset of bacteremia (d + 1). Delta (Δ) CRP and Δ WCC levels from the level at d - 2 onward were calculated. Results CRP levels and WCC counts were substantially higher in patients with GNB. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that GNB and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score were independently associated with a CRP increase of 5 mg/dL from d - 2 to d + 1, and both were also independently associated with an increase of WCC levels from d - 2 to d + 1 of 5, 000 × 10 3 cells/mm 3. Conclusion Increased levels of CRP and WCC are suggestive for GNB, while almost unchanged CRP and WCC levels are observed in patients with GPB. However, despite the different patterns observed, antimicrobial treatment as such cannot be guided based on both biomarkers. </p...|$|E

This study was undertaken to describe the bacterial pathogens causing bacteremia in adult Thai HIV-infected patients, and hence to give guidance {{in the choice of}} empirical antimicrobials. MethodsBlood culture results at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen during the period January 1996 to December 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsIn HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients, 172 and 4082 episodes of bacteremia occurred, respectively. In HIV-infected patients, community-acquired and <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> were found in 78. 5 % and 21. 5 %, respectively and most were monomicrobial. Gram-negative bacteria were the main pathogens isolated in both groups of bacteremia. Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were more common pathogens causing <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> in HIV-infected patients, whereas Acinetobacter spp were more common in HIV-uninfected patients. Salmonella spp, especially Salmonella groups D and B, were the most common (62. 2 %) pathogen in community-acquired bacteremia in HIV-infected patients whereas Escherichia coli was the most common in HIV-uninfected patients. Only a few episodes of community-acquired bacteremia in HIV-infected patients had identified sources. Co-trimoxazole resistance was common in community-acquired bacteremia caused by Gram-negative bacilli in HIV-infected patients, with Salmonella group B being more resistant to co-trimoxazole than Salmonella group D (statistically significant, p< 0. 001). However, resistance rates to ceftriaxone and ofloxacin were low.

Recently, however, multidrug-resistant and car-bapenem-resistant P. putida isolates have emerged, causing difficult-to-treat nosoco-mial infections in seriously ill patients. Currently, the outcome of multidrug-resistant or carbapenem-resistant P. putida bacteremia remains uncertain. Here, we report 18 cases of P. putida bacteremia with high rates of carbapenem resistance and mortality. From January 2005 through December 2011, all cases of nosocomial P. putida bacter-emia were identified and analyzed at Chonnam National University Hospital and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital.

40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} {{the relevance of}} nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus, either methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) or methicillinresistant (MRSA), as {{a risk factor for}} the development of <b>nosocomial</b> S aureus <b>bacteremia</b> during an MRSA outbreak. patients and methods: In this prospective cohort study, 488 patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) during a 1 -year period were screened with nasal swabs within 48 hours of admission and weekly thereafter in order to identify nasal S aureus carriage. Nasal staphylococcal carriers were observed until development of S aureus bacteremia, ICU discharge, or death. Results One hundred forty-seven (30. 1 %) of 488 patients were nasal S aureus carriers; 84 patients (17. 2 %) harbored methicillin-sensitive S aureus; and 63 patients (12. 9 %) methicillinresistant S aureus. <b>Nosocomial</b> S aureus <b>bacteremia</b> was diagnosed in 38 (7. 7 %) of 488 patients. Rates of bacteremia were 24 (38 %) of the MRSA carriers, eight (9. 5 %) of the MSSA carriers, and six (1. 7 %) of noncarriers. After adjusting for other predictors of bacteremia by means of a Cox proportional hazard regression model, the relative risk for S aureus bacteremia was 3. 9 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 6 – 9. 8; P = 0. 002) for MRSA carriers compared with MSSA carriers. Conclusions Among ICU patients, nasal carriers of S aureus are at higher risk for S aureus bacteremia than are noncarriers; in the setting of an MRSA outbreak, colonization by methicillin-resistant strains represents a greater risk than does colonization by MSSA and strongly predicts the occurrence of MRSA bacteremia...|$|R
40|$|Clinically {{significant}} {{bloodstream infection}} (BSI) {{continues to be}} a major health problem especially with the growing concern with its changing frequency, epidemiology and microbiology. We conducted a 12 -month prospective, observational study from September 2002 to August 2003 to determine the epidemiologic, clinical and microbiologic profile as well as the outcome of adult patients with bacteremia admitted at St. Luke's Medical Center. All admitted patients aged 18 years old and above with clinically significant bloodstream infection were included. Hospital charts of bacteremic patients were carefully reviewed and data were collected and encoded in a bacteremia surveillance sheet. Statistical analysis was employed to determine significant predictors of outcome. A total of 134 episodes of bacteremia were reported with 69 (51. 1 %) episodes of community-acquired BSI and 66 (48. 9 %) episodes of nosocomial BSI. Majority were secondary bacteremias (56. 3 %), most of which came from the respiratory tract (30. 3 %). There were 42 cases of <b>nosocomial</b> primary <b>bacteremia</b> most of which were related to catheter-related intravascular infection. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of bacteremia by gender. The highest number of bacteremia was seen among patients between 71 - 80 years old at 22. 2 %.

40|$|Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are now {{recognized}} as {{the most common cause}} of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> in pediatric patients. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis was used to study the relationships among 12 isolates of CoNS obtained from eight patients with catheter-related bacteremia in two distinct wards of our hospital and 6 epidemiologically unrelated strains. With this method, we were able to discriminate isolates that otherwise were indistinguishable by conventional criteria such as biochemical typing and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Our results indicate that there were episodes of cross-infections among four patients in one ward but independent infectious episodes among four patients in the other ward. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis is a rapid method which seems particularly well suited to the epidemiological study of CoNS isolates...|$|E
40|$|Ralstonia paucula (formerly CDC group IV c- 2) {{can cause}} serious human infections. Confronted in 1995 with five cases of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia,</b> {{we found that}} pulsed-field gel {{electrophoresis}} could not distinguish between the isolates and that randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis was poorly discriminatory. In this study, we used PCR-ribotyping and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the spacer 16 S- 23 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA); both methods were unable to differentiate R. paucula isolates. Eighteen strains belonging to other Ralstonia species (one R. eutropha strain, six R. pickettii strains, three R. solanacearum strains, and eight R. gilardii strains) were also tested by PCR-ribotyping, which failed {{to distinguish between the}} four species. The 16 S- 23 S rDNA intergenic spacer of R. paucula contains the tRNAIle and tRNAAla genes, which are identical to genes described for R. pickettii and R. solanacearum...|$|E
40|$|Coagulase-negative {{staphylococcus}} (CNS) is {{the most}} frequent cause of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>bacteremia</b> and prosthetic valve endocarditis. CNS bacteremia can be polyclonal. No data exist on the clonality of CNS causing endocarditis. We present a case of CNS aortic homograft endocarditis in which at least five different genotypes of CNS were identified in initial blood-culture isolates by genomic macrorestriction enzyme analysis and pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Since the polyclonality was accompanied by differences in antibiotic susceptibility, this observation may have important consequences {{for the treatment of}} CNS endocarditis. Because of the parallels in the pathogenesis of CNS prosthetic valve endocarditis and CNS infections of a variety of other prosthetic devices, it might also have consequences for CNS prosthetic device infections in general. We suggest that antibiotic susceptibility testing of just one blood-culture isolate may be insufficient. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, motile, spore-forming, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium that {{is widely}} distributed environmentally. While B. cereus is associated mainly with food poisoning, {{it is being}} increasingly reported to be a cause of serious and potentially fatal non-gastrointestinal-tract infections. The pathogenicity of B. cereus, whether intestinal or nonintestinal, is intimately associated with the production of tissue-destructive exoenzymes. Among these secreted toxins are four hemolysins, three distinct phospholipases, an emesis-inducing toxin, and proteases. The major hurdle in evaluating B. cereus when isolated from a clinical specimen is overcoming its stigma as an insignificant contaminant. Outside its notoriety in association with food poisoning and severe eye infections, this bacterium has been incriminated in a multitude of other clinical conditions such as anthrax-like progressive pneumonia, fulminant sepsis, and devastating central nervous system infections, particularly in immunosuppressed individuals, intravenous drug abusers, and neonates. Its role in <b>nosocomial</b> acquired <b>bacteremia</b> and wound infections in postsurgical patients has also been well defined, especially when intravascular devices such as catheters are inserted. Primary cutaneous infections mimicking clostridial gas gangrene induced subsequent to trauma have also been well documented. B. cereus produces a potent β-lactamase conferring marked resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Antimicrobials noted {{to be effective in}} the empirical management of a B. cereus infection while awaiting antimicrobial susceptibility results for the isolate include ciprofloxacin and vancomycin...|$|R

40|$|Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive {{bacterium}} {{with a low}} G_C {{content in}} its genomic DNA. This natural inhabitant of the gastrointestinal mammalian tract is also an opportunist pathogen responsible for urinary tract infections, <b>nosocomial</b> infections, <b>bacteremia</b> and infective endocarditis. E. faecalis normally grows as a commensal organism in the gut, but it possesses very subtle virulence traits that are not easily identified. Besides, its intrinsic physiologic properties such as inherent antibiotic resistance and exceptional ability to adapt to harsh conditions provide this organism with an enormous advantage in the infection processes. Recognizing the medical importance of this bacterium, The Institute for Genomic Research has undertaken the genome sequencing of E. faecalis strain V 583 and based on that, the first genome-scale metabolic model of E. faecalis will be reconstructed. To support the reconstruction, high throughput techniques, generally referred to as omics techniques (genomics, proteomics, fluxomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics) will provide data of different levels to validate, test and sustain the robustness of the model. The different levels of data will comprise genome, metabolite, protein and flux profiles. The first metabolic model generated for this bacterium will allow correlating metabolite levels and fluxes which enables identification of key control points in its metabolism. As it has been previously shown for other organisms, the metabolic network reconstruction {{may serve as a}} valuable tool to predict the phenotypic behaviour under various genetic and environmental conditions...|$|R
