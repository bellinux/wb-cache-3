500|$|In 2007, Whitlam {{testified at}} an inquest into {{the death of}} Brian Peters, one of five Australia-based TV {{personnel}} killed in East Timor in October 1975. Whitlam indicated that he had warned Peters' colleague, Greg Shackleton (who was also killed), that the Australian government could not protect them in East Timor {{and that they should}} <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>there.</b> He also said that Shackleton was [...] "culpable" [...] if he had not passed on Whitlam's warning.|$|E
2500|$|First Man made {{bows and}} arrows for the twins, and they {{traveled}} to the south to hunt. [...] They saw a large black bird on a tree, and tried to hit it with an arrow, but it flew away. [...] When they told Changing Woman this, she said, [...] "That was Raven, and {{he may be a}} spy for , the Monster Bird, who devours our people. [...] Do <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> again." [...] The following day the boys took their bows and headed west. [...] They saw a large black bird with a red head, and tried to kill it, but it flew away. [...] When they told Changing Woman this, she said, [...] "That was Vulture. [...] He may be a spy for , the Monster that Kicks People Down Cliffs. [...] Do <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> again." [...] The next day they boys traveled north, and there they saw a black and white bird with a piercing voice. [...] They tried to shoot it with their arrows, but it flew away. [...] When they told their mother, she said, [...] "That was Magpie. [...] He is a spy for , the Monster Who Kills With His Eyes. [...] If he sees you he will paralyze you with his eyes and peck you to pieces." [...] Changing Woman cried, [...] "Now the monsters know about you, and they will come to kill you. [...] You must stay inside." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another mini-reunion {{happened}} in Saguijo on July 26, 2007. Visitors were startled as the venue's schedule listed [...] "Eraserheads" [...] {{as a performer}} along with Rivermaya and Teeth. Jugs Jugueta of Itchyworms and Kris Gorra-Dancel of Cambio played guitars, Zabala on bass, Marasigan on drums, Jett Pangan of The Dawn on vocals, and producer Robin Rivera played drums when Marasigan sang. They called themselves [...] "Eraser X" [...] during that night. Buendia and Adoro knew about the event but did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> as they had other gigs as well. Pupil was in Hard Rock Cafe Makati, while Adoro had gigs with Markus Highway, although Pupil's bassist Dok Sergio was able to follow and played for Teeth.|$|E

2500|$|The filmmakers' {{decision}} to leave Shelob for the third film meant that Faramir had to become an obstacle for Frodo and Sam. In the book, Faramir (like Aragorn) quickly recognizes the Ring as a danger and a temptation, and does not hesitate long before letting Frodo and Sam go. In the film, Faramir first decides that the Ring shall go to Gondor and his father Denethor, {{as a way to}} prove his worth. In the film, Faramir takes Frodo, Sam and the Ring to the Battle of Osgiliath— they do <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> in the book. Jackson winks to readers with Sam's line, [...] "By all rights we shouldn't even be here, but we are." [...] After seeing how strongly the Ring affects Frodo during the Nazgûl attack, Faramir changes his mind and lets them go. These changes reshape the book's contrast between Faramir and Boromir, who in The Fellowship of the Ring attempted to take the Ring for himself. On the other hand, (which can be seen only in the film's extended version), it is actually their father who wants the Ring and urges Boromir to get it, while Faramir only wants to prove himself to his father. Boyens contends these plot changes were needed to keep the Ring menacing. Wenham commented on the DVD documentaries that he had not read the book prior to reading the script, so the film's version of Faramir was the Faramir he knew. When he later read the book and noticed the major difference, he approached the writers about it, and they explained to him that if he did say [...] "I wouldn't pick that thing up even if it lay by the wayside", it would basically strip the One Ring of all corruptive power.|$|E
