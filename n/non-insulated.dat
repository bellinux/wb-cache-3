30|$|The {{expected}} {{differences in}} muscle temperature notwithstanding, parameters reflecting physical effort and perceived exertion {{were not significantly}} different between PINSUL and PCOOL. Various factors may explain this result: It is possible that the warming effect of the insulation pads was not large enough to cause significant differences in muscle temperature and, consequently no physiologically relevant differences in physical effort were found. Inoue et al. (2016) induced temperature differences of 4  °C within the muscle to produce a significant effect on endurance performance. It is also possible that, even with the <b>non-insulating</b> PCOOL, muscle temperatures did not drop to an extent where performance deficits may be expected (Noakes 2000). While exercise intensities and climatic conditions were deliberately selected to represent typical conditions encountered by recreationally active sportsmen who exercise in a cool environment (study A) or well-trained athletes exercising in a cold environment (study B), lower exercise intensities in combination with colder environmental conditions are expected to result in more drastic decreases in muscle temperature.

40|$|We solve {{exactly the}} {{dielectric}} response of a <b>non-insulating</b> sphere of radius a suspended in symmetric, univalent electrolyte solution, with ideally-polarizable interface but without significant ζ-potential. We then use this solution to derive the dielectric response of a dilute random suspension of such spheres, with volume fraction f≪ 1, within the Maxwell-Garnett Effective Medium Approximation. Surprisingly, we discover a huge dielectric enhancement in this bare essential model of dielectric responses of solids in electrolyte solution: at low frequency ωτ_D ≪ (λ/a) / (σ_w / σ_s+ 1 / 2), the real {{part of the}} effective dielectric constant of the mixture is 1 -(3 f/ 2) +(9 f/ 4) (a/λ). Here σ_w/s is the conductivity of the electrolyte solution/solids, λ is the Debye screening length in the solution, τ_D=λ^ 2 /D is the standard time scale of diffusion and D is the ion diffusion coefficient. As λ is of the order nm even for dilute electrolyte solution, even for sub-mm spheres and low volume fraction f= 0. 05 the huge geometric factor a/λ implies an over 10 ^ 4 -fold enhancement. Furthermore, we show that this enhancement produces a significant low frequency (ωτ_D≪ 1) phase shift tanθ = Re ϵ(ω) / Im ϵ(ω) in a simple impedance measurement of the mixture, which is usually negligible in pure electrolyte solution. The phase shift has a scale-invariant maximum tanθ_max=(9 / 4) f/(2 σ_w/σ_s+ 1) at ω_max=(2 D/λ a) /(2 σ_w/σ_s+ 1).

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{experiments}} showing over 10 ^ 4 -fold increase in induced polarization from electrochemically inert, conducting materials in dilute saline solutions, we theoretically demonstrate a new mechanism for dielectric enhancement, {{in the absence}} of ζ-potentials at interfaces between <b>non-insulating</b> particles and an electrolyte solution. We further show that the magnitude of such enhancement obeys universal scaling laws, independent of the particle's electrical properties and valid across particle shapes: for a dilute suspension of identical, but arbitrarily shaped particles of a linear dimension a and volume fraction f, as ω→ 0 the effective real dielectric constant of the mixture is enhanced from that of water by a factor 1 +f (P_r+(a/λ) P_i), and the frequency-dependent phase shift of its impedance has a scale-invariant maximum f Θ if particles are much more conductive than the solution. Here λ is the solution's Debye length and P_r, P_i, Θ are dimensionless numbers determined solely by the particles' shape. Even for a very dilute electrolyte solution (e. g. 10 ^- 3 molar), sub-mm sized particles, at volume fraction f= 0. 1, can give a 10 ^ 4 -fold dielectric enhancement, producing an easily observable phase shift maximum in a simple impedance measurement. We also derive frequency cutoffs as conditions for observing these enhancements, showing that insulating particles produce no enhancement without ζ-potential. To prove these results for particles of arbitrary shapes, we develop a physical picture where an externally induced double layer (EIDL), in contrast to the Guoy-Chapman double layer on interfaces with significant ζ-potentials, dominates the low-frequency dynamics and produces dielectric enhancement.

With the thickness decreasing from 30 to 10  nm, the Fermi level moves 8  meV far from the Dirac point and the bulk valence band. According to the band structures of Bi 2 Te 3 [6], it is testified that the Fermi level of our exfoliated Bi 2 Te 3 ultrathin films shifts into the bulk gap, and the electrical transport properties are dominated by topological surface states for the Bi 2 Te 3 films with very small thickness. Balandin et al. have explored the thickness dependence for the resistance and thermoelectric efficiency of the exfoliated Bi 2 Se 3 and Bi 2 Te 3 films [34, 35], {{and it is also}} revealed that the surface transport through the topological surface states will play more and more predominant roles with the film thickness decreased.

Confined aquifer flow {{is assumed to}} occur without fluid leakage from the confining units. However, since confining units are typically clayey, and hence more electrically conductive than the aquifer, they are treated as <b>non-insulating</b> in our three-layer conceptual model. We develop a semi-analytical solution for the transient streaming potentials response of the aquifer and the confining units to pumping of the aquifer. The solution is fitted to field measurements of streaming potentials associated with an aquifer test performed at a site located near Montalto Uffugo, {{in the region of}} Calabria in Southern Italy. This yields an average hydraulic conductivity that compares well to the estimate obtained using only hydraulic head data. Specific storage is estimated with greater estimation uncertainty than hydraulic conductivity and is significantly smaller than that estimated from hydraulic head data. This indicates that specific storage may be a more difficult parameter to estimate from streaming potential data. The mismatch may also be {{due to the fact that}} only recovery streaming potential data were used here whereas head data for both production and recovery were used. The estimate from head data may also constitute an upper bound since head data were not corrected for pumping and observation wellbore storage. Estimated values of the electrical conductivities of the confining units compare well to those estimated using electrical resistivity tomography. Our work indicates that, where observation wells are unavailable to provide more direct estimates, streaming potential data collected at land surface may, in principle, be used to provide preliminary estimates of aquifer hydraulic conductivity and specific storage, where the latter is estimated with greater uncertainty than the former...|$|R
40|$|The task of {{this work}} was to {{fabricate}} and characterize AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on sapphire and silicon substrates. For this reason the HEMT fabrication technology had to be developed and optimized on AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire and silicon substrates. The optimization of AlGaN/GaN heterostructure on sapphire substrate has been done using RoundHEMT technology. Effects of the AlGaN barrier layer thickness and doping density of AlGaN carrier supply layer and its influence on the electrical properties of HEMTs were studied. The doping density of 5 x 1018 cm- 3 and 12 nm thick barrier layer gave the best DC performance, i. e. IDSS= 354 mA/mm and gm= 132 mS/mm. On an optimized layer structure {{the influence of the}} transistor layout to its electrical properties has been studied by changing the source to drain distance and by varying the gate width. The maximal frequency of oscillation of 64 GHz and cutoff frequency of 37 GHz have been measured. The influence of the different gate widths onto the device performance was studied with multi-finger HEMTs. The HEMTs on AlGaN/GaN heterostructure on sapphire substrate have shown desirable performances but due to poor thermal conductivity of sapphire substrate they are not suitable for high temperature and high power application. The suitability of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on silicon substrates have been proved by RoundHEMT device. After the first difficulties connected with not suitable structure quality and crack structure have been overcame the RoundHEMT with very promised DC performances had been fabricated on the doped AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. The devices with source to drain spacing of 3 µm and the gate length of 0. 3 µm have shown maximal saturation current of 0. 82 A/mm which was the highest value compared to values published in that time for similar AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Optimizing the fabrication technology and using better quality of layer structure linear HEMTs with excellent RF performance were fabricated. Devices with 0. 5 (respectively 0. 7) µm gate length yielded cutoff frequency of 32 (20) GHz and maximal frequency of oscillation 27 (22) GHz. The obtained fmax to fT ratio was 0. 85 and 1. 08 for devices with 0. 5 and 0. 7 µm gate respectively. <b>Non-insulating</b> substrates also lower the cutoff frequency. This small value indicates a parasitic conduction due to <b>non-insulating</b> silicon substrate. Evaluated channel temperature for AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on sapphire substrate compared to HEMTs on silicon substrate has shown that (at 6 W/mm dissipated power) the temperature in channel of the HEMT on sapphire substrate is 320 °C in comparison to 95 °C for HEMT on silicon substrate. The effect of doping concentration in the carrier supply layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on silicon substrate on DC and RF performance was studied at four samples with varying doping density. An improvement of the performance of HEMT devices is obtained with use of appropriate passivation. Influence of SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 passivation on undoped and doped AlGaN/GaN HEMTs was studied. Hall effect measurements have shown an increase of the 2 DEG concentration after applying both types of passivation. An improvement of DC and RF performance was observed in the case of Si 3 N 4 passivation for all four samples. Nearly two times higher output power density was observed for undoped AlGaN/GaN HEMT after applying Si 3 N 4 passivation. The influence of passivation layers on AlGaN/GaN is still not fully understood and further work requires deeper investigations. Finally, preparation and characterization of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on silicon substrate have shown that this device can be a good candidate for mass production of devices for high-frequency, high-power and high-temperature applications.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of theoretical studies of superconducting qubits, and trapped bosons and fermions at ultracold temperature. In superconducting qubits I analyze the resonant properties and decoherence behavior of dc SQUID phase qubits, {{in which one}} junction acts as a phase qubit {{and the rest of}} the device provides isolation from dissipation and noise in the bias lead. Typically qubit states in phase qubits are detected by tunneling it to the voltage state. I propose an alternate non-destructive readout mechanism which relies on the difference in the magnetic flux through the SQUID loop due to state of the qubit. I also study decoherence effects in a dc SQUID phase qubit caused by the isolation circuit. When the frequency of the qubit is at least two times larger than the resonance frequency of the isolation circuit, I find that the decoherence time of the qubit is two orders of magnitude larger than the typical ohmic regime, where the frequency of the qubit is much smaller than the resonance frequency of the isolation circuit. This theory is extended to other similar superconducting quantum devices and has been applied to experiments from the group at the University of Maryland. I also demonstrate, theoretically, vacuum Rabi oscillations, analogous to circuit-QED, in superconducting qubits coupled to an environment with resonance. The result obtained gives an exact analytical expression for coherent oscillation of state between the system (the qubit) and the environment with resonance. Next I investigate ultracold atoms in harmonically confined optical lattices. They exhibit a `wedding cake structure' of alternating Mott shells with different number of bosons per site. In regions between the Mott shells, a superfluid phase emerges at low temperatures which at higher temperatures becomes a normal Bose liquid. Using finite-temperature quantum field theoretic techniques, I find analytically the properties of the superfluid, Bose liquid, and Mott insulating regions. This includes the finite temperature order parameter equation for the superfluid phase, excitation spectrum, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and vortex-antivortex pair formation (in the two dimensional case), finite temperature compressibility and density - density correlation function. I also study interacting mixtures of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms in harmonically confined optical lattices. For a suitable choice of parameters I find emergence of superfluid and Fermi liquid (<b>non-insulating)</b> regions out of Bose-Mott and Fermi-band insulators, due to finite boson and fermion hopping. I also propose a possible experiment for the detection of superfluid and Fermi liquid shells through the use of Gauss-Laguerre and Gaussian beams followed by Bragg spectroscopy. Another area I explore is ultracold heteronuclear molecules such as KRb, RbCs and NaCs. I obtain the finite and zero-temperature phase diagram of bosons interacting via short range repulsive interactions and long-ranged isotropic dipolar interactions in two-dimensions. I build an analytical model for such systems that describes a first order quantum phase transition at zero temperature from a triangular crystalline phase (analogous to Wigner crystal phase of electrons) to superfluid phase. At finite temperature the crystalline phase melts, due to topological defects, to a hexatic phase where translational order is destroyed but hexagonal orientational order is preserved. Further temperature increase leads to the melting of the hexatic phase into a normal dipolar Bose liquid...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{my thesis}} was to understand, design and modify the {{properties}} of surfaces as a whole, {{as well as of}} surface-supported atoms and molecules. This way I discovered exciting differences and similarities between two- and three-dimensional systems, i. e. between the surface and the bulk, which came as a natural consequence in the pursuit of this aim. I have observed physicochemical phenomena that strictly require the specific characteristics of surfaces and also a number of effects that proceed in a very similar fashion when compared to the gas or the liquid phase. One thesis is, however, not enough to study all of the interesting phenomena in surface science, i. e. the field concerned with effects occurring when the dimensionality of the arrangement of atoms is decreased below three. Therefore I focused on exploring on-surface chemistry and magnetism – phenomena that are closely related, as they both depend on the interaction of atoms’ valence electrons with the surroundings. The first example of how one can tune {{the properties of}} a surface is provided by adding a one-atom-thick layer of adsorbates – specifically O, N and Cl on Cu(001). During my work I discovered that this simple modification can drastically alter the reactivity of a surface, as studied using the self-metalation reaction of porphyrins, in which a metal atom is taken from the substrate and embedded in the molecule. Interestingly, this approach also allowed studying the interactions between the molecules, visualised in the formation of molecular self-assembled islands and clusters. In the second studied system I investigated a surface covered by only single ad-atoms, not by a full layer of adsorbates. In this project I was interested in the influence of a substrate on the magnetic properties of single transition metal atoms. Isolated single atoms, due to their spherical symmetry, cannot possess any magnetic anisotropy – i. e. directional dependence of magnetic properties. The interaction with a surface can, however, induce such directional dependence, which in the case of Cr atoms deposited on a Bi substrate is found to reach the theoretically possible limit. It is, {{to the best of my}} knowledge, the first observation of such a giant magnetic anisotropy on a <b>non-insulating</b> substrate. Due to the very limited nature of the periodic table of elements, it is desirable to change the properties of paramagnetic atoms even before depositing them on a surface. Due to the vast possibilities given by organic chemistry, inserting an atom in easily modifiable molecule is a simple way to achieve that. In this thesis I show that such an organic ‘cage’ around an atom can additionally modify the magnetic interaction between the paramagnetic ion and the underlying substrate. I was able to tune the molecule-substrate magnetic exchange coupling energy by using molecules with different functional groups. Interestingly, molecule-surface magnetic interactions can also be used to study molecular motion. I also discuss the use of X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism for detecting out-of-plane molecular rearrangement in a model case, in which two phthalocyanines, MnPc and FePc, showed different adsorption energies with the former being able to push the latter away from the substrate. During this thesis I also developed a method for creating a supramolecular chessboard-like arrangement built from two different molecules, namely MnPc and FeFPc. This approach has been successfully used by me and my colleagues in many projects that strictly required a surface-supported, alternating arrangement of molecules. Fascinating properties of this low-dimensional magnetic layer were controlled by chemical ligation as well as by the choice of the underlying substrate – Au(111), Ag(111) or ferromagnetic O-covered Co(001). Those different supports enabled studying different magnetic coupling interactions that are strong on ferromagnetic supports, while weak on diamagnetic. This thesis expands the range of tuneable surface properties. This was achieved by the use of on-surface supramolecular engineering, an approach combining the design and modifications of molecules and surfaces, as well as the interactions between them. ...|$|R

Flat, insulated glass had been suggested, but was dismissed by Jahn. Single-paned (<b>non-insulated),</b> curved glass panels were eventually used, and resulted in the need for a more expensive air conditioning system, which remains very costly to operate, and is insufficient on hot days (internal temperatures have reached as high as 90 degrees Fahrenheit). [...] The building is also bitterly cold in the winter; in its early years, ice formed on the interior of some of the wall panels. The marble floor of the atrium initially developed unsightly water stains, an issue which has since been resolved.|$|E
