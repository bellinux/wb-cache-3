5|$|The {{existence}} of aposematism in marine ecosystems is controversial. Many marine organisms, particularly those on coral reefs, are brightly coloured or patterned, including sponges, corals, molluscs and fishes, {{with little or}} no connection to chemical or physical defenses.

5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges.

However an experiment showed that there is <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|Purcell {{did not set}} any of Shakespeare's text to music; {{instead he}} {{composed}} music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare wrote it. The masques {{are related to the}} play metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that they bear <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> to the play. Recent scholarship has shown that the opera, which ends with a masque featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth wedding anniversary of William III and Mary II.|$|E

5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> between the trustees and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E

5|$|The House of Orpheus in the {{southern}} part of the city thus takes its name from the large mosaic depicting Orpheus playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the mosaic is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The mosaic is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.|$|E

30|$|The {{previous}} research on e-learning in developing countries contended that students’ familiarity with computer and technology {{has an impact on}} the acceptance of e-learning.

It also reveals <b>no</b> <b>relationships</b> between the familiarity with technology and age, school year, self-regulation, or the number of online courses taken. As a result, we conclude that the students’ decision to adopt e-learning is not contingent upon how familiar they are with related technology. In other words, students who are highly familiar with various types of technology {{may or may not have}} positive perception toward e-learning.|$|R

40|$|The {{capillary}} wall coated by the endothelial glycocalyx is {{the main}} transport barrier during peritoneal dialysis (PD). Here, we investigated the relationships between measurements of the systemic endothelial glycocalyx and peritoneal transport in PD patients. We performed sidestream darkfield (SDF) imaging of the sublingual microvasculature in 15 patients, measured the perfused boundary region (PBR), which includes the permeable part of the glycocalyx, and calculated the estimated blood vessel density (EBVD). All patients underwent a peritoneal permeability analysis. <b>No</b> <b>relationships</b> were present between the imaging and peritoneal transport parameters, neither in {{the group as a}} whole nor in fast transporters. In patients with nonfast peritoneal transport status, PBR had a negative relationship with EBVD and small solute transport, and a positive one with net ultrafiltration (NUF). The EBVD showed a positive correlation with glucose absorption and a negative one with NUF. We found <b>no</b> <b>relationships</b> with the peritoneal transport of albumin. <b>No</b> <b>relationships</b> are present between the systemic endothelial glycocalyx, which was assessed by SDF, and peritoneal transport. In nonfast transporters, a reduction in blood vessel density caused by endothelial glycocalyx alterations or a thicker permeable phase of the glycocalyx delaying the access of small solutes to the small pores may be important...|$|R
