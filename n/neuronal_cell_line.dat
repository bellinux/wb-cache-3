To better understand the properties of TRalpha shuttling in <b>neuronal</b> and non-neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> we compared the intracellular localization of full-length TRalpha, individual TRalpha domains, and domain combinations. The four functional domains of TRalpha are the transactivation (A/B) domain which contains a novel nuclear localization sequence (NLS), the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the hinge domain (HD) which contains a classical bipartite NLS, and the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Expression vectors for green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged individual and combination domains and GFP-tagged full-length TRalpha were transiently transfected into non-neuronal and <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Fusion protein distribution patterns were visualized by fluorescence microscopy and scored for a nuclear, cytoplasmic or whole cell distribution. We found that the A/B and HD have NLS activity in both non-neuronal and <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> but that the HD is likely to contain a stronger signal for import. The most distinct cell-type specific difference in localization was a shift to the cytoplasm with these domains in <b>neuronal</b> <b>cells.</b> In all <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> the DBD was found to shift the A/B domain to the nucleus but shift the HD to the cytoplasm. The LBD of TRalpha showed strong export activity, as it completely reversed the nuclear localization of the HD alone in all <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Our findings suggest that there are differences in TRalpha localization between non-neuronal and <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> possibly providing an example of transcription factor regulation by compartmentalization...|$|R

40|$|Prader–Willi {{syndrome}} (PWS) is {{a complex}} genetic disorder characterized by hyperphagia, obesity and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, all highly suggestive of hypothalamic dysfunction. The NDN gene, encoding the MAGE family protein, necdin, maps to the PWS chromosome region and is highly expressed in mature hypothalamic neurons. Adult mice lacking necdin have reduced numbers of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, but the mechanism for this reduction is unknown. Herein, we show that, although necdin is not expressed in an immature, migratory GnRH <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> (GN 11), high levels are present in a mature GnRH <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> (GT 1 - 7). Furthermore, overexpression of necdin activates GnRH transcription through cis elements bound by the homeodomain repressor Msx that {{are located in the}} enhancer and promoter of the GnRH gene, and knock-down of necdin expression reduces GnRH gene expression. In fact, overexpression of Necdin relieves Msx repression of GnRH transcription through these elements and necdin co-immunoprecipitates with Msx from GnRH neuronal cells, indicating that necdin may activate GnRH gene expression by preventing repression of GnRH gene expression by Msx. Finally, necdin is necessary for generation of the full complement of GnRH neurons during mouse development and extension of GnRH axons to the median eminence. Together, these results indicate that lack of necdin during development likely contributes to the hypogonadotrophic hypogonadal phenotype in individuals with PWS...|$|E

ApoE synthesis was detected in astrocytes by in situ hybridization but was not detected in neurons. Nevertheless, different studies on apoE immunoreactivity reported the presence of apoE in neurons of Alzheimer, control, and necrosis pontisubicular brains. In this study, we addressed the question of potential synthesis of apoE in neurons and its possible involvement in or in response to pathological conditions. To this purpose, we have studied human <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> (SY 5 Y and Kelly cells) originating from neuroblastoma.

However, the precise cellular and molecular effects of cytokines on these neurons have not been reported yet. To gain a better insight into these regulations, we first examined the pattern of expression of cytokine receptors in a novel <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> expressing GnRH (Gnv- 4 cells). Among others, gp 130 is expressed in Gnv- 4 cells, together with the ligand receptor subunits specific for IL- 6 as well as oncostatin M (OSM). Consistent with the latter observation, we show that OSM stimulates {{the expression of the}} immediate early genes c-fos and early growth response- 1 in Gnv- 4 cells, an effect dependent upon the activation of the MAPK Erk 1 / 2 intracellular signaling pathway. Functional studies performed in parallel in Gnv- 4 cells and in primary hypothalamic neuronal cell cultures show that OSM, although devoid of any effect of its own on GnRH gene expression, can inhibit dose-dependently the stimulation of GnRH expression by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that a GnRH-expressing <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> can be modulated in vitro by cytokines implicated in the regulation of the reproductive axis.

This is particularly true for glomerular podocytes - the gatekeepers of glomerular filtration - which completely enwrap the glomerular basement membrane with their primary and secondary ramifications. Nanotechnologies produce biocompatible materials which offer the possibility to build substrates which differ only by topology in order to mimic the spatial organization of diverse basement membranes.

Replication of HSV- 1 or a LAT-negative mutant was markedly repressed in the LAT-expressing cells, a phenomenon mediated by the LATs.

It is unclear how these events {{relate to each other}} or if they can be reversed by pharmacological intervention. Here, we describe <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> expressing inducible fragments of normal and mutant huntingtin. Results In HN 10 cells, the expression of wild type and mutant huntingtin fragments was dependent on the induction time {{as well as on the}} concentration of the RheoSwitch ® inducing ligand. In order to analyze the effect of mutant huntingtin expression on cellular functions we concentrated on the 72 Q exon 1 huntingtin expressing <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> and found that upon induction, it was possible to carefully dissect mutant huntingtin-induced phenotypes as they developed over time. Dysregulation of transcription as a result of mutant huntingtin expression showed a transcription signature replicating that reported in animal models and Huntington's disease patients. Crucially, triggering of neuronal differentiation in mutant huntingtin expressing cell resulted in the appearance of additional pathological hallmarks of Huntington's disease including cell death. Conclusion We developed <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> with inducible expression of wild type and mutant huntingtin. These new <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> represent a reliable in vitro system for modeling Huntington's disease and should find wide use for high-throughput screening application and for investigating the biology of mutant huntingtin. </p...|$|R
40|$|Inactivating {{mutations}} of the melanocortin- 4 receptor (MC 4 R) cause early-onset severe {{obesity in}} humans. Comprehensive functional {{studies show that}} most of the inactivating mutants of the MC 4 R are retained intracellularly. In the present study, we investigated whether a small molecule inverse agonist of the MC 4 R, Ipsen 5 i, could act as a pharmacoperone and correct the cell surface expression and function of intracellularly retained mutant MC 4 Rs using multiple <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> including HEK 293 and two <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> We showed that Ipsen 5 i rescued the cell surface expression of all eleven intracellularly retained mutant MC 4 Rs studied herein in at least one <b>cell</b> <b>line.</b> Ipsen 5 i functionally rescued seven mutants in all <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> used. One mutant (Y 157 S) was functionally rescued in HEK 293 cells but not in the two <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Ipsen 5 i increased cell surface expression of three mutants (S 58 C, G 98 R, and F 261 S) but did not affect signaling. Ipsen 5 i had no effect on mutant MC 4 Rs with other defects (Δ 88 - 92, D 90 N, I 102 S) or no defect (N 274 S). It also did not affect trafficking of a misrouted MC 3 R mutant (I 335 S). Cell impermeable peptide ligands of the MC 4 R or cell permeable small molecule ligand of δ opioid receptor could not rescue misrouted mutant MC 4 R. In summary, we demonstrated that Ipsen 5 i was a novel potent pharmacoperone of the MC 4 R, correcting trafficking and signaling of a significant portion (73 %) of intracellularly retained mutants. Additional studies are needed to demonstrate its in vivo efficacy...|$|R

Isolation of clonal populations of unique peptidergic neurons from the hypothalamus will facilitate these studies. Herein we describe the mass immortalization of mouse primary hypothalamic cells in monolayer culture, resulting in the generation of a vast representation of hypothalamic cell types. Subcloning of the heterogeneous cell populations resulted {{in the establishment of}} 38 representative clonal <b>neuronal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> of which 16 have been further characterized by analysis of 28 neuroendocrine markers. These <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> represent the first available models to study the regulation of neuropeptides associated THE NEUROENDOCRINE HYPOTHALAMUS consists of a complex array of distinct neuronal phenotypes...|$|R
