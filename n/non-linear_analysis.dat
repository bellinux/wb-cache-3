2500|$|Early {{applications}} of matrix methods {{were applied to}} articulated frameworks with truss, beam and column elements; later and more advanced matrix methods, referred to as [...] "finite element analysis", model an entire structure with one-, two-, and three-dimensional elements {{and can be used}} for articulated systems together with continuous systems such as a pressure vessel, plates, shells, and three-dimensional solids. Commercial computer software for structural analysis typically uses matrix finite-element analysis, which can be further classified into two main approaches: the displacement or stiffness method and the force or flexibility method. The stiffness method is the most popular by far thanks to its ease of implementation as well as of formulation for advanced applications. The finite-element technology is now sophisticated enough to handle just about any system as long as sufficient computing power is available. Its applicability includes, but is not limited to, linear and <b>non-linear</b> <b>analysis,</b> solid and fluid interactions, materials that are isotropic, orthotropic, or anisotropic, and external effects that are static, dynamic, and environmental factors. This, however, does not imply that the computed solution will automatically be reliable because much depends on the model and the reliability of the data input.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} the non-linear response of a wall-equivalent dual-system structure. The procedure of the analyses follows the guidelines incorporated in the current Norwegian seismic design code NS-EN 1998 - 1. The investigated structure is detailed for medium ductility in accordance to NS-EN 1998 - 1. A representative finite element model of the structure (2 D) is created with SeismoStruct and OpenSees software packages with emphasis on capturing the non-linear behavior adequately. Both <b>non-linear</b> static <b>analysis</b> and <b>non-linear</b> time history <b>analysis</b> are executed to simulate earthquake for the structure in question. Over-strength and period-based ductility factors of the structure are assessed in accordance to	FEMA P 695 and the results confirmed that a conservative approach is incorporated in NS-EN 1998 - 1. Although the structure is detailed for DCM, the results from <b>non-linear</b> static <b>analysis</b> revealed that the structure response remained in the elastic range. Furthermore, in the latter analysis the software packages give excellent results in terms of target displacements and base shear forces. <b>Non-linear</b> time history <b>analysis</b> confirmed the results obtained from <b>non-linear</b> static <b>analysis</b> for displacements. Moreover, the importance of distribution of stiffness through the structure with regard to inter-storey drifts is demonstrated. The effect of a soft storey is investigated by increasing {{the height of the}} first floor. The results reveal that the inter-storey drifts highly increases at the lower stories rather than at the upper stories...|$|R
5000|$|While {{dealing with}} {{processes}} in which systems exchange matter or energy, classical thermodynamics is {{not concerned with}} {{the rate at which}} such processes take place, termed kinetics. For this reason, the term thermodynamics is usually used synonymously with equilibrium thermodynamics. A central notion for this connection is that of quasistatic processes, namely idealized, [...] "infinitely slow" [...] processes. Time-dependent thermodynamic processes far away from equilibrium are studied by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. This can be done through linear or <b>non-linear</b> <b>analysis</b> of irreversible processes, allowing systems near and far away from equilibrium to be studied, respectively.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} consideration in <b>non-linear</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is the question}} of uniqueness. For a network composed of linear components there will always be one, and only one, unique solution for a given set of boundary conditions. This is not always the case in non-linear circuits. For instance, a linear resistor with a fixed current applied to it has only one solution for the voltage across it. On the other hand, the non-linear tunnel diode has up to three solutions for the voltage for a given current. That is, a particular solution for the current through the diode is not unique, there may be others, equally valid. In some cases there may not be a solution at all: the question of existence of solutions must be considered.|$|E
50|$|The {{mathematical}} {{description of}} stock market movements {{has been a}} subject of intense interest. The conventional assumption has been that stock markets behave according to a random log-normal distribution. Among others, mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot suggested as early as 1963 that the statistics prove this assumption incorrect. Mandelbrot observed that large movements in prices (i.e. crashes) are much more common than would be predicted from a log-normal distribution. Mandelbrot and others suggested {{that the nature of}} market moves is generally much better explained using <b>non-linear</b> <b>analysis</b> and concepts of chaos theory. This has been expressed in non-mathematical terms by George Soros in his discussions of what he calls reflexivity of markets and their non-linear movement. George Soros said in late October 1987, 'Mr. Robert Prechter's reversal proved to be the crack that started the avalanche'.|$|E

The traditional imperfections include the geometric shell-wall mid-surface imperfect ions that are commonly discussed in the literature on thin shell buckling.
