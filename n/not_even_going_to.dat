500|$|Cruise's {{representative}} {{responded to}} the controversy shortly after it broke, telling the Associated Press that the allegations of Cruise's involvement were [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "he never said that". According to The Washington Post, Cruise's publicist asserted that [...] "Tom {{had nothing to do}} with this matter. He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from." [...] Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC's Primetime in mid-April. When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated, [...] "First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it. I'm working, making my movie, I've got my family. I'm busy. I don't spend my days going, 'What are people saying about me?'" [...] A representative of Cruise had also denied any involvement of Cruise with the issue, specifically responding to allegations of Cruise's reputed corporate power play.|$|E
500|$|Mark Ruffalo {{began his}} role as Banner / Hulk in The Avengers, after Feige said {{he chose not to}} bring back Norton. In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be {{associated}} with only one character. In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film. In a Q session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers. In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] and [...] "World War Hulk" [...] storylines, stated, [...] "everything [...] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in Avengers? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attempt that until Avengers 2. So there's a lot of time to think about it." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{three weeks}} that {{followed}} were awful. Dick never came near Owlwood. Jill and I fought every day, we were so cross and disappointed. Nothing had come out right, and Jill blamed it all on me. She said I must have made it too strong. There was no fun in anything, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> in <b>going</b> <b>to</b> church. Dick hardly thumped the pulpit at all {{and when he did}} it was only a measly little thump. But Aunt Tommy didn't seem to worry any. She sang and laughed and joked from morning to night.|$|R
50|$|Tipp {{opened their}} Munster {{championship}} {{with a second}} first round meeting with Kerry in two years. Tipp hoped to improve on last years performance. Tipp started out the first half strong and kept within 3 points during the half. Kerry would prove their strength and power on in the second half. <b>Not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> down <b>to</b> 10 men {{with the loss of}} Tomas O'Se could halt Kerrys bid for a Munster semi final place with Limerick. Tipp lost by 11 points in the end, 2-16 to 0-11. Tipp missed 3 chances on goal, two that came off the post while one was dis-allowed for being a square ball.|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, we were very near <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> Tarifa, though we had promised {{ourselves}} going from the first. But it was very charming to linger in the civilization of that hotel; to wander through its garden paths in the afternoon after a forenoon's writing and inhale the keen aromatic odors of the eucalyptus, and when the day waned to have tea at an iron table on the seaward terrace. Or if we went to Gibraltar, {{it was interesting to}} wonder why we had gone, and to be so glad of getting back, and after dinner joining a pleasant international group in the long reading-room with the hearth-fires at either end which, if you got near them, were so comforting against the evening chill. Sometimes the pleasure of the time was heightened by the rain pattering on the glass roof of the patio, where in the afternoon a bulky Spanish mother sat mute beside her basket of laces which you could buy if you would, but need not if you would rather not; in either case she smiled placidly.|$|R

Without me, you can't do it, and you know it; and I am not going to Redon or {{anywhere}} else, in fact I am <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Fougeray, until we have an equitable arrangement." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, what is it?" [...] said Dick, {{altering}} {{his mind}} about walking to the Colonies; in fact, passing to the other extreme, and standing so rooted to the road that he was apparently <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> home.|$|R

All my old chums are gone, or hopelessly married and changed, and the young set who have come up know not Joseph, and make me feel uncomfortably middle-aged. It's far worse to feel middle-aged than old, you know. Away there in the woods I feel as eternally young as Nature herself. And oh, it's so nice not having to fuss with thermometers and temperatures and other people's whims. Let me indulge my own whims, Louisa dear, and punish me with a cold bite when I come in late for meals. I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> church again. It was horrible there yesterday. The church is so offensively spick-and-span brand new and modern." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good evening," [...] said he {{when the}} three {{appeared}} under escort. [...] "I want your undivided attention for a few minutes. You've known me for five years, and I've known you for--twenty-five. I think we understand one another perfectly. I am now going to pay you a tremendous compliment (the brown one, please, Sergeant. Thanks. You needn't wait). I'm going to execute you without rhyme, Beetle, or reason. I know you went to Colonel Dabney's covers because you were invited. I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> send the Sergeant with a note to ask if your statement is true; because I am convinced that on this occasion you have adhered strictly to the truth. I know, too, {{that you were not}} drinking. (You can take off that virtuous expression, McTurk, or I shall begin to fear you don't understand me.) There is not a flaw in any of your characters. And that is why I am going to perpetrate a howling injustice. Your reputations have been injured, haven't they? You have been disgraced before the house, haven't you? You have a peculiarly keen regard for the honor of your house, haven't you? Well, now I am going to lick you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nutty,' she said, 'I've {{struggled}} for years against {{the conviction that}} you were a perfect idiot. I've forced myself, against my better judgement, to try to look on you as sane, but now I give in. I can't believe you are responsible for your actions. Don't imagine that I am going to heap you with reproaches because you sneaked off to New York. I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell you what I thought of you for not sending me a telegram, letting me know where you were. I can understand all that. You were disappointed because Uncle Ira had not left you his money, and I suppose that was your way of working it off. If you had just run away and come back again with a headache, I'd have treated you like the Prodigal Son. But there are some things which are too much, and bringing a perfect stranger back with you for an indefinite period is one of them. I'm not saying anything against Mr Chalmers personally. I haven't had time to find out much about him, except that he's an Englishman; but he looks respectable. Which, as he's a friend of yours, is more or less of a miracle.' ...|$|E

I just feel tired of everything sensible and I'm going to let my imagination run riot for the summer. Oh, you needn't be alarmed, Marilla. I'll only let it run riot within reasonable limits. But I {{want to have a}} real good jolly time this summer, for maybe it's the last summer I'll be a little girl. Mrs. Lynde says that if I keep stretching out next year as I've done this I'll have to put on longer skirts. She says I'm all running to legs and eyes. And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live up to them and be very dignified. It won't even do to believe in fairies then, I'm afraid; so I'm going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer. I think we're {{going to have a very}} gay vacation. Ruby Gillis is going to have a birthday party soon and there's the Sunday school picnic and the missionary concert next month. And Mr. Barry says that some evening he'll take Diana and me over to the White Sands Hotel and have dinner there. They have dinner there in the evening, you know. Jane Andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests in such beautiful dresses. Jane says it was her first glimpse into high life and she'll never forget it to her dying day." ...|$|E
