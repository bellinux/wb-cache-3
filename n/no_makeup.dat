25|$|Biba's layout was {{innovative}} and {{was set to}} enhance the clothes rather than just to hold them. The clothes were also displayed in an unusual manner, from the beginning hanging on coat stands. Since coat stands can not hold a lot of clothes many were needed. Fitz shopped for them all year round, {{so that he could}} secure as many as they needed in the store, while ordering hundreds more. Biba was also the first store that let customers try makeup before buying it. This started an unusual routine; women came to Biba before work with <b>no</b> <b>makeup</b> on, put it on in the store and then rushed to work.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the film, the {{cinematography}} made {{extensive use}} of shadows and close up shots to emphasise the moods of the characters. Jump cuts were frequently used as well. Overall, 8,230 metres of film negative was {{used to make the}} film, and the team incurred a cost of [...] 20,000 for exterior shooting equipment. The scenes where Arun interviewed women for his documentary were real scenes, improvised with women they would meet at colleges and bus stops, and shot using the live-recording method. The film uses a sharp contrast of black and white colours to lend a surreal atmosphere to it, and <b>no</b> <b>makeup</b> was used for the lead actors.|$|E

500|$|Makeba was {{described}} as a style icon, both in her home country and the US. She wore <b>no</b> <b>makeup</b> and refused to straighten her hair for shows, thus helping establish a style that came to be known internationally as the [...] "Afro look". According to Music scholar Tanisha Ford, her hairstyle represented a [...] "liberated African beauty aesthetic". She was seen as a beauty icon by South African schoolgirls, who were compelled to shorten their hair by the apartheid government. Makeba stuck to wearing African jewellery; she disapproved of the skin-lighteners common among South African women at the time, and refused to appear in advertisements for them. Her self-presentation has been characterised by scholars as a rejection of the predominantly white standards of beauty that women in the US were held to, which allowed Makeba to partially escape the sexualisation directed at women performers during this period. Nonetheless, the terms used to describe her in the US media have been identified by scholars as frequently used to [...] "sexualize, infantalize, and animalize" [...] people of African heritage.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hidden Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs, but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine. The video consists of close-up shots panning around Björk's face, as fluids flow {{in and out of}} her facial orifices. M/M (Paris) explained the concept behind the video:We always wanted to get as close to her as we could, as we all felt she had never been portrayed as the [...] "real" [...] and beautiful woman she is. This is somehow taboo, to observe a pop star with <b>no</b> <b>makeup</b> from a distance of half an inch. Then the idea of the liquid works as a visualization of all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain. The loop idea was a main point for us as well, trying to extend the usual time frame of pop video super-fast editing, to make it hypnotising, mesmerising and irritating, like an eternally burning fireplace.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara {{made her}} screen debut in Walter Forde's Kicking the Moon Around (1938), {{although}} she did not consider it {{a part of her}} filmography. Richman had introduced her to Forde at Elstree Studios, but as she was not cast in the film in a notable role, she agreed to deliver one line in it as a favor to Richman for helping with her screen test. Laughton arranged for her to appear in the low-budget musical My Irish Molly (1938), the only film she made under her real name, Maureen FitzSimons. In the film she plays a woman named Eiléen O'Shea who rescues an orphan girl named Molly. Biographer Aubrey Malone stated of it: [...] "One could argue that O'Hara never looked as enticing as she does in Little Miss Molly, even if she isn't 'Maureen O'Hara' quite yet. She wears <b>no</b> <b>makeup,</b> and there's no Hollywood glamour, but despite (or because of?) that, she is rapturously beautiful. Her accent is thick, which is perhaps why she didn't mention the film much. It also looks as if it were made in the 1920s rather than the 1930s, so primitive are the sets and characters". Malone added that though the lot was [...] "ham-fisted", it is a [...] "quaint film which O'Hara scholars should view if only to see early evidence of her natural instinct for dramatic timing and scene interpretation".|$|E
500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than <b>no</b> <b>makeup,</b> the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E

It was the first onscreen portrayal of the Fu Manchu character in film. Oland continued to appear onscreen as an Asian, probably more often than any other white actor in the history of cinema.

2500|$|As in {{the beat}} {{movement}} preceding them, and the punk movement that followed soon after, hippie symbols and iconography were purposely borrowed from either [...] "low" [...] or [...] "primitive" [...] cultures, with hippie fashion reflecting a disorderly, often vagrant style. As with other adolescent, white middle-class movements, deviant {{behavior of the}} hippies involved challenging the prevailing gender differences of their time: {{both men and women}} in the hippie movement wore jeans and maintained long hair, and both genders wore sandals, moccasins or went barefoot. Men often wore beards, while women wore little or <b>no</b> <b>makeup,</b> with many going braless. Hippies often chose brightly colored clothing and wore unusual styles, such as bell-bottom pants, vests, tie-dyed garments, dashikis, peasant blouses, and long, full skirts; non-Western inspired clothing with Native American, Asian, African and Latin American motifs were also popular. Much hippie clothing was self-made in defiance of corporate culture, and hippies often purchased their clothes from flea markets and second-hand shops. Favored accessories for both men and women included Native American jewelry, head scarves, headbands and long beaded necklaces. Hippie homes, vehicles and other possessions were often decorated with psychedelic art. The bold colors, hand-made clothing and loose fitting clothes opposed the tight and uniform clothing of the 1940s and 1950s. It also rejected consumerism in that the hand-production of clothing called for self-efficiency and individuality.|$|E

2500|$|Her last {{motion picture}} {{was in a}} British horror film, Fanatic (1965). She chose this role over the lead in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, which she had turned down. Fanatic was {{released}} in the U.S. as Die! Die! My Darling!, which she protested, thinking it was exploiting her characteristic catchphrase, but {{did not succeed in}} getting it changed. During the screening she held privately for her friends, she apologized for [...] "looking older than God's wet nurse" [...] (in the film she wore <b>no</b> <b>makeup</b> and dyed her hair grey, and the film used very claustrophobic close-ups to accentuate her age and frailness). She called the B-movie horror flick [...] "a piece of shit", though her performance in it was praised by critics and remains popular as a cult film and with her fans. Her last appearances on television came in March 1967 as the villainous Black Widow in the Batman TV series, and on the December 17, 1967, episode of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour comedy-variety TV series, in the [...] "Mahta Harry" [...] skit. She also appeared on NBC's famous lost Tonight Show Beatles interview that aired on May 14, 1968. Sitting behind the interview desk and beside Joe Garagiola, who was substituting for an absent Johnny Carson, she took an active role during the interview, questioning Paul McCartney and John Lennon. George Harrison and Ringo Starr were not present and were in England at the time, as noted during the interview.|$|E
2500|$|Bond girls {{conform to}} a fairly {{well-defined}} standard of beauty. They possess splendid figures {{and tend to}} dress in a slightly masculine, assertive fashion, wear little jewellery—and that in a masculine cut—wide leather belts, and square-toed leather shoes. (There is some variation in dress, though: Bond girls have made their initial appearances in evening wear, in bra and panties and, on occasion, naked.) Nearly {{all of them are}} white; they often sport light though noticeable suntans (although a few, such as Solitaire, Tatiana Romanova, and Pussy Galore, are not only tanless but remarkably pale), and they generally use little or <b>no</b> <b>makeup</b> and no nail polish, also wearing their nails short. Their hair may be any colour, though they typically wear it in a natural or casual cut that falls heavily to their shoulders. Their features, especially their eyes and mouths, are often widely spaced (e.g. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tiffany Case, Tatiana Romanova, Honey Ryder, Viv Michel, Mary Goodnight). Their eyes are usually blue (e.g. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Honey Ryder, Tracy Bond, Mary Goodnight), and sometimes this is true to an unusual and striking degree: Tiffany Case's eyes are chatoyant, varying with the light from grey to grey-blue, while Pussy Galore has deep violet eyes, the only truly violet eyes that Bond had ever seen. The first description of a Bond girl, Casino Royale's Vesper Lynd, is almost a template for the typical dress as well as the general appearance of later Bond girls; she sports nearly all of the features discussed above. In contrast, Dominetta [...] "Domino" [...] Vitali arguably departs to the greatest degree from the template, dressing in white leather doeskin sandals, appearing more tanned, sporting a soft Brigitte Bardot haircut, and giving no indication of widely spaced features. (The departure {{may be due to the}} unusual circumstances behind the writing of the novel Thunderball, in which Domino appears.) Even Domino, however, wears rather masculine jewellery.|$|E
