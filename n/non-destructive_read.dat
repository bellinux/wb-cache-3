The one advantage that distinguishes it from other next generation non-volatile memory like {{magnetic random access memory}} (MRAM) is the unique scaling advantage of having better performance with smaller sizes.

40|$|The dense surface charges {{expressed}} by a ferroelectric polymeric thin film induce ion displacement within a polyelectrolyte layer and vice versa. This {{is because the}} density of dipoles along {{the surface of the}} ferroelectric thin film and its polarization switching time matches that of the (Helmholtz) electric double layers formed at the ferroelectric/polyelectrolyte and polyelectrolyte/semiconductor interfaces. This combination of materials allows for introducing hysteresis effects in the capacitance of an electric double layer capacitor. The latter is advantageously used to control the charge accumulation in the semiconductor channel of an organic field-effect transistor. The resulting memory transistors can be written at a gate voltage of around 7 V and read out at a drain voltage as low as 50 mV.

We believe that this noise model, which is validated using real and simulated test data, is applicable to most astronomical near-infrared instruments. We describe some non-ideal behaviors that have been observed in engineering grade NIRSpec detectors, and demonstrate that they are unlikely to affect NIRSpec sensitivity, operations, or calibration. These include a HAWAII- 2 RG reset anomaly and random telegraph noise (RTN). Using real test data, we show that the reset anomaly is: (1) very nearly noiseless and (2) can be easily calibrated out. Likewise, we show that large-amplitude RTN affects only a small and fixed population of pixels. It can therefore be tracked using standard pixel operability maps. Comment: 55 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

This comparison also reveals that the read noise associated with a single readout of the SpeX array increases {{with the number of}} <b>non-destructive</b> <b>reads,</b> n_r, as n_r^ 0. 16. This implies that the {effective} read noise of a stored image decreases as n_r^- 0. 34, shallower than the expected rate of n_r^- 0. 5. The cause of this read noise behavior is uncertain, but may be due to heating of the array {{as a result of the}} multiple read outs.

50|$|First-generation DRAM ICs (those with {{capacities}} of 1 Kbit), {{of which the}} first was the Intel 1103, used a three-transistor, one-capacitor (3T1C) DRAM cell. By the second-generation, the requirement to increase density by fitting more bits in a given area, or the requirement to reduce cost by fitting the same amount of bits in a smaller area, lead to the almost universal adoption of the 1T1C DRAM cell, although a couple of devices with 4 and 16 Kbit capacities continued to use the 3T1C cell for performance reasons (Kenner, p. 6). These performance advantages included, most significantly, the ability to read the state stored by the capacitor without discharging it, avoiding the need to write back what was read out (<b>non-destructive</b> <b>read).</b> A second performance advantage relates to the 3T1C cell has separate transistors for reading and writing; the memory controller can exploit this feature to perform atomic read-modify-writes, where a value is read, modified, and then written back as a single, indivisible operation (Jacob, p. 459).|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{applications}} such as software deﬁned radios have different reception modes and their real-time requirements {{are a result of}} periodic sources and sinks in the form of ADCs and DACs. Tools are under development that automatically translate a sequential speciﬁcation of a radio application, that often includes nested while loops to describe the modes, into a parallel task graph and map this task graph onto an embedded multiprocessor system. However the speciﬁcation of strict periodic sources and sinks together with input and output buffers that can respectively overﬂow or underrun is currently not possible in a sequential programming language. In this paper we will introduce a nested loop program (NLP) language extension that enables the speciﬁcation of periodic sources and sinks and their buffers in a sequential program. We show that parallelization of such a sequential program poses challenges because the order in which different tasks access the input and output buffers should be maintained in the parallel program. Furthermore, the buffers at the sources and sinks allow destructive writes and <b>non-destructive</b> <b>reads,</b> which causes non-deterministic functional behavior in case the throughput and latency constraint of the application are not met. The other buffers in the task graph block in case no data or space is available. Therefore, the system internals remain functionally deterministic which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes debugging and analysis. Furthermore, to guarantee real-time requirements, we show {{that it is possible to}} conservatively model an application with nested while loops as a Cyclo-Static Dataﬂow (CSDF) model. Using this model we can compute a mapping of the task graph, which includes a task to processor assignment, suitable scheduler settings and buffer capacities. By making use of this CSDF model, we can guarantee that sources and sinks can run periodically under the assumption that the used execution times of the tasks are upper bounds...|$|R

40|$|A {{flexible}} azobenzene side-chain liquid crystalline (SCLC) polyester architecture {{employed for}} re-versible optical storage is described. The modular design allows four structural parameters to be in-dividually modied. These parameters: i- the methylene side-chain spacer length, ii- the substituent on azobenzene, iii- the methylene main-chain segment length, and iv- the polyester molecular mass, all influence the optical storage properties. A general synthetic route to novel mesogenic azobenzene di-ols comprising parameters i and ii is outlined. Polyesters with molecular masses (parameter iv) up to 100, 000 are routinely obtained by melt transesterication {{of the novel}} diols and selected diacid precursors (parameter iii). Prominent storage features include no prealignment of thin SCLC polyester lms prior to the writing process, and sensitivity in a broad laser wavelength window (415 - 532 nm). Additionally, information can be recorded either through polarization holography or as direct computer generated pat-tern (grey tones). Thus polarization holography results in high diraction eciency (> 50 %) and high storage density (> 5000 lines/mm interference gratings) lasting presently well over 5 years without any sign of fatigue.

40|$|Ferroelectric {{materials}} have established themselves as indispensable in key {{applications such as}} piezoelectric transducers and energy storage devices. While the use of ferroelectrics in these fields dates back more than 50 years, little {{progress has been made}} to extend applications of ferroelectrics into new fields. To a large extend the observed slow progress is not caused by a lack of potential applications, but to by the inherent complexity associated with a structural phase transition, combined with strong coupling of polarisation, strain and temperature, and the strong modification of the phenomena by material defects. This thesis takes a look at prospective applications in energy storage for pulse power applications, solid state cooling and non-volatile random access memory and identifies key issues that need to be resolved. The thesis delivers time-domain based approaches to determine ferroelectric switching behaviour of bulk materials and thin films down to sub-ns time scales. The approach permitted study of how information written to a ferroelectric memory decays as a result of multiple <b>non-destructive</b> <b>read</b> operations. Furthermore simultaneous direct measurements of temperature and ferroelectric switching established a direct link between the retarded switching phenomenon observed in ferroelectrics and temperature changes brought by the electrocaloric effect. By comparison with analytical models and numerical simulation a large localised temperature change on the scale of individual domains is postulated. It implies a much larger coupling between switching and local temperature than has been previously considered. In extension of the model the frequency dependence of polarisation fatigue under bipolar conditions is explained by the occurrence of large temperature gradients in the material...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2012. Major:Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Chris H. Kim. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 84 pages. Low power memory is always desired {{due to its}} significance in many large-scale applications. It is important to emerging technologies such as organic electronics, since it is an indispensible component to extend the technology towards larger application scope with complicated functionalities. It is also a hot topic in the mature silicon technology because the device scaling makes memory designs challenging with increasing leakage currents and process variations. Organic electronics deals with conductive polymers and plastics, and is capable of realizing large area flexible applications, which cannot be fulfilled by modern silicon technology. Conventional organic devices require a high operation voltage due to its low carrier mobility. Ion-gel gated OTFTs (gel-OTFTs), however, deliver unusually high gate capacitance through an electrolyte-gated structure, and therefore offer sufficient drive currents under a low voltage. Being an emerging technology, few {{attempts have been made}} on organic memory designs. In this dissertation, we first propose an improved design-fabrication-testing flow to significantly facilitate the entire process, which boosts the design efficiency and fabrication yield and thus enables the implementation of complex circuits such as memory array. An organic process design kit (OPDK) with various modeling approaches allows designers to easily design organic circuits in a similar way as that in silicon technology. Various circuit components including logic gates, ring oscillators and a D-flipflop were demonstrated and a general purpose organic dynamic memory cell was proposed for the first time. The cell, known as a DRAM gain cell, achieves a sub- 10 nW-per-cell refresh power with a retention time of over 1 minute, which is 5 orders of magnitude longer than that in silicon designs. The same DRAM gain cell architecture is also found potential as embedded memory in the modern silicon technology, where the prevailing 6 T SRAM is suffering from leakage power and poor low voltage margin when devices keep scaling down. In this dissertation we report the first variation-aware performance analysis on the silicon gain cell and reveal that conventional corner simulations are no longer valid in capturing worst cases of gain cells. Insights can be obtained through the various analysis approaches described in the dissertation to benefit future memory design strategy and device optimization. With innovations in cell structure and peripheral circuitry, the silicon gain cell performance can be further enhanced to compete with the mainstream 6 T SRAM. In this dissertation, we for the first time experimentally demonstrate a gain cell design with write-back-free read operations, utilizing its <b>non-destructive</b> <b>read</b> nature to improve the read speed into GHz regime without sacrificing retention time. Various circuit techniques including a local-sense-amplifier architecture are proposed to eliminate the need of a complex current-sensing scheme, and a dual-row-access mode is proposed for further power saving in half-utilization scenarios. The test chip in a 65 nm low power process achieves a 23. 9 % power saving compared to a 6 T SRAM at 0. 6 V retention voltage and an additional 27. 8 % power saving during cases when only half array is needed...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, organic {{thin-film}} electronics {{have emerged}} as a route towards flexible, low-cost, large area applications, which are unfeasible in the current silicon technology. For example, low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) tags that can be placed on any object, as envisioned by the Internet of Things, for smart labeling, security, monitoring, or tracking purposes. For these applications, a nonvolatile memory functionality is crucial for their intended operation. Therefore, simultaneous {{to the development of}} organic transistors and circuits, progress needs to be made towards a compatible nonvolatile, electrically reprogrammable memory array. In this doctoral research, we aim to realize such an organic memory array that can be integrated with the organic logic circuits on the same, flexible substrate. More specifically, we focus on the device architecture and materials of ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFET) as the basic memory unit. The objective of this work was pursued by a combination of i) technological advancements over the state-of-the-art; ii) further understanding of the device operation; iii) devising a read-and write scheme suited for an array; and iv) use of novel materials and device architectures. By optimizing the processing conditions, we demonstrate high-performance bottom gate - top contact (BG-TC) FeFETs with pentacene as the organic semiconductor, as shown in Chapter 2. These memory devices can switch within a few ms, and can be cycled for at least 10000 times. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate a long term retention data of more than one year. These results make this device highly promising for non-volatile memory applications. Unexpectedly for a bi-stable material, the BG-TC FeFET shows three reprogrammable memory states: OFF, Intermediate and ON state. Using Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy, we elucidate the device operation in this device structure in Chapter 3. These measurements show that the ferroelectric layer in the channel region of the FeFET is not fully polarized in the OFF and Intermediate states. The difference between these two states can be explained by a different injection property of the contacts, caused by the ferroelectric polarization state underneath the source-drain contacts. This refinement clarifies the peculiarities experimentally found in literature, as well as in our own results. To integrate with organic circuits, as well as to fabricate memory arrays, photolithography must be used. In addition, the bottom gate - bottom contact (BG-BC) device architecture needs to be adopted. By further technology development, we realize such a memory FeFET that can be integrated with current state-of-the-art organic circuits on flexible substrates, as demonstrated in Chapter 4. Moreover, we employ this technology to fabricate a passive NAND array, as described in Chapter 5. The NAND architecture was chosen, as it offers the highest possible density of all transistor memory arrays. Despite the fact that passive arrays are more challenging to reliably address all FeFETs, we demonstrate a <b>non-destructive</b> <b>read</b> and write operation in the NAND array. Finally, novel device architecture and materials are explored to improve the memory characteristics in Chapter 6. Replacing pentacene with novel, high mobility semiconductors alone are proven to be unsuccessful to enlarge the memory window in the BG-BC FeFET. On the other hand, by adapting a planar heterojunction structure in the device, the memory window can be significantly enlarged by 30 - 60 %. The heterojunction device architecture is promising for further improvements, as many combinations of organic semiconducting materials are possible.
