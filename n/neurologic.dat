5|$|Left untreated, Wilson's disease {{tends to}} become {{progressively}} worse and is eventually fatal. With {{early detection and}} treatment, most of those affected can live relatively normal lives. Liver and <b>neurologic</b> damage that occurs prior to treatment may improve, but it is often permanent.|$|E
5|$|Physiotherapy and {{occupational}} therapy are beneficial {{for patients with}} the <b>neurologic</b> form of the disease. The copper chelating treatment may take {{up to six months}} to start working, and these therapies can assist in coping with ataxia, dystonia, and tremors, as well as preventing the development of contractures that can result from dystonia.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{progressive}} MS {{occurs in}} around 65% {{of those with}} initial relapsing-remitting MS, who eventually have progressive <b>neurologic</b> decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission. Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear. The most common length of time between disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19years.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} initial {{course of the}} disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is {{characterized}} by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, {{many of the people}} who have this subtype begin to experience <b>neurologic</b> decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady <b>neurologic</b> decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.|$|E
5|$|Generally, if {{the patient}} is treated and survives then a full {{recovery}} is expected. Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term <b>neurologic</b> dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute <b>neurologic</b> deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For <b>neurologic</b> problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma, {{depressed}} {{level of}} consciousness, or focal <b>neurologic</b> signs {{may benefit from}} urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site. The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a transfemoral angiogram or CT angiogram later. It is hard to predict who will have a rebleed, yet it may happen {{at any time and}} carries a dismal prognosis. After the first 24hours have passed, rebleeding risk remains around 40 percent over the subsequent fourweeks, suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible. Some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure, the presence of a hematoma in the brain or ventricles, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm >10mm in size.|$|E
5|$|The bromide anion is {{not very}} toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8milligrams. However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the {{membrane}} of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as bromism. Bromide has an elimination half-life of 9 to 12 days, {{which can lead to}} excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to <b>neurologic,</b> psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in somnolence, psychosis, seizures and delirium.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{includes}} {{the use of}} iron chelating agents (such as desferrioxamine) to lower serum ferritin concentration, brain and liver iron stores, and to prevent progression of <b>neurologic</b> symptoms. This, combined with fresh-frozen human plasma (FFP) effectively in decreasing liver iron content. Repetitive use of FFP can even improve <b>neurologic</b> symptoms. Antioxidants such as vitamin E can be used simultaneously to prevent tissue damage to the liver and pancreas.|$|E
25|$|The late disseminated {{stage is}} where the {{infection}} has fully spread throughout the body. Chronic <b>neurologic</b> symptoms occur in up to 5% of untreated patients. A polyneuropathy that involves shooting pains, numbness, and tingling in the hands or feet may develop. A <b>neurologic</b> syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle cognitive difficulties, insomnia, a general sense of feeling unwell, and changes in personality. Other problems, however, such as depression and fibromyalgia, are no more common in people with Lyme disease than in the general population.|$|E

25|$|Pseudobulbar affect is a {{condition}} that occurs secondary to neurological disease or brain injury, and is thought to result from disruptions of neural networks that control the generation and regulation of motor output of emotions. PBA is most commonly observed in people with <b>neurologic</b> injuries such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke, and <b>neurologic</b> diseases such as dementias including Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Lyme disease, PANDAS in children and adults, and Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported as a symptom of hyperthyroidism, Graves' Disease, or hypothyroidism in combination with depression.|$|E
25|$|Just as in adults, most {{headaches}} are benign, {{but when}} head pain is accompanied with other {{symptoms such as}} speech problems, muscle weakness, and loss of vision, a more serious underlying cause may exist: hydrocephalus, meningitis, encephalitis, abscess, hemorrhage, tumor, blood clots, or head trauma. In these cases, the headache evaluation may include CT scan or MRI in order to look for possible structural disorders of the central nervous system. If {{a child with a}} recurrent headache has a normal physical exam, neuroimaging is not recommended. Guidelines state children with abnormal <b>neurologic</b> exams, confusion, seizures and recent onset of worst headache of life, change in headache type or anything suggesting <b>neurologic</b> problems should receive neuroimaging.|$|E
25|$|Variegate {{porphyria}} (also porphyria variegata {{or mixed}} porphyria), which {{results from a}} partial deficiency in PROTO oxidase, manifests itself with skin lesions {{similar to those of}} porphyria cutanea tarda combined with acute <b>neurologic</b> attacks.

25|$|<b>Neurologic</b> {{symptoms}} and signs {{vary depending on}} the site of the brain abnormalities. Common symptoms are partial epilepsy, asymmetric spasticity, ataxia and cognitive impairment. The latter affects visuospatial and visuoconstructive skills first. The intracranial pressure can be elevated if cysts develop in the brain. Migraine-like headaches can occur.|$|E
25|$|Stiff person {{syndrome}} (SPS), {{also known}} as stiff man syndrome (SMS), is a rare <b>neurologic</b> disorder of unclear cause characterized by progressive rigidity and stiffness. The stiffness primarily affects the truncal muscles and is superimposed by spasms, resulting in postural deformities. Chronic pain, impaired mobility, and lumbar hyperlordosis are common symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{therapy is}} useful to {{maintain}} strength and general cardiovascular health. Horseback therapy and exercises {{in a swimming pool}} are often well-tolerated and fun for people with A-T. However, no amount of practice will slow the cerebellar degeneration or improve <b>neurologic</b> function. Exercise to the point of exhaustion should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the relapsing form is related to the antiAQP4+ seropositive status and the monophasic form related to its absence Unlike multiple sclerosis, Devic's disease rarely has a secondary progressive phase in which patients have increasing <b>neurologic</b> decline between attacks without remission. Instead, disabilities arise from the acute attacks.|$|E
25|$|While observing {{large family}} trees with many {{individuals}} having ataxia, Lazzarini noticed that many family members also had restless legs syndrome.
