[...] The actor recalls, [...] "I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant, until I read it!" [...] Adler had long wondered why his character behaved the way he did: [...] "I thought there's got to be a reason why he's so angry, why he's such a bully, why he's going {{out of his way to}} make other people's lives a living hell". Although he had considered various ideas for Karofsky—"maybe he was jealous of the glee club, maybe he was gay, maybe a million different things"—when he got the script for that episode he [...] "was just as shocked as anybody else" [...] when his character kissed Kurt, though he [...] "thought it was so awesome that they would allow this character to go there." ...|$|E

The {{conduct of}} the people was so indescribably frightful, that I felt for some time {{afterwards}} almost as if I {{were living in a}} city of devils. I feel, at this hour, as if I never could go near the place again. My letters have made a great to-do, and led to a great agitation of the subject; but I have not a confident belief in any change being made, mainly because the total abolitionists are utterly reckless and dishonest (generally speaking), and would play the deuce with any such proposition in Parliament, unless it were strongly supported by the Government, which it would certainly not be, the Whig motto (in office) being [...] "laissez aller." [...] I think Peel might do it if he came in. Two points have occurred to me as being a good commentary to the objections to my idea. The first is that a most terrific uproar was made when the hanging processions were abolished, and the ceremony shrunk from Tyburn to the prison door. The second is that, at this very time, under the British Government in New South Wales, executions take place within the prison walls, with decidedly improved results. (I am waiting to explode this fact on the first man of mark who gives me the opportunity.) ...|$|E

50|$|In his account, Gandil {{suggested}} that the players were under intense pressure from both observers suspicious of their every move and the gamblers expecting them {{to go along with}} the plan. He said this may have contributed to their making poor plays despite their decision to abandon the fix. However, he was firm in his insistence that all of the players were trying their best throughout all eight games of the Series. Gandil also said that the original deal called for the conspirators to play the first game straight, since a White Sox win would drive the price up further; the White Sox were shelled in that game 9-1. Gandil further claimed in his story that he never received his share of any of the money paid by the gamblers, and <b>that</b> he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> happened to <b>that</b> money.|$|R

50|$|According to Berkeley, {{an object}} has real being {{as long as}} it is {{perceived}} by a mind. God, being omniscient perceives everything perceivable, thus all real beings exist in the mind of God. However, it is also evident that each of us has free will and understanding upon self-reflection, and our senses and ideas suggest that other people also possess these qualities as well. According to Berkeley there is no material universe, in fact he has absolutely <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> could possibly mean. To theorize about a universe that is composed of insensible matter is not a sensible thing to do. This matters because there is absolutely no positive account for a material universe, only speculation about things that are by fiat outside of our minds.|$|E

500|$|Liu {{was once}} an eminent scholar, but was {{reportedly}} little-known inside the People's Republic of China (PRC) {{at the time of}} the award due to official censorship. Those who had heard about Liu had mixed views about him. Some clearly supported the government position, whereas one university student was quoted as saying [...] "George Orwell probably had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> he wrote would end up being the reality of China now." [...] "Liu Xiaobo" [...] and [...] "Nobel Peace Prize" [...] became the most searched terms among internet users in China. However, some time after the release of the official response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, government censors screened the news item, and there were reports of searches in China using Chinese search engines returning error pages. Web searches using Chinese search engines for [...] "Liu Xiaobo" [...] in Chinese without attaching the words [...] "Peace Prize," [...] gave information about Liu. Yet most sites found [...] "Liu" [...] plus [...] "Peace Prize" [...] yield only the official foreign ministry response. CNN reported that any mention of [...] "Nobel Prize" [...] on microblogging sites was censored. One person claimed that his SIM card was deactivated after he sent a text message to a relative about the Nobel Peace Prize. Accustomed to circumventing Chinese internet censorship, bloggers and forum-users used variants of Liu's name and posted subtle or cryptic messages to express their elation about the award or sarcasm towards the state. The statement on 8 October by renowned blogger Han Han consisted of only a pair of double quote marks.|$|R

Your mother's nature, as far as I have seen of her, is not a deep one. She was very fond of your father, and she is fond of you; but you know, just as still waters run deep, shallow waters are full of ripples, and eddies, and currents. She has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> seems natural and right to her should jar upon you. You upon your part can {{scarcely}} make sufficient allowance for her different treatment of a subject which is to you sacred. I know how you miss your father, but your mother must miss him still more. No man ever more lovingly and patiently tended a woman than he did her so far as lay in his power. She had not a wish ungratified. You have in your work an employment which occupies your thoughts and prevents them from turning constantly to one subject; she has nothing whatever to take her thoughts from the past. It is better for her to speak of him often than to brood over him in silence. Your tribute to your father's memory is deep and silent sorrow, hers is frequent allusions. Doubtless her way jars upon you; but, Ned, you are younger than she, and it is easier for you to change. Why not try and accept her method as being a part of her, and try, instead of wincing every time that she touches the sore, to accustom yourself to it. It may be hard at first, but it will be far easier in the end." ...|$|R

I know a lot of people really love that album, and I think that's great. But for me, I think the most disappointing element is the production, which I think could have been punchier, and the feelings the album conjures up.
