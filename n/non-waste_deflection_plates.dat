5000|$|The {{most common}} use for this {{technique}} is controlling {{the path of a}} stream of electrons in a vacuum. One application is in small cathode ray tubes for oscilloscopes. In these tubes the electric field is created by two sets of paired electrodes, mounted at right angles, that the electron stream flows between. This arrangement allows independent deflection of the beam in two dimensions (usually perceived as up/down (vertical) and right/left (horizontal)). The electrodes are commonly called <b>deflection</b> <b>plates.</b> Traditionally, the electrons pass through the vertical <b>deflection</b> <b>plates</b> first, yielding slightly higher sensitivity because of the longer travel time from the vertical <b>deflection</b> <b>plates</b> to the phosphor screen as compared to the horizontal <b>deflection</b> <b>plates.</b> In very high speed oscilloscopes, the <b>deflection</b> <b>plates</b> were often complex structures, combining a series of sub-plates with an electrical delay line. By matching the propagation speed of the electrical signal with the transit speed of the electrons, maximum bandwidth (frequency response) was achieved.|$|R

The interior region of the eye pattern is called the eye opening. An eye pattern provides {{a great deal of}} information about the performance of the pertinent system.|$|R
40|$|Thermionic {{emission}} microscope (THEM) is {{an important}} analytical research tool for studying the electron emission uniformity of a thermionic cathode. The criticality of its design and development stems from the inhomogeneous emission nature of impregnated cathode surface. In this paper, a design approach of lens and <b>deflection</b> <b>plate</b> is described. The analytical equation for focal length, refractive index and condition for beam convergence of the microscope is derived using electron-optical phenomena. Finally, all the parameters are optimized using TRAK simulation software. The microscope has been developed and tested in UHV chamber.

50|$|A {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) {{consists}} of three primary parts, the electron gun that provides a stream of accelerated electrons, the phosphor-covered screen that lights up when the electrons hit it, and the <b>deflection</b> <b>plates</b> that use magnetic or electric fields to deflect the electrons in-flight and allows them to be directed around the screen. It is the ability for the electron stream to be rapidly moved using the <b>deflection</b> <b>plates</b> that allows the CRT {{to be used to}} display very rapid signals, like those of a television signal or to be used for radio direction finding (see huff-duff).|$|R

The fast rise time of the ramp pulse generated by the switch (90 ps) combined with the fast response of the traveling wave <b>deflection</b> <b>plates</b> (150 ps) significantly reduced the jitter caused by the shot-to-shot laser fluctuation. At {approx} 1 % rms (root mean square) laser energy fluctuation, the resolution of the camera is 1. 1 ps when over 5000 laser shots were accumulated.

5000|$|To write a {{value to}} memory, the address was amplified {{and sent to}} the Y <b>deflection</b> <b>plates,</b> such that the beam would be fixed to a {{horizontal}} line on the screen. A timer then set the X <b>deflection</b> <b>plate</b> to increasing voltages, causing the beam to be scanned across the selected line. The gun was set to a default energy close to , and the bits from the computer fed to the gun to modulate the voltage up and down such that 0's would be below [...] and 1's above it. By the time the beam reached {{the other side of the}} line, a pattern of short dashes was drawn for each 1, while 0's were empty locations.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed for}} improving the precision of laser ranging measurements of ground-to-satellite distances. The method employs a mode-locked laser transmitter and utilizes an image converter tube equipped with <b>deflection</b> <b>plates</b> in measuring the time of flight of the laser pulse to a distant retroreflector and back. Samples of the outgoing and returning light pulses are focussed on the photocathode of the image converter tube, whose <b>deflection</b> <b>plates</b> are driven by a high-voltage 120 MHz sine wave derived from a very stable oscillator. From the relative positions of the images produced at the output phosphor by the two light pulses, {{it is possible to}} make a precise determination of the fractional amount by which the time of flight exceeds some large integral multiple of the period of the deflection sinusoid...|$|R
50|$|The second design, {{described}} in U.S. Patent 2,837,691, {{was similar to}} the first for vertical addressing, but used a conventional horizontal scanning system. The gun was moved to the lower middle of the display, firing upward, scanned horizontally by a single pair of <b>deflection</b> <b>plates</b> arranged just above the gun. Horizontal scanning is much faster than vertical, so this change greatly reduced the complexity of the driver electronics. At the top of the screen was a single wire charged to very high voltages, which bent the beam through 180 degrees back towards the bottom of the display. The vertical <b>deflection</b> <b>plates</b> were mounted on a plate arranged to lie between the path of the beam as it traveled upwards {{at the back of the}} tube and back down at the front.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the purpose}} of the time base generator, which is {{attached}} to one of the set of <b>deflection</b> <b>plates,</b> normally the X axis, while the amplified output of the radio signal is sent to the other axis, normally Y.

50|$|Between the {{electron}} gun {{and the screen}} are two opposed pairs of metal <b>plates</b> called the <b>deflection</b> <b>plates.</b> The vertical amplifier generates a potential difference across one pair of plates, giving rise to a vertical electric field through which {{the electron}} beam passes. When the plate potentials are the same, the beam is not deflected. When the top plate is positive {{with respect to the}} bottom plate, the beam is deflected upwards; when the field is reversed, the beam is deflected downwards. The horizontal amplifier does a similar job with the other pair of <b>deflection</b> <b>plates,</b> causing the beam to move left or right. This deflection system is called electrostatic deflection, and is different from the electromagnetic deflection system used in television tubes. In comparison to magnetic deflection, electrostatic deflection can more readily follow random and fast changes in potential, but is limited to small deflection angles.|$|R

Our peaking technique has applications to other HV pulsers including those which must drive 51 ohm loads. Generally, rise time voltages are measured between 10 and 90 %. To minimize the camera image blur resulting from the dynamic influence of <b>deflection</b> <b>plate</b> potentials acting on photocathode electrons, it was necessary to design a circuit that would rise from 0 to the 99 % voltage level in under 100 nS. Once this voltage was reached, it was necessary to stay within 1 % of the attained voltage level for a duration of 1 uS. This was accomplished with the use of MOSFET solid state switching...|$|R

Currents and rigid nozzle plates are used inside the cartridge to fix the size of droplets exiting the chamber. This research is focused on studying the effect of nozzle flexibility on droplet formation. A flexible nozzle can be modeled as an flexible annular plate with a clamped outside edge. In this thesis, plate vibration equations are studied for an annular shape. An analytical solution is formed for the small <b>deflection</b> <b>plate</b> equation. To solve the large <b>deflection</b> <b>plate</b> vibration equation, Galerkin's method is used. Droplet formation is predicted by a one dimensional fluid dynamic model. An integrated plate vibration and droplet formation model is created with these basic building blocks.
