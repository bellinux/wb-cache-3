40|$|Two new {{products}} developed for road authorities and other customers of the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institutes</b> Market Division are presented and verified in this paper: A precipitation type forecast and a radar precipitation type product. The HIRLAM model {{is used to}} forecast the precipitation types rain, sleet and snow. The operational HIRLAM-forecasts are biased towards predicting too many cases with snow. The paper shows that additional calculations of snow melting based on temperature and humidity in the lowest model layer reduce this error. For the radar product, the precipitation type is estimated from synoptic observations of 2 m-temperature and dew point temperature. The observations are interpolated in space using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) after deriving local vertical temperature gradients. A precipitation type datset is derived and combined with the actual radar precipitation intensity image. The radar product is verified against observed precipitation types at the synoptic stations for the winter season 2002 / 2003 (October to March). The percentage correct is 85 %. The Probability of Detection is 0. 9 for rain and 0. 91 for snow. A comparison of estimated and forecasted precipitation types is carried out for January 2002 against an independent set of precipitation stations in Southern Norway. The results confirm the good quality of the radar product and show that the adjustment of HIRLAM precipitation type to real topography improves the forecast...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} master thesis {{presents a}} {{statistical analysis of}} energy delivered through district heating for a selection of buildings in Oslo, Norway. The research objective is to study whether meteorological factors (i. e. wind speed, air pressure, solar radiation) {{can be used as}} supplement to outdoor temperature to explain the energy consumption. In addition simple linear regression has evaluated as a method to estimate the percentage of heating energy spent on hot water. The meteorological variables used in the analysis have been found in the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institutes</b> online database – “eKlima”, and are registered at Blindern survey station in Oslo. The data on energy consumption has been collected by Kristensen for his master thesis at The Norwegian University of Life Sciences spring 2014 (Kristensen 2014). In the analysis procedure it has been decided to split the observed energy consumptions in three populations – residential, commercial, and a total population. The latter population consisted of the sum of energy spent in the residential and the commercial populations. The reason for this grouping of the populations was due to the assumption that commercial energy consumption has a different characteristic than residential energy consumption and {{it would be interesting to}} see whether potential meteorological explanatory variables would be valid for all populations. The study has proven that the expected energy consumption of all populations varies according to which direction the wind blows. It can be expected higher energy consumption with wind from north and east than wind from the south and west. This correlates to higher expected wind speed and lower expected outdoor temperature with wind blowing from north and east, and lower expected wind speed and higher expected outdoor temperature with wind from the south and west. The study concludes that the convection heat loss is affected by from which direction the wind blows. By multivariate linear regression is has been found that the climatic factors, average wind speed, number of hours with sunshine, average air pressure, and average energy degrees (difference between average outdoor temperature and 17 °C indoor temperature), are statistically significant as explanatory variables for the energy consumption in all populations. The study concludes that these climatic variables better explain the energy consumption of the residential population than simple linear regression with energy degrees alone as explanatory variables does. It has been found that simple linear regression can be used as a method to estimate the percentage of heat energy used for hot water in the residential population. Still it is a weakness to the method as it in this study assumes that the energy spent on heating water is constant during the observation period. This method weakness can be somewhat counter acted by analysing the energy consumption year by year. The energy consumption of the commercial population has been proven non-linear correlated with energy degrees. Cubic estimation of the commercial energy consumption has proven to have a higher coefficient of determination than estimation by linear regression. By assumption of valid cubic correlation the energy consumption of the commercial population has been proven to have different outdoor temperature sensitivity than the residential population. The thesis concludes that a non-linear correlation and temperature sensitivity needs further study. M-FORN...|$|R

5|$|The first {{proposals}} for an airport on Værøy were {{launched by the}} government in the late 1960s. A 1968 meteorological report concluded that the island was highly susceptible for strong winds, dominantly from the west, which could cause problems for air traffic. Three locations were considered: Kvalnes, Røssnesvågen og Nordlandet. The <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institute</b> concluded in 1973 that Nordlandet was the most suitable location in terms of weather, but test flights showed otherwise. Nordlandet was the cheapest alternative. Estimates showed that the regularity at an airport would be significantly lower than at the existing heliport. This caused local politicians to wish to keep the existing service, but pressure from Røst caused Værøy politicians to support an airport. After initial protests against Nordlandet as a site, Mayor Asmund Berg accepted the location on 3 May 1984. There had not been conducted sufficient test flights to establish the wind conditions above the airport caused by Teisthammeren, a mountain next to the airport. Widerøe was opposed to the location of the airport.|$|E

500|$|The {{report from}} the Accident Investigation Board was highly {{critical}} to the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, stating that the airport {{should never have been}} built where it was and that it was [...] "clearly unsuitable for regular traffic". It stated that the administration had overlooked comments from meteorologists and test flights in the area that had concluded that the wind conditions in the area were not suitable for an airport. The commission that wrote the report and conducted the investigation, stated that the Civil Aviation Administration had not proceeded correctly while planning the airport—they had chosen Nordlandet early as a location and ignored negative comments. After the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institute</b> had made a favorable report about the weather in the area, the administration had failed to conduct the necessary test flights to test the wind conditions, since this was not determined in the initial recommendation. The commission also commented that the safety division had been critical to the localization of the airport, but had withdrawn their disputes following pressure from higher ranks in the administration. The commission also criticized the Civil Aviation Administration for not conducting investigations following the reports of low regularity and the incidents in 1988 and 1989.|$|E
