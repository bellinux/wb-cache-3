50|$|Cord {{then comes}} upon {{a band of}} {{travellers}} holding a festival. Cord meets with their leader, Chang-Sha (Carradine), who offers to let Cord sleep {{with one of his}} wives, Tara (Erica Creer). Cord declines due to his vow of celibacy and instead challenges Chang-Sha to combat. The contest is set for the following day; during the <b>night,</b> <b>Cord</b> is joined in his tent by Tara. They make love, and Cord asks Tara to stay with him forever. The next morning when Cord awakes, he finds that the entire band has left, and that Tara has been crucified.|$|E
60|$|One September <b>night</b> a <b>cord</b> was {{let down}} from the crenels of the tower, and by this the duke was to descend from his window to the castle ditch, where Benavente's men awaited him. Garcia was {{to go with him}} since, naturally, it would not be safe for the {{servants}} to remain behind, and Garcia now let himself down that rope, hand over hand, from the terrible height of the duke's window. It was only when he had reached the end of it that he discovered that the rope was not long enough, and that below him there was still a chasm that might well have appalled even desperate men.|$|R
6000|$|Although {{lying in}} a {{position}} that was unfavourable for eating purposes, Crusoe opened his jaws and took it. An awful crash was followed by two crunches--and it was gone; and Crusoe looked up in the old squaw's face with a look that said plainly, [...] "Another of the same, please, and as quick as possible." [...] The old woman gave him another and then a lump of meat, which latter went down with a gulp--but he coughed after it! and it was well he didn't choke. After this the squaw left him, and Crusoe spent the remainder of that <b>night</b> gnawing the <b>cords</b> that bound him. So diligent was he that he was free before morning and walked deliberately out of the tent. Then he shook himself, and with a yell that one might have fancied was intended for defiance, he bounded joyfully away, and was soon out of sight.|$|R
