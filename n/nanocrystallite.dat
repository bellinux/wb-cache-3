Its qualitative features hold both for states localized {{near the center}} of a <b>nanocrystallite</b> and those near the surface, such as states due primarily to dangling bonds. However, different quantitative features are expected because of the different size constraints on each of these states. Since the majority of atoms in a typical <b>nanocrystallite</b> are on the surface, contrasting confinement effects between these two types may prove useful in predicting how surface state dependent properties, such as optical absorption, change with the size of the <b>nanocrystallite.</b> By applying first principles pseudopotential methods to indium doped, uncapped CdSe nanocrystallites containing 17 and 34 atoms, we identify center and surface localized states.

The main spectral feature for all samples and both temperatures {{is a broad}} band whose position does not change considerably with <b>nanocrystallite</b> size. The band is assigned to recombination through defect states, whose energy depends on the <b>nanocrystallite</b> size {{in such a way}} that they counter-balance the similar dependence of the optical band gap on the <b>nanocrystallite</b> size. A noticeable asymmetry on the low-energy side of this band at low temperatures is attributed to the existence of a variety of surface defect states and/or a large number of volume defect states in these nanocrystals.

The single doping with group-III or group-V impurities leads to significant changes on the onsets of the absorption spectra that are related to the minority-spin states. In contrast to the optical absorption spectra, the radiative lifetimes are sensitively influenced by the shape of the <b>nanocrystallites,</b> though this influence tends to disappear as the size of the <b>nanocrystallites</b> increase. Codoping is investigated for pairs of group-III and group-V impurities. We show that the impurity formation energies decrease significantly when the <b>nanocrystallites</b> are codoped with B and P or with Al and P. Additional peaks are introduced in the absorption spectra due to codoping, giving rise to a redshift of the absorption onset with respect to the undoped <b>nanocrystallites.</b> Those additional peaks are more intense when codoping is performed with two different species either of the group III or of the group V.
