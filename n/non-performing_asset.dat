This is commonly the case when the amount owed on the home is higher than the current market value of this foreclosure property, such as with a high loan-to-value mortgage following a real estate bubble. As soon as the beneficiary repossesses the property it is listed on their books as REO and categorized as an asset. (See <b>non-performing</b> <b>asset).</b>|$|E

40|$|Basel III is {{a global}} risk {{management}} framework on capital adequacy, liquidity and leverage for banks. The Reserve Bank of India, on congruence to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, has set 31 st March 2019 as the deadline for Indian banks to fully implement the Basel III norms. Basel III would undoubtedly improve {{the stability of the}} banks by tightening capital, liquidity and leverage requirements but the potential trade-off, for this stability, is reduced liquidity creation, and therefore profitability. Currently, in India, several public sector banks, including three of the "Big Four Banks", are experiencing rapidly rising <b>Non-Performing</b> <b>Assets.</b> These banks had to set provisions for these <b>Non-Performing</b> <b>Assets</b> and thus had resulted in reduced profits. In addition to this, the falling interest rates are contributing to reduced profitability as a result of reduced net interest margins. This research examines the significance of the impact of rising <b>non-performing</b> <b>assets,</b> and the falling interest rates, on the Indian commercial banks in implementing the capital regulations of Basel III. Pearson Product Moment Correlation is used to examine the impact of Net Interest Margin and Gross <b>Non-Performing</b> <b>Assets</b> ratio, with the capital regulation metric of Basel III – the Capital Adequacy Ratio.

50|$|<b>Non-performing</b> <b>assets</b> {{had been}} the single largest cause of {{irritation}} of the banking sector of India. Earlier the Narasimham Committee-I had broadly concluded that {{the main reason for}} the reduced profitability of the commercial banks in India was the priority sector lending. The committee had highlighted that 'priority sector lending' was leading to the buildup of <b>non-performing</b> <b>assets</b> of the banks and thus it recommended it to be phased out. Subsequently, the Narasimham Committee-II also highlighted the need for 'zero' <b>non-performing</b> <b>assets</b> for all Indian banks with International presence. The 1998 report further blamed poor credit decisions, behest-lending and cyclical economic factors among other reasons for the buildup of the <b>non-performing</b> <b>assets</b> of these banks to uncomfortably high levels. The Committee recommended creation of Asset Reconstruction Funds or Asset Reconstruction Companies to take over the bad debts of banks, allowing them to start on a clean-slate. The option of recapitalisation through budgetary provisions was ruled out. Overall the committee wanted a proper system to identify and classify NPAs, NPAs to be brought down to 3% by 2002 and for an independent loan review meachnism for improved management of loan portfolios.The committee's recommendations let to introduction of a new legislation which was subsequently implemented as the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 and came into force with effect from 21 June 2002.|$|R

The analysis underscores that {{as in the case of}} a centralized strategy the prerequisites for a successful decentralized restructuring strategy are manifold. The successful countries significantly improved the banking system's capital position enabling banks to write down loan losses; banks as well as corporations had adequate incentives to engage in corporate restructuring; and ownership links between banks and corporations were limited or severed during crises...|$|R

The study employed Panel secondary data from 33 banks in the period (2006 - 2011) and the linear Regression model was used to test for {{the relationship between the}} two variables. The findings indicate that capital adequacy has a great influence on the asset quality.

However, when use <b>non-performing</b> <b>asset</b> to total asset ratio as a credit risk measurement, we find a negative relationship between securitization and bank’s credit risk taking, and both findings are statistically significant for period 2001 to 2007. After we decompose the aggregate securitization, we find that various underlying assets have mixed effects of the overall impact of securitization on bank’s credit risk taking behaviour, with the Family Residential Loans tend to always contribute the most to the aggregate securitization’s impact. In sum, we conclude that the impact is ambiguous and the relationship will depend on the economic conditions...|$|E

In alter from the history; Income recognition is now not on an addition basis but when it is essentially received. Past problems faced by banks were to a great extent attributable to this. Classification of what an NPA is has changed with narrowing of prudential norms. At present an asset is "non-performing" if interest or installments of principal due stay unpaid for more than 180 days. To improve the efficiency and profitability, the NPA has to be scheduled. Various steps have been taken by government to reduce the NPA.
