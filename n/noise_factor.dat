A commercial single and video of her performance were released, and reached the Top 20 on the US Hot 100, making her the only act to turn the US national anthem into a pop hit of that magnitude (José Feliciano's version reached No. 50 in November 1968). Houston donated all her share of the proceeds to the American Red Cross Gulf Crisis Fund. As a result, the singer was named to the Red Cross Board of Governors.|$|E

In this paper, a Bayesian approach to model-robust process optimization in the presence of <b>noise</b> <b>factors</b> and non-normal error terms is presented.
