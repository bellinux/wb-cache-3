5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of <b>natural</b> <b>sugar.</b> Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of sugar substitutes approved {{for food use}} are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk <b>natural</b> <b>sugar</b> substitutes are known, including sorbitol and xylitol, which are found in berries, fruit, vegetables, and mushrooms. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, xylose is converted to xylitol, lactose to lactitol, and glucose to sorbitol. Other natural substitutes are known, but these have yet to gain official approval for food use.|$|E
25|$|Grape {{maturity}} {{depends on}} the requirement of the final product. For a sweet white wine, whether fortified or <b>natural,</b> <b>sugar</b> is the key criterion. For a dry white wine, technological maturity is calculated and the fruit is harvested just before (usually eight days) the maturity of the sugar. At this point the relationship between sugar and acid is optimal. Further, low acidity will cause the future wine to be unbalanced with excess alcohol and lack of liveliness. In addition, the flavour will be less fresh and less vivid.|$|E

50|$|Fructose has {{the lowest}} glycemic index (GI = 19) of all the <b>natural</b> <b>sugars.</b> In comparison, {{ordinary}} table sugar (sucrose, which is half fructose) has a GI of 65 and honey (usually about 50% fructose content) has a GI of 55.|$|R
25|$|Primary {{fermentation}} {{usually takes}} 2856 days, {{after which the}} must is placed in a secondary fermentation vessel for 6–9 months of aging. Durations of primary and secondary fermentation producing satisfactory mead may vary considerably according to numerous factors, such as floral origin of the honey and its <b>natural</b> <b>sugar</b> and microorganism contents, must water percentage, pH, additives used, and strain of yeast, among others. Although supplementation of the must with nitrogen, salt or vitamins has been tested to improve mead qualities, {{there is no evidence}} that adding nutrients reduced fermentation time or improved quality. Cell immobilization methods, however, proved effective for enhancing mead quality.|$|E
2500|$|The Wrotham (pronounced [...] "rootum") Pinot is an English {{selection}} of Pinot that is sometimes {{regarded as a}} synonym of Pinot Meunier. The Wrotham Pinot does look somewhat similar to Meunier, with white hairs on the upper surface of the leaves. But it is particularly resistant to disease, has a higher <b>natural</b> <b>sugar</b> content and ripens two weeks earlier than Meunier. No genetic evidence exists however to prove it is {{anything other than a}} distinctively named clone of Pinot Meunier.|$|E
2500|$|Almost all {{wines are}} white, except those {{made from the}} Pinot noir grape which are pale red, often rosé, rarely red (e.g. [...] ). Sparkling wines known as Crémant d'Alsace are also made. Much of the white wines of Alsace are made from {{aromatic}} grape varieties, so many characteristic Alsace wines are aromatic, floral and spicy. Since they very seldom have any oak barrel aromas {{they tend to be}} very varietally pure in their character. Traditionally all Alsace wines were dry (which once set them apart from German wines with which they share many grape varieties), but an ambition to produce wines with more intense and fruity character has led some producers to produce wines which contain some residual sugar. Since there is no official labeling that differentiates completely dry from off-dry (or even semi-sweet) wines, this has occasionally led to some confusion among consumers. It is more common to find residual sugar in Gewürztraminer and Pinot gris, which reach a higher <b>natural</b> <b>sugar</b> content on ripeness, than in Riesling, Muscat or Sylvaner. Usually there is a [...] "house style" [...] as to residual sugar, i.e., some producers only produce totally dry wines, except for their dessert style wines.|$|E
50|$|Kudus are browsers and eat {{leaves and}} shoots. In dry seasons they eat wild {{watermelons}} and other fruit for their liquid {{content and the}} <b>natural</b> <b>sugars</b> that they provide. The lesser kudu is less dependent on water sources than the greater kudu.|$|R

2500|$|In the UK, {{the name}} 'Wrotham Pinot' is a {{permitted}} synonym for Pinot Meunier and {{stems from a}} vine {{that one of the}} pioneers of UK viticulture, Edward Hyams, discovered in Wrotham (pronounced 'root-am' or 'root-em') in Kent in the late 1940s. It was in all probability the variety known as 'Miller's Burgundy' which had been widely grown on walls and in gardens in Great Britain for many years. Archibald Barron writing in his book, Vines and Vine Culture, the standard Victorian work on grape growing in the UK, states that the 'Millers Burgundy' also was: found by [...] Sir Joseph Banks in the remains of an ancient vineyard at Tortworth, Gloucestershire – a county well known for its medieval vineyards. Hyams took the vine to Raymond Barrington Brock, who ran what was to become the Oxted Viticultural Research Station, and he trialed it alongside the many other varieties he grew. Brock said that when compared to supplies of Meunier from France, Wrotham Pinot: had a higher <b>natural</b> <b>sugar</b> content and ripened two weeks earlier. Hyams, ever the journalist in search of a good story, claimed that this vine had been left behind by the Romans although he provided absolutely no evidence for this. Brock sold cuttings of 'Wrotham Pinot' and the variety became quite popular in early English 'revival' vineyards in the late twentieth century, although it is unlikely that many vines from the cuttings supplied by Brock survive in any present UK vineyards. Indeed, despite the fact that today virtually all plantings of Meunier in the UK stem from French and German nurseries, the name Wrotham Pinot is still a legally acceptable synonym for this variety, although little, if ever, used by UK growers.|$|E

5|$|Before {{technology}} in wineries could stabilize temperatures, the low temperatures in winter {{of the northern}} German regions would halt fermentation and leave the resulting wines with <b>natural</b> <b>sugars</b> and a low alcohol content. According to local tradition, in the Mosel region the wine would then be bottled in tall, tapered, and green hock bottles. Similar bottles, although brown, are used for Riesling produced in the Rhine region.|$|R
