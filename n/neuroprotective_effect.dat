25|$|NELL2 is a tissue-specific {{protein in}} the nervous system. It {{contains}} EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like repeat domain and its gene expression is regulated by estrogen.

When NELL2 synthesis is blocked by intracerebroventricular injection of antisense (AS) NELL2 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) into neonatal male rat brains (postnatal day0-day5), the size of SDN-POA is decreased.

25|$|Erythropoietin was {{reported}} to have a range of actions beyond stimulation of erythropoiesis including vasoconstriction-dependent hypertension, stimulating angiogenesis, and promoting cell survival via activation of Epo receptors resulting in anti-apoptotic effects on ischemic tissues. However this proposal is controversial with numerous studies showing no effect. It is also inconsistent with the low levels of Epo receptors on those cells. Clinical trials in humans with ischemic heart, neural and renal tissues have not demonstrated the same benefits seen in animals. In addition some research studies have shown its <b>neuroprotective</b> <b>effect</b> on diabetic neuropathy, however these data were not confirmed in clinical trials that have been conducted on the deep peroneal, superficial peroneal, tibial and sural nerves.|$|E

In this study, we aimed to investigate the <b>neuroprotective</b> <b>effects</b> of CsV on MPP+-induced cytotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells and explore its possible mechanisms. Our results show that CsV attenuates MPP+-induced cytotoxicity, inhibits ROS accumulation, and increases mitochondrial membrane potential dose-dependently. We also found that levels of Sirt 1 protein and Mn-SOD mRNA significantly decreased in MPP+-treated group but were restored with CsV treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GRP 78 protein and Caspase- 12 mRNA levels were elevated by MPP+ exposure but reversed by CsV treatment. CsV inhibited the MPP+-induced downregulation of Bcl- 2 and up-regulation of Bax in a dose-dependent manner and, thus, increased the ratio of Bcl- 2 /Bax. Overall, {{these results suggest that}} Sirt 1 /Mn-SOD and GRP 78 /Caspase- 12 pathways might be involved in the CsV-mediated <b>neuroprotective</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
