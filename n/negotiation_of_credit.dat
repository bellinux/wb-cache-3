40|$|The {{implementation}} of activities aimed to mitigate global {{greenhouse gas emissions}} is more cost-efficient in developing countries than {{in most of the}} industrialized world. Thus it has been a major, but contentious topic in the climate <b>negotiations</b> to allow <b>crediting</b> <b>of</b> emissions reduction in developing countries towards domestic emission targets of industrial countries. The Kyoto Protocol instituted a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) that is to assure that the interests of all parties from industrialized and developing countries are equally represented. Many issues concerning the structure of the CDM remain to be decided. Crediting critically depends on these decisions. Credits should accrue only after verification. A crucial issue that influences all decisions on creation and distribution <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> is whether they are tradable. Concerning credit creation, it would be advisable not to set quotas on the share <b>of</b> CDM <b>credited</b> toward Annex-B targets as they give no dynamic incentive for innovation. To reach the latter goal, crediting should be gradually reduced in the long run. Crediting should also be related to externalities and thus be differentiated according to project categories. In a fund model, the reduction <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> could be evenly spread over all investors. In a clearinghouse model {{it would have to be}} related to each project. Uncertainties should not be covered through discounting but through a compulsory insurance. Credit sharing leads to higher costs for the investors and a lower demand for CDM projects. Free <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> sharing ratio will lead to a competition between host countries. In case of tradability, host countries could set up projects with own funds to earn credits they can sell. Such a de facto extension of emissions trading could work against the goal of inducing developing countries to voluntarily adopt emission targets. This could be promoted by making credits non-tradable but allowing banking against future targets...|$|R

40|$|The {{strategy}} conceived for {{a certain}} type of business takes shape {{in the form of the}} business plan. The business plan represents a complex system based on interdependence and which reflects in an accessible manner the idea of business and the evolution of this one in the time. This is a work tool used for the beginning and the development of a business that needs material, financial and human resources. By the instrumentality of the business plan are improved the experience and the realizations of the past with the intention to project the future through the most appropriate methods of estimation and approximation. It serves as an element of convincing in the process <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> some <b>credits</b> and <b>of</b> attraction of some potential paymasters. A business plan can be compared with a road map: it shows where we are and where we want to arrive. It contains points of mark and other helping elements for the orientation in the economical environment, preparing at the same time the traders for the more ore less predictable modifications of the “crossing”. A good based business plan should be capable to determinate the necessity of additional capital and the moment to realize the infusion of this one, convincing on the capacity of the inquirer to manage the business. The paymasters want to be sure that it was made a responsible analysis of the strong and weak points of the business, of the rescues and the associate opportunities. They also must be convinced that a lot of rescues indissoluble related to that businesses were identified and some methods of decreasing of these ones were found on acceptable levels. the bank financing; the capitalinvestment; the alliance; the relations with the clients and with the distributors; external sources of financing...|$|R

40|$|A line <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{flexible}} financing tools for companies. Banks give companies lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> {{to strengthen their}} profitability and competitive ability. On the other hand, companies draw the lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> that will increase banks' credit risk. It {{is very difficult for}} banks to determine the lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> for an enterprise group. Based on principle <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> risk evaluation and structural model, this paper first defines bank's tolerable default risk and lines <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> and then analyzes integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>of</b> parent and subsidiary companies. The results of this research indicate that the lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>of</b> single company is related to its asset value growth, and integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>of</b> an enterprise group is also related to member's asset value growth and the associated relationships. Furthermore, this study shows that the integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>of</b> an enterprise group can be determined by the weighted sum of member's lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and the computational formula of weight. This study provides a quantitative analysis tool to ascertain the enterprise group's integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and analyze how the associated relationships affect the integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> Integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> default probability, enterprise group, ratio of shareholding, 37 A 50, 60 Fxx, 60 G 10...|$|R

40|$|A set of {{descriptive}} {{studies was}} undertaken in four French immersion classrooms {{at the elementary}} level with a view to further characterizing the <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> form in classroom discourse. The <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> form consists of at least four interactional moves that encourage peer- and self-repair and aim to draw attention to non-target output. Unlike the <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> form, recasts - the most widely used type of corrective feedback - are unable to lead to peer- or self-repair. Moreover, they risk being perceived ambiguously by classroom learners because their discourse functions resemble those of noncorrective repetition and because they are often accompanied by signs of approval. Immediate repairs of phonological errors, however, tend to follow recasts, whereas most immediate repairs of lexical and grammatical errors result from <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> form...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} verbal student–teacher interactions in vocational education from a socio-cultural perspective on <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning. Teaching {{as part of}} these interactions is addressed {{by a combination of}} diagnosing, checking and intervening strategies. A study was conducted in which students (n students[*]=[*] 20) and teacher (n teachers[*]=[*] 5) from Social Work (SW) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) worked together in small groups (n groups[*]=[*] 5) discussing vocational core problems. Each group held five discussions (n discussions[*]=[*] 25). All discussions were audio recorded and transcribed before they were analysed for <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning including teaching strategies. The results showed that 5 – 8 % of the interactions include <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning. Interactions in SW groups revealed more <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning than in interactions in ICT groups. Teaching strategies mainly included checking and intervening activities in favour of diagnosing activities. Furthermore, teachers used meta-cognitive and conceptual interventions most frequently. The implications of these results are discussed by reflecting on occupational differences and on how <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning including teaching strategies can be enhanced...|$|R

40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study investigated}} the occurrence <b>of</b> meaning <b>negotiation</b> in an interactive synchronous computer-mediated second language (L 2) environment. Sixteen dyads (N = 32) consisting of nonnative speakers (NNSs) and native speakers (NSs) of English performed 2 different tasks using videoconferencing and written chat. The data were coded and analyzed both for instances <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning and for instances where the NNSs did not initiate repair despite nonunderstanding. Absences <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning are generally excluded from detailed analysis primarily because {{it is difficult to}} establish nonunderstanding unless the participant overtly indicates it. In order to assess the effect of the nonoccurrence <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning on task performance and task completion, this study used 2 tasks: a culturally specific task that almost certainly would result in NNS nonunderstanding and a collaborative decision-making task that should trigger instances <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning. It was found that, in both tasks, instead of initiating repair sequences, NNS participants frequently did not engage in <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning despite nonunderstanding. We conclude that disregarding nonoccurrence <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning in (digital) task-based language teaching may lead to misrepresenting task performance, task outcome, and task evaluation, and, beyond that, to disregarding evidence that has both empirical and theoretical consequences for the Interaction Hypothesis and, by implication, for second language acquisition...|$|R
