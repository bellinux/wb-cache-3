25|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} series is its use of a repertory cast — Boyd Banks, Nicky Guadagni, Kari Matchett, Debra Monk, George Plimpton, Ron Rifkin, Marian Seldes, Francie Swift, James Tolkan and many other accomplished Canadian and American actors — to play <b>non-recurring</b> roles.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{dedicated}} semiconductor foundries (such as TSMC and UMC) without in-house design services, Fujitsu/Samsung charge two- to three-times {{more per}} manufactured wafer. For low to mid volume applications, a design service foundry offers lower overall pricing (through subsidisation of the licence fee). For high volume mass-produced parts, {{the long term}} cost reduction achievable through lower wafer pricing reduces the impact of ARM's NRE (<b>Non-Recurring</b> Engineering) costs, making the dedicated foundry a better choice.|$|E
25|$|A Nero Wolfe Mystery is a {{television}} series adapted from Rex Stout's classic series of detective stories that aired for two seasons (2001–2002) on A. Set in New York City {{sometime in the}} 1940s–1950s, the stylized period drama stars Maury Chaykin as Nero Wolfe and Timothy Hutton as Archie Goodwin. A distinguishing feature of the series is its use of a repertory cast to play <b>non-recurring</b> roles. A Nero Wolfe Mystery {{was one of the}} Top 10 Basic Cable Dramas for 2002.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, AMD's then CEO Rory Read began {{a program}} to offer semi-custom designs. Rather than AMD simply {{designing}} and offering a single product, potential customers could work with AMD to design a custom chip based on AMD's intellectual property. Customers pay a <b>non-recurring</b> engineering fee for design and development, and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. In particular, AMD noted their unique position of offering both x86 and graphics intellectual property. These semi-custom designs would have design wins as the APUs in the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and the subsequent PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox One X. Financially, these semi-custom products would represent {{a majority of the}} company's revenue in 2016. In November 2017, AMD and Intel announced that Intel would market a product, combining in a single package an Intel Core CPU, a semi-custom AMD Radeon GPU, and HBM2 memory.|$|E
500|$|The only <b>non-recurring</b> {{guest star}} in [...] "Tuvix" [...] is the eponymous fusion of two main characters. [...] Though guest stars have {{occasionally}} played major recurring characters—e.g., Sandra Smith as Captain Kirk in s [...] "Turnabout Intruder" [...] and David Birkin as Captain Picard in s [...] ""—Tom Wright {{is the first}} to portray two in the same episode.|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, the HASC Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee {{proposed}} {{legislation that would}} direct the Air Force [...] "to conduct a comprehensive assessment and study of {{the costs associated with}} resuming production of F-22 aircraft." [...] Defense Secretary Robert Gates had production halted at 187 F-22s (at a cost of $67 billion) to direct funds for ongoing irregular warfare operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] Since then, lawmakers and the Pentagon noted that air warfare systems of Russia and China were catching up to U.S. air superiority capabilities. Previous estimates of restarting production placed figures at around $2 billion, including $300–500 million in <b>non-recurring</b> start-up costs, with an estimated unit cost of $233 million for a production run of 75 aircraft over five years. [...] Lockheed has proposed upgrading the 36 early training-model Block 20 Raptors into combat-coded Block 30/35 versions as a way to increase numbers available for deployment. On 9 June 2017, the Air Force submitted their report to Congress stating they had no plans to restart the F-22 production line due to economic and operational issues; it estimated it would cost approximately $50 billion to procure 194 additional F-22s, at a cost of $206–$216 million per aircraft, including approximately $9.9 billion for <b>non-recurring</b> start-up costs and $40.4 billion for aircraft procurement costs.|$|E
500|$|... "Sardines" [...] is {{the first}} episode of British dark comedy {{anthology}} series Inside No. 9. Written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, it premiered on BBC Two and BBC Two HD on 5 February 2014. The episode features a stand-alone plot revolving around a group of adults, who are <b>non-recurring</b> characters, playing sardines at an engagement party. Rebecca, the bride-to-be, finds a boring man named Ian in a wardrobe; he introduces himself as a colleague of Jeremy, Rebecca's fiancé. The pair are subsequently joined by family, friends and colleagues of Rebecca and Jeremy. As more people enter the room and step into the wardrobe, secrets shared {{by some of the}} characters are revealed, with various allusions to incestuous relationships, child sexual abuse and adultery. The humour is both dark and British, with references to past unhappiness and polite but awkward interactions.|$|E
2500|$|Kari Matchett has the {{distinction}} of playing a recurring role (Archie Goodwin's sometime girlfriend Lily Rowan) and a <b>non-recurring</b> role (nightclub singer Julie Jaquette) in the same episode, [...] "Death of a Doxy." [...] Nicky Guadagni has {{the distinction}} of playing two <b>non-recurring</b> characters (a secretary and Mrs. Cramer) in the same episode, [...] "The Silent Speaker." [...] Its ensemble cast gives A Nero Wolfe Mystery {{the effect of a}} series of plays put on by a repertory theatre company.|$|E
2500|$|To emphasise Pepé's cheerful {{dominance}} of the situation, Penelope is always mute (or more precisely, makes only natural cat sounds, albeit with a stereotypical [...] "le" [...] before each one) in these stories; only the self-deluded Pepé speaks (several <b>non-recurring</b> human characters are given minimal dialogue, often {{nothing more than a}} repulsed, [...] "Le pew!").|$|E
2500|$|Norway offered {{incentives}} to help reach {{the goal of}} 50,000 zero emission vehicles by 2018. Electrics are exempt from all <b>non-recurring</b> vehicle fees, making electric cars price competitive with conventional cars. BEVs are exempt from the annual road tax, public parking fees and toll payments (including domestic ferries), as well as given access to bus lanes. These incentives were to be in effect {{until the end of}} 2017 or until the goal was achieved. PHEVs have a smaller market than BEVs because they are not eligible for the same incentives. [...] In 2013 the government reduced taxes for to improve PHEV sales.|$|E
2500|$|Other notable {{variations}} include Shore changing melodies from descending to rising, {{a device}} {{applied to all}} the Mordor motifs in Return of the King, but {{not one of those}} is labeled a separate theme in the book. He also takes the Nazgul harmonies and sets them to a choir for the Witch King's battle with Eowyn and while that figure is <b>non-recurring,</b> it is a device that he also used with other themes like Thorin's in An Unexpected Journey. There is a two-beat variation of the Mordor Skip-Beat used in [...] "the most frenetic situations" [...] which can be described as a separate chase motif.|$|E
2500|$|The Parliament of Norway set {{the goal}} to reach 50,000 zero {{emission}} vehicles by 2018. Among the existing incentives, all-electric cars are exempt in Norway from all <b>non-recurring</b> vehicle fees, including purchase taxes, which are extremely high for ordinary cars, and 25% VAT on purchase, together making electric car purchase price competitive with conventional cars. As an example, by early 2013 {{the price of the}} top selling Nissan Leaf is 240,690 kroner (around [...] ) while the purchase price of the 1.3-lt Volkswagen Golf is 238,000 Krone (about [...] ). Electric vehicles are also exempt from the annual road tax, all public parking fees, and toll payments, as well as being able to use bus lanes.|$|E
2500|$|A threat {{representative}} Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM) {{target for}} operational open-air testing {{has become an}} immediate test resource need. China is fielding the DF-21D ASBM, which threatens U.S. and allied surface warships in the Western Pacific. While the Missile Defense Agency has exo-atmospheric targets in development, no program currently exists for an endo-atmospheric target. The endo-atmospheric ASBM target is the Navy’s responsibility, {{but it is not}} currently budgeted. The Missile Defense Agency estimates the <b>non-recurring</b> expense to develop the exo-atmospheric target was $30 million with each target costing an additional $30 million; the endo-atmospheric target will be more expensive to produce according to missile defense analysts. Numerous Navy acquisition programs will require an ASBM surrogate in the coming years, although a limited number of targets (3-5) may be sufficient to validate analytical models ...|$|E
