40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to study {{the influence of the}} occupational nickel exposure on the concentration of nickel in nasal mucosa, plasma and urine. Plasma, urine and biopsy specimens of nasal mucosa from 318 nickel workers, 15 retired nickel workers and 57 non-exposed controls were analyzed for nickel by atomic absorption spectrometry. The results showed that nickel exposure led significantly to raised nickel concentration in nasal mucosa, plasma and urine both in active and retired nickel workers. The average nickel concentration in the nasal mucosa was highest in workers exposed to the highest atmospheric nickel concentration, inhaled as <b>nickel</b> <b>subsulphide</b> and oxide dust. Workers exposed to aerosols of nickel chloride and sulphate at a lower atmospheric nickel concentation had, on the other hand, the highest mean nickel concentration in plasma and urine. The mucosal, plasma and urine nickel concentration were significantly corre lated to duration of nickel exposure. The accumulated nickel in the nasal mucosa was retained for years after term ination of the nickel exposure, and slowly released with an estim ated half-life of 3. 5 years. 28, 29, 30 increased incidence of nasal cancer at a Norwegian nickel refinery was reported by Pedersen et al in 1973. 17 Tor-jussen and Solberg 28, 29 made histological examinations of nasal biopsies from nickel workers at the same refinery and found an increased incidence o f carcinom a and dysplasia of the surface epithelium, par ticularly in process workers exposed to high atmospheric nickel concentration. As a local carcinogenic effect is sus pected in nasal carcinoma in nickel ex...|$|E
