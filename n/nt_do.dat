40|$|The {{possible}} {{involvement of}} endogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK) and neurotensin (NT) {{in the control}} of thymocyte proliferation has been investigated in vivo in the immature rat. For this task, we have studied {{the effects of the}} administration of selective antagonists of the receptors of the three neuropeptides on the mitotic index (% of metaphase-arrested cells after vincristin injection) of thymocytes. Both CCK- and TN-receptor antagonists were ineffective. In contrast, two VIP receptor antagonists (VIP-As) enhanced the mitotic index of thymocytes. VIP reversed the effect of VIP-As, but when administered alone it did not alter the mitotic activity of thymocytes. In light of these findings, we conclude that endogenous VIP exerts a maximal tonic inhibitory influence on the basal proliferative activity of rat thymocytes, while endogenous CCK and <b>NT</b> <b>do</b> not play a relevant modulatory role in this process...|$|E

While we use the radial range from 11 to 12 jovian radii for computing our index, the same values for the index would be obtained over a wide range of radial distances. The present internal field as deduced from the Galileo fluxgate magnetometer data differs somewhat from earlier models. Whether this is due to secular variation or due to errors in the original models is difficult to determine. We obtain a dipole longitude of 160. 0 ’+ 0. 6 ” and a tilt of 9. 8 “ + 0. 1 ”...|$|E

We analyze the statistical properties of IMF Bs at 1 AU using in situ observations {{for more than}} a solar cycle (1995 – 2010). IMF Bs events are defined as continuous IMF Bs intervals with varying thresholds of Bs magnitude and duration and categorized by different solar wind structures, such as magnetic cloud (MC), interplanetary small‐scale magnetic flux rope, interplanetary coronal mass ejection without MC signature (ejecta), stream interacting region, and Shock, as well as events unrelated with well‐defined solar wind structures.

Here {{we set out}} to identify the 5 ' and 3 ' extremities of TED and features of these sequences with respect to translation. We found that both in wheat germ extract and in tobacco protoplasts, the 5 ' border is confined to 3 nt.

Diffusion of new organizational techniques was also slow.

40|$|Plant viruses often contain parasites {{of their}} own, {{referred}} to as satellites. Satellite RNAs are dependent on their associated (helper) virus for both replication and encapsidation. Satellite RNAs vary from 194 to approximately 1, 500 nucleotides (nt). The larger satellites (900 to 1, 500 nt) contain open reading frames and express proteins in vitro and in vivo, whereas the smaller satellites (194 to 700 <b>nt)</b> <b>do</b> not appear to produce functional proteins. The smaller satellites contain {{a high degree of}} secondary structure involving 49 to 73 % of their sequences, with the circular satellites containing more base pairing than the linear satellites. Many of the smaller satellites produce multimeric forms during replication. There are various models to account for their formation and role in satellite replication. Some of these smaller satellites encode ribozymes and are able to undergo autocatalytic cleavage. The enzymology of satellite replication is poorly understood, as is the replication of their helper viruses. In many cases the coreplication of satellites suppresses the replication of the helper virus genome. This is usually paralleled by a reduction in the disease induced by the helper virus; however, there are notable exceptions in which the satellite exacerbates the pathogenicity of the helper virus, albeit on {{only a limited number of}} hosts. The ameliorative satellites are being assessed as biocontrol agents of virus-induced disease. In greenhouse studies, satellites have been known to "spontaneously" appear in virus cultures. The possible origin of satellites will be briefly considered...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the ability of three methods, {{alkaline}} elution (AE), nick translation (NT), and single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE), to detect DNA single-strand breaks (ssb) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (HPBL) exposed in vitro to three genotoxic agents: -rays, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE). The ultimate objective is to select the most feasible, sensitive, and reproducible method for the monitoring of populations exposed to genotoxic agents. AE and <b>NT</b> <b>do</b> not seem suitable assays. AE is able to detect DNA lesions induced by the three compounds, but only at relatively high doses (2 Gy, 5 mM EMS and 20 μM BPDE). With NT, DNA alterations induced by γ-rays are not detected and ssb are only evidenced after exposure to EMS (80 mM), which already alters the viability of the lymphocytes. Nick translation is able to detect ssb induced by 10 μM BPDE. Compared to the other assays, the sensitivity of the SCGE assay is significantly higher since statistically significant changes were detected after incubation with 0. 5 mM EMS and 1. 25 μM BDPE. SCGE is a relatively simple method, not time-consuming and applicable to a large number of samples per working day. In conclusion, on the basis of the results of this in vitro comparison, SCGE seems a promising method for the monitoring of populations exposed to genotoxic chemicals.

We show that mutations of nucleotide sequence or base pair structure {{of any of the}} 3 ′-terminal 6 <b>nt</b> <b>do</b> not significantly affect viral translation, but exert discrete effects on RNA replication. (i) The flavivirus-conserved terminal 3 ′ U is optimal for WN virus replication. Replacement of the wild-type 3 ′ U with a purine A or G resulted in a substantial reduction in RNA replication, with a complete reversion to the wild-type sequence. In contrast, replacement with a pyrimidine C resulted in a replication level {{similar to that of the}} 3 ′ A or G mutants, with only partial reversion. (ii) The flavivirus-conserved 3 ′ penultimate C and two upstream nucleotides (positions 78 and 79), which potentially base pair with the 3 ′-terminal CUOH, are absolutely essential for viral replication. (iii) The base pair structures, but not the nucleotide sequences at the 3 rd (U) and the 4 th (A) positions, are critical for RNA replication. (iv) The nucleotide sequences of the 5 th (G) position and its base pair nucleotide (C) are essential for viral replication. (v) Neither the sequence nor the base pair structure of the 6 th nucleotide (G) is critical for WN virus replication. These results provide strong functional evidence for the existence of the 3 ′ flavivirus-conserved RNA structure, which may function as contact sites for specific assembly of the replication complex or for efficient initiation of minus-sense RNA synthesis...|$|E

Stimulation of lipolytic activity in adipose tissue or inhibition of fat synthesis is one way to prevent these serious diseases. Lactic acid bacteria have an anti-obesity effect, but the mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the administration of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus gasseri NT) on lipid metabolism and fat synthesis in a mouse high-fat-diet model, focusing on visceral fat. Balb/c mice were fed a 45 kcal % fat diet for 13 weeks with and without a freeze-dried preparation of L. gasseri NT (109 CFU/g). An ex vivo glycerol assay with periovarian fat revealed that L. gasseri <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not stimulate lipolytic activity.

Os objetivos deste estudo foram: (a) simular por meio do modelo Century os efeitos de sistemas de produção de milho sob adubação orgânica e mineral sobre a dinâmica da matéria orgânica em um Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo, e (b) comparar os estoques de C orgânico total (COT), N total (NT) e dos compartimentos de C medidos por meio de métodos de laboratório e estimados pelo modelo Century na camada {{superficial}} (0 - 20 cm). A área em estudo, sob Floresta Atlântica (FA) até o ano de 1930, foi cultivada com milho e feijão por aproximadamente 50 anos, até à instalação do experimento no ano de 1984. Os tratamentos constaram de combinações entre três doses de adubo mineral, correspondentes a de 0, 250 e 500 kg ha- 1 da fórmula 4 - 14 - 8, e duas doses de adubo orgânico (esterco bovino com palha de soja e feijão), nas doses de 0 e 40 m³ ha- 1. Os métodos de laboratório incluíram determinações do COT, do <b>NT,</b> <b>do</b> C da biomassa microbiana (C MIC), representando o compartimento ativo, e do C da fração leve (C FL), referenciando o compartimento lento. O compartimento passivo foi obtido por diferença. A parametrização do modelo Century foi realizada a partir dos dados obtidos no experimento e na literatura, enquanto as simulações da dinâmica do COT, NT e dos compartimentos ativo de C lento e passivo incluíram as mudanças no uso da terra ocorridas de 1930 a 2050. O modelo Century estimou diminuição nos estoques de COT, NT e dos compartimentos de C desde a derrubada da FA até o início do experimento e apenas nos tratamentos com adubação orgânica foi observada recuperação desses estoques. O CmIC e o C FL foram mais sensíveis às mudanças no manejo do que o COT, o que indica a importância desses compartimentos no estudo da dinâmica da matéria orgânica, especialmente em solos tropicais. Os estoques de COT, NT e dos compartimentos de C (lento e passivo), simulados pelo modelo Century, foram similares aos estoques medidos. Os estoques de COT (em Mg ha- 1 de C), medidos e simulados pelo modelo Century, foram bem correlacionados (R² = 0, 93; p Simulation {{models are}} essential instruments to understand {{soil organic matter}} dynamics and the turnover of its pools in tropical soils. The objectives of this study were: (a) simulate the effects of maize production systems under organic and mineral fertilization on soil organic matter dynamics of an Ultisol using the Century model; (b) to compare total carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen stocks (TN) and the carbon pools (C) measured in the laboratory and estimated by the Century model for the surface soil layer (0 - 20 cm). The study area {{had been part of}} the Atlantic Forest (FA) until 1930. After that it had been used for maize/bean production up to 1984, when the field experiment was set up. The treatments included a combination of three levels of mineral fertilizer at doses of 0, 250 and 500 kg ha- 1 of the 4 - 14 - 8 formula and two levels of organic fertilizer (animal manure with soybean and bean straw) at doses of 0 and 40 m³ ha- 1. Laboratory determinations included TOC and TN, microbial biomass C representing the active C pool and carbon of the light fraction representing the slow C pool. The passive C pool was determined by difference. The Century model was parameterized with data from the present experiment and from literature, whereas the simulations of the dynamics of TOC, TN and the active, slow, and passive pool included land use changes between 1930 and 2050. The Century model estimated a decrease in TOC, TN and the different carbon pools between the slash and burn of the Atlantic Forest until the establishment of the field experiment. Only in the treatments with organic fertilization it was observed a recovery of these pools. Biomass carbon and the carbon of the light fraction were more sensitive to changes in management than TOC. This highlights the relevance of these pools in studies of organic matter dynamics, particularly in tropical soils. Measured and simulated values of TOC (in Mg ha- 1 of C) were well correlated (R² = 0. 93; p < 0. 01). This was also observed for the active (R² = 0. 84; p < 0. 05), the slow (R² = 0. 87; p < 0. 05) and the passive (R² = 0. 91; p < 0. 05) C pools.

Microsoft {{realized they}} were in need of {{an updated version of}} Windows that could support 32-bit applications and preemptive multitasking, but could still run on low-end hardware (Windows <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not). So the development of Windows [...] "Chicago" [...] was started and, as it was planned for a late 1993 release, became known as Windows 93. Initially, the decision was made not to include a new user interface, as this was planned for Cairo, and only focus on making installation, configuration, and networking easier. Windows 93 would ship together with MS-DOS 7.0, offering a more integrated experience to the user and making it pointless for other companies to create DOS clones. MS-DOS 7.0 was in development at that time under the code name [...] "Jaguar" [...] and could optionally run on top of a Windows 3.1-based 32-bit protected mode kernel called [...] "Cougar" [...] in order to better compete with DR-DOS. The first version of Chicago's feature specification was finished on September 30, 1992. Cougar was to become Chicago's kernel.|$|R
5000|$|Nt or Zw are system calls {{declared}} in ntdll.dll and ntoskrnl.exe. When called from ntdll.dll in user mode, {{these groups are}} almost exactly the same; they trap into kernel mode and call the equivalent function in ntoskrnl.exe via the SSDT. When calling the functions directly in ntoskrnl.exe (only possible in kernel mode), the Zw variants ensure kernel mode, whereas the <b>Nt</b> variants <b>do</b> not. The Zw prefix does not stand for anything.|$|R
