40|$|Radiocarbon dating of peat has its {{intrinsic}} problems. This {{is often}} caused by mobile organic fractions. For the Weichselian Pleniglacial, another methodological problem arises: {{the limit of}} the 14 C dating method. This is {{discussed in terms of}} bulk (i. e. <b>non-selected</b> <b>material,</b> generally dated conventionally) vs AMS (i. e. selected botanical remains) dates, contamination, background and calibration, guided by a series of peat samples from the Belgian/Dutch border. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} report (Loomis, Jesseph and Beyer, 1952) {{on the use of}} conjugates of heparin in animals as a form of {{repository}} anticoagulant medication, the butacaine-heparin preparation appeared to possess particularly desirable prop-erties. This preparation was apparently painless on intramuscular injection. The rate of absorption was sufficiently prolonged so that approximately 24 hours duration of effect was uniformly obtained. Systemic toxicity was completely absent and only minimal local tissue toxicity was observed in that study. Be-cause of these desirable properties in a repository heparin preparation, the prep-aration was tested in the clinic. The present report is concerned with the dosage, duration of effect and toxicity of the butacaine-heparin conjugate in <b>non-selected</b> hospitalized subjects. <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS. The preparation of the conjugate has been described in a previous article (Loomms, Jesseph and Beyer, 1952). All preparations used in this study were sterilized in the autoclave at 15 pounds pressure for 15 minutes. The final preparation which was used consisted of a sterile suspension of finely divided, crystallmne-lmke, white to slightl...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{infection}} {{ability of}} miracidia of BH and SJ strains of S. mansoni, obtained front mice infected with cercariae taken from Biomphalaria glabrata and Biomphalaria tenagophila, genetically selected for susceptibility is {{compared with the}} infection ability of miracidia obtained from mice infected with larvae from <b>non-selected</b> mollusks. <b>Material</b> and Method Progeny of S. mansoni resulting from successive infections of selected mollusk sproduced various generations of selected miracidia. Selecion of B. glabrata and B. tengophila {{was carried out by}} autofertilization of mollusks susceptible to the BH and SJ strains of S. mansoni. Five generations of mollusks (from parental down to F 4), were used in the experiment. Tests for the infectiousness of the miracidia used 10 larvae; susceptibility was checked starting on day 30 after infection, for 90 days, through observation for the presence of cercariae. Results The results showed that susceptibility of the the selected mollusks {{in the face of the}} respective sympatric strains was not altered by the selection process of S. mansoni. However F 4 miracidia of the BH strain were more infectant for non-selected B. glabrata than parental miracidia of the same strain. Miracidia of BH and SJ strains, parental generation, and BH strain, F 3 generation, showed the same infectiousness in selected B. glabrata. Nevertheless, these mollusks had distinct infection rates from allopatric selected miracidia (SJ strain, F 4 generation). The generation of successive successive infections of S. mansoni SJ in selected B. tenagophila resulted in the adaptation of the worm strain to the species of mollusk. B. tenagophila was never susceptible to the BH strain, even when selected mollusks and trematodes were employed. The susceptibility/infectiousness of the pair B. tenagophila-SJ S. mansoni strain was only changed by the selection process of the mollusks. Conclusion As non-selected B. glabrata were more intensively-infected by selected BH miracidia than by non-selected BH miracidia, one is led to surmise that the greater pathogenicity of S. mansoni from susceptible mollusks implies the greater infection ability of these miracidia...|$|R
40|$|Eucalyptus globulus {{is widely}} planted in {{temperate}} regions to produce pulp for its high performance but few {{studies of the}} impact of Mycosphaerella Leaf Disease (MLD) have been documented. This study aimed to explore and provide knowledge on disease in the management of young Eucalyptus globulus stands in the north of Spain. The influences of subspecies, cloning, and fertilization on the degree of severity of the disease were analyzed. The study was conducted with different material plants of Eucalyptus globulus, of Australian origin, from other sources, open-pollinated families, clones, and families of controlled pollination. Each series tested different vegetal material, except for a number of control codes that were used as reference samples for MLD evaluation. Severity, height at which foliage changes from juvenile to adult, total height, and volume were all measured. There were significant correlations in the average MLD severity of families and provenances obtained from the different trials. ANOVA revealed important differences between subspecies of E. globulus. A correlation was found between the percentage of adult leaf and the severity. There were differences in the impact of MLD between plant <b>material</b> <b>non-selected</b> and selected by its tolerance (p < 0. 0001). There was a significant effect on the severity between mature cuttings and families from seed non-selected in their tolerance to MLD. Their tolerance was lower than that achieved from seed selected by its tolerance to MLD. Genetic selection was shown as the best strategy since there are individuals exceptionally tolerant to MLD...|$|R

OBJETIVO: Comparar a capacidade de infecção de miracídios das linhagens BH e SJ de S. mansoni, obtidos de camundongos infectados com cercárias oriundas de Biomphalaria glabrata e B. tenagophila, selecionadas geneticamente para a susceptibilidade, com miracídios obtidos de camundongos infectados com larvas procedentes de moluscos não selecionados. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Progenies de S. mansoni foram obtidas das passagens sucessivas pelos moluscos selecionados, obtendo-se assim gerações de miracídios selecionados. A seleção de B. glabrata e B. tenagophila foi realizada através da autofecundação dos moluscos susceptíveis, frente às respectivas linhagnes BH e SJ do trematódeo. Foram obtidas 5 gerações de moluscos (P a F 4). Os testes de infecciosidade dos miracídios foram realizados utilizando-se 10 larvas e a susceptibilidade verificada após 30 dias e durante 3 meses, através da detecção da eliminação de cercárias. RESULTADOS: Evidenciou-se que a susceptibilidade de moluscos selecionados, confrontada com as respectivas linhagens simpátricas, não foi alterada pelo processo de selecão das linhagens do trematódeo, porém miracídios BHF 4 foram mais infectantes frente a B. glabrata não selecionada do que miracídios BHP. A seleção de B. glabrata propiciou sua infecção de modo semelhante com miracídios BHP, SJP e BHF 3. Esses moluscos não apresentaram a mesma capacidade de infecção frente a miracídios alopátricos selecionados (SJF 4). A passagem sucessiva do S. mansoni SJ em B. tenagophila selecionada ajustou essa linhagem para essa espécie de molusco. B. tenagophila nunca foi susceptível à linhagem BH, mesmo utilizando moluscos e trematódeos selecionados. A susceptibilidade/infecciosidade do binomio B. tenagophila - linhagem SJ só foi alterada pelo processo de seleção do molusco. CONCLUSÕES: Como miracídios BH selecionados infectaram, de forma mais intensa, B. glabrata não selecionada do que miracídios BH não selecionados, conclui-se que a maior patogenicidade do S. mansoni, oriundo de moluscos mais susceptíveis, implica maior capacidade de infecção desses miracídios...|$|R
