50|$|In logic gates, logical {{functions}} are performed by parallel or series connected switches (such as relay contacts or insulated gate FETs like CMOS) controlled by logical inputs or parallel resistors or diodes which are passive components. Diode logic is implemented by diodes which exhibit low impedance when forward biased {{and a very}} high impedance when reverse biased. There {{are two kinds of}} diode logic gates - OR and AND. It is not possible to construct <b>NOT</b> (<b>Invert)</b> diode gates because the <b>NOT</b> or <b>Invert</b> function requires an active component such as a transistor.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} low temperature spin configurations, investigating the magnetization profile of the local states due to the impurities and the two point correlation function centered {{in one of the}} impurities. This correlation is found to be weak against temperature effects although the magnetization profile in the triplet state is visible up to higher temperatures. Here we introduce a loop cluster quantum Monte-Carlo method with a fixed magnetization Mz in order to study the correlations in the ground state of a given value of Mz. From the population distribution of magnetization, the very small energy gap between the quasi degenerate states due to the impurities is obtained. Comment: 13 pages, 16 figures.

40|$|Infant face {{processing}} {{becomes more}} selective during the fi rst {{year of life}} as a function of varying experience with distinct face categories defi ned by species, race, and age. Given that any individual face belongs to many such categories (e. g. A young Caucasian man’s face) we asked how the neural selectivity for one aspect of facial appearance was affected by category membership along another dimension of variability. 6 -month-old infants were shown upright and <b>inverted</b> <b>pictures</b> of either their own mother or a stranger while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. We found that the amplitude of the P 400 (a face-sensitive ERP component) was only sensitive to the orientation of the mother’s face, suggesting that “tuning” of the neural response to faces is realized jointly across multiple dimensions of face appearance...|$|R
