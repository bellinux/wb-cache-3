5000|$|A {{report about}} Sans Everything by David Roxan in the News of the World {{triggered}} letters of concern from staff and former staff about other hospitals. [...] Roxan forwarded {{them to the}} Ministry. One concerned Ely Hospital, Cardiff. The Welsh Hospital Board set up a committee of inquiry into conditions at Ely chaired by Geoffrey Howe. Howe had recently represented the Coal Board managers at the inquiry into the Aberfan disaster, so had experience of an inquiry into neglect in the public sector. Howe conducted the Ely Inquiry rigorously, and avoided the biased processes of the Sans Everything inquiries. [...] He meticulously weighed all the evidence from the whistle-blower, <b>nursing</b> <b>auxiliary</b> Michael Pantelides. The committee upheld most of Pantelides' allegations, which {{were similar to those}} in Sans Everything, including ill-treatment of patients, victimization of staff who complained and inadequate hospital management. Howe wanted his full report published. Crossman (Robinson had since left the Ministry of Health), fearful of Howe's legal skills and Robb's relationship with the press, agreed. The day Crossman revealed the Ely Inquiry findings in the Commons, he also announced plans to establish an NHS hospitals' inspectorate to help ensure higher standards. [...] The Ely Inquiry, along with those at Farleigh, Whittingham and South Ockendon, vindicated Robb and Sans Everything, although the NHS authorities made no public apology. Sans Everything faded from the agenda and from history, while the other inquiries, especially Ely, achieved highly regarded status.|$|E

As at May that year, the Legion was organised into a first aid and home <b>nursing</b> <b>auxiliary,</b> a transport division (which included horse and mechanised transport units) a land workers' section, a communication unit, despatch riders, a cooking unit and the air wing section. By July 1940 there were six different organisations training women for war work in the Brisbane region. Ryan {{and the members of the}} other organisations rejected a proposal made by The Courier-Mail that the six organisations be combined, however. At this time the WNEL had 4,000 members, of whom 1,600 were located in Brisbane, and included a transport section and an air unit. It also provided training in first aid, field cooking, physical fitness and radio communications. At about this time the WNEL also became affiliated with the British First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. The WNEL and other war-related women's organisations prominently participated in the 1941 Brisbane Exhibition. In late 1941 General Thomas Blamey, the commander of the Australian Imperial Force, stated that Australian women should prepare to work in the national economy rather than train to be dispatch riders or signalers. In response, Ryan argued that [...] "The whole situation will be changed if the enemy attacks our shores. Then women would have to be utilised in many more ways than seems likely at present. So we'll go on training".|$|E

These services are new to the rural communities served by rural health centers (RHCs). The objective of this project was to test whether the demand for these newly introduced services would increase at the rural health centers (RHCs) if a promotional brochure was distributed in the surrounding communities by the RHC’s clients. The <b>nurse</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> gave ten-minute talks at the RHCs and asked clinic clients to distribute the brochures among potentially interested friends in their communities. Twelve rural health centers (RHCs) participated in the study: six in the experimental group where brochures were distributed, and six in the control group, where no special activity was conducted.

40|$|Objectives: Responding {{a demand}} from {{the centre of}} elderly abused persons (Centre d’Aide aux Personnes Âgées Maltraitées CAPAM) the general {{medicine}} department of the Liège University conducted a qualitative research on the elderly abuse performed at home. Methods: A half structured guide of interview concerning the health workers and their feelings and needs when looking after abused elderly people living at home was given to an interviewer. While performing the research, he recorded the nine focus groups chatting about elderly abused (in each group, they were 10 GP, <b>nurses</b> or <b>nurses</b> <b>auxiliary).</b> Results:General practitioners are mostly concerned by financial abuses, on the other hand, <b>nurses</b> and <b>auxiliaries</b> mostly talk about psychological or indifferent behaviours in elderly abused. Everyone talks about family and professional neglects. GP‘s behaviours are eventually criticised by <b>nurses</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> as well.

40|$|Six {{cases are}} {{described}} of Beau’s lines (transverse grooves in the fingernails) developing after injuries to the hand involving damage to nerves and flexor tendons. The literature is reviewe Transverse depressions of the fingernails were first described by Beau in 1846 {{and are therefore}} known as Beau’s lines. They {{are thought to be}} due to inhibition of nail growth, although it is not known how this is mediated. They have not previously been reported after injury to the hand. Case reports Case one A 46 -year-old right-handed <b>nursing</b> <b>auxiliary</b> fell while holding a glass, sustaining three lacerations of the right palm. Flexor digitorum profundus, flexor digitorum superficialis, both digital nerves to the index, middle, ring and little fingers and the radial digital nerve to the thumb were divided. Following repair of the tendons with Kessler sutures and epineural repair of the nerves, gross oedema of the hand prevented primary wound closure. A split skin graft was therefore applied three days later and the hand was immobilised on a plaster-of-paris back-slab for four weeks. Despite prolonged physiotherapy, only a fair return of function of the hand was achieved. Seven months post-operatively, a transverse depression on each fingernail of the injured hand was noticed, extending across the whole width of the nail (Fig. 1). When first seen each depression was five mm distal to the nail-fold (Fig. 2); they subsequently moved distally with nail growth and eventually disappeared.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{nosocomial}} TB risk and recommend appropriate risk management procedure for the trauma {{ward of the}} emergency department at a university hospital in Bangkok. Material and Method: The risk assessment procedure includes: (1) estimating the number of healthcare visits of the TB patients at the trauma ward of emergency department in 2004; (2) determining the TB incidence rate among the healthcare workers (HCWs) of the trauma ward during 2004 - 2005; and (3) surveying the indoor environment (particularly concerning the ventilation condition) of the targeting ward. Appropriate risk management procedures were then recommended based on the guidelines provided by The World Health Organization (WHO) and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States. Results: The estimated number of healthcare visits of the TB patient at the trauma ward in 2004 was 20. During 2004 - 2005, there were 4 out of 57 HCWs at the trauma ward who developed tuberculosis; among these were two registered nurses and two nursing auxiliaries. The TB incidence rates among these HCWs were 3, 509 per 100, 000 person-year overall (or 2, 632 per 100, 000 person-year for confirmed TB cases only) and 3, 333 (or 1, 667 for confirmed TB cases only) and 4, 761 per 100, 000 person-year for registered nurse and <b>nursing</b> <b>auxiliary.</b> The ventilation in the trauma inpatient ward had 1. 43 air changes per hour, which was below the recommended standard value.

40|$|Background: Little {{research}} has been conducted in private nursing schools with regard to the educator–student relationship to strengthen the resilience of nursing students and to improve the educator–student relationship. An effective educator–student relationship is a key factor to ensure a positive learning climate where learning can take place and resilience can be strengthened. Purpose: The purpose was to explore and describe nursing students’ view on the basic elements required for an effective educator–student relationship to strengthen their resilience and the educator–student relationship. Method: This study followed an explorative, descriptive and contextual qualitative design in a private nursing education institution in the North West Province. Purposive sampling was used. The sample consisted of 40 enrolled <b>nursing</b> <b>auxiliary</b> students. The World Café Method was used to collect data, which were analysed by means of content analysis. Results: The following five main themes were identified and included: (1) teaching–learning environment, (2) educator–student interaction, (3) educator qualities, (4) staying resilient and (5) strategies to strengthen resilience. Conclusion: Students need a caring and supportive environment; interaction that is constructive, acknowledges human rights and makes use of appropriate non-verbal communication. The educator must display qualities such as love and care, respect, responsibility, morality, patience, being open to new ideas, motivation, willingness to ‘go the extra mile’ and punctuality. Students reported on various ways how they manage to stay resilient. It thus seems that basic elements required in an effective educator–student relationship to strengthen the resilience of students include the environment, interaction, educator and student’s qualities and resilience.
