5|$|Since {{devolution}} in 1999, Scotland has devolved stronger working relations {{across the}} two other devolved governments, the Welsh Government and <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive.</b> Whilst there are no formal concordats between the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive,</b> ministers from each devolved government meet at various points throughout the year at various {{events such as the}} British-Irish Council and also meet to discuss matters and issues that is devolved to each government. Scotland, along with the Welsh Government, British Government as well as the <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>executive,</b> participate in the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) which allows each government to discuss policy issues together and work together across each government to find solutions. The Scottish Government considers the successful re-establishment of the Plenary, and establishment of the Domestic fora to be important facets of the relationship with the UK Government and the other devolved administrations.|$|E
5|$|In May 1974 unionists {{called a}} general strike to protest against the Sunningdale Agreement – an attempt at power-sharing, setting up a <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive</b> and a {{cross-border}} Council of Ireland, which {{would have given the}} Government of Ireland a voice in running Northern Ireland. During that strike on 17 May, the UVF carried out the Dublin and Monaghan car bombings, which killed 33 civilians. The Provisional IRA were suspected by British police of bombing two pubs in the English city of Birmingham the following November, resulting in 21 deaths.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive</b> {{allocated}} £138million for a {{major programme}} of stadium redevelopment throughout Northern Ireland, with £28million allocated to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. In June 2012, further details of the stadium's redevelopment were released. The plan was to redevelop Windsor Park into an 18,000 all-seater stadium {{with a series of}} phased works originally intended to begin in the middle of 2013. The redevelopment would include the demolition of the existing East and South Stand structures, to be replaced by new purpose built stands that would partially enclose the stadium; complete renovation of the existing North and West Stands; and construction of both new conferencing facilities and a new headquarters facility for the IFA.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive</b> and Assembly have powers {{similar to}} those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a diarchy {{representing}} unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly. Arlene Foster (Democratic Unionist Party) and Martin McGuinness (Sinn Féin) were First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively until 2017. Devolution to Northern Ireland is contingent on participation by the Northern Ireland administration in the North-South Ministerial Council, where the <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive</b> cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the Government of Ireland. The British and Irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting Northern Ireland through the British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which assumes {{the responsibilities of the}} Northern Ireland administration in the event of its non-operation.|$|E

25|$|On 13 May 2006, it was {{announced}} that when the Northern Ireland Assembly reconvened, Ervine would join the Ulster Unionist assembly group, while remaining leader of the Progressive Unionists.

25|$|When Sinn Féin came to {{nominate}} its two ministers to the <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive,</b> for tactical reasons the party, like the SDLP and the DUP, {{chose not to}} include its leader among its ministers.

25|$|The Assembly is a unicameral, {{democratically elected}} body {{comprising}} 90 members known as Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). Members are elected under the {{single transferable vote}} form of proportional representation. In turn, the Assembly selects most of the ministers of the <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive</b> using the principle of power-sharing under the D'Hondt method to ensure that Northern Ireland's largest voting blocs, unionists and Irish nationalists, both participate in governing the region.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{suspension}} occurred after unionists {{withdrew from the}} <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive</b> after Sinn Féin's offices at Stormont were raided by the police, who were investigating allegations of intelligence gathering {{on behalf of the}} IRA by members of the party's support staff. The Assembly, already suspended, dissolved on 28 April 2003 as scheduled, but the elections due the following month were postponed by the United Kingdom government and were not held until November that year.|$|E

25|$|Nationalists {{pointed to}} this {{to argue that}} the use of the Union Flag for {{official}} purposes should be restricted, or that the Irish tricolour should be flown alongside the British flag on government buildings. Sinn Féin ministers in the power-sharing <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive</b> instructed that the Union Flag was not to fly from buildings operated by their respective departments.

25|$|In 2016, the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance Party {{decided not}} to accept the seats on the <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive</b> to which {{they would have been}} {{entitled}} and to form an official opposition to the executive. This marked the first time since 1921 that a devolved government in Northern Ireland did not include the UUP. The party was led by Mike Nesbitt, but on 3 March 2017 he announced his resignation following the party's poor performance at that year's assembly election.|$|E

Labour had shifted its policies closer to the political centre, under the new slogan 'New Labour'. The Bank of England was given independence over monetary policy and Scotland and Wales were both given a devolved Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly respectively. A devolved power sharing <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Executive</b> was established in 1998, believed {{by many to be}} the end of The Troubles.|$|E
