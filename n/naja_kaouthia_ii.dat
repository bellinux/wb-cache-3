40|$|Snake venoms {{comprise}} a highly complex mixture of proteins, which requires for their characterization {{the use of}} versatile two-dimensional electrophoresis techniques. In the present study, venoms obtained from eight snakes (Ophiophagus hannah, <b>Naja</b> <b>kaouthia,</b> <b>Naja</b> sumatrana, Bungarus fasciatus, Trimeresurus sumatranus, Tropidolaemus wagleri, Enhydrina schistosa and Calloselasma rhodostoma) commonly found in Malaysia were separated based on two independent properties, isoelectric point (pI) and molecular weight (MW). Many differences in snake venoms at the inter-family, inter-subfamily, inter-genus and inter-species levels were revealed. Notably, proteins from individuals of the Viperidae family - Trimeresurus sumatranus, Tropidolaemus wagleri and Calloselasma rhodostoma - {{were found to be}} numerous and scattered by the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DE) specifically in regions between 37 and 100 kDa compared to the Elapidae venom proteins. The latter were clustered at the basic and lower molecular mass region (less than 20 kDa). Trains of spots were commonly observed, indicating that these proteins may be derived from post-translational modifications. Ophiophagus hannah (Elapidae) revealed a great amount of protein spots in the higher molecular mass range when compared to Enhydrina schistosa, <b>Naja</b> <b>kaouthia,</b> <b>Naja</b> sumatrana and Bungarus fasciatus.

40|$|A fibrinogenolytic toxin of {{molecular}} weight 6. 5 kDa has been purified from the venom of Indian monocled cobra (<b>Naja</b> <b>kaouthia)</b> by repeated cation exchange chromatography on CM-sephadex C- 50. The purified toxin {{did not show}} any phospholipase activity but was mildly hemolytic on human erythrocytes. This toxin, called Lahirin, cleaved fibrinogen in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The digestion process apparently started with the Aα chain, and gradually other lower-molecular-weight chains were also cleaved to low-molecular-weight peptides. The fibrinolytic activity was completely lost after treatment with ethylene di-amine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). However, exposure to 100 °C for 1 min or pre-treatment with phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) {{did not affect the}} fibrinolytic activity.

40|$|The {{protective}} {{activity of}} some antivenoms on the neuromuscular activity in vitro of six snake venoms {{was established in}} order to test the feasibility of using a simple isolated nerve-muscle preparation to compare different antivenoms. Six venoms designated as International Reference Venoms by the World Health Organization (WHO) were used: Echis carinatus (Iran), Echis carinatus (Mali), <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>kaouthia,</b> Notechis scutatus, Trimeresurus flavoviridis, and Vipera russelli (Thailand). The chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation was used to detect neurotoxic and myotoxic effects. The ratio of the amount of antivenom needed to neutralize a dose of venom (w/w) was calculated in order to quantify the potencies of the antivenoms. The antivenom to venom ratios were 1000 for Echis carinatus (Mali) and for Notechis scutatus; 100 for <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>kaouthia</b> and Vipera russelli; and 10 for Echis carinatus (Iran) and Trimeresurus falvoviridis.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{specific}} features of the clinical course of acute intoxications with venoms due to the bites of Naja (cobra) <b>naja</b> and <b>Naja</b> <b>kaouthia</b> and those of intensive therapy in patients with the severest forms of this condition. Subjects and methods. Two clinical cases of acute intoxications with venoms due to Naja <b>naja</b> and <b>Naja</b> <b>kaouthia</b> bites were examined. The specific features of their clinical picture over time, changes in clinical and biochemical indicators, blood gas composition, and acidbase balance, coagulogram readings, ECG and radiological findings were studied. Results. Acute intoxication with venoms due to serious cobrabites {{was found to be}} characterized by the development of toxicohypoxic encephalopathy, toxic myopathy with skeletal and respiratory muscle paresis to develop acute respiratory and cardiovascular failure, coagulopathy, and metabolic disorders. Specific therapy (with an anti-ophidic serum in one case) resulted in drastically worsening health conditions as fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome. A package of intensive therapy measures should include actions based on general resuscitation approaches — maintenance of life support systems (breathing, blood circulation), anti-sensitizing therapy, correction of metabolic disturbances with substrate antihypoxants (cytofavin, reamberin), and antimicrobial therapy. Conclusion. In the severest acute intoxications due to cobra snakebites, specific therapy methods (with anti-ophidic serum) should be used with extreme caution and particular emphasis should be laid on the general resuscitation-based principles.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Cytotoxins from cobra venom {{are known}} to {{manifest}} cytotoxicity in various cell types. It is widely accepted that the plasma membrane is a target of cytotoxins, but the mechanism of their action remains obscure. Using the confocal spectral imaging technique, we show {{for the first time}} that cytotoxins from cobra venom penetrate readily into living cancer cells and accumulate markedly in lysosomes. Cytotoxins CT 1 and CT 2 from Naja oxiana, CT 3 from <b>Naja</b> <b>kaouthia</b> and CT 1 from Naja haje are demonstrated to possess this property with respect to human lung adenocarcinoma A 549 and promyelocytic leukaemia HL 60 cells. Immobilized plasma membrane binding accompanies the internalization of CT 3 from <b>Naja</b> <b>kaouthia</b> in the HL 60 cells, but it is very weak for other cytotoxins. Detectable membrane binding is not a property of any of the cytotoxins tested in A 549 cells. The kinetics and concentration-dependence of cytotoxin accumulation in lysosomes correlate well with their cytotoxic effects. On the basis of the results obtained, we propose that lysosomes are a primary target of the lytic action of cytotoxins. Plasma membrane permeabilization seems to be a downstream event relative to lysosome rupture. Direct damage to the plasma membrane may be a complementary mechanism, but its relative contribution to the cytotoxic action depends on the cytotoxin structure and cell type...|$|R

Snake venom toxicity was expressed as the venom dose that killed 50 % of the cells (CTC 50) under the assay conditions.

All the viper venoms showed higher cytotoxic potency towards both Vero and MDCK cell lines, in comparison to krait and cobra venoms.
