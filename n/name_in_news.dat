50|$|During the 1980s, sanctioned auto {{races in}} NASCAR and IndyCar began {{to abandon their}} {{traditional}} <b>names</b> <b>in</b> favor of exclusive sponsor names. The trend expanded rapidly in NASCAR such that in 1991, all 29 races in the Winston Cup Series featured sponsor names (including the Daytona 500, which was given a presenting sponsor as the Daytona 500 by STP), {{with little or no}} reference to the original names. As of the 2010s, very few exceptions remain in NASCAR (such as the Daytona 500, which no longer uses the presenting sponsor), and typically races without sponsor names only lack them because a suitable sponsor could not be secured in enough time. IndyCar follows suit, with most races (except the very traditional Indianapolis 500) embracing title sponsorship. Sports media coverage (such as ESPN news reports) typically refer to races by the town in which the home race track is held, avoiding the use of sponsored <b>names</b> <b>in</b> <b>news</b> coverage.|$|R

40|$|We {{have been}} {{developing}} Name-It, {{a system that}} associates faces and <b>names</b> <b>in</b> <b>news</b> videos. First, as the only knowledge source, the system is given news videos which include image sequences and transcripts obtained from audio tracks or closed caption texts. The system can then either infer {{the name of a}} given face and output the name candidates, or can locate the faces <b>in</b> <b>news</b> videos by a name. To accomplish this task, the system extracts faces from image sequences and names from transcripts, both of which might correspond to key persons <b>in</b> <b>news</b> topics. The proposed system takes full advantage of advanced image and natural language processing. The image processing contributes to the extraction of face sequences which provide rich information for face-name association. The processing also helps to select the best frontal view of a face in a face sequence to enhance the face identification which is required for the processing. On the other hand, the natural language processing effectively extracts names by using lexical/grammatical analysis and knowledge of the news video topics structure. The success of our experiments demonstrates the benefits of the advanced image and natural language processing methods and their incorporation. ...|$|R

40|$|Conventionally, the {{identification}} of proper <b>names</b> <b>in</b> arbitrary texts is accomplished by using a surface linguistic approach or a probabilistic approach. The need to use costly tagged corpora is inevitable to both approaches. In addition, the visual examination of proper <b>name</b> surrounding contexts <b>in</b> such corpora is vital in order to utter their local grammar. In this research, we investigate how techniques in corpus linguistics, including frequency, collocation and concordance analyses, {{can be used to}} automatically identify the local grammar of proper <b>names</b> <b>in</b> untagged corpora. If biographical dictionaries are considered {{to be a source of}} knowledge about notable men and women recorded <b>in</b> history, daily <b>news</b> stories might also be regarded as a source of knowledge about personalities currently shaping our world. The local grammar of proper <b>names</b> discussed <b>in</b> this work can be used to automatically acquire such knowledge from journalistic texts. Analysis conducted on news data leads to the observation that there are undoubtedly repetitive patterns used in journalism when describing important personas. These patterns suggest the possibility of a hands-on wealth of both lexical and world knowledge of proper names and making it available for computational consumption. Our approach to handling proper <b>names</b> <b>in</b> <b>news</b> texts is implemented in a system called NExtract. This system comprises three major units: a lexical analyser, a sublanguage parser and a proper name classifier. The key component of NExtract is its sublanguage parser which uses cascades of finite state transducers (implementing the discovered local grammar) to achieve syntax-semantic mapping. We present a small-scale evaluation of NExtract’s performance on samples of unseen news texts, which is held to support the validity of our approach to handling proper names...|$|R
