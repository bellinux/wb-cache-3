40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{communication}} system operating over a Gilbert-Elliot channel is studied. The {{goal of the}} transmitter is to maximize the number of successfully <b>transmitted</b> <b>bits.</b> This is achieved by choosing among three possible actions: (i) betting aggressively by using a weak code that allows the transmission of {{a high number of}} bits but provides no protection against a bad channel, ii) betting conservatively by using a strong code that perfectly protects the <b>transmitted</b> <b>bits</b> against a bad channel but does not allow a high number of data bits, iii) betting opportunistically by sensing the channel for a fixed duration and then deciding which code to use. The problem is formulated and solved using the theory of Markov decision processes (MDPs). It is shown that the optimal strategy has a simple threshold structure.
