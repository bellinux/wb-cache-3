40|$|International audienceThe upper {{circulation}} {{in the southern}} Bay of Biscay is analysed over winter and fall 2004 using a coastal altimetric dataset, moorings, sea surface temperature (SST) observations and a regional simulation from the SYMPHONIE model. The aim is to determine whether altimetric data can detect occurrences of a slope current (the Iberian Poleward Current, IPC). We first analyse in situ and SST data. The results show pulses of a warm surface poleward flow (IPC) limited to the westernmost part of the northern Spanish coast. Along-track TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason- 1 data are analysed over three 'events' (Jan., Feb., and Oct. 2004). Altimetric data can depict the main pulses. They provide some information on their spatial variability but the present in situ dataset is not dense enough to assess this information. Local inconsistencies between <b>neighbouring</b> <b>tracks</b> {{may be related to}} uncertainties in altimetric corrections. The simulated fields are consistent with the in situ observations. They allow us to better understand the IPC subsurface properties and its signature in altimetric data. The ability of altimetry to monitor IPC pulses under any atmospheric conditions or when the SST signature is weak makes it an essential component for the IPC observing system in addition to satellite SST and moorings data...|$|R

40|$|Steel shafts can be {{hardened}} by laser {{using one}} continuous spiral track. This method however {{leads to a}} hardening zone which is not homogeneous in surface hardness and case depth. This is primarily due to the hemispherical shape of the hardening track {{as well as to}} tempering effects between two <b>neighbouring</b> <b>tracks</b> of the spiral. A new method was developed to solve this problem for cylindrical shafts. The laser hardening was performed by rotating the shafts at a very high speed and by heating the shaft with two high power diode lasers of 6 kW each equipped with fiber optics. At the start the shaft is shortly preheated to attain the required hardening temperature. After preheating, the lasers moved along the axis to obtain a continuous hardening zone. Initial hardening tests were performed with 30 mm shafts made of low alloyed steel 42 CrMo 4 V and later the same method was applied for the hardening of shafts with larger diameters up to 60 mm without overlapping. A second application of high speed rotation hardening by diode laser was the inside hardening of small holes drilled in 20 mm steel plates. With other techniques like induction hardening and conventional laser hardening, only a part of the inside surface can be hardened with heterogeneous hardening zones because of overlapping and tempering. The diameters of the holes were 10 and 20 mm. Two steels were tested: 42 CrMo 4 and X 42 Cr 13. By using a fast rotating mirror and a 6 kW diode laser, the inside surface of the holes were hardened with high precision and without overlapping effects. The resulting hardening zones o f both shafts and holes are very homogeneous in hardness and depth. Therefore, the method looks very promising as a new and flexible hardening technique for the heat treatment of shafts, which can compete with other methods like induction hardening. For inside hardening of holes, the described method is even better than induction method especially for hardening small diameter holes...|$|R

50|$|The red Mondo 400-metre {{athletics}} track {{used for}} the London 2012 games was laid in August 2011, possessed nine lanes, and was 13.5 mm thick. It used two vulcanised rubber layers, {{one of which was}} a cushioning underside with elongated diamond-shaped cells, which allowed them to flex in any direction. During the four London 2012 ceremonies, the track was protected via synthetic covering. For the stadium's transformation, the track was protected from construction work for the 2015 events by covering it with a plastic sheet layer and burying it under 75 cm of soil. The Mondotrack surface was removed in early 2016 and a new surface, using 17,000 sqm of the improved Mondotrack/WS, was laid that May. Some of the original running track from (mainly) the home straight was kept so that it could be sold and auctioned to the public, thereby raising money to reinvest into operating the stadium and its <b>neighbouring</b> community <b>track.</b> The grass playing field was lengthened by several metres at either end for the 2015 rugby matches to fit a suitably-sized rugby/football pitch, and was reseeded with a Desso GrassMaster artificial-natural hybrid pitch approved for Premier league matches of 105 by 68 m, ready for West Ham United, complete with undersoil heating. In football/pitch mode, the pitch is surrounded by artificial turf and carpeting that covers the exposed sections of the running track.|$|R
40|$|Thermoluminescence {{dosimeters}} (TLDs) {{are solid}} state detectors {{widely used in}} conventional radiation detection and dose verification. The development of ion beam cancer therapy, and the research in radioprotection in space, stimulated {{the use of the}} TLDs for heavy ions dosimetry. The main advantages of this kind of detector, compared, e. g., to ionization chambers, are the small dimensions, ease of handling, no interference on the radiation field and the usability in solid state phantoms. However the response of TLDs with dose is non-linear. It can be supralinear and is affected by saturation effects as well. The response of these detectors when irradiated with particle beams depends also strongly {{on the quality of the}} radiation. For this reason, in order to use TLDs with particle beams, and specifically to get a prediction of their response in a treatment plan, a model that can reproduce the behavior of these detectors in different conditions is needed. In literature, several models describing the TLDs behavior already exist and in this work we start briefly introducing some of them. In particular, we focus on an extension of `local effect model' (LEM). This model stems from an amorphous track structure model and assumes the knowledge of both the radial dose distribution around heavy ion trajectories and the detector response to reference radiation. Even though the LEM was originally developed for predicting the response of biological systems following ion irradiation, it can also be extended for efficiency calculations of solid state detectors, such as TLD. In this context a new, simple and completely analytical algorithm for the calculation of the efficiency dependence on ion charge Z and energy E has been developed. The response of the whole detector has been evaluated starting from the response to a single ion of the beam. The dose contributions coming from <b>neighbouring</b> <b>tracks</b> are assumed to add up linearly. This approach is realistic in a low dose approximation, but we nevertheless analized its limits of validity. Its main advantage is that, being fully analytical, it is computationally fast and can be efficiently integrated in treatment planning verification tools. Furthermore, it is robust against modifications of the radial dose distribution of a single ion in the detector, as well as to different detector response models as we critically evaluated in our work. The calculated values of the efficiency have been compared with experimental data, as well as to other calculated values provided by different approaches. Moreover, after implementing our model data in the treatment planning code TRiP 98, we performed signal calculations on macroscopic target irradiated with an extended Carbon ion field. Also these results were compared with recent experimental measurements as well as with alternative calculations. The results, both for pure efficiency calculations and for their propagation in macroscopic dose response prediction, achieve a level of accuracy which is comparable to previous calculations, while needing a much lighter computational effort...|$|R

40|$|One {{important}} but largely unanswered question about floristic responses {{to climate change}} is how interactions such as competition, facilitation and plant-soil feedbacks will influence the ability of species to track shifting climates.

Two species had higher success in cooler topographic locations, and this success was enhanced by neighbouring plants, which appeared to modulate minimum growing season temperatures. One species' success was also facilitated by the higher soil organic matter found in cooler sites. These results are a novel experimental demonstration of two important factors that may buffer climate change impacts on plants: rugged topography and plant-plant facilitation. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS...|$|R

Fetal diagnosis may also be made in the same way, but not without a substantial casualty rate. The precision of such diagnosis by proxy is limited both by the estimate of the recombination fraction and its variance, and can rarely exceed 1 /s where the recombinational data are based on s informative meioses. Bracketing loci provide greater security from failure to diagnose cases but may involve substantial casualty rates. The estimation of both failure rates and casualty rates is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with techniques for determining the properties of singularities in the flow field. Okubo and Ebbesmeyer (1976) and Molinari and Kirwan (1975) developed a regression technique {{that has become a}} standard for determining velocity gradients of the flow field. Kirwan (1988) has pointed out that this regression technique is fundamentally inadequate because is assumes a paradigm with the flow centre fixed to the centroid of the drifter cluster. Kirwan et al., (1988) formulated a solution to this dilemma by inverting non-linear solutions obtained by Okubo (1970) for motion near a flow field singularity with specified differential kinematic properties (DKP). The DKP are horizontal divergence, vorticity, stretching and shearing deformation rate. We solve the non-linear equations of Kirwan et al., (1988) to obtain DKP and the position and velocity of a flow field singularity from a single drifter trajectory. This solution (henceforth called the OK solution) is mathematically more concise than that presented in Kirwan et al., (1988) and corrects previously undetected algebraic errors in the published literature. It has been successfully tested using artificially generated data. The method is fundamentally limited due to the requirement that DKP are time invariant. It also has the undesirable feature that it requires fourth order time derivatives of data. A new method, the HS method, that uses regression without artificially setting a flow centre to the cluster centroid is presented. It has also been successfully tested by application to artificially generated data. The DKP are successfully recovered by the HS providing all drifters in the cluster are being moved by the same unique singularity in the flow field. [...] Applying all three methods to three <b>neighbouring</b> drifter <b>tracks</b> measured on Sable Island Bank clearly indicated the limitations of all three methods. The regression technique Okubo and Ebbesmeyer (1976), the OE method, ‘failed’ because the flow centre was not at the cluster centroid position. The OK method gives ambiguous results in that it can not distinguish between solid body rotation about a point and a slab that oscillates. The lack of a single well defined flow centre for all three drifter trajectories was sufficient to ensure the HS method gave meaningless DKP that had large intermittent fluctuations. Nevertheless, given trajectories near a well-defined flow field singularity, we can be assured that both the HS and OK method can be used to obtain the position, velocity and SKP of the singularity. Depending upon the separation scales of the drifters, the HS method can be much less or more sensitive to noise than the OK method...|$|R
