500|$|In 2006, Scott {{was asked}} [...] "Who's the biggest {{pain in the}} arse you've ever worked with?", he replied: [...] "It's got to be Harrison... he'll forgive me because <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked {{together}} {{it was my first}} film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie." [...] Ford said of Scott in 2000: [...] "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." [...] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: [...] "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another." [...] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. [...] "Harrison's fully on board", said Scott.|$|E
500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> it? [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{television}} series Hannibal, Dr. Alana Bloom is thrown {{through the window}} of Hannibal Lecter's Baltimore home in the Season 2 finale. When she's first seen in the hospital in Season 3, she says, [...] "I've always enjoyed the word 'defenestration.' <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to use it in casual conversation." [...] Later, in season 3, Hannibal pushes a man out the museum window so that an extension cord hangs him by the neck as his sliced abdomen empties his internal organs to the ground beneath.|$|E

2500|$|Irwin [...] "takes {{the humor}} very seriously... I {{remember}} {{being a little}} kid wondering why we laugh and what makes me laugh. I always was a class clown. I was always interested in what makes laughter happen and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to dig into the theory of it every day." [...] Irwin thinks {{of himself as a}} fiction writer and refers to himself as a humorist, [...] and states, [...] "I call myself a humorist and storyteller instead of a comedian because I play in libraries and there's no three-drink minimum." [...] Irwin's stories often reflect life in a small Southern town with recurring themes of growing up and growing old, the bonds of family, the complexities of racial relations in the Deep South, especially during the 1960s and the important art of the practical joke.|$|E

If can't get it - well, then no operation as can't ask the doctor to actually fork out money for me in addition. So, sister, please see what you can do in addition to the usual ten-spot, will you please? And let me have it by Wednesday.” [...] a group of Chinese saw me today and want to take lessons from me and will even pay for a ship as soon as the eye is okay. Private flying, govt. jobs, city and state jobs - all waiting.|$|E

2500|$|On May 14, 2016, {{the band}} {{were forced to}} cancel their {{headlining}} slot at the annual KROQ Weenie Roast, as Kiedis {{was rushed to the}} hospital prior to the band appearing on stage. It was confirmed that Kiedis was suffering from intestinal flu and was expected to make a full recovery soon however the band was forced to postpone their iHeartRadio album preview show on May 17, 2016 (rescheduling it for May 26). Kiedis and the Chili Peppers returned to the stage on May 22, 2016 in Columbus, OH. According to the band's drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis was suffering from a stomach flu a few weeks earlier and it had returned on the night they were set to perform. In a May 20, 2016 interview with Entertainment Tonight Canada, his first since being released from the hospital, Kiedis said that his illness was brought on by an [...] "inflammation in my guts" [...] which he said was complicated by a recent stomach virus and existing scar tissue from previous hernia operations which required his stomach being pumped at the hospital due to his food not being able to properly digest. [...] "That becomes an incredibly painful situation where you get a fever and pass out... Lo an behold, I'm on the mend" [...] He went on to say [...] "so it turned out to be a good thing, albeit painful and very sad to have to cancel a show. We don't really do that. I'd rather play deathly ill than not play at all, but in this particular instance, I was starting to go down, as in to the ground, so I got rushed to the hospital, got some help, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to figure things out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Cut it out," [...] {{said the}} {{financier}} austerely, {{breaking out of}} the clinch. [...] "We'll take the Apache Dance as read. Good-by, Squire. Glad it's settled. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> busy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you needn't mind that!" [...] the man said; [...] "as {{you work}} in the shop it's safe enough. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> my dinner, else I shall be late for work." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Here it is, Hugh," [...] cried my guardian, gaily; [...] "and {{a capital}} letter it is!

6000|$|... "I can't {{afford it}} myself," [...] our friend said. [...] "But I save a little by breakfasting there, and lunching and dining elsewhere. Or, I did till the eggs {{got so bad}} that I {{had to go out}} for my breakfast, too. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> perfect eggs, of the day before, for half the price that the extortionate hens laying for the Universe exact for their last week's product. At a very good Broadway hotel, which simple strangers from Europe think first class, I get a 'combination' breakfast of fresh eggs, fresh butter, and fresh rolls, with a pot of blameless Souchong or Ceylon tea, for thirty cents; if I plunge to the extent of a baked apple, I pay thirty-five. Do you {{remember}} what you last paid in Paris or Rome for coffee, rolls, and butter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sundays are my best times. You {{must come}} on Sundays. There are such heaps of things I {{want to talk}} about and ask your advice about. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> back to work.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I sure will. I {{first come}} over Chilcoot in '83. I went {{out over the}} Pass in a fall blizzard, with a rag of a shirt {{and a cup of}} raw flour. I got my grub-stake in Juneau that winter, and in the spring I went over the Pass once more. And once more the famine drew me out. Next spring I went in again, and I swore then that I'd never come out till I made my stake. Well, I ain't made it, and here I am. And I ain't going out <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> the mail and I come right back. I won't stop the night at Dyea. I'll hit up Chilcoot soon as I change the dogs and get the mail and grub. And so I swear once more, by the mill-tails of hell and the head of John the Baptist, I'll never hit for the Outside till I make my pile. And I tell you-all, here and now, it's got to be an almighty big pile." ...|$|E
6000|$|She replied, {{very simply}} and candidly: [...] "I was born near Cincinnati. My {{father was a}} spiritualist early in the 'craze,' as it was called, and I was about nine when I became a medium. At first {{we did not know}} that I was the psychic. Demons seemed to take {{possession}} of our house, and for a few weeks nothing movable was safe. After awhile my father became sure that I was the cause of these disturbances, because everywhere I went raps were heard: the movement of small objects near where I sat made me an object of aversion or of actual terror to my school-mates. So finally my father asked me to sit. I didn't want to do so at first, but he told me it was my duty. They used to tie me in every way and experiment with me. It was very wearisome to me, but I submitted, and I have been devoted to the work ever since. After my father and mother died I gave up all opposition to my gift, and now it is a great comfort to me; for <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> messages from my father and my little daughter almost every day." ...|$|E
6000|$|But, as I say, {{our ideas}} are changing--mahogany has gone, and repp curtains. Articles {{are made for}} man, nowadays, and not man, by careful early training, for articles. I feel myself to be in many respects a link with the past. Commodities come like the spring flowers, and vanish again. [...] "Who steals my watch steals trash," [...] as some poet has remarked; the thing is made of I know not what metal, and if I leave it on the mantel {{for a day or}} so it goes a deep blackish purple that delights me exceedingly. My grandfather's hat--I {{understood}} when I was a little boy that I was to have that some day. But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a hat for ten shillings, or less, {{two or three times a}} year.
