5|$|The {{country was}} {{historically}} about evenly balanced between Catholic and Protestant, with a complex patchwork of majorities {{over most of}} the country. Geneva converted to Protestantism in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived there. It became known internationally as the Protestant Rome, being base for such reformers as Theodore Beza or William Farel. Zürich became another stronghold around the same time, with Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger, later joined by fleeing Peter Martyr Vermigli, taking the lead there. One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland, the Valais, the Ticino, Appenzell Innerrhodes, the Jura, and Fribourg are traditionally Catholic. The Swiss Constitution of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg, consciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete {{separation of church and state}} was rejected by 78.9% of the voters. Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a slight Catholic majority, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> growing in members, quite the contrary, but only because since about 1970 a steadily growing minority became not affiliated with any church or other religious body (21.4% in Switzerland, 2012) especially in traditionally Protestant regions, such as Basel-City (42%), canton of Neuchâtel (38%), canton of Geneva (35%), canton of Vaud (26%), or Zürich city (city: >25%; canton: 23%).|$|E

Essentially the argument was that idols were idols because they represented false gods, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> images. Images of Christ, or of other real people {{who had lived in}} the past, could not be idols. This was considered comparable to the Old Testament practice of only offering burnt sacrifices to God, and not to any other gods.|$|E

Hans Delbrück considered {{this to be a}} mere misreading of Plutarch. Plutarch does indeed describe Pelopidas leading the Band and catching the Spartans in disorder, but there is nothing in his account that conveys anything other than the Sacred Band being the head of the column, and the Spartans were disordered <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> taken in the flank but because they were caught in mid-maneuver, extending their line.|$|E

500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. <b>Not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> good or bad films, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E

500|$|Rodham {{maintained}} {{her interest}} in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles [...] "Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect" [...] in 1977 and [...] "Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective" [...] in 1979. The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, [...] "Her articles were important, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate." [...] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as [...] "one {{of the more important}} scholar-activists of the last two decades", while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority, would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents, and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.|$|E
500|$|Catholic historians, such as John Lingard, thought Mary's {{policies}} failed <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{wrong but}} because she had too short a reign to establish them and because of natural disasters beyond her control. In other countries, the Catholic Counter-Reformation was spearheaded by Jesuit missionaries; [...] Mary's chief religious advisor, Cardinal Reginald Pole, refused to allow the Jesuits in England. Her marriage to Philip was unpopular among her subjects and her religious policies resulted in deep-seated resentment. The military loss of Calais to France was a bitter humiliation to English pride. Failed harvests increased public discontent. Philip {{spent most of his}} time abroad, while his wife remained in England, leaving her depressed at his absence and undermined by their inability to have children. After Mary's death, Philip sought to marry Elizabeth but she refused him. Although Mary's rule was ultimately ineffectual and unpopular, the policies of fiscal reform, naval expansion, and colonial exploration that were later lauded as Elizabethan accomplishments were started in Mary's reign.|$|E
500|$|If {{a concerted}} effort {{had been made by}} Birmingham's Anglican elite to attack the Dissenters, it was more than likely the work of Benjamin Spencer, a local minister, Joseph Carles, a Justice of the Peace and landowner, and John Brooke (1755-1802), an attorney, coroner, and under-sheriff. Although present at the riot's outbreak, Carles and Spencer made no attempt to stop the rioters, and Brooke seems to have led them to the New Meeting chapel. Witnesses agreed [...] "that the magistrates promised the rioters {{protection}} so long as they restricted their attacks to the meeting-houses and left persons and property alone". The magistrates also refused to arrest any of the rioters and released those that had been arrested. Instructed by the national government to prosecute the riot's instigators, these local officials dragged their heels. When finally forced to try the ringleaders, they intimidated witnesses and made a mockery of the trial proceedings. Only seventeen of the fifty rioters who had been charged were ever brought to trial; four were convicted, of whom one was pardoned, two were hanged, and the fourth was transported to Botany Bay. But Priestley and others believed that these men were found guilty <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> rioters but because [...] "they were infamous characters in other respects".|$|E

2500|$|The {{attacks on}} Clark were not entirely {{politically}} motivated. Clark's professional {{reputation as a}} historian declined during the later period of his life, and the final two volumes of the History were given scant attention by other serious historians, regardless of their political views. This was <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> seen as too [...] "left-wing," [...] but because they were seen as verbose, repetitive and with few new insights to offer. Clark's publisher at MUP, Peter Ryan, maintains that leading historians acknowledged to him in private that the later volumes of the History were inferior work, but would not say so publicly {{out of respect for}} Clark, or out of a reluctance to give ammunition to the political attacks on him. [...] "By the time Volume V was published in 1981, this approached the proportions of a professional scandal.

2500|$|Józef Włodarski {{regards the}} treaty {{as one of}} the {{heaviest}} mistakes in Polish foreign policy towards Prussia with fatal consequences for Poland. According to Anna Kamińska, the treaty marked the point when Poland's influence on the Baltic was lost and Poland-Lithuania's position in Europe declined. Frost says that the treaty was subject to criticism of historians such as Kazimierz Piwarski, who says that the prize paid by Poland in Bromberg was unnecessarily high. According to Frost, these critics argue from a post-partition point of view, and neglect the complexity of the contemporary situation: [...] "Contemporary [...] politicians were aware of the dangers of conceding sovereignty, which they accepted <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> stupid, indifferent, or lacking in foresight, but because the alternatives seemed more damaging to the Commonwealth's interests", he says. While Frost regards Piwarski's assertion, that the Polish decision was heavily influenced by the Habsburgs, to have merit, he also says that the Polish interest in a rapprochment with Brandenburg had already emerged in 1656, long before Lisola entered the scene.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contemporary}} or near-contemporary sources, {{the invaders}} are overwhelmingly described as English. This {{was because they}} were vassals of the king of England, and <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> culturally Anglo-Saxon. Expugnatio Hibernica almost always describes them as English; so too does the Song of Dermot and the Earl, a source which uses the term [...] "English" [...] about eighty times, whilst using [...] "French", [...] "Flemings", and [...] "Normans" [...] in only one particular line. Despite the modern employment of terms such as [...] "Normans", [...] "Anglo-Normans" [...] (itself an eighteenth-century construct), and [...] "Cambro-Normans", contemporary sources virtually never use [...] "Norman" [...] in an Irish context. Irish sources usually describe the men as [...] "foreigners" [...] and [...] "grey foreigners", or else as Saxain ("Saxons" [...] or [...] "English"). In consequence, {{it is apparent that}} contemporaries regarded the incomers as English, {{despite the fact that they}} weren't exactly as such.
