50|$|Smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> may {{be easily}} {{confused}} with the spiny <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Apalone spinifera), as {{the differences between the}} two species are subtle. Spiny <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> have a rough carapace with spines along the front edge while, as the name implies, smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> lack such spines. Additionally, the white chin and throat of the smooth softshell are unmarked, compared to the splotchy chin and throat of the spiny softshell. A. mutica is the only species of North American softshell with round nostrils; all other species have ridges on the nasal septum which make the nostrils C-shaped.|$|R
5000|$|The African <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> or Nile <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Trionyx triunguis) {{is a large}} {{species of}} turtle from fresh-water and {{brackish}} habitats in Africa (larger parts of East, West and Middle Africa) and the Near East (Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey). It is the only extant species from the genus Trionyx, {{but in the past}} many other <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> were placed in this genus; they have now been moved to various other genera. Despite the name [...] "African softshell turtle", {{it is not the only}} species or genus of <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> in Africa (the genera Cyclanorbis and Cycloderma are also African).|$|R
50|$|The black <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> or Bostami turtle (Nilssonia nigricans, {{previously}} {{placed in}} genus Aspideretes) is {{a species of}} freshwater turtle found in India (Assam) and Bangladesh (Chittagong and Sylhet). It was long believed to be inbred individuals of the Ganges <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (A. gangeticus or N. gangeticus) or the Indian peacock <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (A. hurum or N. hurum), but while it is a close relative of the latter, it is a distinct species.|$|R
5000|$|The smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> has an anapsid skull. This kind of skull {{is present}} among the {{earliest}} reptiles and is retained by turtles today. The anapsid skull lacks openings behind the orbits. The smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> has a smooth, flexible and leather like carapace that {{is covered by}} skin instead of the hard scutes commonly observed in other turtle species. The plastron is light (white or gray) with no markings, and the underlying bones are visible. Smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> have a tubular snout with round nostrils.|$|R

50|$|Cantor's giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> or Asian giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Pelochelys cantorii) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} turtle native to Southeast Asia. It has been considered the largest extant freshwater turtle. The species is endangered and in the 20th century has disappeared from much of its former range.|$|R

50|$|Thus, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} to unite the two genera under the older name, Nilssonia. As it seems, the closest living relatives of the Burmese peacock softshell are the Indian <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (A./N. gangeticus) and the Leith's <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (A./N. leithii), making the merging of the genera well warranted.|$|R
