500|$|Following the 1994 Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet impacts with Jupiter, Teller {{proposed}} to a collective of U.S. and Russian ex-Cold War weapons designers in a 1995 planetary defense workshop at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), that they collaborate {{to design a}} 1 gigaton <b>nuclear</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>device,</b> which would be equivalent to the kinetic energy of a 1km diameter asteroid. In order to safeguard the earth, the theoretical 1 Gt device would weigh about 25–30 tons, hence light enough to be lifted on the [...] Russian Energia rocket {{and it could be}} used to instantaneously vaporize a 1km asteroid, divert the paths of extinction event class asteroids (greater than 10km in diameter) within a few months of short notice, while with 1-year notice, at an interception location no closer than Jupiter, it would also be capable of dealing with the even rarer short period comets which can come out of the Kuiper belt and transit past Earth orbit within 2 years. For comets of this class, with a maximum estimated 100km diameter, Charon served as the hypothetical threat.|$|E
500|$|Clouzot's next {{feature film}} was Les Espions, which was {{released}} in 1957. Les Espions featured actors {{from around the world}} including Véra Clouzot, Curd Jürgens, Sam Jaffe and Peter Ustinov. Les Espions would be the last acting role for Clouzot's wife Véra, who had been suffering from severe heart problems since filming Diabolique. Les Espions is set in a rundown sanitarium that is taken over by international spies. One of the spies claims to have invented a <b>nuclear</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>device</b> which attracts the attention of the Russian and American counterspies. Les Espions was not released in the United States and was a financial failure in France. Clouzot later admitted that he only liked the first two-thirds of Les Espions. Producer Raoul Levy suggested Clouzot's next film should feature Brigitte Bardot as the lead actress. In response, Clouzot wrote the script for La Vérité. Bardot plays Dominique Marceau, who is on trial for the murder of her former boyfriend Gilbert Tellier. As her trial progresses, the relationship between Dominique and Gilbert becomes more finely shaped. Bardot later described La Vérité as her favorite of all the films she worked on. Released in 1960, La Vérité was the second most popular film in France with 5.7million spectators and was Bardot's highest-grossing film. The film [...] was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
