30|$|The {{reservoir}} temperature {{calculated using}} the above equations individually gives two different values (281 °C and 70 °C respectively) since the reaction involved K-Na equilibrates at high temperatures while K/√Mg equilibrates at low temperatures. Further, the reaction involving K and Mg equilibrates is faster, and their temperatures estimated from surface geothermal waters give very low reservoir temperatures. Reactions involving K and <b>Na</b> <b>do</b> not adjust {{quickly to the}} physical environment at shallow depths. So in this case, cation geothermometry overestimates the reservoir temperature.|$|E

40|$|From recent {{published}} data, it {{is still}} unclear whether combining additions of Na and Sr have synergistic effects or deleterious interactions, This paper clarifies the interactions between these two modifiers and investigates the effects of such interactions on alloy solidification and castability. It was found that combined additions of Sr and <b>Na</b> <b>do</b> not appear to cause improvement of the modification of the eutectic microstructure even after only a short period after addition. Na addition may promote Sr vaporization and/or oxidation kinetically. leading to a quicker loss of both modifiers, which is blamed for the rapid loss of the modification effect during melt holding. Quenching trials during the eutectic arrest indicate that addition of Sr into Na-modified melts does not alter the eutectic solidification behaviour The effect of Na on eutectic solidification dominates, and the eutectic is observed to evolve with a significant dependency on the thermal gradient, Combining Sr and Na additions produced no beneficial effects on porosity and casting defects.

40|$|The nocturnal {{secretion}} of pineal melatonin {{provides information}} to vertebrates {{on changes in}} day length under {{the circumstances in which}} they live. In sheep, which are seasonal breeders, the secretion of melatonin is also a signal to the neural structures controlling the secretion of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland to drive their activity in accordance with the sea son of the year. The sites and mechanisms of melatonin action on GnRH/LH secretion {{have been the subject of}} intensive studies in the last decade. This article briefl y reviews the most important discoveries and methods used in this research, which has led to a better understanding of the role of melatonin in the modulation of hypothalamo-pituitary-go <b>na</b> <b>do</b> trop ic axis activity in sheep.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation conducted to examine carbonation resistance of Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) made with coarse Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA). In total, five SCC mixes were prepared by systematically replacing coarse Natural Aggregates (NA) by RCA at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %. In order to measure the carbonation resistance of SCC made with RCA, accelerated carbonation tests were performed for 4 and 12 weeks of exposure to carbon dioxide. The carbonation resistance has been evaluated after curing periods of 28 and 90 days. In addition to this, the compressive strength of all the mixes was also obtained after 7, 28 and 90 days of curing and ultra-sonic pulse velocity tests (UPV) were also conducted. The results indicate that with the increase in the content of RCA as replacement of NA, decrease in the carbonation resistance, compressive strength and UPV was observed for all SCC mixes. It has been observed that the SCC mixes containing low percentages of RCA (i. e. 25 %) as replacement of <b>NA</b> <b>do</b> not impart detrimental behaviour in the overall performance but higher replacement levels (> 50 %) have been found to deteriorate the performance in terms of carbonation resistance, compressive strength and UPV...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test if the pattern of human mood {{variation}} across the day is consistent with the hypothesis that self-reports of positive affect (PA) have a circadian component, and self-reports of negative affect (<b>NA)</b> <b>do</b> not. Data were collected under two protocols: normal ambulatory conditions of activity and rest and during a 27 h constant routine (CR) procedure. Mood data were collected every 3 h during the wake span of the ambulatory protocol and hourly during the 27 h CR. In both protocols, rectal temperature data were continuously recorded. In the ambulatory protocol, activity data were also collected to enable estimation of the unmasked (purified) temperature rhythm. Participants were 14 healthy females aged 18 - 25 yr in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Under both protocols, PA exhibited significant 24 h temporal variation [CR: F(23, 161) = 2. 12; p 0. 01; ambulatory: F(5, 55) = 2. 44, p 0. 05] with a significant sinusoidal component [CR: F(2, 21) 7. 51, p 0. 01; ambulatory: F(2, 3) = 20. 49, p. 05] of the same form as the circadian temperature rhythm. In contrast, NA exhibited an increasing linear trend over time under the ambulatory protocol [F(1, 11) = 5. 74, p 0. 05] but nonsignificant temporal variation under the CR protocol. The findings support the hypothesis of a circadian component in PA variation...|$|E
40|$|Em ensaio iniciado em março de 1969, na Estação Experimental de Jundiaí, SP, foram estudados os efeitos da incorporação de massa vegetal, proveniente de leguminosas e de gramínea, e do sombreamento parcial, simulando o plantio consorciado com milho, na cultura do feijoeiro. Determinou-se para culturas "apleno sol" e "sombreada" a temperatura do solo a 2 e 10 cm de profundidade. Observou-se efeito favorável da incorporação de massa vegetal ao solo imediatamente antes do plantio do feijoeiro. Os tratamentos que receberam incorporação de massa vegetal produziram mais sementes de feijão, o que os torna estatisticamente superiores aos tratamentos que não receberam tal prática. Nessas mesmas condições o sombreamento parcial não interferiu na temperatura ambiente, nem <b>na</b> <b>do</b> solo, e tampouco na produção, que foi praticamente idêntica à do tratamento testemunha. In 1969 an {{experiment}} with dry beans was {{started at the}} Estação Experimental de Jundiaí (State of São Paulo) with the scope to {{study the effects of}} the incorporation in the soil of undecomposed vegetative matter, which sources were leguminous plants (Glycine wightii Verdc.) and grass (Melinis minutiflora Béauv.), {{as well as of the}} partial shading of the plants. Soil temperatures were determined at depths of two and ten centimeters in all treatments. Air temperature was determined in plots with and without shading. The treatments which consisted in the incorporation of undecomposed vegetative matter at all times produced higher yields than those with shading and control. There was no significant difference in grain yields of treatments with leguminous plants and grass, as well as between shading and control. With incorporation of vegetative matter the variation of the temperature in the soil was a little lower than with shading or control...|$|E

Osredotočili smo se <b>na</b> <b>do</b> sedaj najmanj raziskano področje – to je termokemično shranjevanje toplotne energije. Cilj je raziskati prenos toplote in snovi v poroznem mediju, ki adsorbira nasičeno vodno paro. Za raziskavo je bil izbran porozen medij silikagel. Zanimale so nas lastnosti poroznega medija, na kakšen način lahko v shranjevalniku toplotno energijo sploh hranimo in kakšne so njegove slabosti. Prav tako smo si zastavili cilje, da bi že obstoječe meritve in analize v prihodnosti primerjali z rezultati, ki bi jih pridobili s pomočjo programov kot so ANSYS Fluent ali Comsol. Na ta način bi lahko lažje prišli do analiz, prav tako pa bi že s simulacijo lahko preverili, na kaj moramo biti pazljivi pri optimiziranju in sestavljanju prototipa. The {{purpose of}} the final thesis is to review the storage of thermal energy and its {{extraction}} from renewable sources. Our {{focus has been on}} the least reasearched area until now – thermochemical storage of heat energy. The aim of the paper is to investigate the mass and heat transfer in a porous medium that absorbs saturated water vapor. For the study, a porous silica gel medium was selected. We were interested in the characteristics of the porous medium, in what way can thermal energy be stored in a thermal energy storage unit, and what are its weaknesses. We have also set goals to compare the already existing metrics and analyzes with the results that would be obtained through programs such as CFD Fluent or Comsol in the future. In this way, {{it would be easier to}} get to analyzes while – with the help of a simulation – we could check what we should be careful about when optimising and composing the prototype...|$|E
