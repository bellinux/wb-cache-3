In Europe, the impasse lasted until the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when the continent passed through a drastic economic transition that transformed finance.

40|$|The {{introductory}} part of {{this thesis}} identifies developments in world financial markets, and then focuses upon the financial crisis that afflicted East Asia and Thailand in particular. The crisis in Thailand that began in mid 1997 occurred due {{to a loss of}} intemational and domestic confidence in the Thai economy arising from the weakness of its financial sector. This in tum is attributed to madequate pmdential regulation that resulted in an excessive stock market boom and a real estate bubble, in which foreign loans were used to finance <b>non-productive</b> <b>investment</b> in land and properties. A dynamic macroeconomic model for the Thai economy was constmcted by emphasizing the impact aspect of the Thai crisis: namely the impact of a jump in the perceived financial risk in investing in the Thai economy; the impact of an increase of short-term flows in financing non-productive investments; and the impact of a collapse in aggregate supply resulting from financial and corporate sector insolvencies. In addition, government policy advocated by the IMF in response to the Thai financial crisis in the initial stage is explicitly analyzed and compared with the Radelet and Sachs (RS) policy approach. The major conclusion from the simulation results presented is that an exogenous shock arising from a temporary increase in the perceived risk of Thai financial assets during the onset of the crisis period, in conjunction with the collapse in aggregate supply as a result of financial and corporate sector insolvencies, can lead to a Severe temporary economic contraction both in domestic demand and supply. Implementing the IMF approach, by tightening monetary and fiscal policies in the initial stage of the crisis, could strengthen the real exchange rate in the short mn but at a potentially high cost. Such a policy contraction contributes to a more protracted decline in aggregate supply and private capital stock, the latter being detrimental for long-term economic growth and aggregate demand. The IMF approach produces more favorable effects in terms of external developments (more stabilized exchange rate), while the RS approach brings about favourable effects upon domestic demand and supply. The simulation results suggest that adopting the RS approach is an appropriate policy option in the short-term, particularly in dealing with such a crisis in the early stage. The RS policy approach eases the crisis in its initial stages arising from the abmpt and severe contraction in domestic demand and supply, but it comes at the cost of the larger depreciation of the real exchange rate than that for the IMF approach. Restmcturing of the financial sector is important but needs a more comprehensive and well-thought-out financial restmcturing plan, otherwise it may lead to a more protracted contraction in economic activities. Encouraging long-term flows is also essential because they can generate a larger accumulation of private capital stock and a higher level of aggregate supply relative to short-term flows...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWorldwide public {{authorities}} have replied {{to the financial}} and economic crisis of the last years through fiscal policy measures which have mainly targeted short term objectives. Unfortunately, on the long term, {{the impact of these}} measures hasn’t always been a favorable one due to its collateral effects. Although the upward trend of the economy has been re-established as a result of increasing public expenditures, the public debt accumulated in this way has been difficult to manage. This paper aims to identify the main determinants of economic growth in the EU countries and to highlight several reforms in terms of public policies. The results point out the fact that a rather small dimensioned public sector positively influences economic growth, just like productive investments do, as opposed to <b>non-productive</b> <b>investments.</b> The differential taxation of tax base categories, as well as a cautionary increase of public debt or even public debt reduction, has to be considered {{in order to get a}} sustainable fiscal policy...|$|E
40|$|This chapter summarises recent {{findings}} on the impacts of agri-environmental (AE) measures (2008 - 13), with special attention to water loading and biological diversity. Indicator trends, and comparisons between sites subject and not subject to AE measures, were analysed. Measures with the most potential for reducing nutrient loading are those targeting fertiliser rates, nature management fields and plant cover. Biodiversity has benefited from farmer contracts regarding traditional biotope management, organic production, raising local breeds and so on, as well as <b>non-productive</b> <b>investments</b> like establishing constructed wetlands. Agricultural nutrient loading has decreased because of lower artificial fertiliser use, but nutrient leaching from manure around clustered animal production units is increasing and requires measures targeted to manure composition and disposal. The greatest threat to biodiversity derives from trends in landscape structure. Due to regional heterogeneity, the objectives, measures and support levels of the AE scheme should be customised more according to the region, production sector and individual farm, by means of farm-specific environmental management plans. vo...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} obstacles in a developing country is related to <b>non-productive</b> <b>investments</b> or delay on productivity of construction projects. Following the development in the business world, the challenges for handling the businesses toward productivity raised as well. Construction industry {{plays an important role in}} the foundation of economy everywhere. Therefore, to undertake and push the projects through the challenges to achieve the productivity and the business advantages, a proper leadership by a competent Construction Manager (CM) is essential. Necessary competencies as the first objective, the importance of the competencies as the second objective, and finally prediction of a competent manager leading to a successful construction project based on CM’s “Big Five Traits” as a psychological factor through the dominant challenges at working environment is as the last objective. In order to gather data, both quantitative and qualitative surveys were employed in the study. Interview, Delphi method, and questionnaires analysis have been utilised to fulfil the three objectives respectively. By the results of the survey, the projects’ authorities can recognize the essential competencies, the level of competency, and finally a predictor for prominent construction managers based on CM’s Big Five traits as a psychological factor before employmen...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2009. Major: Economics. Advisor: Larry E. Jones. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 68 pages. This dissertation {{is comprised of}} two papers. In the first one, titled "Public Investment and Corruption in an Endogenous Growth Model," I provide an endogenous growth model with Ramsey taxation {{that is consistent with}} empirical findings regarding public investment, corruption, and economic growth. In the model, government maximizes the weighted average of consumers' utility and its own utility coming from expropriation of tax revenues. The weight determines the benevolence of the government. I show that a self-interested government sets a higher public-to-private-capital ratio than a benevolent one in order to increase the before-tax returns to private investment and hence increase tax revenues that can be expropriated. However, after-tax returns to private investment are lower and hence the growth rate is lower. Another result is that self-interested governments choose a high level of <b>non-productive</b> public <b>investment,</b> which provides a channel for the government to expropriate tax revenues for its private gain, thereby inflating total public investment. In the second paper, titled "Self-selection of Politicians and Corruption," I, together with my coauthor Evsen Turkay, build a citizen-candidate model, in which agents are heterogenous with respect to their honesty and they choose whether to become entrepreneurs or run for politics. We characterize the subgame perfect equilibrium of the model and analyze the effects of changing exogenous parameters, such as politicians' salaries, entrepreneurial profits and campaigning costs, on the equilibrium outcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{illustrate}} a methodology to determine the lost revenue and increased costs resulting from the assumption of forest-environment commitments, as provided by rule 225 (Council Regulation (EC) No. 1698 / 2005) of the measure defined by the Tuscany Region. The aim is therefore to determine the appropriateness of the payments provided by European Community measures. Regulation (EC) No. 1698 / 2005 regards mainly land management and contributes to sustainable development by encouraging farmers and forest holders to employ methods of land use compatible with the need to preserve the natural environment and landscape and protect and improve natural resources. This Rule covers support for <b>non-productive</b> <b>investments</b> linked to the achievement of agro or forest-environmental commitments or the achievement of other agri-environmental objectives, as well as measures aimed at improving forestry resources with an environmental objective (support for the first forestation of agricultural land, establishment of agroforestry systems or restoring forestry potential and preventing natural disasters). We have worked by analyzing each of the commitments required by individual actions and checking their impact on forest regional management; we have calculated the additional costs and the lost revenue resulting from the assumption of commitments...|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} consider microfinance as a {{tool for}} poverty reduction. Even more, especially in post-conflict African countries, micro-financial institutions are seen as an opportunity of reconciliation. Lending from microfinance institutions to that from traditional banks and examine their respective effects upon economic growth has been practiced in some sub-Saharan countries. Considerable progress in research has been found that microfinance loans raise growth comparatively to that of traditional banks. A lot of number of researches carried out in sub-Saharan countries even in other developing countries outside of Africa did not find strong evidence that bank loans raise growth. There is, however, some evidence that bank loans do increase investment, whereas microfinance loans do not appear to do so. Differently, other researchers highlighted clearly that microfinance can provide its contribution on poverty reduction and better access to finance needed for startup micro-entrepreneurs along the world. These results suggest that microfinance loans are not primarily invested as physical capital in developing countries, but could still augment total factor productivity, whereas banks may have been financing <b>non-productive</b> <b>investments.</b> Herein, we highlighted the impact of microfinance banks on developing countries economic growth. We also indicate how microfinances system incorporated in rural areas boosted the lifestyle of poor people in Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{development}} has been on target in the literature {{for the past two}} decades. Different aspects of this topic have been debated, most notably its growth aspect that is widely discussed. The main conclusion of this discussion is that financial development can cause growth as well as growth can cause financial development. Although poverty has been also discussed, not a lot of studies have tried to understand the causal relationship between financial development and poverty. Moreover, when talking about financial development, most studies focus on bank finance and equity finance as the main channels of financial development. The advent of microfinance lets to think about the potential role these institutions can play in a countrywide economy. Many studies have found evidence of increases in consumption, savings, and poverty alleviation as the results of microfinance loans at the community level, but not much has been said at the countrywide level. Some theoretical papers have found aggregate level evidence of microfinance, but this evidence has not been yet under empirical investigations. The first two chapters of this dissertation empirically investigate respectively growth and poverty effects of microfinance and compare them with traditional banks using the financial development framework. Chapter 1, entitled 2 ̆ 2 Growth effect of banks and microfinance: Evidence from developing countries, 2 ̆ 2 considers both the banking and microfinance sectors and analyzes their growth effect using traditional measures of financial development such as credit to GDP ratio. Using a panel of 72 developing countries over the period 2002 - 2011, we find with the system GMM estimator that microfinance loans do exhibit strong growth effect. As for bank loans, there is no strong evidence of growth effect. However, the analysis from the investment perspective tells quite the opposite story: Bank loans do have investment effect, while microfinance loans do not show strong evidence of investment effect. These results suggest that microfinance loans are not primarily invested as physical capital, but could increase total factor productivity, whereas banks may have been financing <b>non-productive</b> <b>investments</b> in developing countries. In chapter 2, entitled 2 ̆ 2 Financial development and poverty reduction in developing countries, 2 ̆ 2 the objective is to analyze the relationship between financial development and poverty reduction {{and the extent to which}} banks and microfinance reduce poverty. We use Geweke (1982) linear feedback method and measure the extent to which banks and microfinance contribute to poverty alleviation. With data on 71 developing countries over the period 2002 - 2011, we find in most cases that microfinance reduces poverty more than banks, but requires some income level to expand its activities. However, we do not find strong evidence that the whole financial system reduces poverty more than the individual financial institutions. While our first result suggests that microfinance does not service the very poor, our second result suggests that that individual institutions are in most cases more beneficial than the whole financial system. The third chapter, entitled 2 ̆ 2 Financial development and capital structure of firms, 2 ̆ 2 discusses another aspect of financial development usually found in the finance literature. This chapter examines the relationship between financial development and capital structure and analyzes how capital structure might change due to the global financial crisis. We use aggregate data, computed from 5, 000 publicly traded firms from 1990 to 2012. The results indicate with the instrumental variable-generalized method of moments methodology that financial development, measured by bank finance and equity finance, has positive effects on capital structure. However, the analysis with respect to the debt maturity indicates that these effects vary with the maturity and the type of finance. While the results are similar in developed countries except in the short-run, in developing countries, only bank finance has significant effects. Our results seem to be consistent with the pecking order theory and suggest that firms in developed countries prefer debt to equity despite the expansion of the equity market, whereas firms in developing countries rely on bank finance. Further, the results show that the subprime crisis has changed firms 2 ̆ 7 capital structure. In developed countries, the crisis has reduced short-term and total debt, whereas in developing countries, it affects more long-term debt. This latter result suggests that developing countries are more resilient to the crisis...|$|E
