40|$|Fusarium verticillioides {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} Fusarium species on maize and sorghum, causing Fusarium ear rot and sorghum grain mold in warm and humid regions of Iran. The pathogen produces potent mycotoxins known as fumonisins. In order to determine mycotoxin (fumonisins) production on different maize and sorghum genotypes, a field trial was carried out based on a randomized complete block design with 10 treatments and three replications for each crop at Gorgan station in 2010. The ears of corn plants were inoculated by spore suspension of the mixture of some virulent F. verticillioides isolates using an ear inoculation method (<b>Nail</b> <b>Punch).</b> The sorghum panicles were also inoculated by spraying of spore suspension isolates at f lowering stage. All infected kernels were evaluated by ELISA kits (AgraQuant Fumonisin Kit; Romer Labs, Austria) for their total fumonisins production at the physiological maturing stage. All genotypes showed statistically significant difference in their fumonisin production in Gorgan. The results of fumonisins analysis obtained from ELISA test showed that lines 1 (Resistant) and 3 (Susceptible) with 2. 4 ppm and 13. 7 ppm had the least and highest amount of total fumonisins respectively among all maize genotypes. Also among all sorghum genotypes, genotypes 10 and 6 with 0. 2 ppm and 4. 8 ppm had the least and the highest amount of total fumonisins respectively. The results of this experiment demonstrated that fumonisin production level in maize kernels (maybe as maize kernels are the main host of this fungus) was significantly higher than sorghum kernels in Gorgan region...|$|E
50|$|Bronze {{and ivory}} objects had {{a variety of}} {{functions}} in the ritual and courtly life of the Kingdom of Benin. They were used principally to decorate the royal palace, which contained many bronze works. They were hung on the pillars of the palace by <b>nails</b> <b>punched</b> directly through them. As a courtly art, their principal objective was to glorify the Oba—the divine king—and the history of his imperial power or to honor the queen mother. Art in the Kingdom of Benin took many forms, of which bronze and brass reliefs and the heads of kings and queen mothers are the best known. Bronze receptacles, bells, ornaments, jewelry, and ritual objects also possessed aesthetic qualities and originality, demonstrating the skills of their makers, although they are often eclipsed by figurative works in bronze and ivory carvings.|$|R

50|$|Professional {{matches in}} Greco-Roman wrestling were {{known for their}} great brutality. Body slams, choke-holds, and head-butting was allowed, and even caustic {{substances}} were used to weaken the opponent. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, gouging with the <b>nails,</b> <b>punching,</b> and violently slamming the arms together around the opponent's stomach were forbidden. Greco-Roman matches were also famous for their length. Professionally, it was not uncommon for there to be matches lasting two or three hours. William Muldoon's bout with Clarence Whistler at the Terrace Garden Theater in New York lasted eight hours before ending in a draw. Even in the 1912 Olympics, a match between Anders Ahlgren of Sweden and Ivar Boehling of Finland lasted for nine hours before a draw was called and both wrestlers awarded the silver medal. The International Amateur Wrestling Federation (IAWF) took over the regulation of Greco-Roman wrestling in 1921. Since then matches have been dramatically cut short, and today all movements that put the life or limb of the wrestler in jeopardy are forbidden.|$|R

50|$|The zax (also {{called a}} sack or sax) is a hand tool for cutting, trimming, and <b>punching</b> <b>nail</b> holes in slate. It {{consists}} of a heavy rectangular knife blade with a large point, of square cross section, protruding from the poll (or butt). The blade edge is used to split slate, while the point is used to pierce square holes for mounting the slate on the roof (with square copper nails) or making {{a series of small}} holes marking a line where the slate is broken over a slater's iron. The tool is mounted to a laterally offset handle to protect the user's hand from sharp slate chips.|$|R
40|$|Separator {{integrity}} {{is an important}} factor in preventing internal short circuit in lithium-ion batteries. Local penetration tests (<b>nail</b> or conical <b>punch)</b> often produce presumably sporadic results, where in exactly similar cell and test set-ups one cell goes to thermal runaway while the other shows minimal reactions. We conducted an experimental study of the separators under mechanical loading, and discovered two distinct deformation and failure mechanisms, which could explain the difference in short circuit characteristics of otherwise similar tests. Additionally, by investigation of failure modes, we provided a hypothesis about the process of formation of local “soft short circuits” in cells with undetectable failure. Finally, we proposed a criterion for predicting onset of soft short from experimental data. DaimlerChryslerJaguar Land Rover (Firm) LG ChemBoston-PowerMIT Battery Consortiu...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} and determine resistance rates of different corn genotypes to Fusarium ear rot, 22 inbred lines and 19 late and medium maturity hybrids in 2009 and 17 inbred lines and 14 late and medium maturity hybrids were planted in Qarakheil Agricultural Research Station in 2010. Each line and hybrid were planted separately. For each experiment a randomized complete block design with three replications was used. Plant ears were inoculated by <b>Nail</b> th <b>Punch</b> method at the 10 day after anthesis. When the disease symptoms were observed, evaluation of each line and genotype was done based on percentage and severity of the disease symptom. The result in 2009 showed that 14 hybrids were tolerant. Hybrids of K 3640 / 3 X MO 17, K 166 B X K 18, K 166 B X K 19 / 1 and K 3547 / 4 X MO 17 were resistant. One hybrid was susceptible. Pure lines of K 18 and K LM 77007 / 7 - 2 - 6 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 1 were resistant. 14 tolerance lines and 6 susceptible lines were shown. In 2010 hybrids of K 166 B X K 18 and K 3653 / 2 X K 18 were resistant. The other hybrids were tolerant. Pure lines of K 3547 / 3 and K 18 were resistant. Five tolerance lines were also shown. ...|$|R

Napoleon then ordered that he be removed from French Territory. In 1812 the secret service from Russia got Leppich Passports with the name Schmidt and then he and a secret undercover person went to Moscow to Count Rostopchin. Near Moscow a [...] "Werft" [...] was set up and with about 50 other German-speaking mechanics, {{and he started to}} build [...] "air bouts". When the balloon was finally tried out, they worked but were unable to move against the wind [...] Leppich did final work after the burning of Moscow, on this about a year longer near St. Petersburg and then he left for Germany again. There he worked on the subject up to 1817. In 1818 he received a patent in his and his brothers name in Vienna for making <b>nails</b> with a <b>punch.</b>|$|R
