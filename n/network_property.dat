50|$|A dynamic model, {{often used}} by {{physicists}} and biologists, {{begins as a}} small network or even a single node. The modeler then uses a (usually randomized) rule on how newly arrived nodes form links {{in order to increase}} the size of the network. The aim is to determine what the properties the network will be when it grows in size. In this way, researchers try to reproduce properties common in most real networks, such as the small world <b>network</b> <b>property</b> or the scale-free <b>network</b> <b>property.</b> These properties are common in almost every real network including the World Wide Web, the metabolic network or the network of international air routes.|$|E

Over the next five years Napier explored the networked software environment, creating work that challenged the definition of the art object. The salient features of these pieces: 1) The artwork can be altered by the viewer/visitor, 2) it responds to actions from the viewer/visitor and 3) typically relies on viewer/visitor actions to enact the work. The work can change, possibly unpredictably, over time, and often appropriates other <b>network</b> <b>property</b> to use as raw material, e.g., websites, flags, images.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the node {{activity}} state is treated here as a rather general static concept, and it is not necessarily related to any particular network dynamics such as a coupling function, a limit-cycle oscillation, or time-varying behavior, although it can be. Therefore, the concept of the consilience degree (CSD) is basically also a static <b>network</b> <b>property,</b> in the same way the connection degree (CND) is a static <b>network</b> <b>property.</b> However, the static nature of CSD does not mean it cannot be applied to studying dynamic network systems. Actually, the CSD exhibits great potential for the study of dynamic network systems, and there are at least three ways to apply the CSD to such systems.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe are {{considering}} distributed network computing, in which computing entities are {{connected by a}} network modeled as a connected graph. These entities are located at the nodes of the graph, and they exchange information by message-passing along its edges. In this context, we are adopting the classical framework for local distributed decision, in which nodes must collectively decide whether their network configuration satisfies some given boolean predicate, by having each node interacting with the nodes in its vicinity only. A network configuration is accepted {{if and only if}} every node individually accepts. It is folklore that not every Turing-decidable <b>network</b> <b>property</b> (e. g., whether the network is planar) can be decided locally whenever the computing entities are Turing machines (TM). On the other hand, it is known that every Turing-decidable <b>network</b> <b>property</b> can be decided locally if nodes are running non-deterministic Turing machines (NTM). However, this holds only if the nodes have the ability to guess the identities of the nodes currently in the network. That is, for different sets of identities assigned to the nodes, the correct guesses of the nodes might be different. If one asks the nodes to use the same guess in the same network configuration even with different identity assignments, i. e., to perform identity-oblivious guesses, then it is known that not every Turing-decidable <b>network</b> <b>property</b> can be decided locally. In this paper, we show that every Turing-decidable <b>network</b> <b>property</b> can be decided locally if nodes are running alternating Turing machines (ATM), and this holds even if nodes are bounded to perform identity-oblivious guesses. More specifically, we show that, for every <b>network</b> <b>property,</b> there is a local algorithm for ATMs, with at most 2 alternations, that decides that property. To this aim, we define a hierarchy of classes of decision tasks where the lowest level contains tasks solvable with TMs, the first level those solvable with NTMs, and level k contains those tasks solvable with ATMs with k alternations. We characterize the entire hierarchy, and show that it collapses in the second level. In addition, we show separation results between the classes of network properties that are locally decidable with TMs, NTMs, and ATMs. Finally, we establish the existence of completeness results for each of these classes, using novel notions of local reduction...|$|E
40|$|MicroRNAs {{control the}} {{expression}} of their target genes by translational repression. They are involved in various biological processes including cancer progression. To uncover the biological role of microRNAs {{it is necessary to}} identify their target genes. The small number of experimentally validated target genes makes computer prediction methods very important. However, state of the art prediction tools result in a great number of putative targets. The number of false positives among those putative targets is unknown. This report proposes, investigates and analyses two ways of ranking the biological relevance of putative targets of miRNAs which are associated with breast cancer. One approach characterises values of network properties of the putative microRNA targets in the human Protein-Protein Interaction network and compares them to <b>network</b> <b>property</b> values of validated microRNA targets. Using these results we suggest a simple approach for ranking the relevance of putative targets. The approach consists of testing if a <b>network</b> <b>property</b> value of a putative target differs from the mean value of the network. In addition we study which <b>network</b> <b>property</b> contributes most to ranking using this approach. The second approach identifies commonly overrepresented Gene Ontology categories among putative microRNA targets, validated targets and known breast cancer genes. We investigate possibilities to use the occurrence of a putative target in these categories to rank its biological relevance. Finally we present a number of genes with interesting features considering both approaches. These genes might play a role in breast cancer progression and might be worth investigating further...|$|E

40|$|Higher general {{intelligence}} attenuates age-associated cognitive {{decline and}} the risk of dementia. Thus, intelligence has been associated with cognitive reserve or resilience in normal aging. Neurophysiologically, intelligence is considered as a complex capacity that is dependent on a global cognitive network rather than isolated brain areas. An association of structural as well as functional brain network characteristics with intelligence has already been reported in young adults. We investigated the relationship between global structural brain <b>network</b> <b>properties,</b> general intelligence and age in a group of 43 cognitively healthy elderly, age 60 â 85 years. Individuals were assessed cross-sectionally using Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) and diffusion-tensor imaging. Structural brain networks were reconstructed individually using deterministic tractography, global <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> (global efficiency, mean shortest path length, and clustering coefficient) were determined by graph theory and correlated to intelligence scores within both age groups. <b>Network</b> <b>properties</b> were significantly correlated to age, whereas no significant correlation to WAIS-R was observed. However, in a subgroup of 15 individuals aged 75 and above, the <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> were significantly correlated to WAIS-R.

40|$|Abstract Background Chloroplasts {{descended from}} {{cyanobacteria}} {{and have a}} drastically reduced genome following an endosymbiotic event. Many genes of the ancestral cyanobacterial genome have been transferred to the plant nuclear genome by horizontal gene transfer. However, a selective set of metabolism pathways is maintained in chloroplasts using both chloroplast genome encoded and nuclear genome encoded enzymes. As an organelle specialized for carrying out photosynthesis, does the chloroplast metabolic <b>network</b> have <b>properties</b> adapted for higher efficiency of photosynthesis? We compared metabolic <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> of chloroplasts and prokaryotic photosynthetic organisms, mostly cyanobacteria, based on metabolic maps derived from genome data to identify features of chloroplast <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> that are different from cyanobacteria and to analyze possible functional significance of those features. Results The properties of the entire metabolic network and the sub-network that consists of reactions directly connected to the Calvin Cycle have been analyzed using hypergraph representation. Results showed that the whole metabolic networks in chloroplast and cyanobacteria both possess small-world <b>network</b> <b>properties.</b> Although the number of compounds and reactions in chloroplasts is less than that in cyanobacteria, the chloroplast's metabolic network has longer average path length, a larger diameter, and is Calvin Cycle -centered, indicating an overall less-dense network structure with specific and local high density areas in chloroplasts. Moreover, chloroplast metabolic network exhibits a better modular organization than cyanobacterial ones. Enzymes involved in the same metabolic processes tend to cluster into the same module in chloroplasts. Conclusion In summary, the differences in metabolic <b>network</b> <b>properties</b> may reflect the evolutionary changes during endosymbiosis {{that led to the}} improvement of the photosynthesis efficiency in higher plants. Our findings are consistent with the notion that since the light energy absorption, transfer and conversion is highly efficient even in photosynthetic bacteria, the further improvements in photosynthetic efficiency in higher plants may rely on changes in metabolic <b>network</b> <b>properties.</b> </p...|$|R
