5|$|A non-tropical frontal low {{developed}} from a cold front on November 1 {{to the west}} of the Azores. It intensified while moving west-northwestward and gradually dissipated its frontal structure. It became a subtropical storm on November 4 about 775 nautical miles (1435km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Operationally, the storm was considered a non-tropical low, and the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until it became a tropical cyclone. It moved slowly northward as convection organized into a ring around the center. As a result of a ship reporting hurricane-force winds <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> and due to the development of a weak mid-level warm core, the subtropical cyclone was reclassified as Hurricane Noel on November 5. Increasing westerly wind shear limited convection <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> and Noel weakened to a tropical storm early on November 6. Progressively cooler water temperatures contributed to weakening, and Noel became extratropical later on November 6 about 330mi (530km) southeast of Newfoundland. The extratropical remnant continued to the northeast and was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm later that day.|$|E
5|$|During extratropical transition, the cyclone {{begins to}} tilt {{back into the}} colder airmass with height, and the cyclone's primary energy source {{converts}} from the release of latent heat from condensation (from thunderstorms <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center)</b> to baroclinic processes. The low pressure system eventually loses its warm core and becomes a cold-core system.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} {{continued to}} the northeast, and re-strengthened into Tropical Storm Dean early on August 27 while located 580miles (930km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The convection became better organized, and Dean steadily strengthened as it tracked northeastward. A ship <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of Dean confirmed the storm re-developed. The convection <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> greatly organized, and an eye feature began to develop. Remaining over warm waters, Dean continued to strengthen and reached peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) late on August 27 while located about 465miles (750km) southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The eye feature failed to develop further, and after maintaining its peak intensity for 12hours Dean weakened over progressively cooler waters. The convection quickly diminished, and on August 28 Dean became extratropical while located 145miles (235km) east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The extratropical storm continued northeastward until being absorbed by a frontal low on August 29.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are areas}} of relatively low {{pressure in the}} troposphere, with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level. The environment <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they are characterized as “warm core” systems.|$|E
5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow {{outward from}} the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers. Gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|E

About half of the molecules listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature. A rich source of investigation for circumstellar molecules is the relatively nearby star CW Leonis (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August11. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave. Environmental conditions favored tropical development, and the system gradually became better organized, although convection was initially limited <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> On August 14, convection increased northwest of the center and became sufficiently well-organized for the system to be considered a tropical depression; at the time, it was located about 1500miles (2400km) east of the southern Windward Islands.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September1 and continued westward until reaching the eastern Pacific fifteen days later. A broad {{area of low pressure}} formed along the wave axis on September16 as convective activity organized, and by 0600UTC on September18, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Convective bands began to form <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> {{a few hours}} later, leading to an improved satellite presentation overall. Tracking west-northwestward {{as a result of the}} mid-level ridge, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ivo at 0000UTC on September19. Turning northwest, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite, prompting the NHC to upgrade the system to a Category1 hurricane 24 hours later. With an area of deep convection <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mb (hPa; 29.06inHg) at 0000UTC on September21. Westerly flow associated with a large upper-level low began to undercut the outflow of Ivo, and it weakened to a tropical storm by the afternoon hours. The convective pattern rapidly deteriorated due to southeasterly wind shear, and despite a brief burst of convection, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression to the west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California at 0000UTC on September 23. Associated deep convection dissipated later that day as Ivo turned eastward, and the system degenerated into a remnant low accordingly. The remnant low dissipated two days later as it continued in the same direction.|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} of 65mph (100km/h) around 8 a.m. (EDT) as it continued to become more organized. However, there were indications that it {{had already begun to}} weaken. Outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
