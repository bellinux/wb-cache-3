5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to <b>nine</b> <b>holes</b> and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred yards away at Kersal Vale.|$|E
5|$|Following the cut, an {{additional}} 36 holes are played {{over the final}} two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a sudden-death playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains. Adopted in 1976, the sudden-death playoff was originally formatted to start on the first hole, but was not needed {{for the first three}} years. It was changed for 1979 to the inward (final) <b>nine</b> <b>holes,</b> starting at the tenth tee, where the television coverage began. First employed that same year, the Masters' first sudden-death playoff ended on the eleventh green. The current arrangement, beginning at the 18th tee, was amended for 2004 and first used the following year. Through 2017, the eleven sudden-death playoffs have yet to advance past the second extra hole. Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in 1935, which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in 1970, and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.|$|E

40|$|Four short, simple {{measures}} of arm function, {{suitable for use}} with patients recovering from acute stroke, are described. These tests are: the Frenchay Arm Test, the <b>Nine</b> <b>Hole</b> Peg Test, finger tapping rate and grip strength. Good interobserver and test-retest reliability was demonstrated for all tests, and the Frenchay Arm Test was shown to be valid. Normal values for all tests were established on 63 controls. It {{was found that the}} limited sensitivity of the Frenchay Arm Test could be improved using the <b>Nine</b> <b>Hole</b> Peg Test and grip strength. Recovery of arm function has been studied in a sample of 56 patients seen regularly over the first 3 months after their stroke, using these standard measures.

The use of the <b>Nine</b> <b>Hole</b> Peg Test enabled further recovery to be detected after patients achieved a top score on the Frenchay Arm Test. Failure to recover measureable grip strength before 24 days was associated with absence of useful arm function at three months. Measurement of finger tapping rate was not useful...|$|R

25|$|Dye {{made the}} {{decision}} to become a golf course designer in his mid-30s. Alice supported his career change and became partner in the new venture. In 1961, the couple visited and talked to noted golf architect Bill Diddle, who lived nearby. He warned them about the economic uncertainty of the profession, but they persisted. The first design from Dye and his wife was the nine-hole El Dorado course south of Indianapolis, which crossed a creek thirteen times. Those <b>nine</b> <b>holes</b> are now incorporated into the Royal Oak course at Dye's Walk Country Club. Their first 18-hole course was created during 1962 in Indianapolis and named Heather Hills, now known as Maple Creek Golf & Country Club.|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose. Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that wearing blue tinted glasses helps relieve the symptoms of Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD). Though not formally tested, changes in the eye, resulting from PD, have been documented. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if wearing blue tinted glasses would result in an immediate decrease in the bradykinesia/akinesia associated with PD as measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and <b>Nine</b> <b>Hole</b> Peg Tests. Methods. A single-blind design with randomized trials was used. Subjects with a diagnosis of PD and rated in Hoehn and Yahr stages two to four were recruited. Each subject was tested under four randomized conditions: no glasses, blue, gray, and yellow tinted glasses. During each condition, the subjects 2 ̆ 7 movement times were measured with the TUG and the <b>Nine</b> <b>Hole</b> Peg Tests. Data was analyzed using an ANOVA without replication. Results. Data from 24 subjects, primarily in Hoehn and Yahr stage two, was used for analysis. No statistically significant differences were found between movement times in the four test conditions. Conclusion and Discussion. Wearing blue tinted glasses did not immediately decrease the bradykinesia/akinesia associated with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease as measured by the TUG and the <b>Nine</b> <b>Hole</b> Peg Tests. Based upon exit questionnaire responses, subjects were unaware of movement time differences during testing conditions. Future research should address more severely impaired subjects with PD, as well as various shades of blue and the length of time glasses are worn...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown that ondansetron, a 5 -HT 3 antagonist, can ameliorate vertigo in patients with acute brainstem disorders. A coincidental benefit was the improvement of cerebellar tremor in some patients with both vertigo and tremor. To further evaluate this effect, a placebo controlled, double blind, crossover study was conducted of a single dose of intravenous ondansetron in 20 patients with cerebellar tremor caused by multiple sclerosis, cerebellar degeneration, or drug toxicity. The principal outcome measures were the change in blind assessment of a writing task (spiral copying) and the timed completion of a <b>nine</b> <b>hole</b> peg test. Thirteen of 19 patients were deemed to have improved spiral copying after treatment with ondansetron when compared with baseline performance. One patient had a better response to the placebo compared with baseline performance (P = 0. 00024). Patients completed the <b>nine</b> <b>hole</b> peg test in less time after ondansetron than after placebo (P = 0. 08).
