50|$|Laboratory-scale {{studies of}} the {{phenomenon}} typically employ a wheel or a blade, which is towed behind a pivot point and allowed to bounce over the material studied as it follows a circular path in a pan, holding the material. These studies have investigated a variety of granular and viscous, even fluid, materials. In the laboratory, washboarding has been studied {{for a range of}} parameters, including the thickness and grain size of the material for varied wheel sizes, shapes, and masses. Experiments produced ripples for each parameter, above a threshold speed, when the wheel (or blade) began to bounce. Experiments also show that the pattern can move either against the direction of motion or in the direction of motion. They also show that a passive, <b>non-driving</b> <b>wheel</b> suffices to create corrugations and that displacement of material, rather than ejection is the dominant mechanism.|$|E
40|$|An {{on-board}} {{centralized system}} for regulating {{the pressure of}} the tyres of a motor-vehicle. Tue system comprises a source of pressurized air (lOl), two toroidal pneumatic rotary joints (T) each associated to a driving wheel (W) ofthe motor-vehicle, and a circuit that sets in communication the source of pressurized air (I O l) with an inlet fitting of each pneumatic rotary joint (T). Tue output member of the constant-velocity joint (J) and the wheel spindle (7) have an internal duct (65) for passage of air, connected on one side to the respective pneumatic rotary joint (T) {{and on the other side}} to a plenum (P) of the respective driving wheel (W). Each <b>non-driving</b> <b>wheel</b> (WR) has its wheel spindle (46) traversed by an axial bare for the passage of air, connected on one side to the air-supply circuit via a pneumatic rotary joint (TR) and on the other side to a plenum (PR) of the <b>non-driving</b> <b>wheel</b> (WR), which is in turn connected to the inner chamber (C) of the tyre. Each driving wheel or <b>non-driving</b> <b>wheel</b> has its plenum (P, PR) connected to the inner chamber (C) of the tyre via two parallel lines (L 2, L 3), for deflating and inflating, respectively, the tyre interposed in which are respective one-way valves (28, 32). Tue one-way valve (28) on the deflation line is provided with a return spring (30), which guarantees a pre-set minimum value of he pressure of the inner chamber (C) of the tyre...|$|E
2500|$|The UIC {{classification}} is used {{mostly in}} European countries {{apart from the}} United Kingdom. It designates consecutive pairs of wheels (informally [...] "axles") with a number for <b>non-driving</b> <b>wheels</b> and a capital letter for driving wheels (A=1, B=2, etc.) So a Whyte 4-6-2 designation would be an equivalent to a 2-C-1 UIC designation.|$|R
50|$|Park (P): This {{selection}} mechanically {{locks the}} output shaft of transmission, restricting the vehicle from moving in any direction. A parking pawl prevents the transmission from rotating, {{and therefore the}} vehicle from moving. However, the vehicle's non-driven wheels are still free to rotate, and the driven wheels may still rotate individually (because of the differential). For this reason, it is recommended to use the hand brake (parking brake) because this actually locks (in most cases) the wheels and prevents them from moving. It is typical of front-wheel-drive vehicles for the parking brake to lock the rear (<b>non-driving)</b> <b>wheels,</b> so use of both the parking brake and the transmission park lock provides the greatest security against unintended movement on slopes. This also increases {{the life of the}} transmission and the park pin mechanism, because parking on an incline with the transmission in park without the parking brake engaged will cause undue stress on the parking pin, and may even prevent the pin from releasing. A hand brake should also prevent the car from moving if a worn selector accidentally drops into reverse gear while idling.|$|R
5000|$|... ==History== The BFB was {{developed}} in 1938 for use on Bulleidâ€™s innovative Merchant Navy class of Pacific locomotives. He later used them on all subsequent designs: the Q1 [...] "austerity class" [...] in 1942; his Light Pacifics (the West Country and Battle of Britain classes) in 1945; and his Leader class in 1946. The pacifics also used a similar design of BFB for the <b>non-driving</b> carrying <b>wheels.</b> He also used them in his modifications to the Maunsell Diesel shunters then in use on the Southern.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Monitoring and {{management}} of soil quality is crucial for sustaining soil function in ecosystem. Tillage {{is one of the}} management operations that drastically affect soil physical quality. Conservation tillage methods are one of the efficient solutions in agriculture to reduce the soil erosion, air pollution, energy consumption, and the costs, if there is a proper management on the crop residues. One of the serious problems in agriculture is soil erosion which is rapidly increased in the recent decades as the intensity of tillage increases. This phenomenon occurs more in sloping lands or in the fields which are lacking from crop residues and organic materials. The conservation tillage has an important role in minimizing soil erosion and developing the quality of soil. Hence, it has attracted the attention of more researchers and farmers in the recent years. Materials and Methods: In this study, the effect of different tillage methods has been investigated on the crop residues, mechanical resistance of soil, and the stability of aggregates. This research was performed on the agricultural fields of Urmia University, located in Nazloo zone in 2012. Wheat and barley were planted in these fields, consecutively. The soil texture of these fields was loamy clay and the factorial experiments were done in a completely randomized block design. In this study, effect of three tillage systems including tillage with moldboard (conventional tillage), tillage with disk plow (reduced tillage), chisel plow (minimum tillage) and control treatment on some soil physical properties was investigated. Depth is second factor that was investigated in three levels including 0 - 60, 60 - 140, and 140 - 200 mm. Moreover, the effect of different percentages of crop residues on the rolling resistance of <b>non-driving</b> <b>wheels</b> was studied in a soil bin. The contents of crop residues have been measured by using the linear transects and image processing methods. In the linear transects method, the experiments were replicated three times in each block due to increasing the accuracy and mean of datawas calculated. The tests were randomly performed in each block. Then, the number of nodes, which are located on crop residues of size 25 mm, longitudinally, was counted. So the percentage of crop residue in each block was calculated through the percentage of nodes. The experiments of rolling resistance were also performed in three levels, 10, 50, and 90...|$|R
