40|$|International audienceThe {{use of the}} DNL metric in airport <b>noise</b> <b>zoning</b> {{is based}} {{in the works of}} Schultz, that were later {{improved}} by Fidell. The basic idea is to use the percentage of highly annoyed people as a parameter to organize the area around airports. In urban zoning it is recommended to use the equivalent sound level LAEQ, which uses different criteria to day and night periods to define the land use. With regards to airport noise one may use LAD and LAN metrics which are the equivalent sound levels determined for day and night period, respectively. In this case, the maximum levels chosen to the establishment of the zoning are based on the land use. It is possible, through a simple equation, to determine the DNL level associated to a LAD, LAN pair. The inverse problem, however, has not a unique solution, once this relation depends on the number of daily and night flights of the airport. Thus, the use of DNL in airport <b>noise</b> <b>zoning</b> may lead to completely different results for different airports. Examples are presented and discussed for two main brazilian airports: Recife and Congonhas...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the Resolution A 33 / 7, 2001, ICAO has {{presented}} a balanced approach related {{the problem of}} airport noise control. In this approach the four aspects considered are: Reduction at source of aircraft noise, planning and land management, operational procedures for reducing noise and operational restrictions. The one that presents more difficulties in implementation is management of land use {{in the case of}} Brazil. The urban zoning aims to ensure the comfort of the population, divide the city into zones and for each zone set a noise criterion level at daytime and at nighttime. The metric used in urban zoning is the equivalent sound level. The metric used for the airport zoning is DNL which is 24 h metrics and is directly related with annoyance. The use of the DNL metric in airport <b>noise</b> <b>zoning</b> is based in the works of Schultz that were later improved by Fidel. The inconsistencies between metrics create urban conflicts due to lack of communication and understanding of the zoning approach used. The analysis has shown that the DNL metric has problems to zoning airports with restrictions on nighttime use. In urban zoning it is recommended to use the equivalent sound level LAEQ, which uses different criteria to day and night periods to define the land use. It is possible, through a simple equation, to determine the DNL level associated to a LAeqD, LAeqN pair. The inverse problem, however, has not a unique solution, once this relation depends on the number of daily and night flights of the airport. Thus, the use of DNL in airport <b>noise</b> <b>zoning</b> may lead to completely different results for different airports. Thus a new logical airport zoning is proposed based on LAeqD and LAeqN. This airport zoning will provide for urban authorities a set of curves and clear application {{that can be used to}} produce a compatible urban zoning...|$|E

40|$|The Brisbane River serves {{multiple}} {{functions in}} both its upper catchment and its lower reaches. The lower reaches are highly urbanized {{where the river}} flows through Australia's third largest city, and here the river sustains transport activities, waste water disposal, a port, and both motorized recreation and active and passive non-motorized recreation. In the city the river {{also serves as a}} locality for community events, as a cultural icon and as a residential neighbour. Many of these functions are spatially and temporally congruent and, amongst other issues, this congruency has the potential to generate significant levels of noise conflict. This paper describes the approach adopted to assess {{the nature and extent of}} noise conflicts and to develop a comprehensive strategy of noise management-allas part of a larger scheme for an integrated approach to manage the Brisbane River and its catchment. Noise management strategies recommended for implementation include <b>noise</b> <b>zoning</b> of the river, planning and approval processes for land-based waterway facilities, noise planning and approval processes for residential and other noise-sensitive uses, codes of practice for rowing and similar activities, as well as the more conventional approach of regulatory limits on river-based noise sources. The paper demonstrates that a wide range of strategies are necessary to handle complex pollution problems of this sort, and provides a model of comprehensive action for management of noise from river-related activities that may find application elsewhere. ...|$|E
40|$|As a theory, {{location}} is {{the effects of}} space on the organization of economic activities. The main stages in determining the airport {{location is}} to determine the size of land required; the evaluation of factors that influence the airport location; the study of the possible alternatives area which can be built; survey/inspection location; environmental studies; evaluation of the locations that are considered potential; preparation of an outline plan, cost and revenue estimates; evaluation and final selection; and report and recommendations. The purpose of this study were to select the optimal location of airports and feasible in terms of economical, technical, land use, air transport operational and the environment aspects, and also preparing a strategy analysis, forecast growth in short, medium and long terms in facing the challenges ahead. The study was conducted by collecting primary and secondary data. The data was based on field survey; interviews; discussions with airport authority, official government, etc; and also from various agencies. Analytical tools used were: (1) scoring method (lykert scale), (2) formulas of NPV, BCR, EIRR, FIRR, (3) aviation operation safety zone and <b>noise</b> <b>zoning</b> area management viewed from land use plan, (4) regression analysis, and (5) analysis of environmental aspect (noise, air pollution, etc.). The findings and recommendations were: optimal airport location should provide: (1) a positive benefit/value on high score in technical aspect viewed from the topography, soil structure, hydrology and geology/physiography; land use; accessibility; infrastructure; availability of land; and distance to/from airport, (2) NPV> 0, BCR> 1, EIRR, and FIRR is higher than the cost of capital, viewed from economic and financial aspects, (3) limited obstacles related to Aviation Operation Safety Zone and Noise Zone Contour viewed from land use plan (4) good forecasting analysis viewed from airport operational aspect, and (5) minimum of airport construction impact on pre-construction, construction and post-construction viewed from environmental aspect...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{management}} of noise in an academic library by outlining an evidence-based approach taken over seven years by the University of Limerick in the Republic of Ireland. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the impact on library users of noise management interventions implemented from 2007 to 2014 through retrospective analysis of LibQUAL+® survey data. The data indicate that readers’ perceptions of the provision of quiet space in the library greatly improved in that period. The study provides evidence showing the effectiveness of interventions, such as the development of a <b>noise</b> policy, <b>zoning,</b> rearranging of furniture, removal of service points from reader spaces, and structural improvements. There is evidence to indicate that the creation of a separate graduate reading room may be an effective noise management intervention not previously identified in the literature. Academic libraries struggling with noise problems and those with low scores on the LibQUAL+® quiet space question may find some helpful interventions that have an underlying evidence base to indicate their effectiveness when dealing with noise and the provision of quiet space...|$|R

It is noted, that there is no modern standard and methodical base for such assessment. It is shown that when planning the build- ing, and also when developing noise-protective actions for residential areas in the zones of aviation noise increased level im- pact it’s most effectively to carry out acoustic zoning of areas near airports borders and flight routes. The system of transport sources noise rationing in Russia doesn't consider the established practice of its application. The aircraft of noisy types were actively taken out of service and aviation noise impact near the airports decreased, but the problem of noise protection, de- mands control when planning land use. Noise measurements in residential areas, near houses and inside, showed the excess of maximum allowed level values to 25 - 35 dBA (on equivalent value) and to 25 - 40 dBA (on the maximum value). As a consequence of the European states policy {{in the sphere}} of aviation noise management and of aerodrome en- virons <b>zoning</b> <b>noise</b> levels at the airports of Europe and their surroundings were stabilized and the sizes of noise contours were reduced.

For rationing theaerodrome environs noise of the airports it’s offered to take a sound equivalent level in which admissible values are ranged on three zones for the main standard criterion. The authors present acoustic measurements results in houses near the airport Vnukovo on condition of using standard two-chamber trimmable and folding windows with the ventilating valve. It is shown that the popular window designs can't provide inside noise reduction at night to the standard L Amax level = 45 dBA from the aviation source creating noise L Amax > 75 dBA; sound insulation efficiency of the used blocks is insufficient.
