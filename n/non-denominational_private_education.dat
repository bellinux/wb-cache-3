40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between the expenditure on <b>private</b> <b>education</b> and stress from <b>private</b> <b>education,</b> and the role conflicts of the mothers of junior and senior high school students. The subjects were 300 mothers of students who are enrolled in junior and senior high school and receiving <b>private</b> <b>education</b> in Seoul and its suburbs. The results were as follows: First, the level of stress from <b>private</b> <b>education</b> was found to be higher than the scale range of the median, whereas the degree of role conflicts was slightly lower than the scale range of the median. Second, a hierarchical regression analysis was performed by using the expenditure on <b>private</b> <b>education</b> and stress from <b>private</b> <b>education</b> as independent variables and the socio-demographic variables of mothers as the control variables in order to identify their effect on the role conflicts of the mothers of the junior and senior high school students. The results show that the age of the mother, the household monthly income, the monthly expenditure on <b>private</b> <b>education,</b> and stress from <b>private</b> <b>education</b> were significantly related to the role conflicts of the mothers. That is, the older the age of the mother, the lower the level of monthly income, the lower the level of the monthly expenditure on <b>private</b> <b>education,</b> and the higher the level of stress from <b>private</b> <b>education,</b> the greater the degree of the role conflicts of the mother...|$|R
