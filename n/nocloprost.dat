40|$|The {{release of}} {{neuronal}} [3 H]acetylcholine (ACh) from isolated human bronchi after labelling with [3 H]choline was measured {{to investigate the}} effects of prostanoids. A first period of electrical field stimulation (S 1) caused a [3 H]ACh release of 320 ± 70 and 200 ± 40 Becquerel (Bq) g− 1 in epithelium-denuded and epithelium-containing bronchi respectively (P> 0. 05). Subsequent periods of electrical stimulation (Sn, n= 2, 3, and 4) released less [3 H]ACh, i. e. decreasing Sn/S 1 values were obtained (0. 76 ± 0. 09, 0. 68 ± 0. 07 and 0. 40 ± 0. 04, respectively). Cumulative concentrations (1 – 1000 [*]nM) of EP-receptor agonists like prostaglandin E 2, <b>nocloprost,</b> and sulprostone (EP 1 and EP 3 selective) inhibited evoked [3 H]ACh release in a concentration dependent manner with IC 50 values between 4 – 14 [*]nM and maximal inhibition of about 70 %. The inhibition of evoked [3 H]ACh release by prostaglandin E 2, <b>nocloprost</b> and sulprostone was not affected by the DP-, EP 1 - and EP 2 -receptor antagonist AH 6809 at a concentration of 3 [*]μM, i. e. a 3 – 30 times greater concentration than its affinity (pA 2 values) at the respective receptors. Circaprost (IP-receptor agonist; 1 – 100 [*]nM), iloprost (IP- and EP 1 -receptor agonist; 10 - 1000 [*]nM) and U- 46619 (TP-receptor agonist; 100 – 1000 [*]nM) did not significantly affect [3 H]ACh release. Blockade of cyclooxygenase by 3 [*]μM indomethacin did not significantly modulate evoked [3 H]ACh release in epithelium-containing and epithelium-denuded bronchi. Likewise, the combined cyclo- and lipoxygenase inhibitor BW- 755 C (20 [*]μM) did not affect evoked [3 H]ACh release. In conclusion, applied prostanoids appear to inhibit [3 H]ACh release in epithelium-denuded human bronchi under the present in vitro conditions, most likely via prejunctional prostanoid receptors of the EP 3 subtype...|$|E
