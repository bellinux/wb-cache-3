5000|$|The {{decline of}} the turkey {{industry}} was followed by rapid growth in the chicken egg business. Egg production, {{which began in the}} 1920s, thrived into the 1970s. In 1970, there were about 50 egg ranches in Ramona. Today, most of the chicken ranches are gone. By 2003, only four remained. A notable exception to the decline is the Pine Hills Egg Ranch, which at 1,100,000 birds is the 58th largest nationally, and the 5th largest in the state of California.

Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was the latest gold standard to detect the genome of AI and ND viruses. Recently, RT-PCR was developed in routine diagnosis and research. RT-PCR is a method to amplify the sequences of DNA genome, preceded by reverse transcriptase process with the primer-mediated enzymatic. Some factors that influenced detection of AI and ND are design primer and probe, types of samples, enzyme, reagent composition, amplification temperature and cycles, technical and non-technical factors such as contamination and trained staff. Modified conventional and real time RT-PCR are able to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the test. ...|$|R

Molecular techniques (RT-PCR and PCR) were performed for <b>Newcastle</b> <b>Diseases</b> Virus (NDV) and Chlamydia psittaci diagnosis. Additionally, HI test was applied to detect antibodies against NDV. Serological results by RST were 3. 3 % positive for M. synoviae, 2. 5 % for M. gallisepticum, and 0. 4 % for S.

Eighty day old Cobb broilers were randomly divided into 2 equal groups of control and treatment. Both groups were kept under the same management, nutrition, density, ventilation and vaccination conditions. The only difference between the two groups was treatment of the last week of the breeding period (days 36 - 42). Which was 24 0 C in the control group and 33 0 C in the treatment group. At the end of the breeding period (days 42), blood samples were taken from the brachial vein of all broiler. To determine the blood parameters, part of the samples were collected in anticoagulant containing capillary tubes (1 mg/ml, EDTA) and were determined immediately. The Haematocrit, Leucocyte counts and differential Leucocyte counts were determined immediately. The other portions of the brachial blood were used to determine blood PH and following centrifuging and separation of the sera, some biochemichal parameters such as Total protein and Glocose were evaluated by colorimetric method with specific kits.

40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} {{inhibitory}} effect of <b>Newcastle</b> <b>diseases</b> virus (NDV) on CCl 4 -induced liver fibrosis in mice. Methods　Liver fibrosis model was reproduced in 30 Kunming mice by intraperitoneal injection of CCl 4 /peanut oil solution for 2 times a week, {{and the total}} treatment lasted for 8 weeks. Three days after last injection, NDV was injected through tail vein for 1 or 3 times (24 h intervals). Twenty-four hours after NDV infusion, mice were sacrificed and the livers were removed for gross morphology observation. The liver tissue sections were stained by HE and Sirius red dyeing. α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression was detected by Western blotting. Results　After CCl 4 induction for 8 weeks, obvious fibrosis symptoms appeared in the liver of model mice, and the surface of liver tissue became hard with rough, with white patches on it. HE staining showed that there was loosening of tissue and enlarged perisinusoidal spaces in liver with fibrosis. Sirius red dyeing displayed abnormal collagen deposition in the fibrotic liver tissues. After NDV injection for 3 times, white spots {{on the surface of}} mouse liver were significantly reduced, and collagen deposition was lowered. Western blotting showed that α-SMA levels decreased with increasing frequency of NDV injection. Conclusion　NDV may effectively suppress the development of CCl 4 -induced liver fibrosis in mice.

40|$|European {{starlings}} (Sturnus vulgaris, Figure 1) are an {{invasive species}} in the United States. The first recorded release of the birds was in 1890 in New York City’s Central Park. Because starlings easily adapt {{to a variety of}} habitats, nest sites and food sources, the birds spread quickly across the country. Today, there are about 150 million starlings in North America. Conflicts between people and starlings occur mostly in agricultural settings. Conflicts can occur during winter in urban and suburban environments, especially in business districts. Starlings damage apples, blueberries, cherries, figs, grapes, peaches, and strawberries. Besides causing direct losses from eating fruits, starlings peck and slash at fruits, reducing product quality and increasing the fruits’ susceptibility to diseases and crop pests (Figure 2). Starlings gather at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) during late fall and winter. Flocks are much larger than those encountered in late summer and are harder to disperse {{because of a lack of}} alternative foods. Starlings prefer facilities with open feeder systems which provide easy access to livestock rations (Figure 5). The link between starlings and livestock health is beginning to be understood. Epidemiological evidence suggests that starlings are both biological vectors (e. g., fecal matter) and mechanical vectors (e. g., feet, beaks) of pathogens. Starlings can transmit or amplify several bacterial, fungal, parasitical and viral pathogens. Starlings carry Salmonella spp., several Escherichia coli serotypes, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacterium avium, Chalmydophilia psittaci, Flavivirus spp. (West Nile Virus), Avulavirus spp. (<b>Newcastle’s</b> <b>disease)</b> and transmissible gastroenteritis (a coronavirus) without showing any symptoms of illness. Pathogens survive in feed troughs, watering troughs and fecal deposits, some surviving for weeks or years. Transmission to livestock occurs through fecal–oral routes, mainly ingestion or licking among animals. Combining multiple methods that affect auditory, gustatory and visual senses is an effective approach for managing pest birds, such as starlings. Starlings quickly habituate to visual deterrents (e. g., Mylar® tape, hawk kites) and audio deterrents (e. g., recorded distress calls). You can prolong and enhance the effectiveness of deterrents by frequently changing their locations and reinforcing them with other methods, such as pyrotechnics, propane cannons, falconry, and shooting...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial {{disorders}} {{belong to}} the most prevalent inherited metabolic diseases with the m. 3243 A > G mutation reflecting {{being one of the}} most common mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Previous studies showed little relationship between mitochondrial genetics and disease manifestation. Relationship between genotype and disease manifestation with patient reported quality of life and other patient reported outcomes is still unexplored. METHODS: Seventy-two out of the 122 invited adult patients with m. 3243 A > G mutation completed online standardized questionnaires on quality of life, functional impairment, fatigue and mental health as assessed by the RAND-SF 36, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). Data were related to clinical manifestation reflected by the <b>Newcastle</b> Mitochondrial <b>Disease</b> Adult Scale (NMDAS) score and heteroplasmy levels of the mutation in urine epithelial cells. RESULTS: Patients reported impaired quality of life. Sixty percent showed severe levels of fatigue, and 37 % showed clinical relevant mental health problems, which was significantly more than healthy norms. These patient reported health outcomes showed negligible relationship with levels of heteroplasmy (r = <. 30) and weak (. 30 < r <. 50) to moderate (. 50 < r <. 70) relationship with clinical manifestation. CONCLUSIONS: Patient reported outcomes on quality of life, fatigue and mental health problems, are only partly reflected by clinical assessments.

Methods: We assessed the six minute timed walk (6 MTW), 10 meter walk / test (10 MWT), Timed up and Go (TUG) and the 5 times sit to stand (5 XSTS), in 18 patients (12 sedentary controls), at baseline and a subgroup of 10 control-matched patients following a 16 -week structured aerobic exercise intervention program. Results: All outcome measures assessed were valid and able to differentiate between patients and controls. Disease severity, as measured by the <b>Newcastle</b> Mitochondrial <b>Disease</b> Adult Scale, correlated with TUG (r = 0. 54, p = 0. 020) and 10 MWT (r = 0. 47, p = 0. 050).
