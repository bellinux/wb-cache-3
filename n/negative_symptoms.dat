40|$|Background: In a {{previous}} study, we {{reported that the}} distribution of total depressive symptoms scores according to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in a general population is stable throughout middle adulthood and follows an exponential pattern except for at the lowest end of the symptom score. Furthermore, the individual distributions of 16 <b>negative</b> <b>symptom</b> items of the CES-D exhibit a common mathematical pattern. To confirm the reproducibility of these findings, we investigated the distribution of total depressive symptoms scores and 16 <b>negative</b> <b>symptom</b> items {{in a sample of}} Japanese employees. Methods: We analyzed 7624 employees aged 20 - 59 years who had participated in the Northern Japan Occupational Health Promotion Centers Collaboration Study for Mental Health. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D. The CES-D contains 20 items, each of which is scored in four grades: "rarely, " "some, " "much, " and "most of the time. " The descriptive statistics and frequency curves of the distributions were then compared according to age group. Results: The distribution of total depressive symptoms scores appeared to be stable from 30 - 59 years. The right tail of the distribution for ages 30 - 59 years exhibited a linear pattern with a log-normal scale. The distributions of the 16 individual <b>negative</b> <b>symptom</b> items of the CESD exhibited a common mathematical pattern which displayed different distributions with a boundary at "some.

5|$|The {{first-line}} {{psychiatric treatment}} for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which {{can reduce the}} positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. Antipsychotics, however, fail to significantly improve the <b>negative</b> <b>symptoms</b> and cognitive dysfunction. In those on antipsychotics, continued use decreases the risk of relapse. There is little evidence regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years. However use of anti-psychotics can lead to dopamine hypersensitivity increasing the risk of symptoms if antipsychotics are stopped.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met {{over much of the}} time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be <b>negative</b> <b>symptoms,</b> or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Previous {{studies have}} been {{inconsistent}} {{with regard to the}} extent to which stress perception, rather than stressor exposure, predicts <b>negative</b> health <b>symptoms.</b> Because sex differences have been observed in all three of these variables, in this study the possibility that sex differences also exist in the relationships between them is investigated. Methods: Self-report inventories of perceived stress, stressor exposure, and <b>negative</b> health <b>symptoms</b> were given to 107 young-adult participants (65 females, 42 males). Results: Sex differences were observed in the associations among perceived stress, stressor exposure, and <b>negative</b> health <b>symptom</b> rates. Specifically, while higher perceived stress and higher stressor exposure rates independently predicted higher <b>negative</b> health <b>symptoms</b> rates in females, only higher stressor exposure rates independently predicted higher <b>negative</b> health <b>symptoms</b> in males. Indeed, unexpectedly, after controlling for exposure to stressors there was a trend towards higher perceived stress predicting lower <b>negative</b> health <b>symptoms</b> in males. Conclusions: While exposure to stress was a significant negative predictor of health for both sexes, perception of stress was predictive only for females. One implication of this finding is that different psychological models are needed to predict health symptoms in the two sexes...|$|R
5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or <b>negative</b> <b>symptoms.</b> The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E

50|$|In psychology, alogia (Greek ἀ-, “without”, and λόγος, “speech”), or {{poverty of}} speech, {{is a general}} lack of additional, unprompted content seen in normal speech.

25|$|Current theory {{focuses on}} the role of {{dopamine}} in schizophrenia, particularly how <b>negative</b> <b>symptoms</b> such as social withdrawal and apathy may be caused by a deficiency of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex while positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations may be caused by excess dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway.

40|$|The current {{research}} investigates cognitive mechanisms that may mediate poor functional outcomes and symptoms in schizophrenia. Findings are that: (1) relative to controls, patients manifest more symptomatology (positive, negative and affective), perform more poorly on cognitive tasks (memory, attention, and abstraction), achieve poorer social and occupational outcomes, and endorse defeatist and negativistic cognition {{to a greater}} degree (i. e., inaccurate or overly pessimistic expectations and thoughts about social and non-social performance); (2) patients who endorse defeatist and negativistic cognition tend to be characterized by higher <b>negative</b> <b>symptom</b> levels, poorer social and occupational outcomes, and worse performance on cognitive performance measures of abstraction, attention, and memory; (3) defeatist performance attitude endorsement mediates the relationship between cognitive performance and <b>negative</b> <b>symptom</b> levels; (4) defeatist performance attitude endorsement mediates the relationship between cognitive performance and social and occupational functioning. Implications of these findings for future research and treatment in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia are discussed in the context of study limitations. ...|$|R

25|$|It is unclear, however, how {{nicotine}} {{interacts with}} positive symptoms, {{as it would}} follow from this theory that nicotine would exacerbate excess dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway and thus positive symptoms as well.

Results: The {{results indicate that the}} individuals with schizophrenia and HFA were both impaired on a variety of social cognitive tasks relative to the non-clinical controls, but did not differ from one another. When individuals with schizophrenia were divided into <b>negative</b> <b>symptom</b> and paranoid subgroups, exploratory analyses revealed that individuals with HFA may be more similar, in terms of the pattern of social cognition impairments, to the <b>negative</b> <b>symptom</b> group than to the paranoia group.

30|$|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterised by the {{progressive}} deposition of amyloid-β {{in the wall}} of cortical and leptomeningeal arteries [62].

Such acute subarachnoid haemorrhage in CAA is usually limited to a few sulci at the convexity of the brain, but predicts a high early risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, which may motivate preventive action [63]. These TFNE are mostly recurrent, stereotyped and brief. The most common <b>negative</b> <b>symptom</b> is spreading brachiofacial paresia [64].

40|$|Aim. Cognitive {{impairment}} in schizophrenia strongly relates to social outcome {{and is a}} good candidate for endophenotypes. When we accurately measure drug efficacy or effects of genes or variants relevant to schizophrenia on cognitive impairment, clinical factors that can affect scores on cognitive tests, such as age and severity of symptoms, should be considered. To elucidate the effect of clinical factors, we conducted multiple regression analysis using scores of the Continuous Performance Test Identical Pairs Version (CPT-IP), which is often used to measure attention/vigilance in schizophrenia. Methods. We conducted the CPT-IP (4 - 4 digit) and examined clinical information (sex, age, education years, onset age, duration of illness, chlorpromazine-equivalent dose, and Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Symptom</b> Scale (PANSS) scores) in 126 schizophrenia patients in Japanese population.
