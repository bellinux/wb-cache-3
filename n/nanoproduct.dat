The initial emphasis of nanomaterial life cycle studies {{has been on the}} environmental and health effects of nanoproducts during the production and usage stages. Analyzing the end-of-life (eol) stage of nanomaterials is also critical because significant impacts or benefits for the environment may arise at that particular stage. In this article, the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) Consumer Products Inventory (CPI) model was used, which contains a relatively large and complete <b>nanoproduct</b> list (1, 014) as of 2010. The consumer products have wide range of applications, such as clothing, sports goods, personal care products, medicine, as well as contributing to faster cars and planes, more powerful computers and satellites, better micro and nanochips, and long-lasting batteries. In order to understand the eol cycle concept, we allocated 1, 014 nanop! roducts into the nine end-of-life categories (e. g., recyclability, ingestion, absorption by skin/public sewer, public sewer, burning/landfill, landfill, air release, air release/public sewer, and other) based on probable final destinations of the nanoproducts. This article highlights the results of this preliminary assessment of end-of-life stage of nanoproducts. The largest potential eol fate was found to be recyclability, however little literature appears to have evolved around <b>nanoproduct</b> recycling. At lower frequency is dermal and ingestion human uptake and then landfill. Release to water and air are much lower potential eol fates for current nanoproducts.

40|$|Abstract In the European {{construction}} industry in 2009, {{the use of}} engineered nanoparticles appears to be confined to {{a limited number of}} products, predomi-nantly coatings, cement and concrete. A survey among representatives of workers and employers from 14 EU countries suggests a high level of ignorance about the availability and use of nanomaterials for the construc-tion industry and the safety aspects thereof. Barriers for a large-scale acceptance of products containing engineered nanoparticles (nanoproducts) are high costs, uncertainties about long-term technical material performance, as well as uncertainties about health risks of nanoproducts. Workplace measurements sug-gest a modest exposure of construction workers to nanoparticles (NPs) {{associated with the use of}} nano-products. The measured particles were within a size range of 20 – 300 nm, with the median diameter below 53 nm.

The relationships between the antibacterial activity of powders and the fabrication conditions were investigated by X-ray diffraction, SEM and UV-visible spectrophotometer.

40|$|International audienceRisks {{associated}} with the end-of-life of nanomaterials are an issue {{that needs to be}} addressed so that the public perception and opinion, with regard to these emerging technological products, can effectively be supported by experimental evidences. In order to find new ecological ways to treat nanoproducts at their end-of-life, a new home-made demonstrator system was setup at INERIS, specifically designed to perform burning tests, coupled to a differential thermal analyzer to monitor the combustion kinetics. To assess nanoobject release during combustion, a high-performance nanocomposite polymer commonly used in the automotive industry, namely the polymeric compound acrylonitrile butadiene styrene matrix mixed with 3 wt% of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was tested. To assess the potential release of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) during the combustion with this tool, the particle size distribution in the fumes was measured using an electrical low pressure impactor, and CNTs were collected using an aspiration-based transmission electron microscopy grid sampler. One of primary objective of these preliminary tests described in this study consisted in validating whether CNT fibers can be released in the gas phase during the combustion of a polymeric matrix filled with CNTs. It was found indeed that MWCNT of about 12 -nm diameter and 600 -nm length can be released in the ambient environment during combustion of 3 % MWCNT ABS.

40|$|The fast {{penetration}} of nanoproducts {{on the market}} under conditions of significant uncertainty of their environmental properties and risks to humans creates a need for companies to assess sustainability of their products. Evaluation of the potential benefits and risks to build a coherent story for communication with clients, authorities, consumers, and other stakeholders is getting to be increasingly important, but SMEs often lack the knowledge and expertise to assess risks and communicate them appropriately. This paper introduces LICARA nanoSCAN, a modular web based tool that supports SMEs in assessing benefits and risks associated with new or existing nanoproducts. This tool is unique because it is scanning both the benefits and risks over the nanoproducts life cycle in comparison to a reference product with a similar functionality in order to enable the development of sustainable and competitive nanoproducts. SMEs can use data and expert judgment to answer mainly qualitative and semi-quantitative questions {{as a part of}} tool application. Risks to public, workers and consumers are assessed, while the benefits are evaluated for economic, environmental and societal opportunities associated with the product use. The tool provides an easy way to visualize results as well as to identify gaps, missing data and associated uncertainties.

During the last 10 years the need to correlate aerosol exposure and biological effects has become especially important due to rapid development of a new, revolutionary industry ? [...] nanotechnology. <b>Nanoproduct</b> commerce is predicted to top $ 1 trillion by 2015. Quantitative assessment of aerosol particle behavior in air and in lung deposition, and dosimetry in different parts of the lung, particularly for nanoaerosols, remains poor despite several decades of study.

We discuss here the use of nanoscale radon decay products as an experimental tool in the study of local deposition and lung dosimetry for nanoaerosols. The issue of the safe use of radon progeny in such measurements is discussed based on a comparison of measured exposure in 3 settings: general population, miners, and in a human experiment conducted at the Paul Scherer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland.

40|$|Nanotechnology {{is a most}} {{promising}} field for generating new applications in medicine, although, only few nano products are currently in use for medical purposes. A most prominent <b>nanoproduct</b> is nanosilver. Nano-silver has biological properties which are significant for consumer products, food technology, textiles, and medical applications (e. g. wound care products, implantable medical devices, in diagnosis, drug delivery, and imaging). For their antibacterial activity, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are largely used in various commercially available products. The use of nano-silver {{is becoming more and}} more widespread in medicine and related applications, and due to its increasing exposure, toxicological and environmental issues need to be raised. Cytotoxicity induced by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and the role that oxidative stress plays in this process were demonstrated in human hepatoma cells AgNPs agglomerated in the cytoplasm and nuclei of treated cells, and they induced intracellular oxidative stress. AgNP reduced ATP content of the cell and caused damage to mitochondria and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. Silymarin was known as a hepatoprotective agent that is used in the treatment of hepatic diseases including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver diseases, Amanita mushroom poisoning, liver cirrhosis, toxic and drug-induced liver diseases. It promotes protein synthesis, helps in regenerating liver tissue, controls inflammation, enhances glucuronidation, and protects against glutathione depletion. Vitamin E is a well-known antioxidant and has hepatoprotective effect in liver diseases. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of Ag NPs on primary liver cells of mice. Cell viability (cytotoxicity) was examined with MTT assay after primary liver cells of mice exposure to AgNPs at 1, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400 ppm for 24 h. AgNPs caused a concentration- dependent decrease of cell viability (IC 50 value = 121. 7 ppm or µg/ml). Then the hepatoprotective effect of silymarin and vitamin E were experimented on silver nanoparticle toxicity on mice liver primary cell culture. The results showed that silymarin at 600 µg/ml and vitamin E at 2500 µmol/l have protective effects on silver nanoparticle toxicity on mice liver primary cell culture.

30|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} in the synthesis and properties of metal nanoparticles has been increasing because of their unique properties and promising applications as catalysts, ferrofluids, and semiconductors [1, 2]. Nanotechnology is the most promising field for generating new applications in medicine. However, only few nanoproducts are currently in use for medical purposes [3]. The most prominent <b>nanoproduct</b> is PNPs. PNPs are generally smaller than 100 nm and contain 20 to 15, 000 platinum atoms. Nanoparticles are often in the range 1 to 100 nm, {{and this is the}} size as that of human proteins. Metal nanoparticles possess a very high surface-to-volume ratio. In biology and biochemistry, nanoparticles have attracted much attention. Especially, PNPs with size in the range of 10 to 50 nm are most attractive for practical reasons [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Cancer killed 7.9 million people worldwide in 2007 [7]. Breast cancer {{is one of the leading}} causes of women mortality worldwide. Chemotherapy is the only option for treating the malignant breast cancer and condition to increase the life span of the patient [8]. Successful chemotherapy of cancer depends on the delivery of sufficient concentrations of an effective drug to tumor cells without causing intolerable toxicity to the patient. Platinum-based drugs are traditional cancer drugs used in chemotherapy to kill cancer cells. Consequently, an effective synthetic technique is required to produce nanoparticles with controlled shape and small size within a few Angström standard deviations. The usual synthetic technique for making such nanoparticles involves chemical or electrochemical reduction of metal ions in the presence of a stabilizer such as linear polymers [9, 10, 11] and ligands [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] which prevent the nanoparticles from aggregation and allow isolation of the nanoparticles. To control the particle size and shape, various reductants, stabilizers, solvents etc., have been utilized in nanoparticle preparation. The control of particle size and morphology has been extensively studied using different stabilizers [17, 18, 19, 20]. MCF- 7 and HepG- 2 cells are a suitable in vitro model system for the study of polarized human hepatocytes. MCF- 7 cells are useful for in vitro breast cancer studies because the cell line has retained several ideal characteristics particular to the mammary epithelium [21]. These include the ability for MCF- 7 cells to process estrogen, in the form of estradiol, via estrogen receptors in the cell cytoplasm. This makes the MCF- 7 cell line an estrogen receptor positive control cell line [22]. Because of their high degree of morphological and functional differentiation in vitro, HepG- 2 cells are a suitable model to study the intracellular trafficking and dynamics of bile canalicular and sinusoidal membrane proteins and lipids in human hepatocytes in vitro. In this research, we want to synthesize stable PNPs by use of K 2 PtCl 6 and a weak reductant agent such as trisodium citrate then evaluate them on the cell lines to determine cytotoxic concentration 50 % (CC 50).|$|E

A survey of experts in the sustainable nanotechnology domain was then conducted to elicit their knowledge in terms of completeness, reliability and validity of the criteria set. Ranking and correlation analyses completed the research by identifying the parameters of major interest as well as the links and dependencies between them. A total of 54 and 65 experts replied to the pilot and main survey, respectively. The reliability and validity of the criteria was assessed with the responses from both questionnaires, whereas the answers from the main survey were used to calculate the relative index of the criteria as well as their correlations. This research resulted in a framework composed of 68 criteria, which are structured into six main areas: (i) economic performance; (ii) environmental impacts, (iii) environmental risk assessment; (iv) human health risk assessment; (v) social implications and (vi) technical performance. This study helps to broaden the understanding on the identification of criteria for sustainability assessments.

Part I begins with definitions of chemical and biological agents within existing treaties, and of <b>nanoproducts,</b> including those existing beyond presently-known technical capabilities, but which are at least reasonably conceivable (“nanobots”). Part II provides an overview of treaty law that is potentially applicable to nanobots. It first examines current treaties that are facially applicable to <b>nanoproducts.</b> Because of the possibility that the “all analogous... devices” language of the 1925 Geneva Protocol bans nanobots, the Article examines very closely the origin, application, and meaning of that language.
