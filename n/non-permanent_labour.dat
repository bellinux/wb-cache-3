40|$|Existing data {{on health}} status {{and health care}} {{provision}} in agricultural labour communities in Zimbabwe indicate that both are poor. In addition, {{there is evidence that}} the concentration of capital through increased areas of landholdings, through mechanisation and use of agrochemicals produces a rise in under- and unemployment within the agricultural sector, which increases the risk of ill health. This paper addresses this question in Zimbabwe by examining the nature of developments within the large scale agricultural sector in the last decade, and the consequent effects on employment and income. Rising capital intensity in the private large scale sector is found to be associated with increases in unemployment and underemployment. The impact of this socioeconomic pattern on health is assessed in a longitudinal assessment of 78 permanent labour families and 76 non-permanent (underemployed) labour families in the large scale farming sector. The study shows that while poor social, economic and health conditions exist in all groups, <b>non-permanent</b> <b>labour</b> households suffer greater insecurity of employment and income, poorer health status and lesser participation in sociopolitical structures important for negotiating primary health care gains.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the status of a class of <b>non-permanent</b> <b>labour</b> in the globalised era in India. Design/methodology/approach – To understand this the paper uses both secondary level information and primary data collected through a survey. Secondary level data are analysed using a panel data model. Here, the hypothesis is: contribution of contract labour to production is greater than that of the regular employees. The primary level survey is conducted to know whether they are exploited due to their non-permanent stature. Findings – It is observed from secondary data analysis that the hypothesis is not rejected. Contract labour makes a significant contribution to production, while the regular employees do not. Primary survey also shows that they are exploited in many ways including through non-payment of minimum wages. Practical implications – The paper indicates that, while regulations are in place, they are abused and hence it is the implementation part on which government needs to focus. Originality/value – Analysis shows how rationalization of employment does not take place due to labour regulations for the regular employees. It also brings to light through primary survey various lacunae in the implementation of the Contract Labour Act. Since survey of such labour class is difficult there are limited studies in this field. Contract workers, Globalization, India, Temporary workers...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{selective}} attrition on estimates of immigrant earnings growth based on repeated cross-sectional data in Canada. Longitudinal tax data linked to immigrant landing records are used in order to estimate the change in immigrant earnings and the immigrant-Canadian-born earnings gap. The results are compared with those from repeated cross-sectional data. This approach eliminates differences in results that may stem from variation in collection modes and procedures across datasets.

40|$|Using {{administrative}} data, {{this paper}} asks (1) whether the changing characteristics of immigrants, notably {{the rise in}} the share with university education and in the "skilled economic" immigrant class, contributed positively to immigrant entry earnings during the 1990 s, and (2) whether the entry earnings of immigrants improved after 2000, and if not, why not. We find that, through the 1990 s, the rising number of entering immigrants with university degrees and in the skilled economic class did little to improve earnings {{at the bottom of the}} earnings distribution (and reduce poverty rates among entering immigrants), but the changes did increase earnings among immigrants at the middle and top of the earnings distribution. The increasing numbers of highly educated at the bottom of the earnings distribution were unable to convert their education and "skilled class" designation to higher earnings: they found themselves with low incomes. These outcomes may be related to language, credentialism, education quality, or supply issues, as discussed in the paper. We find that from 2000 to 2004, the entry earnings of immigrants renewed their slide, but for reasons that differed from the standard explanations of the earlier decline. Much of the fall after 2000 was concentrated among immigrants intending to practice in the information technology (IT) or engineering occupations. This coincided with the IT downturn, which appears to have significantly affected outcomes for these immigrants, particularly the men. Following the significant increase in supply in response to the call for more high-tech workers in the late 1990 s, the large numbers of entering immigrants were faced with the IT downturn.
