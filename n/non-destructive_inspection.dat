As salt and protein crystals are both formed in the growth process, and both are commonly transparent to the human eye, they cannot be differentiated with a standard optical microscope. As the tryptophan of protein absorbs light at 280nm, imaging with a UV microscope with 280nm bandpass filters makes it simple to differentiate between the two types of crystals. The protein crystals appear dark while the salt crystals are transparent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aircraft {{structure}} of a new design or significantly changed structure is subjected to experimental fatigue test due to safety assurance. Structural parts of aircraft frame are loaded in the laboratory, where the service conditions are simulated. According to airworthiness authorities, multiple time of design life is established. Because of fatigue behaviour of structure material, some damage occurs and crack growth is studied. For crack detection during fatigue test, the methods of non-destructive testing are used. Research and development projects, related to inspection of specimen by modern methods, improve the quality level of strength testing. The experiments were finished by teardown inspection and results of previous <b>non-destructive</b> <b>inspections</b> are validated by fractography...|$|R

5000|$|A cascade chart is {{tool that}} can be used in damage {{tolerance}} analysis to determine the proper inspection interval, based on reliability analysis, considering all the context uncertainties. The chart is called a [...] "cascade chart" [...] because the scatter of data points and downward curvature resembles a waterfall or cascade. This name was first introduced by Dr. Alberto W Mello in his work [...] "Reliability prediction for structures under cyclic loads and recurring inspections". Materials subject to cyclic loads, as shown in the graph on the right, may form and propagate cracks over time due to fatigue. Therefore, it is essential to determine a reliable inspection interval. There are numerous factors that must be considered to determine this inspection interval. The <b>Non-Destructive</b> <b>Inspection</b> (NDI) technique must have a high probability of detecting a crack in the material. If missed, a crack may lead the structure to a catastrophic failure before the next inspection. On the other hand, the inspection interval cannot be too frequent that the structure's maintenance is no longer profitable.|$|E
40|$|<b>Non-destructive</b> <b>inspections</b> are {{performed}} to give confidence on the non-existence of flaws exceeding a certain safe limit in the inspected structural component.

Inspection reliability models aim at accounting for these uncertainties. This paper presents the analysis of sizing uncertainty of flaws for the results of NESC III Round Robin Trials on defect-containing dissimilar metal welds. Model parameters are firstly estimated to characterize the sizing capabilities of various teams.

40|$|Aircraft, containers, {{and storage}} tanks contain plate-like {{structures}} that are safety critical. The structures often undergo <b>non-destructive</b> <b>inspections.</b> The inspection frequency {{tends to be}} over-conservatively high, {{and it may be}} possible to reduce the intervals between inspections to realize cost savings. This goal can possibly be realized by automated structural health monitoring (SHM) of structures using sparse active guided wave sensor arrays. Guided waves are sensitive to small defects and can propagate long distances across feature dense plates. Thus, a guided wave SHM system that enables reliable detection of critical defects or monitoring of their growth can potentially be used to reduce the frequency of inspections for real structures. Industrial guided wave SHM systems must be reliable throughout prolonged exposure to temperature, humidity, and loading changes encountered in operation. Research at Imperial College shows that temperature compensation and subtraction between monitored guided wave signals and baselines acquired from healthy plates enables detection of 1. 5...|$|R

To this end, the total mismatch angle, defined as the sum over the full stacking sequence of the mismatch angle at each interface, is used to categorize the potential for delamination. Impact tests have been conducted on specimens with various different stacking sequences, selected to have a variety of different total mismatch angles. Impact tests were conductedat increasing impact energies, to evaluate the effect of energy level on individual delamination size derived from <b>non-destructive</b> <b>inspections.</b> Results indicate that the morphology of individual delaminations depends solely on the fibre orientation of the bounding plies and is independent of overall stacking sequence of the laminate, ply-percentages, the through-the-thickness location of the delamination within the laminate and impact energy.
