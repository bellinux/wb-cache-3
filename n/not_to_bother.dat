5|$|In 1255 Saka, Permana Dikoesoemah is the King of Galuh, {{beloved by}} {{his people and}} his wife Naganingroem. The {{minister}} Aria Kebonan wants power for himself, and persuades the king to surrender the crown to him. Permana Dikoesoemah warns Aria Kebonan to respect him always and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> his wife. He then abdicates to meditate, ultimately ascending to a higher plane of existence. Aria Kebonan, meanwhile, magically gains the king's appearance, ensuring {{that the people of}} Galuh are unaware that they have a new king.|$|E
5|$|Coach Perkins met {{for several}} hours with Oklahoma linebacker Brian Bosworth, who entered a {{supplemental}} draft after being kicked off of the Oklahoma team. Perkins and Bosworth were impressed with each other, but the rights to select were awarded lottery-style, and the first selection went to the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks drafted Bosworth despite his having sent them a letter telling them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother.</b> He expressed a preference {{to play for the}} Buccaneers. When the Indianapolis Colts failed to sign linebacker Cornelius Bennett, the second player selected in the draft (directly after Testaverde), they attempted to trade him to Tampa Bay. Perkins had previously coached Bennett at Alabama, but the Colts, looking for extra draft picks to trade to the Los Angeles Rams to get running back Eric Dickerson, wanted two draft picks in return for Bennett. Perkins felt that this price was too steep. Perkins also attempted to persuade Bo Jackson, their first-overall pick from the 1986 NFL Draft who had refused to sign with the Buccaneers, to change his mind and join the team.|$|E
5|$|The {{briefing}} {{process was}} repeated {{with a second}} group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six {{were found to be}} over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six. Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory. Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: Velocity sold {{lighting}} kits and {{a designer}} coat stand, {{and managed to}} find more customers by asking for contacts from stores that they had sold to. Meanwhile, Invicta sold a fuel can with a flow control system, {{and a set of}} metallic shelves, yet despite Sir Alan's warning <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with major retailer chains, Syed spent most of the day doing so with a chain of petrol stations. While he secured the deal, the time spent and an unforeseen delay meant his sub-team was late back to the boardroom and fined 25% of their sales, losing the team the task.|$|E
25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same can be said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
500|$|Metallica's {{performance}} at the ceremony, held in February 1989 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, {{marked the first time}} a heavy metal group had performed during the Grammy Awards. Metallica was expected to win the award, and members of Jethro Tull were told by their record label Chrysalis Records <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> attending the ceremony because they [...] "weren't likely to win." [...] However, Jethro Tull won the award (recipients included members Ian Anderson, Martin Barre, and Dave Pegg), and when presenters Alice Cooper and Lita Ford announced the result, booing could be heard from the crowd. Anderson, who assumed that the band was being recognized for their twenty-year history, as opposed to a single album, later stated that he was [...] "lucky" [...] not to have attended the ceremony, as [...] "there's no way I could have accepted it under those circumstances." ...|$|E

5000|$|A case {{on which}} the Academy is silent is the {{tendency}} described in point b1.

Those Spaniards who would not just say le anyway for the reasons explained in the last paragraph are likely to use le in this case. Butt & Benjamin (1994) says that their Argentine informants made this distinction, whereas their loísta Colombian informants preferred molestarlo always.|$|R

500|$|Poe's {{funeral was}} a simple one, held at 4 p.m. on Monday, October 8, 1849. Few people {{attended}} the ceremony. Poe's uncle, Henry Herring, provided a simple mahogany coffin, and a cousin, Neilson Poe, supplied the hearse. Moran's wife made his shroud. The funeral was presided over by the Reverend W. T. D. Clemm, cousin of Poe's wife, Virginia. Also in attendance were Dr. Snodgrass, Baltimore lawyer and former University of Virginia classmate Zaccheus Collins Lee, Poe's first cousin Elizabeth Herring and her husband, and former schoolmaster Joseph Clarke. The entire ceremony lasted only three minutes in the cold, damp weather. Reverend Clemm decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with a sermon because the crowd was too small. Sexton George W. Spence wrote of the weather: [...] "It was a dark and gloomy day, not raining but just kind of raw and threatening." [...] Poe was buried in a cheap coffin that lacked handles, a nameplate, cloth lining, or a cushion for his head.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Chicago Tribune on the 1992 Consumer Electronics Show, Dennis Lynch saw the Super Scope and Menacer as a {{continuation}} of a Nintendo–Sega arms race and wrote that the peripheral's [...] "Uzi attachment" [...] was [...] "just what every kid needs". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Andy Pargh said the Menacer was [...] "definitely a winner" [...] {{in comparison to the}} Super Scope. Toronto Star William Burrill wrote that the [...] "Great Zapper War" [...] would be decided by the strength of the light guns' supporting games. Multiple reviewers ultimately recommended that players wait for more games to be released before purchasing the Menacer. William Burrill of the Toronto Star said <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> unless the player [...] "absolutely love target shooter games". Mean Machines called the Menacer [...] "an expensive novelty" [...] until it had more games. The Herald Sun wrote in August 1993 that the Menacer looked to be [...] "an expensive, limited-use fad".|$|E
500|$|The {{questions}} about the veracity of Chatwin's writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death. Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS-related illness, some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work. Nicholas Shakespeare said, [...] "His denial [...] bred a sense that if he lied about his life, he must have lied about his work. Some readers have taken this as a cue to pass judgement on his books – or else <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> with them." [...] In 2010 The Guardian's review of Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin opened with the question, [...] "Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days?" [...] However, Rory Stewart has stated, [...] "His personality, his learning, his myths, and even his prose are less hypnotizing [...] And yet he remains a great writer, of deep and enduring importance.” In 2008 The Times [...] named Chatwin #46 on their list of [...] "50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945".|$|E

2500|$|... "Aristocratic cool", {{known as}} sprezzatura, has existed in Europe for centuries, {{particularly}} when relating to frank amorality and love or illicit pleasures behind closed doors; Raphael's [...] "Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione" [...] and Leonardo da Vinci's [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] are classic examples of sprezzatura. The sprezzatura of the Mona Lisa {{is seen in}} both her smile and the positioning of her hands. Both the smile and hands are intended to convey her grandeur, self-confidence and societal position. Sprezzatura means, literally, disdain and detachment. It {{is the art of}} refraining from the appearance of trying to present oneself in a particular way. In reality, of course, tremendous exertion went into pretending <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> or care.|$|E

2500|$|William Miller's mother figured {{prominently}} in the film as well (often admonishing, [...] "Don't take drugs!"). The character was based on Crowe's own mother, who even {{showed up at the}} film sets {{to keep an eye on}} him while he worked. Though he asked her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> Frances McDormand, who played her character, the two ended up getting along well. Also in the film he showed his sister, portrayed by Zooey Deschanel, rebelling and leaving home, and in real life, his mother and sister Cindy did not talk for a decade and were still estranged to a degree when he finished the film. The family reconciled when the project was complete.|$|E
2500|$|Before Proposition 218 became law, {{in a legal}} {{challenge}} to an assessment the courts reviewed {{the actions of the}} local agency under a highly deferential standard. [...] Under this highly deferential standard, the courts presumed that an assessment was valid and the person challenging the assessment had to show that the record before the local agency clearly did not support the underlying determinations of benefit and proportionality. [...] The underlying legal basis for the historical deferential standard of review was that the establishment of an assessment district takes place {{as a result of a}} peculiarly legislative process. [...] As a result, the constitutional separation of powers doctrine demanded a more deferential standard of review by the courts. [...] Property owners rarely won assessment lawsuits on the merits prior to Proposition 218. [...] Because it was so difficult to win a {{legal challenge}}, lawyers were candidly urged <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bother</b> even trying to challenge an assessment in court.|$|E

[...] Further, she stopped him from kneeling and bowing to her, stating, [...] "When I see you kneeling, I feel the pain."
