30|$|A PMU is an {{electronic}} device that provides synchrophasors and frequency measurements for a three-phase AC voltage and/or current waveforms. Figure  2 shows a functional block diagram of PMU [10]. PMU uses state-of-the-art digital signal processors that can measure single phase and three phase AC waveforms of time synchronized electrical quantities i.e, voltages (V) and current (I). Inside a PMU, the V and I signals are {{passed through a}} front-end anti-aliasing filter to eliminate high-frequency interference signals and then digitized using an A/D converter. For digitization, a fixed sampling rate is used with a synchronized GPS clock. The digitized signals are then processed through complex multiplication with the <b>nominal</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>carrier</b> {{in order to get}} the real and imaginary components of the phasor. These components are then passed through a back-end performance class filter (P-class or M-class finite impulse response filter) which gives the required accuracy under dynamic conditions [10].|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> {{received}} {{can vary}} due to Doppler shift, the points where received PRN sequences begin may {{not differ from}} O by an exact integral number of milliseconds. Because of this, <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> tracking along with PRN code tracking are used to determine when the received satellite's PRN code begins. Unlike the earlier computation of offset in which trials of all 1,023 offsets could potentially be required, the tracking to maintain lock usually requires shifting of half a pulse width or less. To perform this tracking, the receiver observes two quantities, phase error and received frequency offset. The correlation of the received PRN code {{with respect to the}} receiver generated PRN code is computed to determine if the bits of the two signals are misaligned. Comparisons of the received PRN code with receiver generated PRN code shifted half a pulse width early and half a pulse width late are used to estimate adjustment required. The amount of adjustment required for maximum correlation is used in estimating phase error. Received frequency offset from the frequency generated by the receiver provides an estimate of phase rate error. The command for the frequency generator and any further PRN code shifting required are computed {{as a function of the}} phase error and the phase rate error in accordance with the control law used. The Doppler velocity is computed as a function of the frequency offset from the <b>carrier</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>frequency.</b> The Doppler velocity is the velocity component along the line of sight of the receiver relative to the satellite.|$|R
