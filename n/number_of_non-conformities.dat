40|$|The {{effects of}} {{parameter}} estimation are examined for the well-known c-chart for attributes data. The exact run length distribution is obtained for Phase II applications, when the true average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-conformities,</b> c, is unknown, by conditioning on the observed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-conformities</b> {{in a set}} of reference data (from Phase I). Expressions for various chart performance characteristics, such as the average run length (ARL), the standard deviation of the run length (SDRL) and the median run length (MDRL) are also obtained. Examples show that the actual performance of the chart, both in terms of the false alarm rate (FAR) and the in-control ARL, can be substantially different from what might be expected when c is known, in that an exceedingly large number of false alarms are observed, unless the number of inspection units (the size of the reference dataset) used to estimate c is very large, much larger than is commonly used or recommended in practice. In addition, the actual FAR and the in-control ARL values can be very different from the nominally expected values such as 0. 0027 (or ARL 0 = 370), particularly when c is small, even with large amounts of reference data.

A total of 31 active certificates from five countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Romania, Slovenia and the United Kingdom) were analysed, including all active certificates (as of 1 st of June 2014) from three countries along with a sample of 13 FSC certificates issued in the UK and one certificate covering 95 % of the certified forest area in Slovenia. 253 non-conformities in relation to FSC standard requirements were identified as formulated by the audit teams and the most frequently identified non-conformities in the certification process were those related to Principle 6 - Environmental impact (34 %), Principle 4 - Community relations and workerâ€™s rights (17 %) and Principle 8 - Monitoring and Assessment (13 %). A slight positive correlation was noticed between the FSC certified area and the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-conformities,</b> with a closer link in the case of Principle 9 - Maintenance of high conservation value forests, and Principle 4.

The aims of this study were the analysis of hygiene and safety processes regarding the preparation of meals in school canteens, as well as the development of a HACCP plan for use in these canteens. To help this analysis, a Checklist of 131 points was drawn up, grouped in 13 areas, from the reception of raw materials to distribution. It was applied in three different canteens with specific conditions. The development of the HACCP plan was made from scratch, considering the prerequisites for implementing the principles of the system, hazard analysis, the determination of measures and critical control points, and limits. The results obtained in the Checklist showed a compliance rate of 48. 64 to 68. 83 % with a greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-conformities</b> related to facilities, cleanliness, hygiene, and cooking. It was concluded that in order to better guarantee the safety of cooked meals, it would be necessary to correct some non-conformities.

40|$|Process {{capability}} indices (PCIs), Cp, Ca, Cpk, Cpm, and Cpmk {{have been}} developed in certain manufacturing industry as capability measures based on various criteria, including process consistency, process departure from a target, process yield, and process loss. It is noted in certain recent quality assurance and capability analysis works that the three indices, Cpk, Cpm, and Cpmk provide the same lower bounds on the process yield. In this paper, we investigate {{the behavior of the}} actual process yield, in terms of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-conformities</b> (in ppm), for processes with fixed index values of Cpk=Cpm=Cpmk, possessing different degrees of process centering. We also extend Johnson's [1992. The relationship of Cpm to squared error loss. Journal of Quality Technology 24, 211 - 215] result formulating the relationship between the expected relative squared loss and PCIs. Also a comparison analysis among PCIs is carried out based on various criteria. The result illustrates some advantages of using the index Cpmk over the indices Cpk and Cpm in measuring process capability (yield and loss), since Cpmk always provides a better protection for the customers. Additionally, several extensions and applications to real world problem are also discussed. The paper contains some material presented in the Kotz and Johnson [2002.

40|$|Environmental {{management}} {{has been discussed}} by researchers and practitioners along recent years. Relations between quality and environmental issues have been treated, since quality problems interfere on environmental impacts. In dairy system, {{according to a report}} on dairy cleaner production by FIESP (2008), processors are concerned especially with rational use of water, energy saving techniques and equipment, use of less toxic raw materials, recycling, water and effluent treatment. Some studies have highlighted the importance of agriculture (milk producers) when it comes to environmental problems along the chain, giving less relevance to dairy processing, packaging, consume phase and waste management. Thus, milk reception control in dairy companies is an important stage for environmental management. Considering the importance of coordination among agents, the aim of this paper was to analyze processor conduct concerning raw material non-conformity, linking quality and environmental issues. This qualitative research was accomplished through a study in a dairy plant in Paraná, which processes 200, 000 liters of milk per day and sells products nationally. The company works with 1, 500 milk suppliers on average. Legal requirements are followed along the process, and ISO 1400 implementation in the company is in progress. According to interviews with quality supervisor and industrial manager, {{one of the most important}} critical point is milk reception, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-conformities</b> are controlled. The presence of antibiotics is the most relevant of them, since it results in material rejection. Other problems, such as acidity and cryoscopy, are less critical, since it is possible to direct input to co-products. Interviewees informed that a low amount of milk is contaminated with antibiotics (about 1 % of total input). Concerning antibiotic contamination, intensive training and constant visits have been developed with producers, especially to inform them about the risks of antibiotics and to help them solving those problems. Such quality non-conformity carries to an environmental problem, being the processor legally responsible for adequate destination of contaminated milk. In this case, we observed a coordination failure that could bring environmental impacts: contaminated milk is dyed to avoid the use in other plants, and it is delivered back to producer, who do not receive for that product. The company’s reverse logistics for those cases ends up there, and rural producer is in charge of adequate destination. So, processor does not have complete control on material disposal, opening space to environmental problems. Although little percentage of milks is rejected due to antibiotics, it represents about 60. 000 liters monthly, which is not insignificant. We conclude that, despite company’s policy directed to a proactive position through training course and visits, lack of coordination related to reverse logistics, being mainly treated as a quality problem, can cause serious environmental issues in that system. </p...|$|E

The objective of this research was to assess the activities developed in a laboratory for research and analysis of food, about the accordance of item 4, which is established requirements of Direction, and the item 5, technical requirements of ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005, to guide correction of non conformities and internal organization. Initially there was a check list for verification of compliance for the activities developed in the laboratory. When the non-conformities were found, the staff was trained and was applied the 5 S System. In applying the first check list in accordance with the item 4, the laboratory was classified in Group 3 of the Standard, with 57. 14 % <b>of</b> <b>non-conformities,</b> after training and implementation of corrective measures.
