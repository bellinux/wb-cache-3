McNabb was the first Labour MLA elected in Alberta (he was defeated in his 1909 re-election bid).|$|E
5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were <b>never</b> <b>easy</b> for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E

25|$|Domestic servants, {{two-thirds of}} whom were women, made up about fifteen to {{twenty percent of the}} {{population}} of the capital. Before the Revolution they had worked largely for the nobility, whose families sometimes had as many as thirty servants. During the Empire they were employed more commonly by the new nobility, the newly wealthy and middle class. Upper-middle-class families often had three servants; families of artisans and shopkeepers usually had one. Living conditions of servants depended largely upon the personality of the master, but were <b>never</b> <b>easy.</b> Napoleon abolished the death penalty which previously could be given to a servant who stole from his master, but any servant who was even suspected of stealing would never be able to get another job. Any servant who became pregnant, married or not, could be dismissed immediately.|$|E

Ono also issued a statement, emphasizing the position she held in common: [...] "Being a single parent of a strong and intelligent boy is <b>never</b> <b>easy.</b> Cynthia and I understood each other in that way, wishing well for our sons and their future."

2500|$|In 2008, George Schaller {{launched}} a campaign to protect the Marco Polo sheep. After the Khunjerab National Park was established by Pakistan in 1975; and the Taxkorgan Nature Reserve similarly settled in China in 1984, Schaller noted that the parks were insufficient to protect the sheep, due to their seasonal migrations. Schaller, among others, then proposed an international reserve in 1987 to combat the problem, but the effort was stalled due to political difficulties. [...] "It's <b>never</b> <b>easy</b> to get the governments of four countries to agree on anything," [...] Schaller has said of his efforts. His mission was to found a park straddling the borders of China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan in which the sheep would be protected. Schaller called the proposed reserve the [...] "Pamir International Peace Park." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{interpreter}} of the Lewis and Clark Expedition mistakenly identified this people as the Nez Perce {{when the team}} encountered the tribe in 1805. [...] Writing in 1889, anthropologist Alice Fletcher, who the U.S. government had sent to Idaho to allot the Nez Perce Reservation, explained the mistaken naming. [...] She wrote, [...] "It is <b>never</b> <b>easy</b> to come at {{the name of an}} Indian or even of an Indian tribe. A tribe has always at least two names; one they call themselves by and one by which they are known to other tribes. All the tribes living west of the Rocky Mountains were called [...] "Chupnit-pa-lu," [...] which means people of the pierced noses; it also means emerging from the bushes or forest; the people from the woods. [...] The tribes on the Columbia river used to pierce the nose and wear in it some ornament as you have seen some old fashioned white ladies wear in their ears. Lewis and Clark had with them an interpreter whose wife was a Shoshone or Snake woman and so it came about that when it was asked [...] "What Indians are these?" [...] the answer was [...] "They are 'Chupnit-pa-lu'" [...] and it was written down in the journal; spelled rather queerly, for white people's ears do not always catch Indian tones and of course the Indians could not spell any word." ...|$|E

2500|$|While its {{performance}} and design were exceptional and appreciated, it was <b>never</b> <b>easy</b> to fly. This {{was caused by}} the 60° leading edge sweepback of its wing and was inherent in these types of delta wing platforms. It required a much higher angle of attack than a conventional aircraft, up to 9.4° at Mach 0.5 at low altitudes. If the angle of attack was too high, in excess of 17°, the bomber could pitch up and enter a spin. Several factors could prevent a successful recovery: if the pilot applied elevon, if the center of gravity was not correctly positioned, or if the spin occurred below , recovery might not be possible. The B-58 also had stall characteristics that were not conventional. If the nose was elevated, the bomber maintained forward motion without pitching down. Unless large amounts of power were applied, the descent rate increased rapidly. Another problem pilots faced was called [...] "fuel stacking" [...] and took place when the B-58 accelerated or decelerated. It was due to fuel moving in the tanks and causing sudden changes in the center of gravity. This could cause the aircraft to pitch or bank and subsequently lose control. The B-58 was very difficult to safely recover from the loss of an engine at supersonic cruise due to differential thrust.|$|E
2500|$|In this battle, the {{two factors}} {{combined}} {{to give a}} glimpse of what would end the Plains Indians way of life since horses had made them true nomads. [...] Although the “Comanche” had always been a nomadic people, it was the horse that transformed them into a true nomad culture, and a very warlike one. [...] In the Journal of American History Pekka Hämäläinen [...] estimates, as do most military historians and cultural anthropologists, that it was around 1700 that the Comanche got access to a sufficient number of Spanish horses {{that they were able to}} make the leap from dog and human assisted nomadic hunter-gatherer to a true nomad culture. [...] The effects of this transformation were radical. [...] Because they were the first Plains tribe to fully incorporate the horse into their way of life, and into their way of making war, they were far and away the best at it [...] [...] Though it was rare, the only successes the Spanish ever had in battle with the Comanche were on occasions that they were able to take them by surprise. [...] However, since the Comanche became classic horse nomads, this was <b>never</b> <b>easy</b> to do. [...] It was only when the Rangers had adopted classic Comanche tactics of cold camps, forced marches, and use of scouts were they able to alter the dynamic of nomad cavalry attacking fixed settlements. [...] At Little Robe Creek, they in large part succeeded in surprising the Comanche.|$|E
2500|$|Apart from Cowdrey, who having {{opened the}} England innings was ninth out, {{none of the}} England batsmen made more than 30 in the first innings. During his Test career, Hall never {{improved}} on his figures in this innings. By {{the end of the}} second day West Indies had reached 81/2 in their reply. Next day, they lost only McMorris, retired hurt, as they closed at 291/2, already with a first innings lead. Sobers was on 142 and Nurse, in his first Test, on 46. However Sobers' early dismissal next morning triggered a collapse, and although McMorris was fit to resume his innings the West Indies led by only 76. McMorris made 73 and Nurse 70. Cowdrey and Pullar more than wiped off the deficit, taking their first wicket stand to 177 before both were out at that score, Cowdrey narrowly missing his second century of the match. The innings then fell away, and with one day to go England, at 280/9, led by only 204. However next morning Allen and Statham held out for 45 minutes, adding 25 runs, and West Indies needed 230 in 245 minutes if they were to win. Hunte began in attacking fashion, scoring 40 out of 48 in an hour before he was the second man out. Wisden felt the turning-point came when Sobers was run out when looking dangerous, to make the score 86/3. West Indies continued to chase the target, but scoring was <b>never</b> <b>easy.</b> At tea 115 were still needed in 90 minutes. When Kanhai was out at 152/6 West Indies gave up the chase and England tried to get the four remaining wickets in the forty-five minutes that were left. May refused to allow Kanhai a runner near the end, when he had developed cramp. In fact Kanhai was entitled to a runner under the laws. May apologised to Kanhai and Alexander after the match for his mistake. The umpires and Alexander himself had also been unsure about the position.|$|E
