40|$|While costing {{methods have}} {{developed}} over time, {{they are often}} static in nature and ill-suited to the dynamic nature of <b>production</b> lines. Static <b>costing</b> systems are often developed for long-term analysis. Due to this, they lack the ability to aid short-term decision-making. In addition, the use of averaged data prohibits a static costing system from accurately tracing the cost effects of changing system behavior like random downtime events. A dynamic costing system, however, can capture the cost effects of changing system behavior {{in a manner that}} can aid short-term operational management. The proposed methodology is a dynamic activity-based costing method that relies on real-time production line data to track costs, specifically the added costs of unused capacity and downtime events. The methodology aims to trace these costs to responsible cost centers on the production line to give a better representation of the total <b>cost</b> of <b>production,</b> specifically in regards to <b>normal</b> <b>production</b> <b>costs,</b> added downtime costs, and added costs from unused capacity. In addition to monetary costs, the methodology provides a framework for tracking environmental costs, such as energy use, in order to aid plant managers with determining the environmental impact of their operations. The methodology addresses a gap between activity-based costing and downtime costing by combining the two under a single methodology. It traces both monetary and environmental costs to cost centers on the manufacturing line to aid continuous improvement efforts and the allocation of resources. By using real-time data, the methodology alerts management to changing system performance in a shorter time frame than static costing systems. The methodology will be shown in a case study of an automotive assembly plant. The case study will model the resource use of an automotive paint shop and trace this resource use to line segments in order to highlight areas of possible improvement. M. S...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhile most {{works on}} CCS in {{connection}} with CO 2 EOR credit all {{the benefit of the}} additional oil production to the CCS entity, this work investigate the impact of alternative EOR methods on the valuation on CO 2 EOR storage. Based on a generic model suitable for CO 2 EOR in Norwegian oil fields, EOR production with CO 2 injection is compared to the EOR production with chemical EOR for different scenarios. The comparison shows that depending on the scenario combination considered the added value of using the CO 2 EOR method instead of the chemical EOR method varies from - 4 to 33 €/bblproduced equivalent to - 4 to 56 €/tCO 2,avoided. In most of the cases considered, the CO 2 EOR method would therefore be preferred with however more or less value creation depending on the case. The evaluation shows that for an oil price minus the <b>normal</b> <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> equal to 50 €/bbl, the oil value which shall be considered for CO 2 EOR application varies between 8 and 41 €/bbl, which can therefore be significantly lower than the 50 €/bbl which shall be considered if chemical EOR is not an alternative. The value one {{would be willing to pay}} to have CO 2 delivered at a field varies between - 4 and 56 €/tCO 2 depending on the scenario combinations considered and can therefore also be significantly lower than in cases in which chemical EOR is not an alternative. For example, in the medium CO 2 EOR scenario, the CO 2 value is between 27 and 60 % lower if chemical EOR is considered as an alternative option for EOR. As a consequence, a CCS chain including CO 2 EOR would overestimate its benefits if it does not considered chemical EOR as an alternative to CO 2 EOR for Oil & Gas companies. Finally, the sensitivity analyses identify the factors having the largest influence on the value one would be willing to pay to have CO 2 delivered at its field...|$|R

Nevertheless stopping, and more specifically, restarting <b>production</b> involves <b>costs</b> associated with refurbishing the smelters units thermal revetment that may hamper the value of such stoppage options. This paper values such options through Monte Carlo simulation, modeling the prices of aluminum as a geometric mean reversion, and the price of electricity as a mean reversion with positive jumps. It also incorporates the asymmetrical costs of stopping and restarting production an...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Agricultural Economics Research Institute has {{calculated}} the <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> {{of the major}} agricultural products since the 1970 s. The calculations are {{used to examine the}} development of <b>production</b> <b>costs,</b> and they are based on the farm models. These farm models are constructed partly on the basis of information compiled from bookeeping farms and on the basis of various standards and recommendations. The models describe a situation where a farm has specialised in a production of one product. The farm models represent the conditions in Southern Finland and a level of agriculture more efficient than average. Therefore, the <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> calculated {{on the basis of these}} models do not descride the average <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> of farm products in Finland. The production methods and yields of the farm models have now been revised to correspond to the current situations. The calculations consist of the production of milk, beef, pork, piglets, eggs, bread grain, feed grain, oil plants and sugar beets. The calculations are made for each product produced on farms of different sizes and so they show the effect of the farm size on the <b>production</b> <b>costs.</b> The total number of models presented in this report is 50. The cost structures of the models are based on the <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> determined at the price and cost level of the year 1996. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> of agricultural products according to farm models The <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> of agricultural products according to farm model...|$|R
40|$|Profitability {{depends on}} <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> {{as much as}} it depends on sales revenue. Information on <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> is {{therefore}} critical in the analysis of competitive commercial enterprises in all industry sectors. The dynamics of any industry sector, under either market or policy changes, depend on the relative <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> of its individual enterprises. Empirical data on <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> are sparse, however, because of commercial sensitivity. Stock exchanges show share prices, and annual financial reports show aggregate income and outgoings, but unit <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> are treated as confidential. Here, therefore, I argue for greater effort in empirical studies on <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> in tourism, to complement the existing body of theoretical research. In particular, I suggest that empirical information on <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> is prerequisite to analyze the value contributed by agents and intermediaries in tourism distribution systems. As an initial case study, I present data from six similar small-group international package tours in the nature and adventure subsector. In tourism, the most typical product design is a package that assembles a complex set of goods and services by purchasing and linking localized or specialized transport, accommodation, and activity subproducts. Theoretical aspects of the assembly, marketing, costs, pricing, and operation of package tours have been studied extensively (Assaf, Barros...|$|R
40|$|Despite recent progress, the <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> for {{renewable}} electricity remain above those for conventional power. Expectations of continuous reductions in <b>production</b> <b>costs,</b> typically underpin governments' policies for financial support. They often {{draw on the}} technology-focused versions of the Experience Curve model. This paper discusses how national-contextual factors also have a strong influence on <b>production</b> <b>costs,</b> such as geographic, infrastructural, institutional, and resource factors. As technologies mature, and as they reach significant levels of diffusion nationally, sustained increases in <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> might be recorded, due to these nationally contextual factors, poorly accounted for in policy-making decisions for price support. The paper suggests an analytical framework for a more comprehensive understanding of <b>production</b> <b>costs.</b> Based on this, it recommends that the evolution of specific cost levels and factors be monitored to locate 'sources of changes'. The paper also suggests policy instruments that governments may use to facilitate cost decreases, whenever possible. The application of the framework is illustrated for the diffusion of wind power in Spain {{during the past three}} decades. Renewable electricity <b>Production</b> <b>costs</b> Policy-making...|$|R

It then discusses the nature and use of artificial neural networks as nonparametric estimates of <b>production</b> <b>costs.</b> In both parts of the article, an empirical study is conducted with the use of adequate statistical methods and artificial neurons. This study presents proce- dures for construction of models of parametric and nonparametric estimation of <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> and discusses their advantages and disadvantages.
