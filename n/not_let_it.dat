25|$|Greg Madden {{is found}} dead weeks later. In {{the months that}} follow, Zach and Kendall enjoy their time with the newborn child. Problems arise here and there, but none {{like that of the}} Satin Slayer, a serial killer murdering the women of Fusion, a {{cosmetics}} company run by Kendall and her friends who helped to define it. The Satin Slayer takes Kendall hostage, and when it is revealed that the Satin Slayer is actually Zach's estranged father, Alexander Cambias, Sr., thought to be dead, but obviously still very much alive and that all he wanted is for Zach to have followed in his footsteps, Zach does everything in his power to save Kendall, as it all culminates on a balcony outside of a hotel room. Zach's father sets a contraption around Kendall's neck, which will kill her if its detonator goes off. Zach and Alexander struggle as Zach gets a hold of the detonator and will <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> go, even as he is shot in the arm by Alexander. Zach is able to sneak a spare knife from the sheath at his ankle and throw it hard enough at Alexander so that Alexander drops his gun. Zach rescues Kendall. He is determined to kill his father, but help soon arrives, and Alexander is sent to jail.|$|E

500|$|Ruth {{continued}} with her studies at Harper Adams {{and she and}} David eventually established [...] "a good working relationship".

The couple's second child, Joshua, was born in 1997. Ruth and David later purchased some Hereford cattle and began to establish themselves as suppliers of traditional beef. Toye and Flynn observed that Ruth and David's marriage had to be strong when the Archer siblings began arguing over who would inherit Brookfield Farm. Ruth told David that [...] "time was too precious to spend in argument" [...] and suggested they moved away. However, David's father, Phil, decided that the farm should go to the couple.|$|E

When Laszlo asked whether Bell knew when she made Frozen {{that it would take}} over kids' lives, she replied: [...] "I did not know that people would <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> go. No pun intended." [...] In a December 2014 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lee acknowledged that she had transitioned from thanking people when they expressed their appreciation for Frozen to having to apologize when they said [...] "we're still listening to those songs" [...] (with their children). Lee also said that she used the film and its strong female characters to inspire her own daughter, who had experienced bullying at school, and admitted that she herself as a child was bullied as well; thus, they had managed to be true to themselves like Anna and Elsa.|$|E

2500|$|Modrić {{became a}} refugee {{and lived with}} his family in the Hotel Kolovare for seven years, later moved to the Hotel Iž, in Zadar.

He has said he was mostly unaware of the war because he befriended many other children and their parents did <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> affect their childhoods. In these difficult circumstances, Modrić began playing football, mostly at the hotel parking lot. In 1992, he simultaneously entered the primary school and a sporting academy, the latter paid for with the little money the family had, sometimes helped by Modrić's uncle. Supported by his family, he participated in representative camps and trained in NK Zadar. He was under tutelage of coach Domagoj Bašić {{and the head of the}} youth academy Tomislav Bašić. Tomislav, considered by Modrić as his [...] "sporting father", said Modrić's father made him wooden shin guards because they had little money, Modrić, however, denied those claims.
