40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{publications}} and publishing practices of Alexander Dalrymple (1737 - 1808). Dalrymple was cumulatively a private publisher of nautical charts and plans (from 1767), the "examiner of ships' journals" and chart publisher for the East India Company (from 1779), and Hydrographer to the Admiralty (from 1795). The core of the study is a catalogue of the known publications of Alexander Dalrymple, defining and establishing his oeuvre. The catalogue is in two parts, Catalogue A for the letterpress publications, numbering 257, and Catalogue B for the engraved charts, plans of ports, views of land, and other Illustrations, numbering 1116. The entries in each part of the catalogue are arranged chronologically by date of publication, with full bibliographical and technical descriptions, and notes of attribution, dating and inter-relationships. The introduction gives a short account of Dalrymple's life, focussing on his publishing activity, and introducing his geographical and political pamphlet publishing. Four phases of activity in his <b>nautical</b> <b>publication</b> are identified: the decision to publish charts and memoirs from his own voyages in the Eastern Archipelago (1769 - 1772); the private publication of charts and plans with grants or subscriptions from the East India Company (1772 - 1779); the annual series of charts, plans, views and memoirs issued from 1779 onwards for the East India Company; and the organisation and output of the Admiralty Hydrographic Office which he ran in parallel with his East India Company work after 1795. This is supplemented by a discussion of the continuing use made of Dalrymple's charts after his death in 1808. An investigation of Dalrymple's engraving and publishing practices follows, with a brief survey of his technical leaflets and manuals on nautical surveying and chronometer use, and an account of Oriental Repertory, his chief non-nautical publication. The study emphasises the close personal control Dalrymple exercised over his publications, and the consequent problems in the Admiralty and East India Company in developing arrangements to continue publishing charts after his death...|$|E

40|$|In the 1830 s, {{there was}} {{increasing}} public alarm about {{the numbers of}} vessels and lives lost at sea. On’ a national level, a Select Committee {{was set up in}} 1836 to investigate the problem and in its report it made a number of suggestions which, it hoped, would bring about an improvement in the conduct of British merchant vessels. one of these recommendations was the establishment of a system of examinations, which would have resulted in only those who held a certificate of either competency or service being allowed to officer a vessel. Moves to introduce legislation setting up such a system failed due to the lobbying of shipowners and fears that it was wrong for Parliament to meddle in private commerce. It was then left to local initiative to establish examinations and in the north east ports on the rivers Tyne, Blyth and Wear, Sunderland and South Shields seem to have taken the first steps in starting a series of examinations. The systems were ". operated by the local marine insurance associations and they were the predecessors of the national voluntary system established in 1845. However, as so few men came forward to be examined it was decided that if the system was to have any beneficial effect, {{it would have to be}} made compulsory, which came about in 1851. The aim of this research is to investigate what facilities were available for mercantile mariners to gain the knowledge necessary to pass the voluntary examinations and later the compulsory examinations. Ihe hypotheses to be examined were as follows: the idea that the proprietary schools were run by retired or invalid seamen; that these were replaced by institutionalised schools organised by bodies, such as Trinity House, Newcastle; and whether a new sort of school appeared when examinations for marine engineers were introduced in 1862. An attempt has been made additionally to consider how boys intending to go to sea were educated. Particular attention is paid to the education provided on board training vessels, such as the Tyneside Industrial Training Ship’ Wellesley', and in shore schools, such as those provided by Trinity House, Newcastle, Sunderland Board of Trade Navigation School, Sunderland Orphan Asylum and the South Shields Marine School. To make the research more significant, an attempt has been made to compare local findings with data from other ports, such as Hull and Leith. These places were chosen because they were east coast ports and involved in trades similar to those undertaken by vessels sailing from the north east ports. They were also selected because they had institutionalised schools as well as proprietary schools available to educate mercantile mariners. The data for this study was unusually scattered among a wide range of sources. Information about the proprietary schools has been gathered from a number of sources including local trade directories, <b>nautical</b> <b>publications,</b> newspapers and census returns for 1841 - 1881. Knowledge about many of the institutionalised schools was more accessible, and a great deal of information about the Sunderland Board of Trade Navigation. Schools and Trinity House School, Newcastle, was contained in the Science and Art Departments Reports. Details of the South Shields Marine School are contained in the School’s admission registers, the Governors' Journals and books of press cuttings. The annual report of the Governors of the ‘Wellesley’ Industrial Training Ship and other materials are available for consultation at the school and a number of Home Office files in the Public Record Office also contain information about the vessel. The research is significant because it is one of few attempts to assess this aspect of Victorian education. There have been a few attempts to narrate the history of the local institutionalised schools, but this is one of the first projects to make a detailed study of proprietary nautical and marine engineering academies. This is essentially a local case study and a great deal more work needs to be done nationally, but such investigations will be very time consuming. Finally, the work is significant because it is an attempt to evaluate the system of examinations as a means of ensuring greater safety at sea...|$|R
