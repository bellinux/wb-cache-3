50|$|Six {{years later}} (2006-03-24 23:00 UTC), {{part of this}} split was reverted {{in order to make}} room for {{cellular}} networks. The 04 <b>numbering</b> <b>area</b> was merged into 02 and 05 was merged into 03, which caused 02 to cover the South while 03 covered the North. This could be done easily because there were no conflicts.|$|E
50|$|Telephone {{numbers in}} Singapore, {{also known as}} the National Numbering Plan, are {{regulated}} by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). Due to the small geographical size of Singapore, there are no area or trunk codes, with the Public Switched Telephone Network, Radio Network and IP Telephony all belonging to one <b>numbering</b> <b>area,</b> and thus comes in the same 8-digit numbering format. Numbers are categorised based on the first digit, thus providing ten possible categories, of which six are currently in use and the remaining four reserved for future usage.|$|E

50|$|On 30 December 1989, area codes were abolished. Area {{codes for}} six-digit numbers {{became part of}} subscriber's <b>numbers.</b> <b>Area</b> codes for seven-digit numbers were simply removed. Some six-digit numbers had the first digit changed to two digits to make a seven-digit number.|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} many {{regional}} routes, reaching smaller {{towns and cities}} within ten designated regions. Each region is divided into a maximum of nine <b>areas.</b> Regional route <b>numbers</b> comprise the <b>area</b> <b>number</b> 1 to 9 followed by another digit. (An exception is in the Scottish Borders council area, where regional routes are numbered 1 to 9.) This means that across the UK there could be 10 regional route 12s, for instance, {{as well as the}} national route 12. To reduce confusion, identically <b>numbered</b> <b>areas</b> in adjacent regions do not abut, and routes with the same number are widely separated.|$|R
40|$|The {{roles of}} {{mitochondria}} in various physiological functions of vascular endothelial cells {{have been investigated}} extensively. Morphological studies in relation to physiological functions have been performed. However, {{there have been few}} reports of morphological investigations related to stem cell differentiation. This was the first morphological study of mitochondria in relation to endothelial differentiation and focused on quantitative analysis of changes in mitochondrial morphology, <b>number,</b> <b>area,</b> and length during differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into endothelial-like cells. To induce differentiation, we engaged vascular endothelial growth factors and flow-induced shear stress. Cells were classified according to the expression of von Willebrand factor as hMSCs, differentiating cells, and almost fully differentiated cells. Based on imaging analysis, we investigated changes in mitochondrial <b>number,</b> <b>area,</b> and length. In addition, mitochondrial networks were quantified on a single-mitochondrion basis by introducing a branch form factor. The data indicated that the mitochondrial <b>number,</b> <b>area</b> per cell, and length were decreased with differentiation. The mitochondrial morphology became simpler with progression of differentiation. These findings could be explained in view of energy level during differentiation; a higher level of energy is needed during differentiation, with larger numbers of mitochondria with branches. Application of this method to differentiation into other lineages will explain the energy levels required to control stem cell differentiation...|$|R

A consequence of this is that the average number of neurons per area also scales approximately as the square root of the total <b>number</b> of <b>areas.</b> Concerning area-area connectivity, we fi nd evidence that the total number of area-area connections scales as the square of the <b>number</b> of <b>areas.</b> These scaling results help constrain theories about the principles underlying neocortical organization...|$|R
