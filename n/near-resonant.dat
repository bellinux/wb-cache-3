50|$|A Zeeman slower {{consists}} of a cylinder, through which the beam travels, a pump laser that is shone on the beam in the direction opposite to the beam's motion, and a magnetic field (commonly produced by a solenoid-like coil) that points along the symmetry axis of the cylinder and varies spatially along the axis of the cylinder. The pump laser, which is required to be <b>near-resonant</b> to an atomic or molecular transition, Doppler slows a certain velocity class within the velocity distribution of the beam. The spatially varying Zeeman shift of the resonant frequency enables lower and lower velocity classes to be resonant with the laser, as the atomic or molecular beam propagates along the slower, hence slowing the beam.|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear {{interactions}} of gravity waves are studied with a two-dimensional, fully nonlinear model. The energy exchanges among resonant and <b>near-resonant</b> triads are examined {{in order to}} understand the spectral energy transfer through interactions. The results show that in both resonant and <b>near-resonant</b> interactions, the energy exchange between two high frequency waves is strong, but the energy transfer from large to small vertical scale waves is rather weak. This suggests that the energy cascade toward large vertical wavenumbers through nonlinear interaction is inefficient, which is different from the rapid turbulence cascade. Because of considerable energy exchange, nonlinear interactions can effectively spread high frequency spectrum, and play a significant role in limiting wave amplitude growth and transferring energy into higher altitudes. In resonant interaction, the interacting waves obey the resonant matching conditions, and resonant excitation is reversible, while <b>near-resonant</b> excitation is not so. Although <b>near-resonant</b> interaction shows the complexity of match relation, numerical experiments show an interesting result that when sum and difference <b>near-resonant</b> interactions occur between high and low frequency waves, the wave vectors tend to approximately match in horizontal direction, and the frequency of the excited waves is also close to the matching value...|$|E

Resonant and <b>near-resonant</b> responses are distinguished. The unforced BZ reaction shows both spatially-uniform oscillations and rotating spiral waves, while the forced system shows patterns such as standing-wave labyrinths and rotating spiral waves. The patterns depend on the amplitude and frequency of the perturbation, and also on whether the system responds to the forcing near the uniform oscillation frequency or the spiral wave frequency.

In Chap. 21, where we analyzed warm plasmas, we derived the dispersion relation for electrostatic waves in an unmagnetised plasma, we showed how Landau damping can damp the waves when the phase space density of the resonant particles diminishes with increasing speed, and we showed that in the opposite case of an increasing phase space density the waves can grow {{at the expense of}} the energies of <b>near-resonant</b> particles (provided the Penrose criterion is satisfied).

40|$|Planetary systems {{discovered}} by the Kepler space telescope exhibit an intriguing feature. While the period ratios of adjacent low-mass planets appear largely random, {{there is a significant}} excess of pairs that lie just wide of resonances and a deficit on the near side. We demonstrate that this feature naturally arises when two <b>near-resonant</b> planets interact in the presence of weak dissipation that damps eccentricities. The two planets repel each other as orbital energy is lost to heat. This moves <b>near-resonant</b> pairs just beyond resonance, by a distance that reflects the integrated dissipation they experienced over their lifetimes. We find that the observed distances may be explained by tides if tidal dissipation is unexpectedly efficient (tidal quality factor ~ 10).

Includes bibliographical references (p. 23 - 24). The set of master rate equations for the vibrational relaxation of mixtures of anharmonic diatomic gases in supersonic nozzle expansions is integrated numerically. Large deviations from a Boltzmann distribution of vibrational state population are predicted, particularly when vibrational energy is exchanged between two <b>near-resonant</b> diatomic species. Radiative gain coefficients for nonequilibrium vibration-rotation transitions are also computed and positive gains, sufficient to support laser oscillations, are predicted for CO-N 2 and CO-N,-Ar admixtures.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of <b>near-resonant</b> Raman scattering measurements on GaAs/AlAs superlattices at room temperature. A strong enhancement of GaAs LO phonon-even modes resulted owing to a dipole-allowed Frohlich interaction in superlattices. Similar to the previous results, the LO phonon-even modes in a polarized configuration are observed. In contrast to previous work, however, what we observed in depolarized configurations is the LO phonon-odd modes instead of even modes. It is confirmed that the selection rules for <b>near-resonant</b> Raman scattering from LO phonons in this kind of superlattices are the same as those for off-resonant scattering. From the second-order Raman scattering, it is confirmed that polarized second-order Raman scattering spectra consist of overtones and combinations of two even modes, and depolarized second-order Raman scattering spectra consist of combinations of an even mode and an odd mode. Our experimental results coincide with the predictions using the recently developed Huang-Zhu model. A brief discussion on interface modes and their combination with confined modes is also presented...|$|E
40|$|The light {{curves of}} many Blazhko stars exhibit {{intervals}} in which successive pulsation maxima alternate between two levels {{in a way}} that is characteristic of period-doubling. In addition, hydrocode models of these stars have clearly demonstrated period-doubling bifurcations. As a result, it is now generally accepted that these stars do indeed exhibit period-doubling. Here we present strong evidence that this assumption is incorrect. The alternating maxima likely result from the presence of one or more <b>near-resonant</b> modes which appear in the stellar spectra and are slightly but significantly offset from 3 / 2 times the fundamental frequency. We show that a previously proposed explanation for the presence of these peaks is inadequate. The phase-slip of the dominant <b>near-resonant</b> peak in RR Lyr is shown to be fully correlated with the parity of the observed alternations, providing further strong evidence that the process is nonresonant and cannot be characterized as period-doubling. The dominant <b>near-resonant</b> peak in V 808 Cyg has side-peaks spaced at twice the Blazhko frequency. This apparent modulation indicates that the peak corresponds to a vibrational mode and also adds strong support to the beating-modes model of the Blazhko effect which can account for the doubled frequency. The modulation also demonstrates the "environment" altering effect of large amplitude modes which is shown to be consistent with the amplitude equation formalism. Comment: This version strengthens the argument connecting the observed double Blazhko modulation in V 808 Cyg to the beating-modes model and also considers a variety of concerns about the proposed alternate explanation for the apparent period-doubling in Blazhko star...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of our latest {{experiments}} on atomic coherences in cold atoms. Interaction of atoms with a <b>near-resonant,</b> linearly polarized light leads to an effective creation of long-lived ground-state Zeeman coherences which is observed through the nonlinear Faraday effect or free induction decay signals of the Larmor precession. Both optically and radiofrequency induced Zeeman coherences are observed, with relaxation rates around a 100 Hz...|$|E
