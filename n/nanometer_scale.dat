Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a <b>nanometer</b> <b>scale.</b> Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E

Its typical characteristic dimensions fall within the range of 1–100nm. At least one dimension of the structure is in nanoscopic scale.

25|$|Chemical etching {{involves}} {{soaking the}} material surface in an etchant such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) until {{the surface is}} etched away to a desired roughness as created by pits and protrusions on the <b>nanometer</b> <b>scale.</b> Longer etch times lead to rougher surfaces (i.e., smaller surface pits and protrusions). Structures with specific geometry or organization cannot be created by this rudimentary method because at best it {{can be considered a}} surface treatment for changing the surface roughness. The significant advantages of this method are ease of use and low cost for creating a surface with nanotopographies. Silicon wafers were etched using HF, and it was demonstrated that cell adhesion was enhanced only in a specified range of roughness (20–50nm).|$|E

2500|$|Nanoconcrete {{is created}} by high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water. To ensure the mixing is {{thorough}} enough to create nano-concrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30 - 600 watts per kilogram of the mix. [...] This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific energy expended upon the mix of at least 5000 joules per kilogram of the mix. A plasticizer or a superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete mixer. In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses {{on the surface of}} cement particles. This intense mixing serves to divide the cement particles into extremely fine <b>nanometer</b> <b>scale</b> sizes, which provides for extremely thorough mixing. [...] This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) colloid creation.|$|E
