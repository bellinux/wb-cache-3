Specifically, {{a proposal for}} calls under the GAB may only be made when a proposal {{for the establishment of}} an activation period under the <b>New</b> <b>Arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>Borrow</b> (NAB) is not accepted by NAB participants, who number 38 countries, amongst which are the BRICS nations and Middle Eastern powers.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011 and 2012, ALG {{opposed the}} use of U.S. funds at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to bail out Greece, Ireland and Portugal, which {{were caught in the}} European {{sovereign}} debt crisis, [...] and urged Congress to roll back the 2009 expansion of the IMF including the $100 billion <b>New</b> <b>Arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>Borrow,</b> supporting legislation offered by U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). In 2016, ALG opposed another $56.7 billion expansion of the IMF that was included in the fiscal year 2016 omnibus spending bill.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the term G10 {{currencies}} is not clear, however it may be derived from the G-10 countries and their agreement {{to participate in the}} IMF General <b>Arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>Borrow</b> (GAB).

50|$|However, {{according}} to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Philippines became a creditor nation in 2010 when it joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Financial Transactions Plan (FTP) through which emerging market economies took part in international cooperation efforts to lessen {{the impact of the}} euro debt crisis {{on the rest of the}} global economy. Among the gains the Philippines got from joining the FTP was access to the <b>New</b> <b>Arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>Borrow</b> (NAB) facility, which the IMF established to help its members cope with serious international financial crises.|$|E
50|$|A {{report by}} the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, {{published}} in May 2017, questioned the legal necessity of leaving Euratom {{and called for a}} temporary extension of membership to allow time for <b>new</b> <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> be made.|$|R
5000|$|Short sellers <b>borrow,</b> or make <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow,</b> {{the stock}} of a company, which they then sell at current prices. If prices later drop, they {{repurchase}} shares of the company, now at a cheaper price, <b>to</b> replace the <b>borrowed</b> stock. The difference is the profit of the short seller. Heinze's plan was to move aggressively to purchase {{the stock of}} United Copper. The price would soar high. Then, with prices high, and Heinze controlling most of the stock, he would force the short-sellers <b>to</b> repay the <b>borrowed</b> stock, a move called a [...] "short squeeze." [...] The short-sellers would have {{no option but to}} settle with Heinze for high prices.|$|R

50|$|On 9 February 2009, after a review, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, {{announced}} <b>new</b> <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> govern migration agents. Under these <b>new</b> <b>arrangements,</b> the OMARA {{was established}} on 1 July 2009. Previously, the legislation appointed an organisation called the Migration Institute of Australia Limited (MIA) {{to function as}} the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA), which was charged with maintaining a register of migration agents and carrying out a variety of functions under the Act in relation to supervision and discipline of agents.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the origin, evolution, and results of two initiatives {{taken by the}} United Kingdom in the early 1960 s. Both initiatives aimed at facilitating large-scale lending by the IMF (or in close parallel to the IMF), primarily {{in support of the}} two reserve currencies of the international monetary system, the US dollar and sterling. The first initiativeâ€”of which {{there appears to be no}} previous record extant anywhereâ€”achieved its objective, leading to three important changes in IMF policy, including the General <b>Arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>Borrow</b> (GAB). The design of the second practically ensured its failure to win international support; but it provoked the United States into proposing a powerful study group on international liquidity which, seven years later, resulted in the creation of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) facility in the IMF. ...|$|R

50|$|But {{the plot}} was {{developing}} a few kinks. Walter and Kurt were {{having trouble with}} the sub. In the calm shallows of Whitefish Bay it had performed flawlessly. But when they tried taking it out into deeper waters they couldn't fully submerge the vessel because the waves were too rough. Walter decided an alternate drop-off scheme was needed so he spent several days devising a <b>new</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>to</b> be executed via motorcycle. He also drafted new letters delivered to Davie explaining the change in plans.|$|R

40|$|If the {{arrangement}} of coils with the eddy currents testing is not a standard one {{it is very important}} to understand the physics of the <b>new</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>to</b> be able to interpret the results properly. A very useful tool is the mathematical treatment of field equations. The numerical methods are often applied, since Maxwell equations are rather complex partial differential equations and there are usually real and imaginary components of the field to be taken into account. In the article there are basic algorithms given that are used with the method of finite differences. There are only main ideas given how to solve more complicated problems. The actual concrete results are part of a broader project and will be published later...|$|R
40|$|Trial {{and error}} are {{inevitable}} {{in the process}} of software development; the redesign is wasteful when unfocused communication occurs within the development process. To speed up this development process, we optimized the information flow and redesigned the development organization into chunks. First, we investigated the information flow between tasks and coupled tasks into phases utilizing the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) so that the information exchange among chunks of tasks is as few as possible. In this way, the redundant iterations of tasks are eliminated. Meanwhile, we also grouped the engineers into groups according to the tasks, in this; we eliminated wasteful communications between the groups of engineers. We depict the social network defined by the information flow within the software development sector and compared the <b>new</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>to</b> the old <b>arrangement</b> in a visible way. This <b>new</b> <b>arrangement</b> will facilitate the communications between engineers and speed up the process of software development...|$|R
