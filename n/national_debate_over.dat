The PC formed a cartel with the PP during the December 1933 election, but registered dismal results. The race was won by the PNL, with Duca being confirmed as Prime Minister. By then, the PC was losing its support base on the right, with Cantacuzino and other cadres migrating toward the Iron Guard, an openly fascist movement, or trying to persuade General Ion Antonescu into reviving the Vlad Țepeș League. Filipescu also ran, unsuccessfully, for a deputy seat in Ilfov during the by-elections of 1934.|$|E

40|$|Drawing a {{large-scale}} ethnographic research, this thesis relates hostility to the equalities and multiculturalism, to the “second white backlash” of multiculturalism evident during the 1990 s in the USA, Australia and the UK. It examines this phenomenon within the unfolding {{social and political}} responses to race equalities {{in the context of}} <b>national</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> racism and multiculturalism. The chosen movies, American History X (USA), Romper Stomper (Australia) and This is England (UK), are depicting the era of white backlash in the 1990 s.

40|$|Economic discontent {{fueled the}} {{political}} dissatisfaction that {{erupted in the}} Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen in 2011. Demonstrators blamed repressive authoritarian governments for slow economic growth, increasing poverty and social inequality, high youth unemployment and rampant corruption. Alongside demands for increased political freedom, greater participation in politics, {{and an end to}} repression were calls for economic freedom and improved well-being. The uprisings, which spawned democracy in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, continue to reverberate across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) by opening up previously closed public spaces to wider popular participation in <b>national</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> the prospects for democracy in Arab countries...|$|R
25|$|Politics {{in early}} Wisconsin were {{defined by the}} greater <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> slavery. A free state from its foundation, Wisconsin became a center of {{northern}} abolitionism. The debate became especially intense in 1854 after Joshua Glover, a runaway slave from Missouri, was captured in Racine. Glover {{was taken into custody}} under the Federal Fugitive Slave Law, but a mob of abolitionists stormed the prison where Glover was held and helped him escape to Canada. In a trial stemming from the incident, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ultimately declared the Fugitive Slave Law unconstitutional. The Republican Party, founded on March 20, 1854, by anti-slavery expansion activists in Ripon, Wisconsin, grew to dominate state politics in the aftermath of these events. During the Civil War, around 91,000 troops from Wisconsin fought for the Union.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, {{the first}} {{cracks in the}} state Democratic Party began to show {{after the passage of}} the Kansas-Nebraska Act by Congress. Bright and his faction, a {{majority}} of the party, began forcing out anti-slavery members of the party leadership, using support of the act as a litmus test of party loyalty. By then the <b>national</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> the possible break-up of the Union had begun. The Whig party was also on the brink of collapse, and a new coalition party of former Whigs, former Democrats, the anti-immigration Free Soil party, and the anti-slavery Liberty Party came together. The result was the so-called Know-Nothing Party and the first real challenge to Democrat control of the state in a generation. The 1854 mid-term election caused the Democrats to lose seats in the Senate, but still maintain control. The Democrats did, however, lose their majority in the house. The House was spilt with no party attaining majority, and the Whigs caucused with the Democrats to control the assembly. The effect was a virtual paralysis to the legislature, and Wright was unable to make any significant accomplishments during his last two years in office.|$|E

40|$|South Africa’s coal-dominated {{electricity}} sector, a {{key feature}} of the country’s minerals-energy complex, is in crisis and subject to change. This offers potential opportunities for decarbonisation. Despite positive examples of decarbonisation in South Africa’s electricity sector, such as a procurement programme for renewable energy, there are structural path dependencies linked to coal-fired generation and security of supply. Decarbonisation goes far beyond what is technologically or even economically feasible, to encompass a complexity of political, social and economic factors. Meanwhile, decision-making in electricity is highly politicised and lack of transparency and power struggles in the policy sphere pose key challenges.

As a result, the Constitution of 1973, a consensus document, became riddled with internal contradictions regarding citizenship. For example, Article 25 says that all citizens are equal before law while Article 2 says that Islam shall be the state religion. When one religion, to the exclusion of all others, is established as the state religion, how can the followers of other religions be equal citizens? And if they cannot be equal citizens, is democracy possible without citizenship equality? The denial of the right of non-Muslims citizens to become the head of state or government also violates Article 25, which requires equality before law.|$|R
