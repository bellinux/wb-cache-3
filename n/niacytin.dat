25|$|Most of the niacin in mature {{cereal grains}} is present as <b>niacytin,</b> which is niacin {{bound up in}} a complex with {{hemicellulose}} which is nutritionally unavailable. In mature corn this may be up to 90% of the total niacin content. The preparation method of nixtamalization using the whole dried corn kernel made this niacin nutritionally available and reduced the chance of developing pellagra. <b>Niacytin</b> is concentrated in the aleurone and germ layers which are removed by milling. The milling and degerming of corn {{in the preparation of}} cornmeal became feasible with the development of the Beall degerminator which was originally patented in 1901 and was used to separate the grit from the germ in corn processing. However this process of degermination reduces the niacin content of the cornmeal.|$|E

J. 120, 515 - 521] that esterified nicotinic acid in <b>niacytin</b> from cereals is a precursor for trigonelline {{was investigated in}} rats. Single oral doses of <b>niacytin</b> resulted in the excretion of trigonelline in urine but only in rats that were niacin-deficient and were fed a cereal diet. These animals {{were found to have}} an abnormally permeable intestine, which allowed the uptake of molecules not usually absorbed. Orally administered synthetic [14 C]nicotinoyl[3 H]methylcellulose was shown to be absorbed by niacin-deficient rats on a cereal diet and [14 C]trigonelline was excreted in urine. These data indicate that dietary cereal induces a permeability defect in the intestinal mucosa of niacin-deficient rats, which allows the uptake of macromolecular <b>niacytin.</b> The nicotinoyl pyridine nitrogen atom is then methylated and slow hydrolysis releases trigonelline from the macromolecule...|$|E
