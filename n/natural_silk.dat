40|$|ABSTRACT In this {{research}} study {{we focused on}} studying the tribological properties of materials using atomic force microscopy techniques (AFM). Especially the tribological properties of fiber materials like <b>natural</b> <b>silks</b> (spider and silkworm) and synthetic materials (Kevlar and Nylon) were studied at micro/nanoscales. It {{was found that the}} <b>natural</b> <b>silks</b> (spider silks, silkworm silks) exhibit lower coefficient of friction and work of adhesion values that the synthetic fibers (Kevlar, Nylon). While the <b>natural</b> <b>silks</b> exhibit comparable scratch resistance to the synthetic fibers at low loads, the synthetic fibers tend to exhibit significantly better scratch resistance at higher loads. Durability of AFM tips were also studied by measuring the change in tip radius of the AFM tips and also utilized the atom probe tomographic (APT) techniques to examine the AFM tips. The measure of change in tip radius indicates the wear resistance of the tips. It was founded that coated tips (silicon nitride and DLC) has good wear resistance compared to pure Si tips and is also confirmed in APT studies...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{artificial}} spinning {{methods have been}} applied to produce regenerated silk fibers; however, how to spin regenerated silk fibers that retain the advantages of <b>natural</b> <b>silks</b> in terms of structural hierarchy and mechanical properties remains challenging. Here, we show a bioinspired approach to spin regenerated silk fibers. First, we develop a nematic silk microfibril solution, highly viscous and stable, by partially dissolving silk fibers into microfibrils. This solution maintains the hierarchical structures in <b>natural</b> <b>silks</b> and serves as spinning dope. It is then spun into regenerated silk fibers by direct extrusion in the air, offering a useful route to generate polymorphic and hierarchical regenerated silk fibers with physical properties beyond natural fiber construction. The materials maintain the structural hierarchy and mechanical properties of <b>natural</b> <b>silks,</b> including a modulus of 11 ± 4 GPa, even higher than <b>natural</b> spider <b>silk.</b> It can further be functionalized with a conductive silk/carbon nanotube coating, responsive to changes in humidity and temperature.

40|$|The {{processes}} used {{to create}} synthetic spider silk greatly affect {{the properties of the}} produced fibers. This paper investigates the effect of process variations during artificial spinning on the thermal and mechanical properties of the produced silk. Property values are also compared to the ones of the <b>natural</b> dragline <b>silk</b> of the Nephila clavipes spider, and to unprocessed (as-spun) synthetic silk. Structural characterization by scanning pyroelectric microscopy is employed to provide insight into the axial orientation of the crystalline regions of the fiber and is supported by X-ray diffraction data. The results show that stretching and passage through liquid baths induce crystal formation and axial alignment in synthetic fibers, but with different structural organization than <b>natural</b> <b>silks.</b> Furthermore, an increase in thermal diffusivity and elastic modulus is observed with decreasing fiber diameter, trending toward properties of natural fiber.

It is also found that fibers spun from spidroin-like proteins that contain different motifs of sequence exhibit variations in their microstructure in terms of crystallinity and chain alignment, but these differences are not reflected in distinct tensile properties. This similarity in terms of their mechanical behavior indicates that bioinspired fibers are largely independent of their exact sequence of recombinant proteins and, in particular, of their proline content.

40|$|Silk {{production}} has evolved to be energetically efficient and functionally optimized, yielding a material that can outperform most industrial fibres, particularly in toughness. Spider silk has hitherto defied all attempts at reproduction, despite advances {{in our understanding}} of the molecular mechanisms behind its superb mechanical properties. Spun fibres, natural and man-made, rely on the extrusion process to facilitate molecular orientation and bonding. Hence a full understanding of the flow characteristics of native spinning feedstock (dope) will be essential to translate natural spinning to artificial silk production. Here we show remarkable similarity between the rheologies for native spider-dragline and silkworm-cocoon silk, despite their independent evolution and substantial differences in protein structure. Surprisingly, both dopes behave like typical polymer melts.
