40|$|Some {{biological}} particles, such as Snomax, {{are very}} active ice <b>nucleating</b> particles, inducing heterogeneous freezing in supercooled water at temperatures above − 15 {{and up to}} − 2  °C. Despite their exceptional freezing abilities, large uncertainties remain regarding the atmospheric abundance of biological ice <b>nucleating</b> particles, and their contribution to atmospheric ice nucleation. It {{has been suggested that}} small biological ice <b>nucleating</b> macromolecules or fragments can be carried on the surfaces of dust and other atmospheric particles. This could combine the atmospheric abundance of dust particles with the ice <b>nucleating</b> strength of biological material to create strongly enhanced and abundant ice <b>nucleating</b> surfaces in the atmosphere, with significant implications for the budget and distribution of atmospheric ice <b>nucleating</b> particles, and their consequent effects on cloud microphysics and mixed-phase clouds. The new critical surface area g framework that was developed by Beydoun et al.  (2016) is extended to produce a heterogeneous ice nucleation mixing model that can predict the freezing behavior of multicomponent particle surfaces immersed in droplets. The model successfully predicts the immersion freezing properties of droplets containing Snomax bacterial particles across a mass concentration range of 7 orders of magnitude, by treating Snomax as comprised of two distinct distributions of heterogeneous ice <b>nucleating</b> activity. Furthermore, the model successfully predicts the immersion freezing behavior of a low-concentration mixture of Snomax and illite mineral particles, a proxy for the biological material–dust (bio-dust) mixtures observed in atmospheric aerosols. It is shown that even at very low Snomax concentrations in the mixture, droplet freezing at higher temperatures is still determined solely by the second less active and more abundant distribution of heterogeneous ice <b>nucleating</b> activity of Snomax, while freezing at lower temperatures is determined solely by the heterogeneous ice <b>nucleating</b> activity of pure illite. This demonstrates that in this proxy system, biological ice <b>nucleating</b> particles do not compromise their ice <b>nucleating</b> activity upon mixing with dust and no new range of intermediary freezing temperatures associated with the mixture of ice <b>nucleating</b> particles of differing activities is produced. The study is the first to directly examine the freezing behavior of a mixture of Snomax and illite and presents the first multicomponent ice nucleation model experimentally evaluated using a wide range of ice <b>nucleating</b> particle concentration mixtures in droplets...|$|R

40|$|Effect of {{very small}} {{quantities}} of organically modified layered silicate clay on the nucleation of polypropylene (PP), as an additive at ppm levels dosage was investigated, {{in combination with}} two of the most commercially exploited organic <b>nucleating</b> agents, one of which is a cyclic aromatic phosphinate salt and the other is bis(3, 4 -dimethylbenzylidene) sorbitol, each representing a separate class of <b>nucleating</b> molecules by itself. Substitution of a considerable fraction of either of these organic <b>nucleating</b> agents with organically modified inorganic nanoclay was seen to result in a unique synergy between the two in <b>nucleating</b> PP. Polarized light microscopy studies of these synergistic formulations with organoclay to <b>nucleating</b> agent ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 totaling 0. 2 weight percent in PP showed significant reduction in spherulite size from that of non-nucleated PP, and compared with the samples containing exclusive organic <b>nucleating</b> agent at similar loading. Differential scanning calorimetric studies provided evidence and insight into such synergistic behavior. Crystallization and supercooling temperatures for the synergistic formulations were comparable for those formulations containing only organic <b>nucleating</b> agents, indicating comparable nucleation efficiency, whereas organoclay alone, although showing some extent of nucleation, was clearly poorer in efficiency. Wide and small angle X-ray scattering studies further explained these observations. An increase in the gamma polytype fraction was seen in samples that contained both organoclay and <b>nucleating</b> agent, pointing to the role of organoclay as a gamma nucleator. Organoclay was found to be completely exfoliated in these synergistic formulations and was seen as well-dispersed, single platelets in the PP matrix. A hybrid network consisting of exfoliated organoclay platelets and organic <b>nucleating</b> agent molecules was proposed, which is more stable and stiffer than the network formed by <b>nucleating</b> agent alone.

Glenwood sites appear to have been more oriented in lifeways and trade with the Central Plains Tradition cultures to the west than with the Mississippian cultures to the southeast. Around 1300 AD Mill Creek and Glenwood sites in Iowa disappeared, replaced by the rapidly spreading Oneota cultures.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the free}} peasants of Anglo-Saxon society appear to have lost status and become indistinguishable from the non-free serfs. Whether this change was due entirely to the conquest is unclear, but the {{invasion}} and its after-effects probably accelerated a process already under way. The spread of towns and increase in <b>nucleated</b> settlements in the countryside, rather than scattered farms, was probably accelerated by {{the coming of the}} Normans to England. The lifestyle of the peasantry probably did not greatly change in the decades after 1066. Although earlier historians argued that women became less free and lost rights with the conquest, current scholarship has mostly rejected this view. Little is known about women other than those in the landholding class, so no conclusions can be drawn about peasant women's status after 1066. Noblewomen appear to have continued to influence political life mainly through their kinship relationships. Both before and after 1066 aristocratic women could own land, and some women continued {{to have the ability to}} dispose of their property as they wished.|$|E

5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Maya was {{hindered}} by their politically fragmented state. Spanish and native tactics and technology differed greatly. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns; they viewed the taking of prisoners as a hindrance to outright victory, whereas the Maya prioritised the capture of live prisoners and of booty. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic; {{in response to the}} use of Spanish cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits and lining them with wooden stakes. Native resistance to the new <b>nucleated</b> settlements took the form of the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the European conquerors. Spanish weaponry included broadswords, rapiers, lances, pikes, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Maya warriors fought with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows, stones, and wooden swords with inset obsidian blades, and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Maya lacked key elements of Old World technology such as a functional wheel, horses, iron, steel, and gunpowder; they were also extremely susceptible to Old World diseases, against which they had no resistance.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{engaged in}} a {{strategy}} of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones (also known as congregaciones). Native resistance to the new <b>nucleated</b> settlements {{took the form of}} the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic.|$|E
5|$|The {{archaeology}} of Iowa is {{the study}} of the buried remains of human culture within the state of Iowa from the earliest prehistoric through the late historic periods. When the American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500–2,800 years ago) American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased. More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increase on the reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and <b>nucleated</b> settlements. The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. During the Historical period European traders and American Indians in Iowa gave way to American settlers and Iowa was transformed into an agricultural state.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{shock of}} the Spanish conquest was {{followed}} by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike.

This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area. The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism. Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups. The greatest change was replacement of the pre-Columbian economic order by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour.
