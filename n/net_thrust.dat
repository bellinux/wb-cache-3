25|$|Mach3 {{performance}} in the 1950s was difficult to achieve. Jet engines compress incoming air, then mix it with fuel and ignite the mixture. The resulting expansion of gases produces thrust. The compressors generally can ingest air only at subsonic speeds. To operate supersonically, aircraft use advanced intakes to slow the supersonic air to a usable speed. The energy lost in this process heats the air, which means the engine has to operate at ever-higher temperatures to provide <b>net</b> <b>thrust.</b> The limiting factor in this process is {{the temperature of the}} materials in the engines, in particular, the turbine blades just behind the combustion chambers. Using materials available at the time, speeds much beyond Mach2.5 were difficult to achieve.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Kartveli, Republic's Chief Designer, {{devised a}} {{solution}} to these problems. He proposed using a Wright J67 turbojet (a license-built derivative of the Bristol Olympus) supplemented by an RJ55-W-1 ramjet behind it. Connecting the two were a series of movable ducts that could route air between the engines. At low speeds the aircraft would be powered by the J67, with the RJ55 acting as a traditional afterburner, producing {{a total of about}} 40,000lbf (180kN) thrust. At high speeds, starting above Mach 2.2, the jet engine would be shut down and the airflow from the intake would be routed around the jet engine and directly into the RJ55. Although the <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> was reduced by shutting down the jet, operating on the ramjet alone allowed the aircraft to reach much higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the {{combustion}} of propellant in the rocket engine {{is to increase the}} velocity of the resulting gases to very high speeds, hence producing a thrust. Initially, the gases of combustion are sent in every direction, but only those that produce a <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> have any effect. The ideal direction of motion of the exhaust is in the direction so as to cause thrust. At the top end of the combustion chamber the hot, energetic gas fluid cannot move forward, and so, it pushes upward against the top of the rocket engine's combustion chamber. As the combustion gases approach the exit of the combustion chamber, they increase in speed. The {{effect of the}} convergent part of the rocket engine nozzle on the high pressure fluid of combustion gases, is to cause the gases to accelerate to high speed. The higher the speed of the gases, the lower the pressure of the gas (Bernoulli's principle or conservation of energy) acting on that part of the combustion chamber. In a properly designed engine, the flow will reach Mach 1 at the throat of the nozzle. At which point the speed of the flow increases. Beyond the throat of the nozzle, a bell shaped expansion part of the engine allows the gases that are expanding to push against that part of the rocket engine. Thus, the bell part of the nozzle gives additional thrust. Simply expressed, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to Newton's third law with the result that the exiting gases produce the reaction of a force on the rocket causing it to accelerate the rocket.|$|E

40|$|Graphs {{have been}} {{developed}} for rapid evaluation of air-induction systems from considerations of their aerodynamic-performance parameters in combination with power-plant characteristics. The graphs cover the range of supersonic Mach numbers to 3. 0. Examples are presented for an air-induction system and engine combination of two Mach numbers and two altitudes in order to illustrate the method and application of the graphs. The examples show that jet-engine characteristics impose restrictions on the use of fixed inlets if the maximum <b>net</b> <b>thrusts</b> are to be realized at all flight conditions. (author) ...|$|R

In practice the effective exhaust velocities of rockets varies but can be extremely high, ~4500m/s, about 15 times the sea level speed of sound in air.|$|E
50|$|Deducting these throttle-dependent drags (where applicable) {{from the}} <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> {{calculated}} above gives the streamtube <b>net</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Nowadays, civil {{engines are}} usually flat-rated on <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> up to a 'kink-point' climate. So {{at a given}} flight condition, <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> is held {{approximately}} constant over a very wide range of ambient temperature, by increasing (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature (RIT or SOT). However, beyond the kink-point, SOT is held constant and <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> starts to fall for further increases in ambient temperature. Consequently, aircraft fuel load and/or payload must be decreased.|$|E
5000|$|The {{speed of}} the jet [...] must exceed the true {{airspeed}} of the aircraft {{if there is to}} be a <b>net</b> forward <b>thrust</b> on the airframe. The speed [...] can be calculated thermodynamically based on adiabatic expansion.|$|R
50|$|If the {{generated}} thrust is {{less than}} the aerodynamic drag of the ducting and radiator, then the arrangement serves to reduce the net aerodynamic drag of the radiator installation. If the generated thrust exceeds the aerodynamic drag of the installation, then the entire assemblage contributes a <b>net</b> forward <b>thrust</b> to the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Their first {{tests of}} this tapered cavity were {{conducted}} {{at very low}} power (2% of Shawyer's 2002 experiment). A <b>net</b> mean <b>thrust</b> over five runs was measured at 91.2 µN at 17 W of input power. The experiment was criticized for its small data set and for not having been conducted in vacuum, to eliminate thermal air currents.|$|R
50|$|As flight speed {{builds up}} after take-off, the ram {{rise in the}} intake starts to have a {{significant}} effect upon nozzle pressure/temperature and intake airflow, causing nozzle gross thrust to climb more rapidly. This term now starts to offset the still increasing ram drag, eventually causing <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> to start to increase. In some engines, the <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> at say Mach 1.0, sea level can even be slightly greater than the static thrust. Above Mach 1.0, with a subsonic inlet design, shock losses tend to decrease <b>net</b> <b>thrust,</b> however a suitably designed supersonic inlet can give a lower reduction in intake pressure recovery, allowing <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> to continue to climb in the supersonic regime.|$|E
5000|$|Naturally, as {{altitude}} increases, {{there is}} a decrease in air density and, therefore, the <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> of an engine. There is also a flight speed effect, termed thrust lapse rate. Consider the approximate equation for <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> again:With a high specific thrust (e.g., fighter) engine, the jet velocity is relatively high, so intuitively one can see that increases in flight velocity have less of an impact upon <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> than a medium specific thrust (e.g., trainer) engine, where the jet velocity is lower. The impact of thrust lapse rate upon a low specific thrust (e.g., civil) engine is even more severe. At high flight speeds, high-specific-thrust engines can pick up <b>net</b> <b>thrust</b> through the ram rise in the intake, but this effect tends to diminish at supersonic speeds because of shock wave losses.|$|E

40|$|Flow {{through a}} {{combined}} ventral and axial exhaust nozzle system was studied experimentally and analytically. The work {{is part of}} an ongoing propulsion technology effort at NASA Lewis Research Center for short takeoff, vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft. The experimental investigation was done on the NASA Lewis Powered Lift Facility. The experiment consisted of performance testing over a range of tailpipe pressure ratios from 1 to 3. 2 and flow visualization. The analytical investigation consisted of modeling the same configuration and solving for the flow using the PARC 3 D computational fluid dynamics program. The comparison of experimental and analytical results was very good. The ventral nozzle performance coefficients obtained from both the experimental and analytical studies agreed within 1. 2 percent. The <b>net</b> horizontal <b>thrust</b> of the nozzle system contained a significant reverse thrust component created by the flow overturning in the ventral duct. This component resulted in a low <b>net</b> horizontal <b>thrust</b> coefficient. The experimental and analytical studies showed very good agreement in the internal flow patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from grinding to chipping {{can be observed}} in tunnel boring machine (TBM) penetration test data by plotting the penetration rate (distance/revolution) against the <b>net</b> cutter <b>thrust</b> (force per cutter) over the full range of penetration rates in the test. Correlating penetration test data to the geological and geomechanical characteristics of rock masses through which a penetration test is conducted provides the ability to reveal the efficiency of the chipping process in response to changing geological conditions. Penetration test data {{can also be used to}} identify stress-induced tunnel face instability. This research shows that the strength of the rock is an important parameter for controlling how much <b>net</b> cutter <b>thrust</b> is required to {{transition from}} grinding to chipping. It also shows that the geological characteristics of a rock will determine how efficient chipping occurs once it has begun. In particular, geological characteristics that lead to efficient fracture propagation, such as fabric and mica contents, will lead to efficient chipping. These findings will enable a better correlation between TBM performance and geological conditions for use in TBM design, as a basis for contractual payments where penetration rate dominates the excavation cycle and in further academic investigations into the TBM excavation process...|$|R

Only then could any conceivable set of launch or post-liftoff abort procedures be contemplated. In addition, failure of an individual SRB's thrust output or ability to adhere to the designed performance profile was not survivable.|$|R
50|$|The next {{generation}} of Supersonic transport (SST) may require some form of VCE. SST engines require a high specific <b>thrust</b> (<b>net</b> thrust/airflow) at supersonic cruise to keep the cross-sectional area of the powerplant to a minimum, so as to reduce aircraft drag. Unfortunately, this implies a high jet velocity not only at supersonic cruise, but at take-off, which makes the aircraft noisy.|$|R

This is not a realistic situation, however, because the attainable pressure recovery decreases markedly with increasing Mach number. The effect of more realistic pressure recovery values are presented in this paper. Two sets of values were employed, which differ by two percent. Diffuser operation is always critical; i. e. we are using a ``rubber`` diffuser. Nozzle are has been optimized for each operating condition.

50|$|Double {{helical gears}} and {{herringbone}} gears are similar, {{but the difference}} is that herringbone gears do not have a groove in the middle like double helical gears do. Double helical gears overcome the problem of axial thrust presented by single helical gears by using two sets of teeth that are set in a V shape. A double helical gear {{can be thought of as}} two mirrored helical gears joined together. This arrangement cancels out the <b>net</b> axial <b>thrust,</b> since each half of the gear thrusts in the opposite direction, resulting in a net axial force of zero. This arrangement can remove the need for thrust bearings. However, double helical gears are more difficult to manufacture due to their more complicated shape.|$|R

In the second part of this study, inlet design points were chosen to optimize the <b>net</b> installed <b>thrust,</b> and detailed design of the two inlet configurations was performed. An analytical methodology was developed to account for propfan slipstream effects, transonic flow efects, and three-dimensional geometry effects.

50|$|One of the {{problems}} with Concorde and the Tu-144's operation was the high engine noise levels, associated with very high jet velocities used during take-off, and even more importantly flying over communities near the airport. SST engines need a fairly high specific <b>thrust</b> (<b>net</b> thrust/airflow) during supersonic cruise, to minimize engine cross-sectional area and, thereby, nacelle drag. Unfortunately this implies a high jet velocity, which makes the engines noisy which causes problems particularly at low speeds/altitudes and at take-off.|$|R
40|$|The {{supersonic}} combustion flowfields {{associated with}} various hypersonic propulsion systems, {{such as the}} ram accelerator, the oblique detonation wave engine, and the scramjet, are being investigated using a new computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code.

It employs an iterative method and a second order differencing scheme to improve computational efficiency. The code is currently being applied to study shock wave/boundary layer interactions in premixed combustible gases, and to investigate the ram accelerator concept. Results obtained for a ram accelerator configuration indicate a new combustion mechanism in which a shock wave induces combustion in the boundary layer, which then propagates outward and downstream.
