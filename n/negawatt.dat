2500|$|According to Lovins, energy {{efficiency}} represents a profitable global market and American companies have {{at their disposal}} the technical innovations to lead the way. Not only should they [...] "upgrade their plants and office buildings, but they should encourage the formation of <b>negawatt</b> markets". Lovins sees <b>negawatt</b> markets as a win-win solution to many environmental problems. Because it is [...] "now generally cheaper to save fuel than to burn it, global warming, acid rain, and urban smog can be reduced not at a cost but at a profit".|$|E
2500|$|A <b>negawatt</b> is a unit in {{watts of}} energy saved. It is {{basically}} the opposite of a watt. Amory Lovins has advocated a [...] "negawatt revolution", arguing that utility customers don’t want kilowatt-hours of electricity; they want energy services such as hot showers, cold beer, lit rooms, and spinning shafts, which can come more cheaply if electricity is used more efficiently.|$|E
50|$|The <b>NégaWatt</b> {{scenario}} spans from 2012 to 2050. The scenario starts by assessing {{energy needs}} {{in terms of}} heat, mobility and specific electricity, and suggests a transition path. It then couples the <b>NégaWatt</b> and the After res 2050 scenarios. The After res association targets agriculture energy use and can evaluate biomass production, providing the <b>NégaWatt</b> scenario with realistic biomass figures.|$|E
5000|$|Individual {{households}} {{can practice}} <b>negawatts</b> through using energy-efficient lighting and Energy Star appliances {{as well as}} simply reducing standby power. The resulting savings sometimes offset the investment in new high efficient light bulbs and appliances. These efficiencies can offset {{a portion of the}} cost of a residential photovoltaic system. <b>Negawatts</b> reduces the overall size of the photovoltaic system required for the household, because they are consuming less electricity. This results in a faster payback period for the photovoltaic system. The City of San Diego has created a <b>negawatts</b> initiative called [...] "Reduce then Produce" [...] to promote this idea.|$|R

50|$|To {{evaluate}} the economic soundness of energy efficiency investments in buildings, cost-effectiveness analysis or CEA can be used. A CEA calculation will produce {{the value of}} energy saved, sometimes called <b>negawatts,</b> in $/kWh. The energy in such a calculation is virtual {{in the sense that}} it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made. Thus CEA allows comparing the price of <b>negawatts</b> with price of energy such as electricity from the grid or the cheapest renewable alternative. The benefit of the CEA approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation, thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments.|$|R

50|$|Energy {{consumers}} {{need some}} incentive {{to respond to}} such a request from a Demand Response Provider (see list of Providers below). Demand Response incentives can be formal or informal. For example, the utility might create a tariff-based incentive by passing along short-term increases {{in the price of}} electricity. Or they might impose mandatory cutbacks during a heat wave for selected high-volume users, who are compensated for their participation. Other users may receive a rebate or other incentive based on firm commitments to reduce power during periods of high demand, sometimes referred to as <b>negawatts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Currently, {{there is}} no way to {{precisely}} measure the amount of energy saved in negawatts; it can only be theoretically determined based on the consumer’s history of energy use. Visualizing has a very important role in “enabling residents to understand and manage their energy use,” which serves as a form of encouragement for consumers to conserve energy. Without the visualization of the energy use, it is difficult to conceptualize <b>negawatts</b> because the consumer cannot see a precise value of the amount of saved energy. Smart meters are becoming a more developed technology to measure energy usage, but [...] "consumers are calling on state regulators to move cautiously on smart meters, citing complaints in some states that the meters are raising electric bills rather than lowering them." ...|$|R

Professor Jacobs is right {{to call attention to}} demand response and to FERC’s approach to matters of jurisdictional doubt. While I share many of her concerns about boundary lines in a federal system, I argue that FERC 2 ̆ 7 s demand response program represents a fair and legally defensible attempt to, among other things, diffuse the market power of energy producers.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{claimed that the}} {{cheapest}} energy {{is the one you}} do not need to produce. Nevertheless, this claim could somehow be unsubstantiated. In this article, the authors try to shed some light on this issue by using the concept of energy return on investment (EROI) as a yardstick. This choice brings semantic issues because in this paper the EROI is used in a different context than that of energy production. Indeed, while watts and <b>negawatts</b> share the same physical unit, they are not the same object, which brings some ambiguities in the interpretation of EROI. These are cleared by a refined definition of EROI and an adapted nomenclature. This review studies the research in the energy efficiency of building operation, {{which is one of the}} most investigated topics in energy efficiency. This study focuses on the impact of insulation and high efficiency windows as means to exemplify the concepts that are introduced. These results were normalized for climate, life time of the building, and construction material. In many cases, energy efficiency measures imply a very high EROI. Nevertheless, in some circumstances, this is not the case and it might be more profitable to produce the required energy than to try to save it...|$|R
40|$|Presidential unilateralism {{has become}} a {{defining}} feature of the executive branch. But a related and equally important phenomenon has been largely ignored: federal agency efforts to circumvent statutory federalism boundaries. This move, which the Article calls 2 ̆ 2 bypassing federalism, 2 ̆ 2 involves using existing jurisdictional authority to work defacto, rather than dejure, reallocations of power. The Article explores agency bypassing through the lens of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 2 ̆ 7 s (2 ̆ 2 FERC 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2) promotion of demand response in electricity markets. Demand response refers to customer sales of negative watts, or 2 ̆ 2 <b>negawatts,</b> 2 ̆ 2 back to the electrical grid. FERC, eager to promote demand-side management programs but stymied by the jurisdictional limitations in the Federal Power Act of 1935, recently adopted a strategy that bypasses these federalism boundaries by setting up demand response programs in wholesale markets, which are under its control, to parallel state and local programs. Although the strategy has boosted demand response program participation, the Article ultimately concludes that bypassing is an insalubrious administrative innovation. While it allows agencies to further national objectives without challenging jurisdictional boundaries head on, the strategy has significant downsides. First, statutory constraints may limit an agency 2 ̆ 7 s options in a way that results in the promotion of second-best over first-best policies. Second, even de facto jurisdictional adjustments raise federalism questions that we might prefer be addressed through the legislative process. Third, bypassing can be a costly strategy {{to the extent that it}} creates animosity between federal agencies and their state counterparts and fails to head off judicial showdowns. Finally, by making a dysfunctional statutory scheme workable, bypassing threatens to delay legislative solutions...|$|R

5000|$|Saving {{energy by}} the <b>negawatt</b> and {{creating}} a <b>negawatt</b> market can present several drawbacks for manufacturers and electricity providers. Manufacturers are less inclined to make energy-efficient devices which meet a specific standard, such as Energy star's standard, because of increased time and cost, while receiving minimal profit. Overall, electricity providers may not want customers to use less energy due {{to the loss of}} profit. Some even argue that producing energy-efficient products, such as light bulbs, actually simulate more demand, “resulting in more energy being purchased for conversion into light." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some conservatives {{claim that}} the <b>negawatt</b> market could help nations or states have a {{deregulated}} electricity system. This would allow a nation or a state to experiment with [...] "electricity deregulation," [...] in which [...] "demand reductions could be purchased {{with a minimum of}} disruption to businesses, workers and the economy." [...] In the United States, for instance, the <b>negawatt</b> market could assist California with rolling blackouts by making more power available from consumers who choose to conserve energy or increase their negawatts. California could achieve the goal of deregulation by allowing a deficit area to [...] "purchase an emergency supply from anywhere within with West" [...] in which [...] "the ultimate purpose of deregulation was to allow competition in the electricity market and consumer choice of electricity providers." [...] <b>Negawatt</b> power would allow the consumers in a country's economy to decide how the energy will be distributed: essentially benefiting regions that hope to have a deregulated electricity system.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>negawatt</b> is a unit in {{watts of}} {{electrical}} power saved. It {{is basically the}} opposite of a watt. The term <b>negawatt</b> is derived from megawatt and was created by Amory Lovins. Lovins saw a typo — [...] "negawatt" [...] instead of [...] "megawatt" [...] — in a Colorado Public Utilities Commission report in 1989. He adopted the term to describe electricity that was not created using energy efficiency and conservation. He was concerned with the large inefficiencies of energy use {{and came up with}} ways to remedy the problem. Lovins advocated for more efficient light bulbs and reflective metals that increase the intensity of light produced. He wanted consumers to use the energy produced in a smarter way by [...] "wringing more work from the electricity we already have." [...] Lovins felt an international behavioral change was necessary in order to decrease countries' dependence on excessive amounts of energy. The concept of a <b>negawatt</b> could influence a behavioral change in consumers by encouraging them to think about the energy that they spend.|$|E
5000|$|On March 15, 2011, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), {{the agency}} that regulates the U.S. {{electrical}} grid, approved a rule establishing the approach to compensation for demand response resources intended to benefit customers and help improve the operation and competitiveness of organized wholesale energy markets. This means that negawatts produced by reducing electrical use can demand the same market prices as real megawatts of generated electricity. The incentives for a <b>negawatt</b> market include receiving money, reduction of national energy dependency, and the local electricity deregulation within certain nations or states. As for the cost incentive, those who produce negawatts or simply conserve energy can earn money by selling the saved energy. The <b>negawatt</b> market could help nations or states obtain a deregulated electricity system by creating another market to purchase electricity from. [...] The <b>negawatt</b> market also has two main drawbacks.

5000|$|<b>Negawatt</b> {{power is}} a {{theoretical}} unit of power representing an amount of electrical power (measured in Watts) saved. Energy is saved by either increased efficiency or reduced energy consumption; the conserved energy is a [...] "negawatthour". The concept of a <b>negawatt</b> is simply a measure of power that is not used. Negawatts are a form of encouragement to motivate consumers to conserve energy. Amory Lovins considers the concept of conservation [...] "a change in behavior based on the attitude 'Do Less to Use Less.'" [...] He makes a distinction between conservation and efficiency by defining efficiency as [...] "the application of technologies and best practices to eliminate waste based on the attitude, 'Do the same or more with less.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|If a {{consumer}} conserves {{a substantial amount}} of energy then there can even be an allowance for a tax deduction. According to the <b>Negawatt</b> Power Solutions Group, a [...] "building that achieved a 50% energy cost reduction may be eligible for tax deduction up to $1.80 per square foot." [...] Negawatts can help alleviate some of the costs of constructing new, efficient buildings. [...] "The <b>negawatt</b> revolution now provides a way to cut construction costs, capture big returns on capital in renovations, and dramatically cut operating expenses." [...] Existing buildings can be made more efficient by renovating the insulation to cut back on electricity used for heating, installing more efficient light fixtures, and an upgraded HVAC design.
