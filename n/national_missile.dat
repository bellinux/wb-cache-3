[...] The bill would approve the transfer of administrative jurisdiction of about 29 acres of the Buffalo Gap National Grasslands from the Forest Service to the National Park Service (NPS).

5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> defense system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E

25|$|Whereas {{the current}} United States <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> defense system is {{designed}} around a relatively limited and unsophisticated attack, SDI planned for a massive attack by a sophisticated opponent. This raised significant issues about economic and technical costs associated with defending against anti-ballistic missile defense countermeasures used by the attacking side.|$|E
25|$|By 1987, the SDIO had {{developed}} a <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> defense concept called the Strategic Defense System Phase I Architecture. This concept consisted of ground and space based sensors and weapons, {{as well as a}} central battle management system. The ground-based systems operational today trace their roots back to this concept.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the Clinton {{administration}} further {{shifted the}} focus to ground-based interceptor missiles and theater scale systems, forming the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) and closing the SDIO. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization was renamed {{again by the}} George W. Bush administration as the Missile Defense Agency and focused onto limited <b>National</b> <b>Missile</b> Defense.|$|E

Aegis BMD (also known as Sea-Based Midcourse) is designed to intercept ballistic missiles post-boost phase and prior to reentry.|$|E
25|$|On February 24, 2005, Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew {{told the}} House of Commons that Canada would not {{participate}} in the American <b>National</b> <b>Missile</b> Defense Program, and that he expected to be consulted {{in the case of a}} missile being launched over Canadian air space. Martin's decision came with much praise, but others saw that the government was distancing itself from the U.S. His government continued to cooperate with the United States on border control, refugee claimants, and defense, and he appointed seasoned Liberal politician Frank McKenna as Canada's ambassador to Washington.|$|E
25|$|McCain is {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of ballistic <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> defenses. Russia threatened to place short-range nuclear missiles on the Russia’s border with NATO if the United States refuses to abandon plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles and a radar in Poland and the Czech Republic. In April 2007, Putin warned of a new Cold War if the Americans deployed the shield in the former Eastern Bloc. Putin also said that Russia is prepared to abandon its obligations under a Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987 with the United States.|$|E
5000|$|TourismJohnson {{authored}} {{the bill}} establishing the Minuteman <b>Missile</b> <b>National</b> Historic Site in western South Dakota.

25|$|Boyce {{commanded}} three submarines {{and then}} a frigate before achieving higher command in the Navy and serving as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff from 1998 to 2001 {{and then a}}s Chief of the Defence Staff from 2001 to 2003. As Chief of Defence Staff he {{is believed to have}} had concerns about US plans for a <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> defence system. In early 2003 he advised the British Government on the deployment of troops for the invasion of Iraq, seeking assurances as to the legitimacy of the deployment before it was allowed to proceed.|$|E
25|$|However, static emplacements remain {{useful in}} both defense against naval attacks and defense against air attacks. Naval mines are still an {{inexpensive}} but {{effective way to}} defend ports and choke off supply lines. Large static air defense systems that combine antiaircraft guns with missile launchers are still {{the best way to}} defend against air attacks. Such systems were used effectively by the North Vietnamese around Hanoi. Also, the United States has invested considerable time and money into the construction of a <b>National</b> <b>Missile</b> Defense system, a static defense grid intended to intercept nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, the US started formal {{negotiations}} with Czech Republic and Poland concerning construction of missile shield installations {{in those countries}} for a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System. Government of the Czech Republic agrees (while 67% Czechs disagree and only about 22% support it) to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors {{is supposed to be}} built in Poland. The objective is reportedly to protect another parts of US <b>National</b> <b>Missile</b> Defense from long-range missile strikes from Iran and North Korea, but Czech PM Mirek Topolánek said the main reason is to avoid Russian influence and strengthen ties to US.|$|E
