Hitler {{needed someone to}} keep up the {{pressure}} on Britain, and Göring was willing to do it. On 19 September, Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to Sea Lion ports, but those under assembly were to continue. But the damage being done by RAF Bomber Command now meant sustaining the army in readiness was becoming a strain. The invasion forces were broken up and moved East on the understanding it could be reassembled with only three weeks notice.|$|E

5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> he was a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that"—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and {{innuendo}} following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was about them.|$|E

5|$|Though <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> to be common, pallid {{sturgeon}} populations rapidly declined {{during the}} late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990. The U.S. government {{and most of the}} states with pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure the survival of the species. Pallid sturgeon were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species, until their numbers declined and they were placed on the endangered species list. All captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the roe from females was used as caviar.|$|E
5|$|As a teenager, Southall had {{unsuccessful}} trials at Wrexham, Crewe Alexandra and Bolton Wanderers. He {{aspired to}} be a postman, and <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> {{that he would make}} a living playing football. He then worked as a binman, waiter and hod carrier and therefore entered the game relatively late. He played for Llandudno Town at age 15, before joining Northern Premier League side Bangor City on £10 a week as a semi-professional the following year. Bangor manager Dave Elliott regularly selected veteran goalkeeper Peter Eales ahead of Southall. Everton asked Elliot permission to take Southall on trial, but Elliot left the club shortly after and no trial took place. With Bangor in financial trouble the paid playing staff began to leave the club, and Southall left Bangor and went on to accept an offer of £3 a week to play for Conwy United. He moved on to Cheshire County League club Winsford United at the age of 20. The club won the Cheshire Senior Cup in 1980, and Southall was voted the club's Player of the Year.|$|E

She held a lot of conferences and talked about the gender issues. As a woman, she <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> gender schema and always fought for herself. She believed that in the science field, women and men are equal, and that the reason why women are fewer in this field is because women are more easily distracted by other things such as gossip, so women have to memorize more unrelated things and cannot focus on work.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1930–31, Hobbs was invited to join a private team run by the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram which toured India and Ceylon. Sutcliffe joined him, and he was {{accompanied}} by his wife. Both Hobbs and Sutcliffe were extremely popular. In games which were not particularly competitive, he scored 593 runs, but these runs, {{and in particular the}} two centuries he scored were later to prove controversial. Hobbs <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> that the matches were, or should have been, first-class but statisticians later decided to recognise them as first-class. Wisden never recognised the centuries and so record his total of centuries as 197. Other authorities give 199 centuries.|$|E

25|$|Lincoln's {{personal}} communications, {{even from}} {{around the time of}} his To Whom it May Concern letter, indicate that he might have been willing to privately give ground on slavery. That Lincoln proposed a delayed ratification plan is mentioned by the Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel in June 1865—based on a report by Stephens from after the meeting. From a legal standpoint, Lincoln <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> that the federal government had the authority to ban slavery in the states—thus his constant emphasis on the status of the Emancipation Proclamation as a measure effective only during wartime. According to Paul Escott, Lincoln's moral opposition to slavery did not override his understanding of the Constitution; therefore, Lincoln may have believed that the rebel states would have a right to reject the Thirteenth Amendment if they rejoined the Union.|$|E
25|$|He {{participated in}} the conference {{that led to the}} merger of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, the Lettriste Internationale, and London Psychogeographical Association to form the Situationist International in 1957. Here he applied his {{scientific}} and mathematical knowledge drawn from Henri Poincaré and Niels Bohr to develop his situlogical technique. Jorn <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> in a conception of the Situationist ideas as exclusively artistic and separated from political involvement. He was at the root and {{at the core of the}} Situationist International project, fully sharing the revolutionary intentions with Debord. The Situationist general principles were an attack on the capitalist exploitation and degradation of the life of people, and solution of alternative life experiences, construction of situations, unitary urbanism, psychogeography, with the union of play, freedom and critical thinking. Such general principles were applied by Jorn to painting.|$|E
25|$|Duryodhana's {{hatred for}} the Pandavas stems from his sincere belief that he—being {{the son of}} the eldest brother—is the heir {{apparent}} to the throne of Hastinapura. Because of his blindness, his father had to renounce the throne in favor of the younger Pandu. Duryodhana deeply believed that what was rightfully his was being given away to his older cousin Yudhishthira. He also felt that the Pandavas were sons of Kunti and Gods (devakin), not of Pandu. He <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> that their divine origin alone proved their superiority, on many occasions questioning their merits, and always calling them the 'Kaunteya' (sons of Kunti). He also bore a deep hatred of Bhima, who was his age and dominated his brothers in sport and skill with his immense physical power and strength. When they were young, Bhima's bullying and taunting were a constant source of pain for Duryodhana and his brothers.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{have long}} admired the playwright's suspenseful {{handling}} of the Keller family's burden in the play All My Sons. The critical character in this work is Joe Keller, who permitted defective parts to remain in warplanes that subsequently crash. Not only does Joe Keller fail to recognize his social responsibility, but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime. Gradually, events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations. He argues that he <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> that the cracked engine heads would be installed and that he never admitted his mistake {{because it would have}} driven him out of business at the age of sixty-one, when he would not have another chance to “make something” for his family, his highest priority. Joe's irresponsibility is exposed through his son's questioning of his very humanity. Joe's suicide results from the tremendous guilt and self-awareness that arises during the play.|$|E
25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of her hands, to always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E
25|$|As {{the second}} Dutch attack on Fontenoy went in, the main allied {{formation}} moved towards the French {{position on the}} plateau. Cumberland took up his place alongside Ligonier {{at the head of}} 20 battalions, 15 British and 5 Hanoverian to their left, led by the British Guards Brigade, each with their two battalion guns, about 13,000 to 15,000 men, drawn up in two disciplined lines, each six ranks deep. However, the narrowness of the defile through which the attack had to pass forced the Hanoverians back to form a third line behind the British. As the British and Hanoverians advanced the French pushed forward the four small three-pounder battalion guns of the Gardes Françaises Brigade and the four of Aubeterre Brigade, the fire from these was added to the bombardment from the Redoubt d'Eu. Cumberland responded by deploying seven of the Guards Brigade's three-pounder battalion guns to push them back. The Duc de Gramont, of Dettingen infamy, was killed by a shot from these. As the column advanced up a slight rise, the British brought up a battery of twelve six-pounder cannons {{to the front of the}} column at such close range that the Gardes Françaises left their supported defensive position against orders, as they had at Dettingen, and advanced, unsupported, in an attempt to take the guns. Both sides exchanged fire at close range. From the Redoubt of d'Eu and Fontenoy the French cannon poured tremendous flanking fire. Whole allied ranks were swept away, but still they pressed forward in perfect order as if on parade, the better to foster cohesion and the better to overawe their opponents. Saxe had <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> that the allies would conceive or execute such a manoeuvre, and here was the one weak spot of his defence – a third redoubt between Fontenoy and the Redoubt of Eu would have rendered the allied advance impossible.|$|E
