5|$|Winckel {{was born}} on 3 November 1912 in Muntok, Bangka Island, {{in what was then}} the Dutch East Indies. On the island his parents ran a trading store in {{commodities}} such as rubber, tin and sugar. Winckel had an untroubled childhood and at age fifteen was sent back to the Netherlands to study at the <b>nautical</b> <b>school</b> in Delfzijl. He stayed with his grandparents while studying, and three years later became a seaman first class for the merchant marine. He specialised in navigation. In 1931, when he was aged nineteen, Winckel started working as a quartermaster on the freighter Pallau, which sailed between the Netherlands and Java. After his work on the ship he went to the island of Borneo to work on oil rigs. By 1935 he returned to the Netherlands once more, this time to work for the Royal Netherlands Navy as a submarine torpedo calibrator. During his time at the Navy a friend showed him a flyer for a pilot position at the Netherlands East Indies Air Force, which was being formed at the time. Winckel joined the Air Force in 1935 and became a pilot at age 23. Between 1935 and 1942 he flew transports across the Dutch East Indies, mainly in Lockheed Lodestars.|$|E

5|$|Many former Austro-Hungarian naval {{personnel}} {{were incorporated into}} the new navy, 90 per cent of whom were of Croatian or Slovene ethnicity. The remainder were Serbs, or non-Slavs such as Germans. Their former ranks were recognised and, initially at least, rank insignia and regulations were adopted from the former Austro-Hungarian Navy. By 1922, the KJRM consisted of 124 officers and about 3,000 men. The number of officers had more than halved {{since the end of}} 1919, largely due to disillusionment. To fill the looming shortfall, around 20 graduates from each of the 1921 and 1922 classes of the Yugoslav Military Academy in Belgrade were sent to the KJRM. In 1923, the new Naval Academy at Gruž accepted its first class of 40 midshipmen, who were to undergo a three-year training course. All entrants to the Naval Academy had to be between 17 and 20 years of age, and graduates of high school or similar <b>nautical</b> <b>school.</b> Two specialist schools for petty officers were established, one at Šibenik for deck crew, and a machinist's school at Kumbor in the Bay of Kotor. Mine and torpedo training was conducted at Đenovići, as was pilot and air observer training. A gunnery school was established at Meljine in the Bay of Kotor. Šibenik was also the home of the main coastal radio station, the signals school and the basic and specialist training school for seamen.|$|E

The courses are addressed in particular to those students who would like to take up a marine career as officers, engineers or other crew members of the Merchant Navy, and thus require an adequate knowledge of seafaring terminology, but can also be interesting for those wishing to explore the origins and development of maritime language. In order to provide a more challenging environment and better opportunity for the learning of seafaring terms and expressions in English, students are supported by Mariterm, a lexical database, organized in semantic relations, available at the Institute for Computational Linguistics (ILC) of the National Research Council (CNR) in Pisa. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Pennsylvania <b>Nautical</b> <b>School’s</b> {{course of}} {{training}} was two years, {{at the end of}} which time cadets graduated as Third Officers and were eligible for an officer’s position aboard any American merchant Ship. PNS cadets studied navigation, theoretical and practical marine engineering, and seamanship, were taught by Navy Officers, and received their training aboard a schoolship, a retired naval ship which was repurposed as a training ship. [...] Coursework was divided into port and sea terms. The schoolship was typically anchored at the port of Philadelphia during port terms and cadets could apply for permission for a leave of absence during the weekends. The sea terms were spent in cruise in foreign or home waters. During sea terms, the schoolship sailed to ports in the United States, Europe, South America and the West Indies. The ship stayed a short time in each of the ports visited so that the cadets could go on shore and see the countries and their people. During the sea terms, cadets devoted most of their time to practical work such as steering, heaving the lead, and handling boats under oars and sail. Athletics also played an important part in the curriculum. Cadets formed baseball, football, swimming, boxing, and track teams. Team uniforms and gear were provided by the school.|$|R
25|$|The Pennsylvania Schoolship Association (PSA) was {{established}} in 1955 {{with the purpose of}} maintaining contact with shipmates and to preserve the history of the Pennsylvania <b>Nautical</b> <b>School.</b> The PSA held memorial services and organized annual musters until 2014. The PSA published the alumni newsletter The Lookout (1956-2015). The Lookout was written and edited for many years by Class of 1930 graduate Captain Ray Eisenberg, and served as an official news vehicle for the PSA. It featured alumni profiles, articles related to the merchant marine, and reports of association meetings. The PSA also published the Chronicle, a booklet containing alumni information, as well as, articles related to history of the PNS/PMA.|$|E
25|$|Born in Grimsby, England to {{a family}} of fishermen, Hills grew up sailing the bleak and {{turbulent}} North Sea. In 1940 he enrolled as a cadet in <b>nautical</b> <b>school</b> and joined the British Merchant Navy during World War II. At sea, Hills had several life and death experiences that formed his views on karma, divinity and destiny. On one occasion a rogue wave swept him off the deck hundreds of yards (metres) away from the vessel, but another wave picked him up and threw him back onto the ship, cutting open his forehead but saving him from freezing to death. As German U-boats sank 2,828 merchant ships, he watched tanker crew colleagues incinerated in the flaming oil-slicked Atlantic. At {{the end of the}} war, as navigating officer for an Esso oil tanker, Hills found himself docked in Curaçao, where he set up shop as a commodities trader with branch offices in Venezuela and Aruba.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 {{at least}} five hundred {{teachers}} (365 males and 165 females) arrived from the U.S. aboard the USS Thomas. The name Thomasite was adopted for these teachers, who firmly established education as one of America's major contributions to the Philippines. Among the assignments given were Albay, Catanduanes, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, and Masbate. Twenty-seven of the original Thomasites either died of tropical diseases or were murdered by Filipino rebels during their first 20 months of residence. Despite the hardships, the Thomasites persisted, teaching and building learning institutions that prepared students for their chosen professions or trades. They opened the Philippine Normal School (now Philippine Normal University) and the Philippine School of Arts and Trades (PSAT) in 1901 and reopened the Philippine <b>Nautical</b> <b>School,</b> established in 1839 by the Board of Commerce of Manila under Spain. By the end of 1904, primary courses were mostly taught by Filipinos under American supervision.|$|E

Soon, the Boston Police, Red Cross, Army, and other Navy personnel arrived. Some nurses from the Red Cross dove into the molasses, while others tended to the injured, keeping them warm and keeping the exhausted workers fed. Many of these people worked through the night. The injured were so numerous that doctors and surgeons set up a makeshift hospital in a nearby building. Rescuers found it difficult to make their way through the syrup to help the victims. Four days elapsed before they stopped searching for victims; many of the dead were so glazed over in molasses, they were hard to recognize.|$|E

50|$|Founded in 1982, Sindel {{began its}} {{activities}} developing simulation {{systems for the}} training of radar operators creating electronic equipment that could simulate a real nautical environment.The Company has placed itself from the earliest years in a niche of the simulator market, which was then characterized by large companies that manufactured optical-mechanical systems run by large and expensive mainframes; Sindel products, however, were based on specific software installed on standard commercial computers. These simulators are better suited to <b>nautical</b> <b>schools,</b> and other institutions with smaller budget than larger organizations like military academies, or radar institutes.Since the beginning the company has collaborated with the Guglielmo Marconi Radar Institute of Genoa which has provided Sindel of the essential know-how, to develop a valid training system for radar operators. The functionality of that system has gradually evolved to ensure the adequate stimulation of radars with ARPA capability, depth sounders and government systems such as the rudder and the engine-room telegraph.Over the years, following the evolution of real systems installed on board, naval simulators have become rich, complex systems with many components such as ECDIS electronic navigational charts, AIS navigation radio helpers, and GMDSS communications systems.From 2002 to 2006 the company developed the ASWTT, an integrated anti-submarine combat simulator for the South Korean Navy.In 2006 the Sindel brand was acquired by the ECA SA group of Toulon, along with some Italian private investors, and since then operates under the extended name of ECA Sindel. The acquisition by the ECA group, active in the marine robotics field, has expanded the application areas of the simulation systems, including now simulators for underwater robots such ROV and AUV, and logical guidance for radio-controlled surface crafts (USV, Unmanned Surface Vehicle).|$|R
500|$|Belgrano {{maintained}} frequent {{discussions with}} the committee members of the Consulate, who were all merchants with strong interests involved in the monopolic commerce with Cadiz. He made many proposals, influenced by free trade ideas. By this time, Belgrano thought that [...] "The merchant must have freedom to buy where he can be best accommodated, and it's natural that he does where {{he is supplied with}} the best price to be able to earn the best profit". Those proposals were rejected by the committee members; his only supporters were Juan José Castelli, Juan Larrea, and Domingo Matheu. However, Belgrano had some successes, such as creating the <b>Nautical</b> <b>School,</b> the Commerce School, and the Geometry and Drawing Academy. He created the Commerce School to influence future merchants to work towards {{the best interests of the}} nation, and the nautical and drawing ones to provide the youth with prestigious and lucrative careers. The schools were situated next to the Consulate so that Belgrano could easily supervise their development. The schools were in place for three years before they were closed by a ruling of Manuel Godoy, from the Spanish monarchy, who considered them an unnecessary luxury for a colony. It was felt that Buenos Aires might not be able to maintain them.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an effort}} to meet the nation’s demand for trained seamen, the United States Congress passed an Act on June 20, 1874 giving the Secretary of the Navy the {{authority}} to provide a naval vessel and instructors for a <b>nautical</b> <b>school</b> to be established at each {{or any of the}} ports of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk, and San Francisco. [...] To that end, the Pennsylvania <b>Nautical</b> <b>School</b> (PNS) was established in 1889 by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and for 58 years trained young men for careers in the maritime trades and professions. PNS cadets were taught aboard five different schoolships: [...] USS Saratoga (1889-1907); USS Adams (1907-1914); USS Annapolis (1919-1942); USS Keystone State, ex USCG Seneca (1942-1946); and USS Keystone State II, ex USS Selinur (1946-1947).
