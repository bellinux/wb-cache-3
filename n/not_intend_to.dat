5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department did <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E

5|$|The Abbasid {{invasion}} of Asia Minor in 782 {{was one of}} the largest operations launched by the Abbasid Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire.

Commanded by the Abbasid heir-apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid, the Abbasid army reached as far as Chrysopolis, across the Bosporus from the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, while secondary forces raided western Asia Minor and defeated the Byzantine forces there.

The Allied forces did <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> conquer the entire island, however, and the invasion area was selected {{on the grounds that it}} was lightly defended and distant from the main Japanese bases at the northern and southern ends of Bougainville.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{responded by}} {{launching}} a major offensive in eastern Slavonia, {{from where it}} intended to progress west via Vinkovci and Osijek to Zagreb.

The JNA leadership did <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> make Vukovar {{the main focus of}} the offensive but, as happened with Stalingrad in the Second World War, an initially inconsequential engagement became an essential political symbol for both sides.|$|E
