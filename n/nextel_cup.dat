5|$|The 2006 UAW-Ford 500 was a {{stock car}} racing {{competition}} {{that took place}} on October 8, 2006. The 38th annual running of the UAW-Ford 500, it was held at Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega, Alabama, before 160,000 spectators; the 188-lap race was the thirtieth in the 2006 NASCAR <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series and the fourth in the ten-race, season-ending Chase for the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup.</b> Brian Vickers of Hendrick Motorsports won the race; Kasey Kahne finished second, and Kurt Busch came in third.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Bank of America 500 was the 31st {{stock car}} {{race of the}} 2006 NASCAR <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series and the fifth in the ten-race season-ending Chase for the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup.</b> It was held on October 14, 2006, before a crowd of 175,000 in Concord, North Carolina, at Lowe's Motor Speedway, one of ten {{intermediate}} tracks to hold NASCAR races. The 334-lap race was won by Kasey Kahne of the Evernham Motorsports team, who started from second position. Jimmie Johnson finished second and Jeff Burton came in third.|$|E
5|$|The Bank of America 500 was the 31st of 36 {{scheduled}} {{stock car}} races of the 2006 NASCAR <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series, {{and the fifth}} in the ten-race season-ending Chase for the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup.</b> It was held on October 14, 2006, in Concord, North Carolina, at Lowe's Motor Speedway (now called Charlotte Motor Speedway), one of ten intermediate tracks to hold NASCAR races; the others are Atlanta Motor Speedway, Kansas Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway, Darlington Raceway, Homestead-Miami Speedway, New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Kentucky Speedway, Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and Texas Motor Speedway. The standard track at Lowe's Motor Speedway is a four-turn, -long, quad-oval track. The track's turns are banked at twenty-four degrees; both the front stretch (the location of the finish line) and the back stretch (opposite the front) have a five-degree banking.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the season}} Hornish drove in the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series for Penske Racing South in its No. 06 Dodge Charger, failing to qualify for his first six races. He {{qualified}} for the Checker Auto Parts 500 at Phoenix, starting in 26th place and finishing 30th (two laps behind). Hornish also qualified for the following race at Homestead-Miami, starting in 29th place. After crashing in turn three of lap 194 he finished 37th, thirteen laps behind.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the race}} Jeff Burton led the Drivers' Championship with 5,511 points, with Denny Hamlin second and Mark Martin third. Matt Kenseth and Kevin Harvick rounded {{out the top}} five and Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Busch and Kasey Kahne rounded out the top ten drivers {{competing}} in the 2006 Chase for the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup.</b> In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet led with 222 points; Ford was second with 175, and Dodge was a close third with 174 points. Dale Jarrett was the race's defending champion.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{collaborated with}} other {{companies}} to produce Halo-themed merchandise and promotions at retailers and vendors. PepsiCo created {{a variant of}} Mountain Dew called Game Fuel. 7-Eleven sold a Slurpee version of the drink. Burger King announced a special promotion starting September 24, 2007 featuring Halo designs and characters on food wrappings. Microsoft sponsored the #40 car driven by David Stremme for Chip Ganassi Racing in the Dover 400 <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series. The racecar featured a Halo 3 inspired paintjob featuring the title for the game printed prominently on the hood and rear bumper, as well as large pictures of Master Chief {{on each of the}} rear fenders.|$|E
5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. Martin {{said he was in}} the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E
5|$|Hornish {{moved to}} Penske's NASCAR program {{part-time}} in the Xfinity Series (then {{known as the}} Busch Series) during the 2006 season, and began driving part-time in the Sprint Cup Series (then known as the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series) in 2007. He raced full-time in the Sprint Cup Series the following year, struggling at first, with eight top-ten finishes over his first three seasons and a top points placing of 28th (in 2009). Hornish returned part-time to the Xfinity Series (then known as the Nationwide Series) in 2011, winning one race. He drove full-time in the series the following year, finishing fourth in points. In 2012 Hornish replaced A. J. Allmendinger (suspended by NASCAR for failing a drug test) in Penske's No. 22 car midway through the season, earning one top-five finish. The following year {{he returned to the}} Nationwide Series, winning one race and earning 16 top-five and 24 top-ten finishes to place second in points (three behind series champion Austin Dillon). Hornish drove part-time for Joe Gibbs Racing in an eight-race 2014 season, with one win and four top-five finishes. He returned to the Cup Series in 2015 with Richard Petty Motorsports, scoring three top-tens and finishing 26th in points. He returned part-time to the Xfinity Series in 2016, winning a race for JGR and finishing sixth or better in all three races he entered for Richard Childress Racing. In 2017, he returned to Penske's Xfinity program for a three-race schedule in the No. 22.|$|E
5|$|Although 52 {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only 43 could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Riggs clinched the third pole position of his career, and his third consecutive at Lowe's Motor Speedway, {{with a time of}} 28.203 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kahne, his Evernham Motorsports teammate, and held the pole position until Riggs' lap. Kurt Busch originally qualified in third, but his car's right-rear shock absorber was found to have violated NASCAR regulations during the post-qualifying inspection because it did not bounce back. Busch was required to start from 42nd position after using a provisional. As a result, Casey Mears inherited third, Sadler fourth, and Harvick fifth. Burton, Martin, Clint Bowyer, Reed Sorenson and Johnson rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Kenseth, a Chase for the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> driver, qualified eleventh, while Earnhardt took 16th and Kyle Busch 18th. The nine drivers who failed to qualify were Elliott, Kevin Lepage, Derrike Cope, Chad Chaffin, Hermie Sadler, Kirk Shelmerdine, Kenny Wallace (who crashed on his first timed lap), Morgan Shepherd (who elected not to set a lap time), and Carl Long (who crashed while attempting to record a timed lap). After the qualifier Riggs said that his team knew his car was good, and achieved a good draw by recording his lap time {{in the latter half of}} the session. He stated when returning to the track, his team wanted to get back into a rhythm of starting and finishing in a top position.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, he {{was signed}} to move up to the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series to drive the No. 41 Target-sponsored car full-time. He made his <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> debut in the 2005 Bass Pro Shops MBNA 500, racing as No. 39, but was {{involved}} in a crash and finished 41st. After a failed attempt to qualify for the Dickies 500, he ran in the Ford 400 for Phoenix Racing, where he finished the race in 28th.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 2006, it was {{announced}} that Elliott would drive the No. 00 Burger King Chevrolet for Michael Waltrip Racing in five <b>NEXTEL</b> <b>Cup</b> events which included Chicagoland, New Hampshire, Indianapolis, California, and Homestead.|$|E
25|$|On May 19, 2007, the AT logo {{replaced}} the Cingular logo on the NASCAR <b>NEXTEL</b> <b>Cup</b> Series car it sponsors, owned by Richard Childress Racing and driven by Jeff Burton; however, {{it was soon}} removed.|$|E
25|$|Kvapil competed against fellow Wisconsin native Matt Kenseth at Madison International Speedway. Kvapil, like Kenseth, {{is an avid}} Green Bay Packers fan. During the 2006 NASCAR <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> season, Kvapil and his No. 32 Tide from PPI Motorsports {{appeared}} on an episode of Guiding Light.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Red Bull {{announced}} {{they would be}} sponsoring the NASCAR Red Bull Racing Team. They debuted in the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series, {{now known as the}} Sprint Cup Series, at Lowe's Motor Speedway. The team was shut down in December 2011 and its assets acquired by BK Racing.|$|E
25|$|Until 2007, he competed {{full-time}} in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, {{being at}} the time the only African-American competing full-time in a NASCAR circuit. He also participated in a number of <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series races. From 2008â€“2010, he competed in the Daytona Prototype category in the Rolex Sports Car Series.|$|E
25|$|Burrton won the Samsung 500 (Texas) on April 15, 2007, {{driving the}} Prilosec OTC-sponsored Chevrolet, passing Matt Kenseth {{on the final}} lap, making him the first driver with {{multiple}} wins at Texas Motor Speedway. He later went on {{to qualify for the}} Chase for the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup,</b> he finished tied for 7th in the 2007 standings.|$|E
25|$|Earnhardt {{was able}} {{to qualify for the}} NASCAR 10-race playoff, and had his 5th <b>NEXTEL</b> <b>Cup</b> win of the season (a career high) at Talladega. However, he was penalized 25 points for use of an {{obscenity}} during the television broadcast, in violation of a new NASCAR rule prohibiting participants from using obscene language (the rule had been created the week after the Daytona 500, {{in the wake of the}} Super Bowl half-time show controversy). That incident, combined with two consecutive DNF's in the Chase, eventually dropped him out of the running, and he finished fifth in the 2004 <b>NEXTEL</b> <b>Cup</b> Chase despite a career-high 6 wins at Daytona, Atlanta, Richmond, Bristol, Talladega and defending his fall win at Phoenix (though under the non-Chase points system, Earnhardt would have tied his third-place points finish of the previous year). He closed off the 2004 season with 6 wins, sixteen Top 5s, and twenty-one Top 10 finishes. He also picked up his 2nd consecutive Most Popular Driver Award.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Reffner {{made two}} starts for Smith Bros. Racing, {{but failed to}} finish higher than 35th. He also made a failed attempt at {{qualifying}} for the <b>NEXTEL</b> <b>Cup</b> Phoenix race with Competitive Edge Motorsports. He also was leading the points in the American Stockcar League series going into the final 3 races of 2005 and was declared the ASL Champion when the final races were canceled.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 2004 season, Kvapil {{made his}} first <b>NEXTEL</b> <b>Cup</b> Series start at Martinsville Speedway. Kvapil drove the No. 06 Mobil 1-sponsored Dodge, the fourth car on the track from Penske Racing. He made three {{additional}} starts in the No. 06 in preparation for driving Penske Racing's No. 77 in 2005. In 2005, Kvapil took over the Penske's No. 77 Kodak-sponsored Dodge full-time, replacing Brendan Gaughan.|$|E
25|$|This {{race was}} held June 17 at Kentucky Speedway. Denny Hamlin won the pole. In a {{stunning}} upset, David Gilliland {{became the first}} winner in the 2006 season that was not on a team with a <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> driver. Jeff Fuller {{was involved in a}} severe crash where, trying to avoid the spinning car of Jason Leffler, Fuller hit the inside wall at full speed, and the car practically imploded on impact. Fuller suffered a broken wrist and thumb.|$|E
25|$|Gilliland {{made his}} first attempt to make a Cup race at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California, in the No. 72 CJM Racing Chevrolet, {{qualifying}} 31st, and finishing 32nd. In August 2006, Gilliland replaced Elliott Sadler as {{the driver of the}} M Ford in the <b>NEXTEL</b> <b>Cup</b> Series. In qualifying for the 2007 Aaron's 499 on April 28, Gilliland recorded a speed of , which was identical to Jeff Gordon for the pole position. As Gordon had the points lead {{at the time of the}} race, Gilliland started the race in second, giving the pole to Gordon. On October 7, he qualified on the pole for the UAW Ford 500 at Talladega Superspeedway, the first pole of his career. He won his second career pole at the Daytona 500, his first points-paying race at the track, and finished 28th in <b>NEXTEL</b> <b>Cup</b> points. Gilliland drove part-time in the Busch Series for Team Rensi Motorsports with a sponsorship from FreeCreditReport.com in 2007, splitting the driving duties at Rensi with rookie Richard Johns. His best finish was a tenth at Daytona. In 2008, FreeCreditReport became his Cup sponsor and he had two top-ten finishes.|$|E
25|$|On June 12, 2005, Edwards {{picked up}} his second <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> win by taking the {{checkered}} flag at the Pocono 500 at the Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania. The weekend was somewhat bittersweet for Edwards, as the Busch Series race at the Nashville Superspeedway in Lebanon, Tennessee had been rained out the night before, and rescheduled for the same day. Also, qualifying for that race had been rained out, and in NASCAR, when qualifying is rained out, the starting grid is set by owner points. Through this process, Edwards was awarded pole, but Hank Parker, Jr. ended up driving the car to a 20th-place finish. Since Edwards did not start the race he was not awarded any points, and as such lost a 74-point lead in Busch Series points and dropped to fourth in the standings; Edwards never recovered from the missed race and finished the season third in points, well behind series champion Martin Truex, Jr.. Edwards got his third win of 2005 on October 30 in the Bass Pro Shops MBNA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, sweeping both of the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> races at Atlanta for the 2005 season.|$|E
25|$|On June 6, 2007, Edwards won the 2007 Nextel Prelude to the Dream at the Eldora Speedway. The Prelude is a dirt late model race {{organized}} {{in part by}} Tony Stewart, owner of Eldora, to benefit the Victory Junction Gang Camp and other worthy causes. Over 20 <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> drivers participated in the heat races and 30-lap feature, along with other drivers from different forms of motorsports. Edwards started second in the feature and held off Kyle Busch and Jeff Gordon to win.|$|E
25|$|Edwards' {{big break}} came in 2002, when he competed in 7 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series events for MB Motorsports. His best {{finish in the}} seven races was 8th at Kansas Speedway. He also ran one Busch Series race for Bost Motorsports, {{finishing}} 38th at Gateway International Raceway. However, {{it was enough to}} impress Jack Roush, and Edwards became a full-time Truck Series competitor for Roush Racing in 2003, driving the No. 99 Ford F-150, and won his first race at Kentucky. He won Rookie-of-the-Year honors in addition, to three race wins, eventually finishing 8th in the points standings {{at the end of the}} season. In 2004, he notched three more race wins, including the season-opening Florida Dodge Dealers 250 at the Daytona International Speedway. At season's end, Edwards finished 4th in the points. In August 2004, he made his <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series debut, replacing Jeff Burton, who left the team, in the No. 99 Ford Taurus for Roush Racing, at the Michigan International Speedway. He finished 10th. He drove the No. 99 Ford for the remainder of the 2004 <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup.</b> He also once again ran one Busch Series race; this time for Bobby Benton's RAB Racing team at Bristol Motor Speedway.|$|E
25|$|During the NASCAR weekend {{races at}} Talladega Superspeedway on April 29, 2006â€“ May 1, 2006, the DEI cars competed in {{identical}} special black paint schemes on Dale Earnhardt Day, which is held annually on his birthdayâ€”April 29. Martin Truex Jr., won the Aaron's 312 {{in the black}} car, painted to reflect Earnhardt's Intimidating Black No. 3 NASCAR Busch Grand National series car. In the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> race on May 1, No. 8 Dale Earnhardt Jr.; No. 1 Martin Truex Jr.; and No. 15 Paul Menard competed in cars with {{the same type of}} paint scheme.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Kenseth won the International Race of Champions (IROC) championship. He {{qualified}} for the inaugural <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup,</b> finished 8th in the final NASCAR point standings. Kenseth finished with two wins, those coming back-to-back {{early in the year}} at Rockingham and Las Vegas. His win in the Subway 400 at Rockingham was a photo finish with eventual Raybestos Rookie of the Year Kasey Kahne. He also won the All-Star Race. Began the 10-race Chase in 5th place and finished 8th, and is of only four drivers to be ranked in the Top 10 all season.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 2006, Michael Waltrip and {{president}} of Jasper Motorsports, Doug Bawel, announced the forming of Waltrip-Jasper Racing. Waltrip-Jasper Racing fielded the No. 55 NAPA Auto Parts Car in the 2006 <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Series, driven by Waltrip. Bawel, as the listed owner of the No. 77 that he fielded with Roger Penske in 2005, had a guaranteed starting spot {{in the first five}} races of 2006 by virtue of finishing 34th in the 2005 owner points. This enabled Waltrip to make the first five races in 2006 without qualifying on time.|$|E
25|$|What {{is now the}} No. 33 car {{started as}} the No. 90 car in 2003. RCR entered the No. 90 Chevrolet in the fall Talladega race with John Andretti driving. The car was {{sponsored}} by AOL 9.0 and was numbered 90 for marketing purposes. Ron Hornaday, Jr. ran the No. 90 in the season-ending Ford 400 with Childress Vineyards on the hood. In 2004, {{it was announced that}} Kerry Earnhardt would drive the car (renumbered to 33) in five NASCAR <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> races. Mike Skinner would run the car in the Daytona 500, finishing 22nd. Earnhardt drove the car in the other three restrictor plate races with Bass Pro Shops sponsoring, getting his best finish of 24th. He attempted all of the restrictor plate races again in 2005, finishing 17th at Talladega. In addition, road course ringer Brian Simo brought home a 10th-place finish at Infineon Raceway. Clint Bowyer (Childress' Busch Series driver) made his <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> debut in this car with a Sylvania sponsorship at Phoenix in April 2005. Scott Wimmer ran the season finale in 2005, attempted two races in 2006 (making one start), and only made one start out of seven attempts in 2007. On May 2, 2008, Wimmer attempted but failed to qualify for the 2008 Crown Royal presents the Dan Lowry 400 at Richmond. Wimmer had sponsorships from Holiday Inn and Camping World/RVs.com. Ken Schrader and Mike Wallace ran one race apice in 2008.|$|E
25|$|David Reutimann {{was tapped}} {{to drive the}} No. 00 Toyota Camry in 2007, with {{full-time}} primary sponsorships from Burger King and Dominos Pizza. He competed for the Rookie of the Year title {{as well as the}} <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> championship. However, the team struggled to qualify for races, as did other Toyota teams, making only 26 of 36 races in the season. Reutimann experienced one of the hardest crashes ever recorded at the 2007 Auto Club 500 at California Speedway. Because of the struggles, the team finished 39th in points and had a best finish of 13th. Sponsors Burger King and Dominos then pulled their sponsorship for 2008.|$|E
25|$|Jarrett {{started the}} 2007 NASCAR <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> season {{on a high}} note as he drew pole {{position}} for the annual exhibition race, the Budweiser Shootout, at the Daytona International Speedway. He finished 18th out of 21 cars. Since Jarrett's team was a brand new team and had no owner points, and due to a rule change, he was eligible to use the Past Champion's Provisional five times as his 1999 championship was the most recent among past champions who were driving for teams not in the top 35 in owner points; prior to the rule change {{the use of a}} Past Champion's Provisional was not limited.|$|E
25|$|Cingular Wireless {{began its}} {{sponsorship}} of the #31 Chevrolet, owned by Richard Childress Racing, in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series in 2002. Two years later, when Nextel Communications (now Sprint Corporation) purchased the naming rights to NASCAR's top division (rebranding the division as the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup,</b> and later the Sprint Cup), Cingular and Alltel, sponsor of the #12 Dodge (owned by Penske Racing and driven by Ryan Newman), were allowed to stay as sponsors under a grandfather clause. In early 2007, following its purchase by AT, Cingular began a re-branding effort to the AT Mobility brand. NASCAR quickly claimed that a clause in their contract with Sprint Nextel would not allow Cingular to change either the name or brand advertised on the #31 car.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the year, though, Evernham made a change. He signed Jeremy Mayfield, who had {{recorded}} three wins for Penske Racing but who had been fired in September 2001 and had not run since, to join Elliott and drive the No. 19. As part of the move, Evernham agreed to the aforementioned deal with Ultra Motorsports which gave Atwood a car to drive. Mayfield struggled in his initial year with Evernham, posting just four top tens and finishing 26th in points. He won a pole at Talladega Superspeedway the next year however, and improved to 19th in points. 2004 was even better, winning at Richmond and barely making the cut for the inaugural Chase for the <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup.</b> He claimed one more win in 2005 and qualified once again for the Chase.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Busch {{won three}} races, two poles, and the inaugural NASCAR <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> Championship. He won his fourth {{consecutive}} race at Bristol {{after winning the}} Food City 500 in March (winning that race {{for the third consecutive}} year), and became the second driver to win both races at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in a single season. He scored ten Top 5's and 21 Top 10 finishes. Midway through the 2005 season, Busch announced that he would be leaving Roush Racing {{at the end of the}} season and would replace Rusty Wallace in the No. 2 Dodge for Penske Racing South. Initially, Roush was unhappy with Busch's decision to leave his team but when Chip Ganassi Racing announced that Jamie McMurray wanted to join Roush Racing in 2006, Roush agreed to let Busch go.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his 16 race schedule in the 01 shared with Mark Martin, Regan Smith was set to make his <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> debut at the 2007 Daytona 500 in a fourth Ginn Racing car, with Ginn Resorts sponsoring. The car was numbered 39 due to the 36 being taken by Bill Davis Racing and Jeremy Mayfield. In his debut, Smith qualified 26th, which earned him a 12th starting position in the 2nd Gatorade 150 duel race. He finished 19th of 30 cars, and seventh out of the 13 drivers who needed to race {{their way into the}} 500, which was not enough to get him into the race. The No. 39 was on the Fontana entry list the next week, but was withdrawn. Smith would make his Cup debut in the 01 at Bristol Motor Speedway.|$|E
25|$|The No. 44 debuted as the No. 9 in the 2001 Daytona 500 with Dodge's {{return to}} NASCAR. After half a decade {{as a driver}} and owner, 1988 Winston Cup Series {{champion}} Bill Elliott joined Evernham as a driver and re-assumed the No. 9 that he drove with Melling Racing. Elliott won the pole for the Daytona 500 and finished fifth. He marked the season with his first win in seven years at Homestead-Miami Speedway and finished 15th in points. Elliott would score two wins and finish 13th in points in 2002. He scored his final career win at North Carolina in fall 2003. After a ninth-place finish in the points that season, Elliott announced that due to the pressures of a full <b>Nextel</b> <b>Cup</b> schedule, he would step down from his full-time ride and would race the team's research and development car.|$|E
