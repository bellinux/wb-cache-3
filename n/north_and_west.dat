5|$|Waller {{was also}} {{involved}} in matters related the local railroads. On October 3, 1877, he sold some of his land in Bloomsburg to the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{for the purpose of}} a new railroad station.

He started raising money for this railroad in 1872 and broke the ground for the railroad in March 1872. Waller put most of his money into the building of the <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> Branch Railway. The work on the railroad stopped during the Panic of 1873 but resumed in 1880. The <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> Branch Railway Company was sold in 1881 but he managed to regain much of the company. The company was leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad on November 23, 1881, but remained its own company for approximately 20 years. He was president of the <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> Branch Railway in the 1880s. In 1888, he sold a piece of land to the town of Bloomsburg for the purpose of building the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad through it.

Waller also successfully convinced the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad to move its Bloomsburg station to his land on Market Street.|$|E
