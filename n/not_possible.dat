5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E

5|$|The Stalinist {{occupation}} of Eastern Europe {{was the issue}} of prime concern, and it raised many problems of interpretation.

5|$|A Free Ride {{was first}} shown to its target {{audience}} in 1915.

Like other pornographic films of that era, A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government.|$|E

5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, it is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and {{the relationship between the two}} physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E
5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} when it is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy plants is <b>not</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E
