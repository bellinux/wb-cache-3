2500|$|In 2008, the Perm Krai ombudswoman Tatyana Margolina {{reported}} that 14 women with disabilities {{were subjected to}} compulsory medical sterilization in the Ozyorskiy psychoneurological nursing home whose director was Grigory Bannikov. The sterilizations were performed {{not on the basis}} of a mandatory court decision appropriate for them, but only on the basis of the application by the guardian Bannikov. On 2 December 2010, the court did not find corpus delicti in the compulsory medical sterilizations performed by his consent. The order by the health minister of the Russian Federation that was issued in 1993 and neatly determined the procedure of forced abortion and sterilization of women with disabilities was repealed by the head of Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation Tatyana Golikova in 2009. Therefore, now women can be subjected to compulsory sterilization without court decision, according to Tatyana Margolina, which may place some types of people within their <b>nation</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> In Russia, one of the supporters of preventive eugenics is the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia Yuri Savenko, who justifies forced sterilization of women, which is practiced in Moscow psychoneurological nursing homes, and states that “one needs a more strictly adjusted and open control for the practice of preventive eugenics, which, in itself, is, in its turn, justifiable.” ...|$|E

50|$|The {{assessment}} of risk factors for genocide is an upstream prevention mechanism for genocide. This means that, if used correctly, the international community {{would be able to}} foresee a genocide before the killing took place, and prevent it. Countries can have many warning signs that it may be leaning {{in the direction of a}} future genocide. If signs are presented the international community takes notes of them and watches over the countries that have a higher risk. Many different scholars, and international groups, have come up with different factors that they think should be considered while examining whether a <b>nation</b> is <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> or not. One predominant scholar in the field James Waller came up with his own four categories of risk factors; including, governance, conflict history, economic conditions, and social fragmentation.|$|R

In 1829, the Spanish attempted to reconquer their former colony and Antonio López de Santa Anna became a national hero defending the homeland.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the association between violent conflict and HIV incidence within and across 36 sub-Saharan Africa countries between 1990 and 2012. We used generalized linear mixed effect modeling to estimate the effect of conflict periods on country-level HIV incidence. We specified random intercepts and slopes to account for across and within country variation over time. We also conducted a sub-analysis of countries who experienced conflict to assess the effect of conflict intensity on country-level HIV incidence. All models controlled for level of economic development, number of refugees present in the country, and year. We found that, compared to times of peace, the HIV incidence rate increased by 2. 1 per 1000 infections per year (95 %CI: 0. 39, 3. 87) in the 5 years prior to conflict. Additionally, we found a decrease of 0. 7 new infections per 1000 people per year (95 %CI: - 1. 44, - 0. 01) in conflicts with 25 to 1000 battle-related deaths and a decrease of 1. 5 new infections per 1000 people per year (95 %CI:- 2. 50, - 0. 52) for conflict with more than 1000 battle-related deaths, compared to conflicts with less than 25 battle-related deaths. Our results demonstrate that HIV infection rates increase in the years immediately prior to times of conflict; however, we did not identify a significant increase during and immediately following periods of violent conflict. Further investigation, including more rigorous data collection, is needed, as is increased aid to <b>nations</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of violent conflict to help in the fight against HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R
