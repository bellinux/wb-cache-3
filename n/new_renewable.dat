5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lower the current {{consumer}} tariff for electricity, the government {{has decided not to}} renew the power purchase agreements of privately owned thermal power stations when their licences expire, as it has done with the six now-decommissioned private power producers listed below.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the large dams prominent in Soviet times largely ended in the 1990s {{with the creation of}} the Russian Federation. In addition, due to the post-Soviet recession, much of the country's infrastructure, including dams, fell into disrepair. Use of oil and gas for energy took priority in Russia and renewable energy was ignored. This policy lasted until 2008, when Medvedev announced reforms to Russia's energy policies in an attempt to focus more on renewable energy. Since then, there has been rapid development of <b>new</b> <b>renewable</b> energy sources.|$|E

25|$|Several {{reports have}} {{discussed}} the possibility of Australia setting a renewable energy target of 25% by 2020. Combined with some basic energy efficiency measures, such a target could deliver 15,000MW <b>new</b> <b>renewable</b> power capacity, $33billion in new investment, 16,600 new jobs, and 69million tonnes reduction in electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
25|$|The OPA has {{subsequently}} published preliminary {{plans for}} a complete coal phase-out by 2014, to begin in 2011.

Thunder Bay Generating Station, the last coal-fired electricity plant in Ontario was shut down in April 2014, completing the phase-out.

25|$|Limitations such as {{the ones}} above present an {{important}} legal vacuum for renewable energy in Colombia. While {{there have been a few}} initiatives concerning efficient and rational use of energy (design of the Colombian program of normalization, accreditation, certification and labeling of final use of energy equipment, and promotion of carburant mixture for vehicle use and massive use of natural gas), there have been no recent initiatives related to <b>new</b> <b>renewable</b> energy technologies.|$|E
25|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Colombia {{is dominated by}} large hydropower generation (65%) and thermal generation (35%). Despite the country’s large potential in <b>new</b> <b>renewable</b> energy technologies (mainly wind, solar and biomass), this potential has been barely tapped. A 2001 law designed to promote alternative energies lacks certain key provisions to achieve this objective, such as feed-in tariffs, and has had little impact so far. Large hydropower and thermal plants dominate the current expansion plans. The construction of a transmission line with Panama, which will link Colombia with Central America, is underway.|$|E
25|$|Marine energy (also {{sometimes}} referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term marine energy encompasses both wave powerpower from surface waves, and tidal powerobtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW). Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water. The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of <b>new</b> <b>renewable</b> energy around the world.|$|E

500|$|One {{factor that}} has {{inhibited}} efficient employment of <b>new</b> <b>renewable</b> energy {{has been the}} lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market.
