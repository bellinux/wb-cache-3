25|$|Córdoba was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Naples in 1504. Jealous of him, Ferdinand II of Aragon {{accused him of}} profligately spending the public treasury to reward his captains and soldiers; the 1504 death of Queen Isabel I of Castile deprived him of a protector, and he was recalled in 1507. Although Ferdinand praised Córdoba, he gave him <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> until his death. Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba died on 2 December 1515 at his villa near Granada from malaria at age 62.|$|E
500|$|Boito was overjoyed, and Verdi {{reported}} {{that he was still}} working on the opera. The two men met in October or November 1891, after which the Verdis were in Genoa for the winter. They were both taken ill there, and two months of work were lost. By mid-April 1892 the scoring of the first act was complete and by June–July Verdi was considering potential singers for roles in Falstaff. For the title role he wanted Victor Maurel, the baritone who had sung Iago in Otello, but at first the singer sought contractual terms that Verdi found unacceptable: [...] "His demands were so outrageous, exorbitant, [...] incredible that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but stop the entire project". Eventually they reached agreement and Maurel was cast.|$|E

500|$|Modelling atomic {{behaviour}} under incident {{electromagnetic radiation}} using [...] "virtual oscillators" [...] at the absorption and emission frequencies, {{rather than the}} (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, Werner Heisenberg and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They {{led to the development}} of matrix mechanics, the first form of modern quantum mechanics. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory. The most provocative element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger. In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that [...] "there is <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible".|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{returned}} home early in 1919 {{to a time}} of readjustment. Not yet 20 years old, he had gained from the war a maturity that was at odds with living at home without a job and {{with the need for}} recuperation. As Reynolds explains, [...] "Hemingway could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee. He could not say how scared he was in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in English if his leg was coming off or not." [...] In September, he took a fishing and camping trip with high school friends to the back-country of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The trip became the inspiration for his short story [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", in which the semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war. A family friend offered him a job in Toronto, and with <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> he accepted. Late that year he began as a freelancer, staff writer, and foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star Weekly. He returned to Michigan the following June and then moved to Chicago in September 1920 to live with friends, while still filing stories for the Toronto Star.|$|E
500|$|In May 1670, {{with the}} death of Grand Duke Ferdinando II, Marguerite Louise became Grand Duchess of Tuscany. The old {{tradition}} of admitting the reigning Grand Duke's mother to the Consulta, or Privy Council, was reinstituted at Cosimo III's accession. Loathing Marguerite Louise for her treatment of Cosimo and herself, Vittoria della Rovere, Cosimo III's mother, ensured that Marguerite Louise was denied membership of the Consulta. Being thus effectively excluded from politics, she was left with <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but supervise the education of her son the Grand Prince Ferdinando. The Grand Duchess, furious at her exclusion, fought with Vittoria over precedence and demanded entry to the Consulta. Cosimo III sided with his mother. Presumably yet another reconciliation, however brief, took place in the summer of 1670, of which a sign was the birth of the couple's last child, Gian Gastone on 24 May 1671. However, by early 1671, the fighting between Marguerite Louise and Vittoria became so heated that a contemporary remarked that [...] "the Pitti Palace has become the devil's own abode, and from morn till midnight only the noise of wrangling and abuse can be heard". The birth of Gian Gastone on the first anniversary of his grandfather Ferdinando II's death, gave an occasion for the child to receive the name of his other, maternal grandfather, Gaston, Duke of Orléans, who had died in 1660. He was later to be the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Joshua {{maintained}} that rejoicing on a Festival {{is a religious}} duty. For it was taught in a Baraita: Rabbi Eliezer said: A person has <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> on a Festival aside from either eating and drinking or sitting and studying. Rabbi Joshua said: Divide it: Devote half of the Festival to eating and drinking, and half to the House of Study. Rabbi Johanan said: Both deduce this from the same verse. One verse [...] says, “a solemn assembly to the Lord your God,” while [...] says, “there shall be a solemn assembly to you.” Rabbi Eliezer held that this means either entirely to God or entirely to you. But Rabbi Joshua held: Divide it: Devote half the Festival to God and half to yourself.|$|E

[...] "This isn't a business," [...] one dancer told the Times. [...] "Dancing is free and voluntary, so why does the government need to get involved?" [...] Their disapproval was echoed in some of the country's media. [...] "What the grannies need are venues, not regulated routines," [...] said RedNet, an online news portal. [...] "Only an increase of public sports venues can satisfy urban and rural residents' need for fitness routines such as football and square-dancing, and lessen the phenomenon where square-dancing disturbs residents and takes up all the parks and public spaces." [...] In Shanghai, the Xinmin Evening News pointed out that [...] "The biggest tragedy is not the square dance by grannies, but the fact that grannies have <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than square-dance." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Through some slip-up in the {{apparatus}} in Moscow, {{which was supposed}} to be bureaucratically airtight, this document of Trotsky came into the translating room of the Comintern. It fell into the hopper, where they had a dozen or more translators and stenographers with <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> They picked up Trotsky's document, translated it and distributed it to the heads of the delegations {{and the members of the}} program commission. So, lo and behold, it was laid in my lap, translated into English! Maurice Spector, a delegate from the Canadian Party, and in somewhat the same frame of mind as myself, was also on the program commission and he got a copy. We let the caucus meetings and the Congress sessions go to the devil while we read and studied this document. Then I knew what I had to do and so did he. Our doubts had been resolved... We made a compact there and then — Spector and I — that we would come back home and begin a struggle under the banner of Trotskyism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tibbits Opera House {{continued}} to host {{many of the}} same types of programming as under previous eras of management, while also bringing new variety to the stage as well. Theatre genres included melodramas, pastoral plays, Irish dramas, combination plays, farce and scenic attractions with Charles Hoyt and Clyde Fitch being the most popular playwrights. The farces tended to focus more on comic specialties rather than a developed plot. Regarding one such farce, At the French Ball, a reviewer quipped, [...] "…The play is one of those kind of creations that one enjoys when he has had a good dinner and has <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but to gaze and laugh, and feel as Frenchy as possible." [...] Another feature of comedy in this era is that it increasingly included elements of vaudeville with it becoming increasingly [...] "difficult to distinguish between pure comedy and variety entertainments." [...] Famous melodramas during the period included The Convict's Daughter and Was She to Blame. The number of Uncle Tom's Cabin companies, whose shows had apparently evolved into farce and comedy from the original serious tenor of the story, declined during this period. But taking the place of Uncle Tom's Cabin was the oft repeated Faust, an opera which stressed scenery and electrical effects. The comic opera Wang featured one of the more absurd stunts performed on the Tibbits stage with a beer-drinking elephant that downed a four-gallon glass of brew. All in all, 376 plays were performed on the Tibbits stage in the decade from 1894 to 1904 alone, a large increase from the Barton S. Tibbits era.|$|E
