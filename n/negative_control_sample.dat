40|$|Background: Currently dengue viruses (DENV) pose an {{increasing}} threat to over 2. 5 billion people in over 100 tropical and sub-tropical countries worldwide. International air travel is facilitating rapid global movement of DENV, increasing {{the risk of}} severe dengue epidemics by introducing different serotypes. Accurate diagnosis is critical for early initiation of preventive measures. Different reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) methods are available, which should be evaluated and standardized. Epidemiological and laboratory-based surveillance is required to monitor and guide dengue prevention and control programmes, i. e., by mosquito control or possible vaccination (as soon as an effective and safe vaccine becomes available). Objective: The purpose of the external quality assurance (EQA) study described is to assess the efficiency and accuracy of dengue molecular diagnosis methods applied by expert laboratories. Study Design: A panel of 12 human plasma samples was distributed and tested for DENV-specific RNA. The panel comprised 9 samples spiked with different DENV serotypes (DENV- 1 to DENV- 4), including 10 -fold dilution series of DENV- 1 and DENV- 3. Two specificity controls consisted of a sample with a pool of 4 other flaviviruses and a sample with chikungunya virus. A <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> was also included.

The goal {{of this study was}} to identify anti-bodies that have broad reactivity of binding to various gen-ogroups of norovirus. A human scFv phage display library was used to identify two antibodies, HJT-R 3 -A 9 and HJT-R 3 -F 7, which bind to both genogroups I and II norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs). Mapping experiments indi-cated that the HJT-R 3 -A 9 clone binds to the S-domain while the HJT-R 3 -F 7 clone binds the P-domain of the VP 1 capsid protein. In addition, a family of scFv antibodies was identified by elution of phage libraries from the GII. 4 VLP target using a carbohydrate that serves as an attachment factor for norovirus on human cells. These antibodies were also found to recognize both GI and GII VLPs in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments.

Samples were then mixed and sequenced together, with the barcodes allowing the identification of the different input samples in the resulting sequence data.

Variable regions of the 16 S RNA gene of E. sakazakii were chosen for amplification by primers designed {{with the help of the}} computer programme Primer 3 (ROZEN und SKALETSKY, 2000). Chimeric primer were used as internal amplification control. To check whether the amplicon was generated agarose gel electrophoresis was employed. To test the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR method 57 E. sakazakii strains as well as 169 isolates belonging to 16 species or genera of other bacteria than E. sakazakii were used. Before testing, the E. sakazakii strains were examined by RAPD-PCR to ensure individuality. The PCR method gave positive results for all 57 E. sakazakii strains, three Hafnia alvei isolates, however, were also positive. It could be shown by DNA sequence analysis that H. alvei has a 16 S rRNA gene sequence identical with the target DNA used for the detection of E. sakazakii. Therefore, the amplicons of the E. sakazakii strains and the H. alvei isolates were analysed by restriction digest using MvaI as restriction enzyme. Both species could be differentiated clearly by their electrophoretic band patterns. To test the performance of the PCR method if food has to be examined 52 samples of powdered infant formulae were artificially contaminated with ten different strains of E. sakazakii (5 to 24 bacteria per 100 g).

One-hundred microliter diluted secondary antibody (for gentamicin: rabbit anti mouse peroxidase (RAMPO, Dako, Denmark), 5000 × diluted in PBS/BSA; for vancomycin: swine anti rabbit peroxidase (SWARPO, Dako, Denmark), 2000 x diluted in PBS/BSA) was added to the wells and incubated for 1  h at room temperature after which the plate is washed 4 times with wash-buffer. After washing, 100  µl 3, 3 ′, 5, 5 ′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added to each well to allow chromogenic detection of bound secondary antibodies. The reaction was stopped with 3  M sulphuric acid at the moment the absorbance of the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> (0  ng/ml antibiotic) reached 0.5 at 650  nm. After stopping the reaction, the absorbance at 450  nm was measured using an ELISA reader (MultiSkan FC, Thermo Scientific). Due to the setup of the ELISA, the measured absorbance is inversely correlated with the antibiotic concentration present in the sample (for a detailed representation of the experimental procedure see Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The antibiotic concentration present in the sample can be calculated based on the used calibration standards in a log–log scale.|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of conjugates between the electrophilic reactive metabolites {{of drugs and}} nucleophilic protein sites {{is known to be}} associated with toxicological risk. At present there is no low cost and high throughput means of reliably detecting the presence of drug-protein adducts in vitro or in vivo. The development of a reliable high throughput methodology would facilitate the study of underlying mechanisms of toxicity and prove useful in early screening of potential drug molecules. Assays using liver microsomes and trapping agents such as glutathione are used to produce and detect a wide range of drug reactive metabolites which are then characterised by mass spectrometry. The glutathione trapping is effective for metabolite identifications but, the modification of proteins by means of electrophilic attack on nucleophilic centres often occurs in an enzyme independent manner and is unlikely to be analogous to the glutathione model. In order to create a more suitable model system, three short polypeptides were designed and synthesised. These peptides were incubated with clozapine and human liver microsomes. The resulting metabolite-peptide conjugates were analysed by nanoLC-MS. Results indicated that a characteristic conjugate specific ion at 359. 1 Da could be detected for each of the peptides. This data was used to create a precursor ion scan specific for the presence of this characteristic ion. Protein separation techniques including SCX, Offgel IEF and 1 d-gel electrophoresis, in conjunction with LC-MS (with the precursor 359 scan), were applied to microsome prep samples in order to identify modified proteins. Using these approaches some 1700 protein identifications were made, more than 1000 of these were unique hits. The precursor ion scan was found to have poor selectivity identifying roughly 1 / 3 as many proteins as the information dependant acquisition approach. No drug-protein adducts were identified. Further to this a novel application of saturation DIGE was applied in order to enrich for the presence of protein adducts. The DiGE approach was used to identify some 15 proteins with apparent change in abundance (fluorescence intensity) between clozapine treated and untreated samples. Spots were excised from the 2 d gel digested and analysed by reversed phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The IDA scans identified some 147 unique protein hits, the precursor ion scans identified 18. Again no drug-protein adducts were found. Biotinylated desmethyl clozapine was metabolised in the human liver microsome assay. Western blotting was carried out on a 2 d gel run from an assay sample. The Western membrane was probed using an HRP-Streptavidin probe. Imaging of the membrane revealed the presence of several biotin bearing proteins, many of which were not present in the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> A print out of the image was used as a map for the excision of modified proteins from a duplicate gel. Digestion and LCMS analysis of the samples revealed the presence of several proteins but no protein-adducts were found...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{fluorescent}} DNA probe (LEIS. P 1) specific for a conserved {{region of}} the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene of Leishmania {{and a pair of}} flanking primers (LEIS. U 1 and LEIS. L 1) were designed for use in a fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction. Optimal assay conditions with zero background were established to detect low levels of Leishmania from clinical samples. By use of this assay, we amplified DNA from 27 strains of cultured Leishmania (both Old and New World strains) and selectively amplified Leishmania DNA from 12 paraffin-embedded human biopsy samples and 3 fresh human skin biopsy specimens. For the fresh human tissue biopsies, the turnaround time from biopsy to test result was 24 hr. No amplification was detected in <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> (including the kinetoplastid protozoa Trypanosoma rangelli and Crithidia fasiculata). This assay provides a specific and rapid diagnostic modality to detect infection with Leishmania...|$|R
