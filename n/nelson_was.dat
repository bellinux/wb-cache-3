5|$|Horatio <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> born on 29 September 1758 in a rectory in Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, England, {{the sixth}} of eleven {{children}} of the Reverend Edmund Nelson and his wife Catherine Suckling. He was named after his godfather Horatio Walpole (1723–1809) then 2nd Baron Walpole, of Wolterton. His mother, who died on 26 December 1767, when he was nine years old, was a great-niece of Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, the de facto first Prime Minister of Great Britain. She lived {{in the village of}} Barsham, Suffolk, and married the Reverend Edmund Nelson at Beccles church, Suffolk, in 1749. Nelson's aunt, Alice <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> the wife of Reverend Robert Rolfe, Rector of Hilborough, Norfolk and grandmother of Sir Robert Monsey Rolfe.

5|$|In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, {{claiming}} that he owed US$32,000,000. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s. In 1978, after he fired Reshen, <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped. While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied), due to penalties and interests, the debt increased {{by the end of}} the decade.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> {{promoted}} to Commodore on 11 March. Shortly thereafter, {{in the action}} of 31 May 1796, boats from Agamemnon and Nelson's squadron captured a small convoy of French vessels off the Franco-Italian coast, while suffering minimal casualties.|$|E

5|$|Although {{pleased with}} {{the result of the}} engagement, Lord Keith issued strict {{instructions}} that <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> to remain in active command of the blockade and on no account to return to Palermo. If {{he had to go to}} port in Sicily, then he was to use Syracuse instead. Keith then sailed to Livorno, where his flagship was destroyed in a sudden fire that killed over 700 of the crew, although Keith himself was not on board at the time. By early March, Nelson had tired of the blockade and in defiance of Keith's instructions returned to Palermo again, leaving Captain Thomas Troubridge of HMS Culloden in command of the blockade squadron. In March, while <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> absent at Palermo, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell, the last survivor of the Nile, attempted to break out of Malta but was chased down and defeated by a British squadron led by Berry in Foudroyant. Although Nelson briefly returned in April, both of the Hamiltons were aboard his ship and most of his time was spent at Marsa Sirocco in the company of Emma, with whom he was now romantically attached.|$|E
5|$|British forces {{landed at}} Calvi on 19 June, and {{immediately}} began moving guns ashore {{to occupy the}} heights surrounding the town. While Nelson directed a continuous bombardment of the enemy positions, Stuart's men began to advance. On 12 July <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> {{at one of the}} forward batteries early in the morning when a shot struck one of the sandbags protecting the position, spraying stones and sand. <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> struck by debris in his right eye and was forced to retire from the position, although his wound was soon bandaged and he returned to action. By 18 July most of the enemy positions had been disabled, and that night Stuart, supported by Nelson, stormed the main defensive position and captured it. Repositioning their guns, the British brought Calvi under constant bombardment, and the town surrendered on 10 August. However, Nelson's right eye had been irreparably damaged and he eventually lost all sight in it.|$|E
5|$|Despite Brueys hopes, <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> {{determined}} to press home his attack {{at once and}} ordered his ships to advance, only pausing to fit springs on their anchor cables, which {{would allow them to}} easily direct their broadsides in cramped, shallow coastal waters. Without an accurate chart of the bay, <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> forced to be cautious in his advance, and ordered Captain Samuel Hood in Zealous to take soundings as he advanced to establish the depth of the bay. At 18:20, as the British ships HMS Goliath and Zealous rounded the northern shoal, the leading French ships Guerrier and Conquérant opened fire. As he approached the French line, Captain Thomas Foley in Goliath noticed that Brueys had made a serious error in the distribution of his forces. Rather than place his lead ship Guerrier close to the northern shoal, the French admiral had left a gap, widened by the order for the French fleet to only anchor by the bow which meant that they drifted significantly, between Guerrier and the shoals. Sailing directly through this gap, Foley raked Guerrier and engaged the second ship of the French line, Conquérant. Zealous also passed through the gap and attacked Guerrier, and was followed by HMS Orion, HMS Theseus and HMS Audacious, all of which opened up a fierce fire on the first four French ships against their unprepared port sides.|$|E

5|$|HMS Lord <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> {{laid down}} by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at Jarrow on 18 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 4 September 1906. Her completion was greatly delayed by the diversion of her 12-inch (305mm) guns and turrets to expedite completion of , {{and she was not}} fully completed until October 1908.

5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E

Winthrop became governor while his brother <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> governor of New York, while the defeat of Johnson in Arkansas and William M.

5|$|Life in <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> {{hard for}} the colonists. The company had limited {{finances}} and tightened its expenditure which affected the salaries of its employees. In 1844, it had to halt its operations for a time. Although Nelson had 300 landowners, nearly two thirds were absentee owners and only 80 actually lived in the town. Brunner lived at Riwaka, a nearby village, and, in addition to carrying out survey work along the Motueka River, helped {{in the design and}} building of houses in the area. He ended his service with the company in August 1844.|$|E
5|$|Of all the {{responsibilities}} given the two ships, {{the most important}} was to guard the Eastern Mediterranean against a breakout by Goeben, but when Goeben and Breslau finally made their breakout attempt on 20 January 1918, Lord <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> away at Salonika and Agamemnon could not get steam up to depart Mudros in time {{to participate in the}} resulting Battle of Imbros.

5|$|The first {{herbarium}} {{collection of}} B.epica {{was not made}} until October 1973, when Ernest Charles Nelson visited Toolinna Cove to collect specimens for a taxonomic revision of Adenanthos. <b>Nelson</b> <b>was</b> stimulated to make that revision from {{an interest in the}} problem of disjunct plant distributions in southern Australia, and therefore collected specimens of a range of plant species. On 22 October, he collected a specimen of B.epica in old flower, but incorrectly identified it as B.media, and later lodged it in the herbarium at Canberra under that name.|$|E
