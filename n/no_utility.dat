This is a subject of ongoing study, with <b>no</b> <b>utility</b> scale plants as of 2015, but a German project ADELE is planning to bring a demonstration plant (360MWh storage capacity) into service in 2016. The theoretical efficiency of adiabatic storage approaches 100% with perfect insulation, but in practice round trip efficiency {{is expected to be}} 70%. Heat can be stored in a solid such as concrete or stone, or more likely in a fluid such as hot oil (up to 300°C) or molten salt solutions (600°C).|$|E
25|$|The {{trade deficit}} induced Buffett {{to enter the}} foreign {{currency}} market {{for the first time}} in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett emphasized the non-productive aspect of a gold standard for the United States dollar in 1998 at Harvard: It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has <b>no</b> <b>utility.</b> Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head. In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.|$|E

500|$|In his conclusion, Smith states {{his belief}} that modern {{politicians}} and military leaders use force where it has <b>no</b> <b>utility</b> and commit military forces without fully defined political and strategic objectives. He believes that politicians and generals remain in the mindset of industrial war, which leads them {{to prepare for a}} decisive confrontation that never happens, and he condemns them for failing to recognise the shift in the way wars are fought. Discussing humanitarian interventions, such as those in the Balkans, Smith does not argue against intervention, but believes that the intervention must be based on a full understanding of the conflict and a clear strategy with defined objectives. According to Smith, [...] "no act of force will ever be decisive" [...] because the aim of modern conflicts is to win the will of the people, which will not be achieved by battlefield victory alone. He argues that whereas, in the industrial war paradigm, war led to victory and thus to peace, in the modern paradigm confrontation leads to conflict, which then reverts to confrontation. He asserts that force {{is only part of the}} solution to modern conflicts; they require complex political and military solutions, which will subdue but not necessarily permanently end the conflict.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} some debate among {{scholars}} as to whether {{to use the term}} magic at all. The scholar of religion Jonathan Z. Smith for example argued that it had <b>no</b> <b>utility</b> as an etic term that scholars should use. Religious historian Wouter Hanegraaff agreed, stating that [...] "the term magic is an important object of historical research, but not intended for doing research." [...] The scholars of religion Berndt-Christian Otto and Michael Stausberg suggested that it would be perfectly possible for scholars to talk about amulets, curses, healing procedures and other components often regarded as magical in Western culture without any recourse to the concept of magic itself. Since the 1990s its usage among scholars has declined.|$|E

60|$|Emigration in {{the year}} 1851 was far less common than it is now, and the {{interest}} was proportionately greater. Charley and Hubert became quite popular characters among their late schoolfellows, who, whenever they met them, would always stop to have a talk about the distant country {{to which they were}} going. The boys, however, had now but little time for talking; for upon the week after their father had first told them of his intention, they had set-to regularly at the work he had laid down for them. They rose every morning at five, had a slice of bread and a cup of milk, and were off to the gardener's, where they worked hard until half-past eight. Mr. Hardy had requested that they should be specially instructed in the raising of vegetables, and in the planting and pruning of fruit-trees. The culture of flowers could be of <b>no</b> <b>utility.</b> The digging made the boys' backs ache at first, and blistered their hands, but they stuck to it manfully, and soon became accustomed to the work, returning to breakfast with glowing cheeks and tremendous appetites.|$|E
5000|$|Living {{conditions}} were primitive, {{particularly in the}} early years when few structures existed suitable for surviving the harsh winter environment. <b>No</b> <b>utilities</b> such as power, water or telephone ran to the land; heating and cooking was by wood, kerosene or bottled propane, and lighting by candles or kerosene lantern. Drinking and bathing water was drawn from Black Turn Brook, or directly from the Coaticook River. Winter access was challenging; once off the plowed state highway, the unmaintained dirt roads were frequently blocked by heavy, drifting snowfall accumulations, adding a half-mile hike in from the highway, with snowshoes, toboggans and cross-country skis much desired items.|$|R

Construction in the City went unregulated, {{and most of the}} roughly 350 buildings were built with poor foundations and few or <b>no</b> <b>utilities.</b> Because apartments were so small—a typical unit was —space was maximised with wider upper floors, caged balconies and rooftop additions. Roofs in the City were full of television antennae, clothes lines, water tanks and rubbish, and could be crossed using a series of ladders.|$|R

60|$|He {{consulted}} Maitre Georges; but {{the latter}} could make no suggestion; his only advice being the erection of a battery {{at a spot}} where it was almost self evident {{that it could be}} of <b>no</b> <b>utility</b> whatever. Other circumstances combined to render the suspicions D'Aubusson had entertained of the good faith of the renegade almost a certainty. Georges was seized, tried, and put to torture, and under this owned that he had been sent into the town for the purpose of betraying it; and he was, the same day, hung in the great square. His guilt must always be considered as uncertain. There was no proof against him, save his own confession; and a confession extorted by torture is of no value whatever. There are certainly many good grounds for suspicion, but it is possible that Georges really repented his apostacy, and acted in good faith in deserting the standard of Paleologus. He was undoubtedly a man of altogether exceptional ability and acquirements, and even the knights who have written accounts of the siege do justice to the fascination of his manner and the charm of his conversation.|$|E
6000|$|In {{answer to}} those who affect to admire that {{deficient}} system of existence which they style simplicity of manners, and who are perpetually committing the blunder of supposing that every advance towards perfection only withdraws man further from his primitive and proper condition, Popanilla triumphantly demonstrated that no such order as that which they associated with the phrase 'state of nature' ever existed. 'Man,' said he, 'is called the masterpiece of nature; and man is also, as we all know, the most curious of machines; now, a machine {{is a work of}} art, consequently, the masterpiece of nature is the masterpiece of art. The object of all mechanism is the attainment of utility; the object of man, who is the most perfect machine, is utility in the highest degree. Can we believe, therefore, that this machine was ever intended for a state which never could have called forth its powers, a state in which <b>no</b> <b>utility</b> could ever have been attained, a state in which there are no wants; consequently, no demand; consequently, no supply; consequently, no competition; consequently, no invention; consequently, no profits; only one great pernicious monopoly of comfort and ease? Society without wants is like a world without winds. It is quite clear, therefore, {{that there is no such}} thing as Nature; Nature is Art, or Art is Nature; that which is most useful is most natural, because utility is the test of nature; therefore a steam-engine is in fact a much more natural production than a mountain.* ...|$|E
6000|$|In this description, {{though all}} is told which is {{necessary}} to convey to us an awful moral lesson, yet we are left ignorant of the minutiæ attending the apparition, which perhaps we ought to accept as {{a sure sign that}} there was <b>no</b> <b>utility</b> in our being made acquainted with them. It is impossible, for instance, to know with certainty whether Saul was present when the woman used her conjuration, or whether he himself personally ever saw the appearance which the Pythoness described to him. It is left still more doubtful whether anything supernatural was actually evoked, or whether the Pythoness and her assistant meant to practise a mere deception, taking their chance to prophesy the defeat and death of the broken-spirited king as an event which the circumstances in which he was placed rendered highly probable, since he was surrounded by a superior army of Philistines, and his character as a soldier rendered it likely that he would not survive a defeat which must involve the loss of his kingdom. On the other hand, admitting that the apparition had really a supernatural character, it remains equally uncertain what was its nature or by what power it was compelled to an appearance, unpleasing, as it intimated, since the supposed spirit of Samuel asks wherefore he was disquieted in the grave. Was the power of the witch over the invisible world so great that, like the Erictho of the heathen poet, she could disturb the sleep of the just, and especially that of a prophet so important as Samuel; and are we to suppose that he, upon whom the Spirit of the Lord was wont to descend, even while he was clothed with frail mortality, should be subject to be disquieted in his grave at the voice of a vile witch, and the command of an apostate prince? Did the true Deity refuse Saul the response of his prophets, and could a witch compel the actual spirit of Samuel to make answer notwithstanding? ...|$|E
