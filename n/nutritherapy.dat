40|$|<b>Nutritherapy</b> {{seeks to}} prevent or correct disease {{by the use of}} {{nutritional}} supplements including vitamins, trace elements, or macronutrients. This chapter of the "Les Entretiens du Carla" reviews the potential of <b>nutritherapy</b> for the prevention or improvement of sarcopenia, which is the progressive reduction in muscle mass and muscle strength prevalent in late-life. It is critical that we review nutrients and their potential to maintain muscle mass and strength which ultimately will help minimize falls and fractures among the older population. Evidence from randomized-controlled trials will be reviewed for muscle mass as well as important sarcopenia-related endpoints including lower extremity strength and function, as well as falls and fall-related fractures. This chapter will focus on vitamin D as a compelling strategy with evidence for strength gain, fall and fracture prevention from double-blind randomized controlled trials. The other strategy discussed is increased protein intake although longer-term trials and evidence for clinically important endpoints are limited. Today, there is no consistent data on other micronutrients or macronutrients with an established potential to combat sarcopenia...|$|E
40|$|An {{imbalance}} in (n- 6) /(n- 3) PUFA {{has been reported}} in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Glycerophospholipids enriched in docosahexaenoic acid (GPL-DHA) have been shown to regulate the (n- 6) /(n- 3) fatty acid ratio in the elderly. Here, we tested the effect of GPL-DHA supplementation on PUFA status in F 508 del homozygous CF mice. GPL-DHA liposomes were administrated by gavage (60 mg DHA/kg daily, i. e. at maximum 1. 4 mg DHA/d) to 1. 5 -mo-old CF mice (CF+DHA) and their corresponding wild-type (WT) homozygous littermates (WT+DHA) for 6 wk. The PUFA status of different tissues was determined by GC and compared with control groups (CF and WT). There was an alteration in the (n- 6) PUFA pathway in several CF-target organs in CF compared with WT mice, as evidenced by a higher level of arachidonic acid (AA) in membrane phospholipids or whole tissue (21 and 39 % in duodenum-jejunum, 32 and 38 % in ileum, and 19 and 43 % in pancreas). Elevated AA levels were associated with lower linoleic acid (LA) and higher dihomo-?-linolenic acid levels. No DHA deficiency was observed. GPL-DHA treatment resulted in different PUFA composition changes depending on the tissue (increase in LA, decrease in elevated AA, DHA increase, increase in (n- 6) /(n- 3) fatty acid ratio). However, the DHA/AA ratio consistently increased in all tissues in CF+DHA and WT+DHA mice. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of an original oral DHA formulation in counter-balancing the abnormal (n- 6) fatty acid metabolism in organs of CF mice when administrated at a low dose and highlights the potential of the use of GPL-DHA as <b>nutritherapy</b> for CF patients...|$|E
