5|$|The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit {{especially}} hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The {{collapse of the}} world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production.

5|$|Baird was {{appointed}} President of the Treasury Board on February 6, 2006. Following his appointment, {{he said that}} one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from Ottawa to other regions for political purposes. Baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government. In June 2006 he announced the creation of a three-member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues.

This, {{along with the}} defection of Wajid Khan to the Conservatives enabled the Conservatives to pass legislation {{with the cooperation of}} any one of the three opposition parties: Liberals, Bloc Québécois, or <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (NDP).|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1956, the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 years out of power. None had come close to {{defeating}} the Liberals; the best performance was in 1945, when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories. The Liberals, though, had won 125seats, and maintained their majority. In the 1953 election, the PC party won 51seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons. Subsequently, the Tories picked up two seats from the Liberals in by-elections, and the Liberals (who had won 169seats in 1953) lost an additional seat to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (NDP)).|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} by Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich {{that she would}} not be seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, that he would seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal Party candidate in the next election. As no one else came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate. In the general election, held in May 2009, he was challenged by a <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> candidate, notary public Kam Brar, and a Green Party candidate, teacher Michael Wolfe, and Nation Alliance Party candidate, accountant Kang Chen. The riding was considered to be a safe seat for the BC Liberals to win, which the 54-year-old Howard did win with over 60% of the vote, with his BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{fourteen}} current first ministers, two (Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne) are women. Two (Bob McLeod and Peter Taptuna) are indigenous.

Of the current first ministers, eight are from a Liberal Party, two are from a <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> one is from a Progressive Conservative Party, one is from the Saskatchewan Party, and two are non-partisan. Provincial parties are not, however, necessarily affiliated with or politically analogous to their federal counterparts.|$|E
