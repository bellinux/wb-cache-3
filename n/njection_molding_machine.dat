40|$|Injection Molding is {{a common}} method of plastic {{processing}} in which thermoplastic materials can be molded into arbitrary complex shapes. Most injection <b>molding</b> <b>machines</b> use complicated hydraulic systems to perform the necessary work of the process. Hydraulic system flow and pressure requirements vary throughout the cycle and in many cases, excess fluid that is not required by the process is throttled back to the reservoir, wasting motor energy and producing additional thermal load on the cooling system. Variable speed drives {{can be used to}} allow injection <b>molding</b> <b>machine</b> hydraulic systems to vary the amount of fluid being pumped and thus reduce the amount of fluid that is throttled, reducing the amount of wasted energy. This paper discusses injection <b>molding</b> <b>machine</b> processes and develops a protocol for assessing the efficacy of variable speed drive retrofits for hydraulic injection <b>molding</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Traditional {{horizontal}} injection <b>molding</b> <b>machines</b> {{have been}} used since the mid-1980s, however loading and unloading [...] cores are difficult so two robots are required. Moreover, the cycle time is quite long, approximately 28 seconds. These problem are overcome by using rotary or shuttle action injection <b>molding</b> <b>machines.</b> These types of machines only require one robot to load and unload cores and have a 30% shorter cycle time. However, these types of machines cost approximately 35% more than horizontal machines, require more space, and require two bottom molds (because one is in the machine during the cycle {{and the other is}} being unloaded and loaded with a new core), which adds approximately 40% to the tooling cost. For small parts, horizontal injection <b>molding</b> <b>machines</b> are still used, because the core does not weigh enough to justify the use of a rotary machine.|$|R
