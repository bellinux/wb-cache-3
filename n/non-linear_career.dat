40|$|This article {{reflects}} ongoing research-led {{teaching in}} the area of creative industries in higher education. Specifically it reports on key work-integrated learning strategies designed to better prepare graduates for the employment sector. The creative industries sector is complex and competitive, characterized by <b>non-linear</b> <b>career</b> paths driven by the individual. Following contextualization of the key issues, a core creative industries subject and curriculum is described, which requires students to engage directly with industry practitioners via internships or case studies. In order to interrogate the impact of these activities, a sample of final reflections as well as formal student feedback on the subject were analyzed in order to draw out key themes in relation to student learning and understanding. Analysis of these data propose that direct engagement with practitioners assists students in developing new knowledge of the capacities they will require for a sustainable career...|$|E
30|$|This {{critical}} perspective though {{contrasted with}} other stories about younger scientists who had simultaneously or consecutively {{worked on a}} start-up and in academia. R 1 himself had in his young age created a company before going back to a research institute and later became {{the head of the}} institution. Interviewees frequently mentioned different similar examples, e.g. of a researcher who created two start-ups after leaving a research institute and now got a professorship at a nearby university or yet another who had been involved in a start-up for approximately 10  years and had only recently got a professorship in academia again. According to such narrations, <b>non-linear,</b> cross-sector <b>careers</b> seemed to be relatively common in the region across universities, research institutes and start-ups.|$|R
30|$|Scientists {{described}} cross-sectoral {{hiring practices}} {{that made it}} possible to return to university in case a start-up fails as a further way in which research organisations reduced career risk and supported AE: some scientists had changed quite frequently between employment at universities and start-ups, especially when they had reasons to expect that the start-up would not be a sustainable success. Such a flexible hiring practice in one case made it possible for a network of scientists to try to commercialise the same analytical technology over the past 15 [*]years, even though the first two start-ups they founded never took off in terms of economic success. Some of the core scientists thus had decided to opt for more secure researcher career option again, but were later encouraged by new funding opportunities and the willingness of both, a research institute and the technical university to negotiate economically favourable employment conditions for scientists to create another start-up. In this context, the agency of research managers can be observed in supporting high-risk AE by adapting employment and cross-sectoral hiring practices allowing for <b>non-linear</b> researcher <b>careers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Fewer {{than half}} of the young people {{attending}} vocational institutions in Norway complete their education within the allotted five years. Indeed, many of these students have non-linear paths to completion. However, it is not changes in the dropout rate that make this different from earlier generations but the expansion of formal edu- cation {{and the rise of the}} knowledge society and individualisation. The term `tightrope biographies' is used here to encapsulate why individualisation cannot be thought of in terms of choice, because today's youth are often held accountable for their educa- tional progression rather than this progression being viewed as dependent on institu- tional mechanisms. The present study characterises young people as tightrope dancers in their interactions with vocational schools. Selected data collected from ethnographic interviews during the ongoing longitudinal project Youth, Completion and Dropout in Telemark are used here to capture the voices of young people. These data focus on the <b>non-linear</b> educational <b>careers</b> of these youth when they re-enter schools and explore the stories they tell about dropping out and re-entering. These stories suggest that, to succeed, students need customised support throughout the process from school to the workplace and that many depend on this support. The study identifes three different ways of understanding these students as tightrope dancers trying to get back on track, characterising them as The Steady, The Shaky and The Shivering...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{macro-economic}} changes, {{organizations are}} now functioning {{differently than the}} classic bureaucracies with their career ladders: rapid technological changes and globalization have {{their impact on the}} way a company should ideally work. The work organization is being increasingly characterized by a less hierarchically organized structure with more autonomy and responsibility for each employee but also by ever greater demands on the employee, who {{has to be able to}} work flexibly in an ever-changing organization. As a result careers are changing. Several new concepts have been formulated that attempt to grasp the complexity of modern, flexible careers as a response to the changed organization of companies and the demands that employees have to meet. One of the pioneers of the <b>non-linear</b> <b>career</b> models is Douglas T. Hall. In 1976, he discussed the ‘protean ’ career. Other concepts that were used are: the ‘transitory ’ and ‘spiral ’ career, the ‘career-resilient ’ workforce or the ‘portfolio ’ career. Another concept is that of the ‘boundaryless career ’ first used by Arthur and Rousseau, which emphasizes the boundary crossings that employees make during their careers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to understand the career choices of older workers. While there is significant research about retirement, {{there is a lack of}} literature and research in the area of older worker careers, in particular those who are continuing to work, rather than retire. This research seeks to not only understand the career choices that older workers are making around retirement, but also to expand and modernise theory in the area of late life careers which is currently inadequate. Design/methodology/approach: This research is taking a mutli-method approach consisting of two phases, a qualitative and quantitative phase of data collection. Findings: Preliminary results based upon more than 50 semi-structured interviews show that the motivation to work and <b>non-linear</b> <b>career</b> intentions are different between older and younger workers. Furthermore, changing life roles have a significant impact upon individual’s desire and ability to work, in particular the life role of child. Research limitations/implications: Currently theory in the area of late life careers is inadequate and does not explain the modern pheromone of a late life career. This research hopes to expand and modernise theory in this area allowing us to predict and explain behaviour. Practical and Social implications: Australia like much of the developed world is faced with an ageing population. If organisations wish to retain this talent they need to understand the changing needs of older worker. 2 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This paper expands on {{previous}} work about women’s <b>non-linear</b> and frayed <b>careers</b> {{by examining the}} experiences {{of women who have}} attempted to return to science, engineering and technology (SET) professions in the UK and Republic of Ireland after taking a career break. These women potentially offer an important perspective on gender and career, because of the deep rooted gendered associations of science and technology with masculinity. Drawing on qualitative interviews with women SET professionals, the paper identifies three narratives – Rebooting, Rerouting and Retreating – which women use to talk about their careers. Some of these women present themselves as career changers having often made compromises and trade-offs, while others who have returned to their substantive professions, focus on continuity in their career narratives. The precarious nature of their careers is also apparent and in some cases leads to opting out or Retreating. The paper concludes by exploring how women’s scientist and technical identities persist, even among those who had not returned to work, and are drawn on in narratives of return and career change...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the incorporation of}} vocational education and training courses into a senior secondary certificate of education, the NSW Higher School Certificate. New VET courses were introduced in 2000 to broaden the offerings available in post-compulsory schooling and to better cater for the vocational needs of students not primarily focused on university study, without excluding the latter option. This paper reviews the progressive implementation of dual recognition of VET courses in the HSC, and growth in participation through quantitative and qualitative data using official statistics to review enrolments and matriculation outcomes for students in the new VET courses. The qualitative data was collected throughout a three year ARC Linkage project on vocational education and equity in senior schooling, across a matrix of eight government schools in NSW. The paper presents new {{analysis of the data}} arguing that these reforms to curriculum and reporting of the HSC has led to a more integrated approach, and a better understanding of linear and <b>non-linear</b> VET and <b>career</b> pathways. The opportunity to have the outcomes from VET courses count towards university entrance was an important policy objective, but it remains unclear whether students take full advantage of this option...|$|R
40|$|With the {{traditional}} one-way hierarchical organization career path being replaced with <b>non-linear</b> or multi-directional <b>career</b> paths, how an individual could maintain continuous career development within a dynamic and discontinued employment context is a consistent {{theme of this}} thesis. Through an internet-mediated quantitative research method among recent alumni of Massey University, this current study explores three core aspects of recent tertiary graduates’ career development: {{the extent to which}} they hold new career attitudes (protean and boundaryless attitudes), endorse career adaptability and implement career self-management behaviours. By also considering these graduates’ gender, age range, ethnicity, highest qualification, the college from which they graduated and location after graduation, this New Zealand based empirical study questions if such demographic elements could affect graduates’ career attitudes, career adaptability and career self-management behaviours. The findings reveal that although recent tertiary graduates’ levels of endorsement of new career attitudes and career adaptability has increased to a considerable extent, these graduates are not practising career self-management behaviours to a similar high level. Demographic elements are implied to be an issue when considering the above three aspects of their career development, but are evidently not crucial; and are still worth more investigation in future empirical career studies. The practical value of this study lies in its implications for both individual graduates and institutions to maintain congruence in both attitudes and actions when developing individual careers...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a very {{personal}} reflection. The {{purpose of the study}} is to illuminate how following the calling of my heart led to a deeper passion in my own work whereupon I realized my natural and limitless creative potential. It is a blending of my narrative with research conducted over a ten year time period on midlife women, work, and the search for passion within. The capacity and fostering of creativity became a focus in my writing because that is exactly where my spirit has led me. It has been my personal joy to put something in this world that was not there before. My personal story is my unique Scholarly Personal Narrative, but the story itself and the constructs embedded within on midlife women moving beyond the feminine mystique to fulfill their career dreams by embracing their passion and seeking creativity is universal to many women. I believe that my experiences are both generalizable and transferable and will serve as a beacon of light in guiding other midlife women in their own journey to follow their dreams and nurture their true self. Scholarly Personal Narrative was used to blend my experiences with research on women 2 ̆ 7 s identity, midlife, reinventing careers, opting-out, on-ramps for women returning to work and expressing creativity. My narrative speaks to how specific events in my life, as in many women 2 ̆ 7 s lives, have contributed to finding my own authentic voice, navigating a course of rediscovery, and ultimately realizing the personal power of knowing you are empowered. Throughout my writing I highlight that midlife is a unique period of time. I believe it can be claustrophobic and it can be ripe with opportunity and adventure. If you allow it, this time of life affords an opportunity for self-discovery and unanticipated growth. Midlife is a time to dig deep in examining our life experiences to extrapolate meaning. My meanings derived combined with my dreams within has led me in finding my true creative calling through my work. But, I believe that we each {{are the only ones who}} can find the meaning in and through our life experiences because they both form and inform our own truth. It became about harmonizing creative development, my identity, and work to fuel major change. Universal themes that emerge include recognizing one 2 ̆ 7 s creativity has worth, viewing future work life as an opportunity to incorporate that with which we are passionate, and embracing midlife as a time for positive personal growth and change. It is a complex narrative, but in finding the truth, I became open to building on the successes, experiences, and lessons of my past to pursue work that excites, enriches, and motivates me. Findings suggest that midlife is a crucial time of personal and professional growth. Findings also suggest many highly educated women have <b>non-linear</b> <b>career</b> paths which in turn deepen our self-understanding moving us toward authenticity and allowing ourselves to engage in work that matters to us. Embracing creativity in midlife, through our work. can fill us with both passion and purpose and ultimately lead us on a magical journey in discovering our own truth...|$|E
40|$|In {{the shift}} to a globalised {{creative}} economy where innovation and creativity are increasingly prized, many studies have documented direct and indirect social and economic benefits of the arts. In addition, arts workers have been argued to possess capabilities which are of great benefit {{both within and outside}} the arts, including (in addition to creativity) problem solving abilities, emotional intelligence, and team working skills (ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation, 2007). However, the labour force characteristics of professional artists in Australia and elsewhere belie their importance. The average earnings of workers in the arts sector are consistently less than other workers with similar educational backgrounds, and their rates of unemployment and underemployment are much higher (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2005; Caves, 2000; Throsby & Hollister, 2003). Graduating students in the arts appear to experience similar employment challenges and exhibit similar patterns of work to artists in general. Many eventually obtain work unrelated to the arts or go back to university to complete further tertiary study in fields unrelated to arts (Graduate Careers Council of Australia, 2005 a). Recent developments in career development theory have involved discussion of the rise of boundaryless careers amongst knowledge workers. Boundaryless careers are characterised by <b>non-linear</b> <b>career</b> progression occurring outside the bounds of a single organisation or field (Arthur & Rousseau, 1996 a, 1996 b). The protean career is an extreme form of the boundaryless career, where the careerist also possesses strong internal career motivations and criteria for success (Baruch, 2004; Hall, 2004; Hall & Mirvis, 1996). It involves a psychological contract with one's self rather than an organisation or organisations. The boundaryless and protean career literature suggests competencies and dispositions for career self-management and career success, but to date there has been minimal empirical work investigating the predictive value of these competencies and dispositions to career success in the boundaryless or protean career. This program of research employed competencies and dispositions from boundaryless and protean career theory to predict career success in professional artists and tertiary arts graduates. These competencies and dispositions were placed into context using individual and contextual career development influences suggested by the Systems Theory Framework of career development (McMahon & Patton, 1995; Patton & McMahon, 1999, 2006 a). Four substantive studies were conducted, using online surveys with professional artists and tertiary arts students / graduates, which were preceded by a pilot study for measure development. A largely quantitative approach to the program of research was preferred, in the interests of generalisability of findings. However, at the time of data collection, there were no quantitative measures available which addressed the constructs of interest. Brief scales of Career Management Competence based on the Australian Blueprint for Career Development (Haines, Scott, & Lincoln, 2003), Protean Career Success Orientation based on the underlying dispositions for career success suggested by protean career theory, and Career Development Influences based on the Systems Theory Framework of career development (McMahon & Patton, 1995; Patton & McMahon, 1999, 2006 a) were constructed and validated via a process of pilot testing and exploratory factor analyses. This process was followed by confirmatory factor analyses with data collected from two samples: 310 professional artists, and 218 graduating arts students who participated at time 1 (i. e., at the point of undergraduate course completion in October, 2005). Confirmatory factor analyses via Structural Equation Modelling conducted in Study 1 revealed that the scales would benefit from some respecification, and so modifications were made to the measures to enhance their validity and reliability. The three scales modified and validated in Study 1 were then used in Studies 3 and 4 as potential predictors of career success for the two groups of artists under investigation, along with relevant sociodemographic variables. The aim of the Study 2 was to explore the construct of career success in the two groups of artists studied. Each participant responded to an open-ended question asking them to define career success. The responses for professional artists were content analysed using emergent coding with two coders. The codebook was later applied to the arts students' definitions. The majority of the themes could be grouped into four main categories: internal definitions; financial recognition definitions; contribution definitions; and non-financial recognition definitions. Only one third of the definition themes in the professional artists' and arts graduates' definitions of career success were categorised as relating to financial recognition. Responses within the financial recognition category also indicated that many of the artists aspired only to a regular subsistence level of arts income (although a small number of the arts graduates did aspire to fame and fortune). The second section of the study investigated the statistical relationships between the five different measures of career success for each career success definitional category and overall. The professional artists' and arts graduates' surveys contained several measures of career success, including total earnings over the previous 12 months, arts earnings over the previous 12 months, 1 - 6 self-rated total employability, 1 - 6 self-rated arts employability, and 1 - 6 self-rated self-defined career success. All of the measures were found to be statistically related to one another, but a very strong statistical relationship was identified between each employability measure and its corresponding earnings measure for both of the samples. Consequently, it was decided to include only the earnings measures (earnings from arts, and earnings overall) and the self-defined career success rating measure in the later studies. Study 3 used the career development constructs validated in Study 1, sociodemographic variables, and the career success measures explored in Study 2 via Classification and Regression Tree (CART - Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, & Stone, 1984) style decision trees with v-fold crossvalidation pruning using the 1 SE rule. CART decision trees are a nonparametric analysis technique which can be used as an alternative to OLS or hierarchical regression in the case of data which violates parametric statistical assumptions. The three optimal decision trees for total earnings, arts earnings and self defined career success ratings explained {{a large proportion of the}} variance in their respective target variables (R 2 between 0. 49 and 0. 68). The Career building subscale of the Career Management Competence scale, pertaining to the ability to manage the external aspects of a career, was the most consistent predictor of all three career success measures (and was the strongest predictor for two of the three trees), indicating the importance of the artists' abilities to secure work and build the external aspects of a career. Other important predictors included the Self management subscale of the Career Management Competence scale, Protean Career Success Orientation, length of time working in the arts, and the positive role of interpersonal influences, skills and abilities, and interests and beliefs from the Career Development Influences scale. Slightly different patterns of predictors were found for the three different career success measures. Study 4 also involved the career development constructs validated in Study 1, sociodemographic variables, and the career success measures explored in Study 2 via CART style decision trees. This study used a prospective repeated measures design where the data for the attribute variables were gathered at the point of undergraduate course completion, and the target variables were measured one year later. Data from a total of 122 arts students were used, as 122 of the 218 students who responded to the survey at time 1 (October 2005) also responded at time 2 (October 2006). The resulting optimal decision trees had R 2 values of between 0. 33 and 0. 46. The values were lower than those for the professional artists' decision trees, and the trees themselves were smaller, but the R 2 values nonetheless indicated that the arts students' trees possessed satisfactory explanatory power. The arts graduates' Career building scores at time 1 were strongly predictive of all three career success measures at time 2, a similar finding to the professional artists' trees. A further similarity between the trees for the two samples was the strong statistical relationship between Career building, Self management, and Protean Career Success Orientation. However, the most important variable in the total earnings tree was arts discipline category. Technical / design arts graduates consistently earned more overall than arts graduates from other disciplines. Other key predictors in the arts graduates' trees were work experience in arts prior to course completion, positive interpersonal influences, and the positive influence of skills and abilities and interests and beliefs on career development. The research program findings represent significant contributions to existing knowledge about artists' career development and success, and also the transition from higher education to the world of work, with specific reference to arts and creative industries programs. It also has implications for theory relating to career success and protean / boundaryless careers...|$|E
40|$|Women {{remain under}} {{represented}} in science, {{engineering and technology}} (SET) professions, and for women who take career breaks returning can be difficult due to the persistence of gendered organisational cultures within these sectors. The papers collated for this PhD by Published Work bring a critical analysis to the experiences of women who return to work in SET after taking a career break {{and in particular the}} locations, both temporal and spatial, in which their careers and professional identities are developed, sustained and rekindled. Reflecting on research and practice spanning more than 20 years, the papers illustrate the development of work on gendered careers in SET over this period. Specifically they show how structured interventions and strategies including training, education and career enhancing opportunities within employing organisations, as well as in women-only training centres and online spaces, have been able to support women’s career development in these sectors enabling them to enter, progress or return to SET professions. The papers draw on a series of studies, predominantly in the UK but also in other European countries, based on a total of 76 biographical narrative interviews with women SET professionals. This is supplemented with survey data from 273 respondents, as well as focus group data and online forum postings. The papers bring a critical gender perspective to discourses about employability and careers in STEM, drawing on theoretical concepts such as doing gender, gendered organisations, sense of entitlement, empowerment and feminist pedagogy. Key contributions include the development of a life course perspective on women’s SET careers, the creation of new models for analysing gendered <b>non-linear</b> and frayed <b>career</b> narratives, and methods for supporting identity work by women in their transition back into work. The papers include recommendations for educators and trainers, employers as well as policy makers concerned with trying to tackle the under representation of women in SET...|$|R
