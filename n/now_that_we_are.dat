500|$|On the {{connection}} between Xenogears and Xenosaga, Takahashi has stated:It's probably more suitable {{to say that it}} follows the direction and style of Xenogears. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> under a different company, we figured we should start everything from scratch all over again. Though there are familiar faces that serve as important characters in Xenosaga, others are more like self-parodies, so we don't really want Xenogears fans to overreact. Like movies, sometimes you have the director of the movie or friend of the leading actor appearing as cameos, so it's similar to that.|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of Transformers, Bart buys Lisa a Malibu Stacy {{convertible}} as a Christmas present. However, the car {{turns out to be}} a Transformer. The robot transforms all of the technology in Springfield into robots so they can wage war with each other. Just as the two machine factions' leaders prepare to face off, Marge asks why the robots are at war with one another; as it turns out, they cannot even remember. Thanking Marge, the two sides declare that they will work together, only for one of the leading robots to shout [...] "and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not fighting each other, we can team up to enslave [...] your planet!" [...] The two factions of sentient machines work together to overthrow humanity and use Springfield's residents in a game of human foosball.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{talking about}} {{literary}} subjects I {{ask you if}} you know a great writer, Rafael Barrett, with a free and bold spirit. With tears in my eyes and on my knees I beg you that when you have a national or two to spend, go straight to Mendesky's, or any other library- and ask for a copy of [...] "Looking the life" [...] of this author. I think that it was published in Montevideo. Is a great book, and reading it soothed me from the foolishness of Giusti, Soiza, O'Reilly and my cousin Alvarito Meli√°n Lafinur.|$|E
60|$|I answered, {{well enough}} <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{together}} again, {{and for the}} rest I would tell him later.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold hard," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{in a low}} voice, for <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> getting near our prey, we made as little noise as possible.|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{ready to}} set out again we decided to follow a {{different}} route on the chance that it might lead us into more familiar territory.|$|R
2500|$|Busch became {{engaged to}} girlfriend Eva Bryan while {{attending}} the 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix. On July 27, 2006, {{three years to}} the day of them meeting on a blind date, they were married in Virginia. The footage was taped and later aired on national television. Busch announced on June 30, 2011, [...] "Those in the NASCAR community have been aware for some time <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> no longer together and we are legally separated". The announcement came days after Busch kissed another woman in Victory Lane celebration following a win at Sonoma Raceway. Busch and Eva Bryan filed for divorce in early June and were legally separated later that month.|$|E
60|$|Luc. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> safe at {{the gate}} of our convent, methinks the {{adventure}} was not unpleasant.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pardon me, Bishop Helmsdale, but {{you said}} just <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> strangers; so what you saw in my cabin {{concerns}} me only.' ...|$|E
60|$|Night had so nearly shut in <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{hidden by}} the gloom, and {{had every reason to}} believe <b>we</b> <b>were</b> come out from amid our enemies without other harm than {{suffering}} with hunger and thirst.|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{assured of}} getting what was needed, {{there was no}} need of great haste, and I told the captain the {{remainder}} of our story, even to describing where father and the lads were hiding.|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> reunited, <b>we</b> held {{a council}} to {{determine}} what course we should pursue in the immediate future. Snider was still for setting out to sea and returning to Pan-America, but the better judgment of Delcarte and Taylor ridiculed the suggestion--we should not have lived a fortnight.|$|R
60|$|HON. Pray, sir, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{upon the}} road, tell us some {{profitable}} things of some {{that have gone}} on pilgrimage before us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Aleck!" [...] he said, reproachfully. [...] "We've {{always worked}} so hard and been so scrimped: and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> rich, it does seem--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we may as {{well have}} speech with him <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> here," [...] I answered. [...] "They are coming down, if I am not mistaken." ...|$|E
60|$|The little witch put a mock malignity {{into her}} {{beautiful}} eyes, and Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and ejaculating 'wicked' as he went. I thought her conduct must be {{prompted by a}} species of dreary fun; and, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> alone, I endeavoured to interest her in my distress.|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in such {{stress for}} food, and since all had turned laborers, whether willingly or no, {{much in the}} way of {{provisions}} was needed. Captain Smith set about taking the turkeys as he did about most other matters, which is to say, that it was done in a thorough manner.|$|R
60|$|During {{the trip}} from Shador I had had no {{opportunity}} to talk with my fellow-prisoner, but <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> safely within the barred paddock our guards abated their watchfulness, {{with the result that}} I found myself able to approach the red Martian youth for whom I felt such a strange attraction.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> of {{the same}} mind in the preliminaries, we will seek the Patroon of Kinderhook, who has a claim to {{participate}} in our confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are afraid, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> four to six," [...] said Snap. [...] "You {{were willing}} enough to pitch into Shep and {{me when we}} were alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will know}} <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> here, and are pretty wide awake," [...] Ben said. [...] "You may {{be sure that}} {{he caught sight of}} these rocks." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> alone, Oscar's absence {{could hardly}} fail to attract Lucilla's attention. Just {{as she was}} {{referring}} to him in terms which made it no easy task for me to quiet her successfully, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> interrupted by the screams of the baby, ascending from the garden below. I ran to the window, and looked out.|$|R
6000|$|Little Frenchie spoke like a preacher, and I dimly {{wondered}} whether his courage might not <b>be</b> failing him, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> fully committed to as desperate a venture as ever lads embarked on; but I need {{have had no}} forebodings, for after remaining silent a dozen seconds or more he seemingly shook off somber thoughts, and said cheerily: ...|$|R
60|$|The old-fashioned ship-life had returned, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{no longer}} in sight of land. For days and days it {{continued}} just the same, one day being exactly like another, and, to me, {{every one of them}} pleasant. At last we anchored in the open roadstead of Funchal, in the beautiful islands we call the Madeiras.|$|R
6000|$|... "Parfaitement!" [...] {{answered}} the smooth Leduc. [...] "Over the bridge we {{laugh at the}} saint. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> cured, the devil take the doctor by all means." ...|$|E
6000|$|ABSOLUTE [Aside.] So!--egad! I {{thought as}} much!--that damned monosyllable has froze me!--[Aloud.] What, Lydia, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> as happy in our friends' consent, {{as in our}} mutual vows---- ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> snug {{and warm}} with this little tea-party, {{while it is}} {{freezing}} with February bitterness outside, we will {{listen to what they}} are talking about.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a host!" [...] Jethro said to Amuba, who, {{after having}} his arm dressed on his {{arrival at the}} palace, had {{accompanied}} the young prince to the walls. [...] "It seems a nation rather than an army. I do not wonder <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> defeated yesterday, but <b>that</b> <b>we</b> so long held our ground, and that so many escaped from the battle." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{standing}} in the street, after being thus ignominiouly escorted thither, my little friend was plainly reduced to the 'piccolo giro,' or little circuit of the town, he had formerly proposed. But my suggestion <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should visit the Palazzo Te (of which I had heard a great deal, as a strange wild place) imparted new life to him, and away we went.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that Sergeant Corney was averse to talking with any of us {{concerning}} the future, for, as soon as it <b>was</b> known <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must decide at once upon some course, he kept aloof whenever he heard two or three discussing the question of what we Minute Boys ought to do, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> no longer needed at Fort Schuyler.|$|R
60|$|And {{scarcely}} a generation ago, we (one knows <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> only our fathers re-enlarged upon the earth), we, I say, ripped and rammed and pithed to admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are awfully good," [...] said Cicely, [...] "but {{you must}} {{agree with me}} more prudently <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> out here, and I will not tell mother until Miriam knows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Chris said. [...] "Then I {{will go in}} to Captain Brookfield and ask his {{permission}} to go. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in camp with him he must be consulted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes he can. He does. That is an invasion. And {{whether he}} is there or not, he can and will write about my house. And though {{no one else will}} make himself such a fool as he has done by his letter, {{nevertheless}} even that is a sign of what others are doing. You yourself <b>were</b> saying just <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to do something,--something particular, you said." ...|$|R
60|$|This was the memorable day {{chosen by}} Herr Grosse for risking the {{experiment}} of removing the bandage, and permitting Lucilla to try her sight {{for the first}} time. Conceive for yourselves (don't ask me to describe) the excitement that raged in our obscure little circle, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> standing {{face to face with}} that grand Event in our lives which I promised to relate in the opening sentence of these pages.|$|R
60|$|Bill Jepson {{acted as}} if he had {{suddenly}} lost his senses. He sang the wildest kind of songs, danced two or three hornpipes, and then insisted on Darius joining him, while Jim Freeman furnished the music by whistling fast and furiously. As a matter of fact, all of us, even including my father, were disposed to <b>be</b> exceeding jolly <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> homeward bound with the belief that the enemy was no longer in a position to annoy us.|$|R
