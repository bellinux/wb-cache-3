5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were {{much closer to}} those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. Amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E
5|$|According to Lokasenna, Loki rebukes {{the gods}} {{at the start}} of the poem for <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> {{welcoming}} him to the feast at Ægir's hall.

Víðarr does so, and then Loki toasts the Æsir before beginning his flyting.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a {{nationwide}} militia of men previously considered unsuitable {{for military service}} – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve {{on the front lines}} against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.|$|E

5|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp. The formation of dentin {{is known as}} dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E
5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.|$|E
5|$|Fox started {{displaying}} {{symptoms of}} early-onset Parkinson's disease in 1991 while shooting the movie Doc Hollywood, {{although he was}} <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> diagnosed until the next year. After his diagnosis, Fox started drinking heavily. He sought help and stopped drinking altogether. In 1998, {{he decided to go}} public with his condition, and since then, he has been a strong advocate of Parkinson's disease research. His foundation, The Michael J. Fox Foundation, was created to help advance every promising research path to curing Parkinson's disease, including embryonic stem cell studies.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 8May several satellite experts questioned the analysis of satellite pings made by Inmarsat staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured were apparently <b>not</b> <b>properly</b> corrected against the satellite's own drift (a periodic North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours). Without any additional data being released, the implication of this new analysis was that the northern portion of the Inmarsat satellite pings arc could not be ruled out. The Malaysian government released the satellite data three weeks later.|$|E

Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.|$|E
