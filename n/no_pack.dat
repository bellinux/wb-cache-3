In this packing, seen in the piles of oranges in every grocer's shop, the spheres occupy. 7405 of the space.

60|$|On {{approaching}} the house I was agreeably disappointed at having <b>no</b> <b>pack</b> of loud-mouthed, ferocious dogs rushing forth to rend the presumptuous stranger to pieces, a thing one always expects. The only {{signs of life}} visible were a white-haired old man seated within the corridor smoking, and {{a few yards from}} it a young girl standing under a willow-tree. But that girl was a picture for one to gaze long upon and carry about in his memory for a lifetime. Never had I beheld anything so exquisitely beautiful. It was not that kind of beauty so common in these countries, which bursts upon you like the sudden south-west wind called pampero, almost knocking the breath out of your body, then passing as suddenly away, leaving you with hair ruffled up and mouth full of dust. Its influence was more like that of the spring wind, which blows softly, scarcely fanning your cheek, yet infusing through all your system a delicious, magical sensation like--like nothing else in earth or heaven. She was, I fancy, about fourteen years old, slender and graceful in figure, and with a marvellously clear white skin, on which this bright Oriental sun had not painted one freckle. Her features were, I think, the most perfect I have ever seen in any human being, and her golden brown hair hung in two heavy braids behind, almost to her knees. As I approached, she looked up to me out of sweet, grey-blue eyes; there was a bashful smile on her lips, but she did not move or speak. On the willow-branch over her head were two young doves; they were, it appeared, her pets, unable yet to fly, and she had placed them there. The little things had crept up just beyond her reach, and she was trying to get them by pulling the branch down towards her.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a {{two-dimensional}} numerical fluid model is developed for a partially packed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in pure helium. In fluence of packing on the discharge characteristics is studied {{by comparing the}} results of DBD with partial packing with those obtained for DBD with <b>no</b> <b>packing.</b> In the axial partial packing configuration studied in this work, the electric field strength was shown to be en hanced at the top surface of the spherical packing material and at the contact points between the packing and the dielectric layer. For each value of applied potential, DBD with partial packing showed {{an increase in the number}} of pulses in the current profile in the positive half cycle of the applied voltage, as compared to DBD with <b>no</b> <b>packing.</b> Addition of partial packing to the plasma-alone DBD also led to an increase in the electron and ion number densities at the moment of breakdown. The time averaged electron energy profiles showed that a much higher range of electron energy can be achieved with the use of partial packing as compared to <b>no</b> <b>packing</b> in a DBD, at the same applied power. The spatially and time averaged values over one voltage cycle also showed an increase in power density and electron energy on inclusion of partial packing in the DBD.

50|$|Fell - The black-furred wolf {{once was}} tricked by Morgra, his aunt, {{into believing that}} he was the evil wolf, Wolfbane. Thanks to his sister Larka, though, he was snapped out of this. Fell still goes against Morgra even though she died several years ago. Fell feels guilt for his sister's death and became a Kerl (a wolf with <b>no</b> <b>pack)</b> because of the guilt. He also feels that since he was once Wolfbane, he is afraid of harming his family, and so stays away from them. He wonders about the Sight, and wonders what he should do. Several times he asks himself if he is in the light, or the dark. Ottol, a beaver, puts the same {{question}} past him, but tells Fell that he enjoys the sunlight like most creatures even if he chooses the darkness.

5000|$|In 2000, his friend, {{the former}} British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Nicholas Henderson, wrote: George {{is a man}} of moods. He is not {{complicated}} but a many-sided character. There are in fact four Georges: there is George the First, the unabstemious, boisterous Lothario, with a leer like a roué in a Peter Arno cartoon, blessed with an iron constitution and athletic prowess that enabled him to have been on the verge of the British Olympic ski and sleigh teams; then we have Hero George, the dashing man of action, a leader who whether descending by parachute or commanding by sea, kept the enemy on tenterhooks in the Eastern Mediterranean throughout the war; thirdly, there is George the aesthete and sightseer, who, with little finger raised, will speak discerningly of paintings, mosaics and furniture, a great patron of the arts, his talent as a collector manqué only due to lack of funds, which has not prevented some bold purchases; and finally we have pensive George, scholar and public servant, concerned to promote the national interest, high-minded, cautious and conscientious ... A striking and irrepressible feature of that character has been his easy communion with members of the opposite sex, and this may have been prefigured by an early experience. He spent some time as a small boy in New Zealand where his father was Governor-General. George wanted to become a wolf cub, but <b>no</b> <b>pack</b> was available, so instead he joined the Brownies.

40|$|International audienceThe Arctic Ocean is {{a region}} where the impact of global change is {{detected}} {{on an annual basis}} by a wide varietyof observations: buoys, research vessels and aircrafts. But the large area involved and the need of frequentsampling make polar orbiting satellites a prime source of observations for documenting the corresponding fastchanges, especially in summer. Sun reflected measurements in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of thespectrum are not very sensitive because of the elevated solar zenith angle. In these conditions, thermal infrared(TIR) measurements using spectra collected by high spectral resolution nadir sounders are a good complement todocument the high latitudes regions. In the present work the spectra acquired by the TANSO-FTS instrument onGOSAT and by the IASI instrument on the MetOp platforms have been used to test the retrieval capabilities ofthese Fourier transform spectrometers to retrieve the carbon dioxide column averaged mixing ratio XCO 2 aswell as the sea surface temperature (SST) used as an inversion diagnostic. Results for 3 observing periods insummer (July, August, September) and 6 years (2010 to 2015) have been obtained in the latitude range 68 N to 82 N over open water (<b>no</b> <b>pack</b> ice). The retrieved products have been analyzed from a climatologic point of viewto assess inter-annual variability and trends of TIR derived XCO 2 and SST zonal averages (3 summer monthsand 7 bins of 2 ° in latitude). Results will be described and compared with other sources of information. This typeof study is important for preparing future satellite missions like IASI-NG (a follow-on of IASI) and GOSAT- 2 (afollow-on of GOSAT).

40|$|Carrying {{heavy and}} {{moderate}} military loads in backpacks or as body armour compresses the chest, causing {{a change in}} lung function that is typical of a restrictive ventilatory impairment. It is not known if a lighter backpack load of only 6 kg, such as is typical of loads carried by students, will have a similar effect on lung function. There have been no studies examining whether backpacks of different strapping styles {{have an effect on}} lung function. Several designs of student backpack have recently been introduced to the market. One of the most popular is a single-strap backpack. This study examined Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV 1), FEV 1. FVC(- 1) % and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) in 13 participants (4 males, 9 females) wearing each of two 6 kg backpacks, one with two shoulder straps (a Double Strap Backpack (DSB)) and the other with a single strap (a Single Strap Backpack (SSB)) worn across the shoulder and chest. In comparison with the control of <b>no</b> <b>pack</b> (N), SSB significantly reduced FVC (by 3. 94 %, p = 0. 006) but {{there were no significant differences}} in FEV 1, FEV 1. FVC(- 1) % and PEF. The DSB also significantly reduced FVC (by 1. 97 %, p = 0. 034) but no significant differences were found in FEV 1, FEV 1. FVC(- 1) % and PEF measures. In comparison with DSB, the SSB was associated with a significantly lower FVC (by 2. 05 %, p = 0. 049) and FEV 1 (by 1. 88 %, p = 0. 029) but there were no significant changes in FEV 1. FVC(- 1) % and PEF. It is concluded that a backpack load of 6 kg could produce a mild restrictive type of ventilatory impairment in lung function. This effect was greater for a single cross-chest strap than for a more conventional double strap harness. Validerad; 2004; 20080819 (andbra...|$|E
