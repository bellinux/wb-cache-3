5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Raskolnikov is {{introduced}} to the detective Porfiry, who begins to suspect him of the murder purely on psychological grounds. At the same time, a chaste relationship develops between Raskolnikov and Sonya. Sonya, though a prostitute, is full of Christian virtue and is only driven into the profession by her family's poverty. Meanwhile, Razumikhin and Raskolnikov manage to keep Dunya from continuing her relationship with Luzhin, whose true character is exposed to be conniving and base. At this point, Svidrigaïlov appears on the scene, having come from the province to Petersburg, almost solely to seek out Dunya. He reveals that his wife, Marfa Petrovna, is dead, {{and that he is}} willing to pay Dunya a vast sum of money in exchange for <b>nothing.</b> <b>She,</b> upon hearing the news, refuses flat out, suspecting him of treachery.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the capture of Success on 13 December, St Fiorenzo and Clyde captured the privateer Dorade eight days later. The actual captor of Dorade was Clyde. Dorade was from Bordeaux and was pierced for 18 guns, though she only had 12. She had been out 50 days and had been cruising off the Azores and Madeira, but had captured <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> and her crew of 93 men {{were on their way}} home when Clyde captured her.

Damas had left Cumaná, Venezuela, ten days earlier for a cruise off Demerara on what was her first cruise, but had captured <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> put up a little resistance and there was fire from the shore, but Kingsfisher suffered no casualties. In April 1826 head money for the capture of the Deux Amis and the Damas was finally paid.|$|E

25|$|In print, Matuschka {{has worked}} {{with some of the}} world's renowned photographers {{including}} Nick Knight for Dazed and Confused, Robert Maxwell for More Magazine and Nadav Kander for his book, Beauty's <b>Nothing.</b> <b>She</b> posed for Gerard Malanga (of Warhol's factory), Don Snyder, Push Pin Studios, Bill Cunningham (The New York Times), Jeff Dunas for Oui Magazine and was featured in Mr. Dunas' book, Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle! in 1983. In the 70s and 80s she apprenticed with Town & Country / Harper's Bazaar photographer Bill Silano, perfecting her printing skills in the darkroom. Matuschka's experience as a photographic assistant and model was essential to her development both behind a camera and in the darkroom. Working alongside masters such as Clemens Kalischer, Bill Silano and Don Snyder, she learned the art of chemically toning and manipulating silver gelatin prints.|$|E

500|$|The Upanishad, in verses 26 to 28, {{asserts that}} Devi is [...] "Unknowable, the Endless, the Incomprehensible, the Unknown, the One and the Many."

All {{knowledge}} is her inherent characteristic, beyond her there is <b>nothing,</b> <b>she</b> is {{the pilot of}} worldly life.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a fit of}} depression, Stephanie confides to Morelli {{that she}} quit {{her job as a}} bounty hunter because she feels [...] "stupid and boring" [...] - she has no career path, no hobbies, no strong interests, and <b>nothing</b> <b>she's</b> really good at.

500|$|In 2006, she starred as a cheerleading {{captain in}} the film , the third {{installment}} of the Bring It On series, alongside American actress and singer Hayden Panettiere. What little critical reaction the low-budget, direct-to-DVD movie got was negative, and Knowles was described as an [...] "affordable young starlet". Knowles uses her full name for her acting, rather than just the first name she uses when singing; for Bring It On: All or <b>Nothing,</b> <b>she</b> was billed as Solange Knowles-Smith, reflecting her married state at the time.|$|E
500|$|When Iris Chang was a child, she {{was told}} by her parents, who had escaped with their {{families}} from China to Taiwan {{and then to the}} United States after World War II, that during the Nanking Massacre, the Japanese [...] "sliced babies not just in half but in thirds and fourths." [...] In the introduction of The Rape of Nanking, she wrote that throughout her childhood, the Nanking Massacre [...] "remained buried in the back of [...] mind as a metaphor for unspeakable evil." [...] When she searched the local public libraries in her school and found <b>nothing,</b> <b>she</b> wondered why no one had written a book about it.|$|E
500|$|I had two {{ideas that}} did not fit the song. She said no even though I had a very clear idea of how she would look in the video. I worked up on another idea and brought {{together}} a featured band for her to see. I did it all in front of me. [...] In retrospect, it feels good, the video we have done much better suited to the track than the first ideas. [...] has an incredible track on everything she is doing. Style, music, business— she has a mental track of every single thing and won't give up until she is completely satisfied. And on music videos there is <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> does {{with one hand on}} her back— she's engaged to one hundred percent.|$|E

500|$|Scholars such as Claudia Tate suggest {{there is}} a theme of jealousy {{throughout}} the novel. Irene displays it here when deciding whether to expose Clare or not [...] "She was caught between two allegiances, different, yet the same. Herself. Her race. Race! The thing that bound and suffocated her. Whatever steps she took, or if she took none at all, something would be crushed. A person or the race. Clare, herself, or the race. Or, it might be, all three. <b>Nothing,</b> <b>she</b> imagined, was ever more completely sardonic.” Larsen uses jealousy as {{the main source of}} conflict in the novel, and uses race solely as a vehicle for Irene to potentially rid herself of Clare. At this point in the story Irene realizes she can expose Clare’s true racial identity to remove Clare from her life, and regain that security she desires more than anything.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{relieved}} that war was over, Alice was {{appalled by the}} behaviour of Prussian troops in Hesse; Berlin took the grand duchy's railways and telegraph systems, and assessed Hesse for three million florins in indemnity. Alice wrote to her mother, who in turn wrote to Princess Victoria, who responded that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could do to relieve the [...] "painful and distressing position darling Alice was in", as it was [...] "one of the unavoidable results of this dreadful war". Influence came from the Emperor of Russia, who urged the Prussian King to allow the Grand Duke to keep his throne. The facts that the Emperor's mother was the Grand Duke's aunt, and Alice's sister being also the Prussian Crown Princess {{are likely to have}} influenced Prussia's generosity. However, Alice was angered by an untactful visit by Princess Victoria to the conquered region of Homburg, originally part of Hesse, shortly after it became Prussian territory.|$|E
500|$|Quinn's car {{accident}} has {{left her in}} a wheelchair, suffering from a severely compressed spine. By [...] "Prom-asaurus" [...] {{she is able to}} stand and to walk a few steps in the sessions. When Quinn is nominated for prom queen, Finn agrees to campaign with her, but is outraged when he discovers that she has been hiding the fact that she can now stand for the sympathy vote. When Quinn and Santana count the votes, they discover that Finn has won and so has Quinn. Quinn realizes that the victory means <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> and Santana falsely report the prom queen results as a write-in victory for Rachel. Her recovery is rapid enough to allow her to dance in the [...] "Nationals" [...] competition episode, which New Directions wins. Quinn helps Puck study for the test he needs to pass in order to graduate. She tells him that with all they went through, they are bonded for life, and she kisses him. Emboldened, Puck passes his test. Later, Quinn returns her cheerleading uniform to Sue, and the two have a tearful farewell.|$|E

500|$|In metaphors {{carried over}} from the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{describes}} marriage as a prison and women as slaves within it in The Wrongs of Woman. In the first chapter Maria laments, [...] " [...] not the world a vast prison, and women born slaves?" [...] and later she makes a politically charged allusion to the French prison, the Bastille: [...] "marriage had bastilled me for life". Moreover, Maria's body is bought and sold like a slave's: she is worth £5,000 on the open marriage market and her new husband attempts to sell her into prostitution. Commenting on her condition, Maria states: [...] "a wife being as much a man's property as his horse, or his ass, she has <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> can call her own". In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft had used the metaphor of slavery not only to describe the horrors of marriage as it currently existed but also to offer a juxtaposition {{to the possibility of}} a new kind of marriage, one which assumed equality between affectionate and rational partners. In The Wrongs of Woman, this option is never presented; instead, the reader is shown a series of disastrous marriages in which women are abused, robbed, and abandoned.|$|E
500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} Daniel Chun, his sixth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the fifth season. It was directed by series cinematographer Matt Sohn, his fourth directing credit for the series. [...] "Tallahassee" [...] marked the return appearance of Catherine Tate, who previously appeared in the seventh season finale, [...] "Search Committee" [...] as a candidate to replace Michael as office manager. Tate was initially the top choice to join the cast as the manager, but due to {{a commitment to the}} West End production of the Shakespeare play, Much Ado About <b>Nothing</b> <b>she</b> was unable to join the series {{at the start of the}} season. Her character, Nellie is introduced as the head of a special project for Sabre. She appeared in a six episode arc, during which, her character also got romantically involved with Robert. The episode also marked the return appearance of David Koechner, who portrays Todd Packer in the series. He recently made a deal with NBC to do more episodes for the series and also possibly join the cast of series developer Greg Daniels's next series, Friday Night Dinner, an adaption of the British series of the same name.|$|E
