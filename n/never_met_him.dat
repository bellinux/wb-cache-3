5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E

As he departs Detroit on a bus, he angrily remarks to Homer that he {{would have been better off}} if he <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> and that as far as he is concerned, he has no brother. While Marge tries to console Homer, Lisa agrees with Herb and laments on his life before he discovered he was a [...] "Simpson". Grampa soon arrives and asks about Herb.

500|$|Jim Beaver made an {{appearance}} on [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] as Lawson, the gun vendor from the opening scene. Beaver previously starred in the HBO western drama series Deadwood along with Breaking Bad star Anna Gunn. He also previously appeared in [...] "Field Trip", a sixth season episode of The X-Files which was written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan. While Gilligan believed Beaver to be a talented actor, he had <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> during the filming of either show. The CW Network television series Supernatural, in which Beaver co-stars, was filming {{at the same time}} as [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub", so Beaver flew into Albuquerque for the Breaking Bad shoot and had only half a day to film the scenes. Mastras said he particularly enjoyed that the character tries to convince Walter to buy a gun legally because, [...] "I like the aspect that you've got this black market dealer who in an ironic way is the sound of morality here." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} the episode and the {{character}} of Patrick began when Robert Downey, Jr. telephoned the show production staff {{and asked if he}} could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his son is a fan of the show, so the producers came up with the character of Patrick for Downey. Show producer Seth MacFarlane believes Downey [...] "did a great job," [...] and brought a [...] "very kind of half crazy, and maybe just eccentric personality to that character that really worked out great." [...] When Patrick makes his second appearance in season 10's [...] "Killer Queen", he is not voiced by Downey. Instead, he is voiced by Family Guy writer, and recurring guest voice actor, Danny Smith. Bob Barker voiced himself presenting The Price Is Right; but the actual sequence took years to make. Barker has provided his voice for the show twice, although MacFarlane has <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> John Veiner voiced Bobby McFerrin falling down a flight of stairs. The ball-in-a-cup scene is commented upon by MacFarlane, where he states that [...] "the voice-overs work, the drawings work" [...] and that Walter Murphy [...] "did a great job of creating a piece of deliberately annoying music." [...] Several jokes had been pitched for Peter's words after killing an evil dragon, but all were dropped, as they weren't deemed funny enough by production staff.|$|E

Collins said, [...] "It floored me completely ... I had <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> I rang him up and said, 'Hi Chester, I've heard your stuff, {{would you like to}} play with Genesis?' ... He didn't even audition!" [...] Genesis toured Wind & Wuthering from January to July 1977 across Europe, North America, and for the first time, Brazil. The stage show cost £400,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). which featured a new PA system, lasers and smoke, and lighting supplied from two rows of Boeing 747 aircraft landing lights. Touring began on 1 January with three sold-out shows at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where 80,000 applications were made for the 8,000 available tickets. They returned to London for three nights at Earls Court, then the largest arena in Britain, supported by Richie Havens. The band's growing popularity in North America led to television appearances and concerts organised in larger venues than previous tours, including Madison Square Garden in New York City. Their Brazilian dates were attended by over 150,000 people and a proposed 100,000-person gig was cancelled over rioting fears. An armed bodyguard accompanied each member throughout their stay.|$|E

2500|$|Machen {{was also}} a pioneer in psychogeography, due to his {{interest}} in the interconnection between landscape and the mind. His strange wanderings in Wales and London recorded in his beautiful prose make him of great interest to writers on this subject, especially those focusing on London, such as Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd. Alan Moore wrote an exploration of Machen's mystical experiences in his work Snakes and Ladders. Aleister Crowley loved Machen's works, feeling they contained [...] "Magickal" [...] truth, {{and put them on the}} reading list for his students, though Machen, who <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> detested Crowley. Other occultists, such as Kenneth Grant, also find Machen an inspiration. Far closer to Machen's personal mystical world view was his effect on his friend Evelyn Underhill, who reflected some of Machen's thinking in her highly influential book Mysticism.|$|E

Compared with Newman, Froude wrote, Keble, Pusey, and the other Tractarians [...] "were all but as ciphers, and he the indicating number". Newman's face was [...] "remarkably like that of Julius Caesar. ...I have often thought of the resemblance, and believed that it extended to the temperament. In both there was an original force of character which refused to be moulded by circumstances, which was to make its own way, and become a power in the world; a clearness of intellectual perception, a disdain for conventionalities, a temper imperious and wilful, but along with it a most attaching gentleness, sweetness, singleness of heart and purpose. Both were formed by nature to command others, both had the faculty of attracting to themselves the passionate devotion of their friends and followers. ...For hundreds of young men Credo in Newmannum was the veritable symbol of faith." ...|$|E

[...] She told a similar story to an interviewer from Hot Press in December 1990.

[...] However, he only began receiving widespread name recognition after his intimate score to the 1962 classic western Lonely Are the Brave.

[...] Goldsmith's score went on to garner him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, though he lost to fellow first-time nominee Maurice Jarre for his music to Lawrence of Arabia (1962). In 1963, Goldsmith composed a score to The Stripper, his first collaboration with director Franklin J. Schaffner for whom Goldsmith would later score the films Planet of the Apes (1968), Patton (1970), Papillon (1973), and The Boys from Brazil (1978).|$|E

Despite being three years older than Riki and having <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in Guardian, Daryl knew Riki by his reputation and admired him. Daryl loved him because of his pride and his will not to bow down, which continued when Daryl met Riki again when he first came to Tanagura. As Riki's caretaker, Daryl tried his best effort to look after Riki, much to Riki's annoyance, while still maintaining his distance. Although Riki never treated with Daryl with a lot of respect, he found a comfortable companion in Daryl, who was dutiful, kind, and taught him the rules of Tanagura. Like Katze, Daryl was skilled at hacking, and used this talent to hack Eos Tower's security system to help Riki escape. Having aided an escape attempt and hacking Tanagura's system, he is executed for his crimes; however, Daryl did not regret his actions, as he was happy that Riki was still himself. Although most of Eos Tower knows of Daryl's fate, Riki never knew that Daryl tried to helped him or that he was killed for his actions. Knowing that Riki will feel guilty for Daryl's death and would keep Daryl's memory in his heart, Iason kept Riki in the dark and told him that Daryl was replaced by Cal due to rearrangement with the Furnitures.
