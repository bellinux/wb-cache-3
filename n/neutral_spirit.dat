25|$|Though {{the actual}} source Shakespeare used {{has not yet}} been determined, it seems clear that Shakespeare's Ariel and his {{relationship}} with Prospero reflects more closely the Renaissance idea of a <b>neutral</b> <b>spirit</b> under the control of a magician than the religious idea of a sprite. Shakespeare, however, refuses to make Ariel a will-less character, infusing him with desires and near-human feelings uncharacteristic of most sprites of this type.|$|E

60|$|It is {{a curious}} trait {{of the human mind}} that, however little {{personal}} interest one may have in the result, it is impossible to prevent oneself taking sides in any event of a competitive nature. I had embarked on this affair in a purely <b>neutral</b> <b>spirit,</b> not caring which of the two won and only sorry that both could not lose. Yet, as the morning wore on, I found myself almost unconsciously becoming distinctly pro-Jukes. I did not like the man. I objected to his face, his manners, and the colour of his tie. Yet there was something in the dogged way in which he struggled against adversity which touched me and won my grudging support. Many men, I felt, having been so outmanoeuvred at the start, would have given up the contest in despair; but Arthur Jukes, for all his defects, had the soul of a true golfer. He declined to give up. In grim silence he hacked his ball through the rough till he reached the high road; and then, having played twenty-seven, set himself resolutely to propel it on its long journey.|$|E

40|$|The spirit {{beverages}} {{of vodka}} and gin are often produced from a <b>neutral</b> <b>spirits</b> base. These <b>neutral</b> <b>spirits</b> {{are derived from}} the distillation of fermented carbohydrates of agricultural origin. The fermentations {{in the production of}} these beverages are not often reported in great detail and to some extent are shrouded in mystery. The roles of fermentation and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are essential to the complete process, and without fermentation there would not be alcohol to distil. Nevertheless, it is not the yeast that is perceived to contribute to the distinctive consumer experiences, which are associated with these beverages. However, there are opportunities for the development of new strains of S. cerevisiae for the production of <b>neutral</b> <b>spirits,</b> which have a high ethanol yield, are tolerant of ethanol stress, and produce low levels of congeners...|$|R
5000|$|There is no aging {{requirement}} {{under the}} U.S. Code of Federal Regulations for American whiskey for the <b>neutral</b> grain <b>spirits</b> in an American blended whiskey, {{although there is}} a 2-year minimum aging requirement for straight whiskey (and for the straight whiskey used in the mixture from which a blended whiskey is formulated) and there is a requirement for an age statement on the label of a blended whiskey containing <b>neutral</b> <b>spirits</b> in cases where the straight whiskey used in the blend is less than 4 years old. A labeling age statement on American blended whiskey that contains <b>neutral</b> <b>spirits</b> (per Title 27, Part 5, Subpart C, Section 5.40) ordinarily refers only to the age of the 20% content of the product that is the straight whiskey used within the blend, and the <b>neutral</b> grain <b>spirits</b> used in the blend may not have been aged. The company web site for Old Thompson refers to it as [...] "4 Year Old Blended American Whiskey", and the picture of the label itself on the web site does not show an age statement, so Old Thompson is formulated from 20% 4 year old straight whiskey and 80% (un-aged) <b>neutral</b> <b>spirits.</b>|$|R
