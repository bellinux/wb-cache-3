5|$|Once Romania {{recovered}} possession {{over its}} southern areas, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was reportedly prosecuted for treason and was again sent to Văcărești. Others however <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> last sentence, passed in 1919, {{was not in}} fact related to his wartime dealings, but merely to his fraudulent activities, and that only by coincidence did Bogdan-Pitești share a prison with the convicted collaborationist journalists (Arghezi, Karnabatt, Ioan Slavici).|$|E
5|$|Between {{these last}} two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In {{the case of the}} bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards the direction in which the bike is traveling. <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> idealized model does not exhibit the wobble or shimmy and rear wobble instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{claimed that}} {{there was no mention of}} the case in police records held by {{archives}} in Adelaide, but that instead, the incident had been related to him by residents of the district who had known Brown. He also placed it as having occurred between 1860 and 1870. Foster et al. <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> date is highly unlikely, as frontier violence in the district began when squatters arrived in 1843, and was tapering off by 1848 when the murders occurred. By the 1860s, Aboriginal labour was highly sought after by pastoralists in the district due to the exodus of white labourers to the Victorian gold rush.|$|E
5|$|Justice Potter Stewart, {{joined by}} Justice Hugo Black, dissented. Stewart {{acknowledged}} that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred hunting and fishing rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that the Termination Act subjected {{the members of the}} tribe to the same laws that all other citizens of Wisconsin were held to, including hunting and fishing regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no bearing on the case and the rights were not protected by the Termination Act, so they were lost. Stewart did <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would have also made the claim for compensation valid under Shoshone Tribe v. United States, regardless of whether Congress intended it or not. He would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
