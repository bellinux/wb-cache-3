40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the {{growth rates of}} two countries and the bilateral income disparity in <b>relation</b> to <b>North-South</b> trade mainly {{from the viewpoint of}} the South. We extend a Ricardian trade model with a continuum of goods in order to consider a situation where the South faces the balance-of-payments constraint while the North is in full employment. Using the model, we show that {{depending on the size of}} a technological parameter, two possibilities arise with regard to the growth of the South: (1) the South can catch up with the North in income level by expanding its comparative advantage sectors, and (2) the South, in contrast, fails to catch up with the North in spite of expanding its comparative advantage sectors. Moreover, we show that if the South is in the catching-up process, a policy intended to improve its international price competitiveness exerts a positive effect on its growth, thereby promoting the catching-up process, whereas if the South is in the falling-behind process, such a policy exerts a negative effect on its growth, thereby leading to immiserizing growth. cumulative causation, <b>North-South</b> <b>relation,</b> Ricardian trade, shifts in comparative advantage, Thirlwall's law,...|$|R

This paper argues for a new approach that puts the emphasis on efforts to improve the development relevance of WTO rules and create mechanisms which allow greater differentiation across WTO members in determining the applicability of WTO disciplines; complemented by non-discriminatory liberalisation of trade in goods and services in which developing countries have an export interest. The former is key in allowing the WTO to expand its reach to new `behind the border¿ policies; and the latter is important to establishing a development dimension in multilateral trade negotiations...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{research}} {{thesis is}} {{a critique of}} the main explanations of regional integration in West Africa. In critiquing West African regional integration, this research introduces and integrates the growing literature on the concept of warlords with theory of regional integration. The main explanations of West African regional integration are functionalism and federalism respectively. The critique in this study is informed by the practical lack of successful regional integration in West Africa, i. e. the failure to merge West African states and establish regional co-operation through regional integration. With regards to West African regional integration, the conventional, also known as the traditional view, argues and maintains that on practical and theoretical levels, integrationist approaches are inherently inappropriate to such integration because they ignore complex realities faced by states that are integrating or wish to integrate. According to the conventional argument, these realities include forces such as globalisation, the nature of <b>North-South</b> trade <b>relations,</b> the colonial experience, which today is responsible for the chaotic social-political and economic landscape in regions such as West Africa This landscape is characterised by economically, politically and institutionally weak countries...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT THE EVOLUTION OF COFFEE MARKETS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: A HONDURAN COOPERATIVE???S EXPERIENCE WITH FAIR TRADE by Erin Sue Smith Master of Arts in Anthropology California State University, Chico Spring 2010 This thesis {{explores the}} {{barriers}} coffee farmers of Cooperativa Copan in Western Honduras face in effectively {{participating in the}} Fair Trade market, {{as well as the}} opportunities Fair Trade offers in improving the conditions of these farmers and the environment. It also highlights the political and economic relationships that constitute the global coffee industry and the many links between points of production and consumption along the coffee value chain. Fair Trade has become an important alternative trade strategy in the world economy as it confronts the power inequalities and exploitations within the <b>North-South</b> trade <b>relations.</b> Despite the limitations of Fair Trade as both a movement and an alternative market for Cooperativa Copan, this research suggests that Fair Trade {{has proven to be a}} key contributor to sustainable income- generating strategies and socio-economic stability among rural, small-scale farmers in Copan. In the case of Cooperativa Copan, access to Fair Trade and organic markets was made possible by the development support from NGOs and Fair Trade networks in the region. CSU, Chic...|$|R
40|$|Changes are reverberating {{through the}} {{international}} development system. This {{article focuses on}} (re) emerging development actors in the South and their role in setting agendas, challenging current aid orthodoxies, and re-articulating development cooperation relationships between and within the North and South. Specifically, the article examines trilateral development cooperation, a significant new trend in foreign aid. The first aim {{is to examine the}} role of trilateral development cooperation in the changing geographies of development and global partnerships. The second aim is to foreground and critically evaluate the politics of trilateral development cooperation. The authors argue that trilateral development cooperation has potential to improve aid effectiveness, harness the energies and expertise of southern partners, and reshape development relations in more egalitarian ways. Alternatively, however, it may work to co-opt (re) emerging donors into a depoliticized and ineffective aid system. While this argument has been made by many critics with regard to <b>North–South</b> development <b>relations,</b> the authors also question the projection of shared interests and essentialized developing country identities in relation to the South–South element of trilateral development cooperation. The article concludes by emphasizing the need to extend critical perspectives to all elements of the new development partnerships emerging within a rapidly changing global landscape...|$|R
