5|$|In the skull, {{the front}} part (rostrum) is large, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as in A.budini. The skull is more robust {{than in the}} very similar Akodon boliviensis, but less so than in A.simulator. The hourglass-shaped interorbital region (between the eyes) is {{narrower}} than in A.caenosus and not as squared as in A.polopi. Members of the Akodon varius group, with which Akodon oenos was formerly associated, tend to have much broader interorbital regions. The braincase is somewhat inflated and bears well-developed temporal and lambdoid crests relative {{to the situation in}} A.caenosus; Akodon polopi has even better developed crests.|$|E
5|$|It soars high while {{searching for}} food, holding its wings {{horizontally}} when gliding. It flaps in short bursts which {{are followed by}} short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long,</b> forming a smaller wing area. In comparison with the turkey vulture, the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight. Like all New World vultures, the black vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation {{of the water in}} the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a syrinx, the black vulture, like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The black vulture is , and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures. The black vulture generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture, which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.|$|E
5|$|Lepiota castaneidisca {{closely resembles}} L.cristata (with {{which it has}} {{commonly}} been confused), {{but it has a}} more rounded cap, lacks an umbo, and is reddish- or pinkish-brown, rather than orange-brown. L.cristata, which is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, prefers habitats where the natural vegetational cover has been disturbed by humans, or in the beds of rivers and creeks; in contrast, L.castaneidisca is found in natural, undisturbed habitats. Other similar species in similar habitats with which L.castaneidisca could be confused include L.thiersii and L.neophana; in contrast to L.castaneidisca, both of the latter two species have ellipsoid spores. The fruit bodies of L.thiersii appear from November through April, and grow scattered or in groups under cypress. It usually lacks the reddish color {{in the center of the}} cap associated with L.castaneidisca, and its spores are <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long,</b> with dimensions of 4.7–6.3 by 3.1–3.9μm. L.neophana is a rare species, but more widely distributed in the United States than L.castaneidisca, as it has been reported from Ohio and Michigan in addition to California. It also fruits under cypress, usually between December and April. This mushroom is most readily distinguished from L.castaneidisca by the dark brown to blackish-brown color of the cap center.|$|E

5|$|The forelimbs of Allosaurus {{were short}} in {{comparison}} to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed claws. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2ulna/humerus ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof-like than those of earlier theropods. Each foot had three weight-bearing toes and an inner dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot.|$|E

500|$|Transandinomys bolivaris is a {{medium-sized}} rice rat with very long superciliary vibrissae (more than [...] long and extending {{well beyond the}} ears when laid back against the head). According to Fiona Reid's Mammals of Southeastern Mexico & Central America, it is distinguishable from any similarly sized rice rats by the length of these whiskers; T.talamancae also has long superciliary vibrissae, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as in T.bolivaris. In both species, the mystacial vibrissae (above the mouth) are also long and extend beyond the ears when laid back, but they are again much longer in T.bolivaris. The vibrissae are mostly dark, but translucent at the tips. Handleyomys alfaroi, a rice rat with which young T.bolivaris are often confused, is much smaller. In T.bolivaris, the cheeks may be light gray, , or reddish. The ears are dark brown to black and are sparsely haired.|$|E
500|$|Competing at {{his first}} Olympic Games, Julius Mutekanga {{qualified}} for the London Games via qualification standards because his fastest time of one minute, 46.30 seconds, recorded at the 2011 Ninove Memorial Geert Rasschaert, met the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for his event, the 800 metres. In an interview with New York Press before the Games he said he promised to ensure {{that he would make}} the best of his participation: [...] "When you’re running, you’re looking at improving your personal best time, so it doesn’t matter whether you win or <b>not.</b> <b>As</b> <b>long</b> as you’re running faster and faster, that’s the ultimate goal." [...] Mutekanga took part in the first round's seventh heat on 6 August, finishing fifth out of eight athletes, with a time of one minute and 48.41 seconds. He ranked ahead of Moise Joseph from Haiti (one minute and 48.46 seconds) and Equatorial Guinea's Benjamín Enzema (one minute and 57.47 seconds) in a heat led by Duane Solomon of the United States (one minute and 46.05 seconds). Overall Mutekanga finished 35th out of 52 athletes, and was 2.06 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his heat who advanced to the semi-final and, therefore, {{that was the end of}} his competition.|$|E

2500|$|The Restoration is {{an unusual}} {{historical}} period, as its literature is bounded by a specific political event: {{the restoration of the}} Stuart monarchy. It is unusual in another way, as well, for it is a time when the influence of that king's presence and personality permeated literary society to such an extent that, almost uniquely, literature reflects the court. The adversaries of the restoration, the Puritans and democrats and republicans, similarly respond to the peculiarities of the king and the king's personality. Therefore, a top-down view of the literary history of the Restoration has more validity than that of most literary epochs. [...] "The Restoration" [...] as a critical concept covers the duration of the effect of Charles and Charles's manner. This effect extended beyond his death, in some instances, and <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as his life, in others.|$|E

2500|$|The Duchess often squabbled {{with her}} {{mother-in-law}} on how {{she should be}} addressed at court. As the Tsar’s only daughter, Maria Alexandrovna had precedence over all the Grand Duchesses in Russia. She therefore deeply resented having to give precedence in England to the Princess of Wales. From her birth, Maria Alexandrovna was an Imperial Highness {{as the daughter of}} an Emperor. However, once she married her husband she was only entitled to the style of Royal Highness. Tsar Alexander II alleged that his daughter should continue to be styled as an Imperial Highness, not royal, [...] "as in all civilized countries". Queen Victoria replied that she did not care whether imperial was used or <b>not,</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as royal came first. [...] There was also the added problem that Maria was both Duchess of Edinburgh and Grand Duchess of Russia, and which title should be written first. In retaliation for the quarrel over precedence, the Duchess of Edinburgh took great pleasure in showing off her magnificent jewellery. The English princesses were clearly jealous of her diamonds, as was Queen Victoria. Meriel Buchanan, daughter of the last British ambassador to Imperial Russia, described Maria’s first Drawing Room: [...] "The Queen compared the Duchess’s tiara with those of her own daughters, shrugging her shoulders like a bird whose plumage has been ruffled, her mouth drawn down at the corners, in an expression which those who knew her had learned to dread." ...|$|E
