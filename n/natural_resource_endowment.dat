5000|$|The most {{significant}} factor in rapid industrialization was the adoption of an outward-looking strategy in the early 1960s. [...] This strategy was particularly well-suited to that time because of South Korea's poor <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowment,</b> low savings rate, and tiny domestic market. The strategy promoted economic growth through labor-intensive manufactured exports, in which South Korea could develop a competitive advantage. Government initiatives {{played an important role}} in this process. Through the model of export-led industrialization, the South Korean government incentivized corporations to develop new technology and upgrade productive efficiency in order to compete in the highly-competitive, global market. By adhering to state regulations and demands, firms were awarded subsidization and investment support to rapidly develop their export markets in the fast-paced, evolving international arena. In addition, the inflow of foreign capital was greatly encouraged to supplement the shortage of domestic savings. These efforts enabled South Korea to achieve rapid growth in exports and subsequent increases in income.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} SSA has derived a minimal growth benefit from trade {{because of what}} it exports and that the {{detrimental}} effect of primary commodity export dependence on SSA growth can be captured by two structural variables, natural barriers to trade (NBT, trade costs) and <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowments</b> (NRE, primary commodity dependence). The analysis {{is based on a}} large panel of developing countries for 1970 to 2008 and explicitly tests for threshold effects in the structural variables. We find that high trade costs and <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowments</b> {{have a negative effect on}} growth and that the combination of these two factors accounts for the SSA dummy: SSA countries tend to have high values of NRE and NBT and this helps to explain why SSA countries experienced lower growth than other developing countries (the significant negative dummy for SSA). The trade variables also performed as expected. Exports and trade openness generally contribute to growth, but their effect on growth is affected by the structural variables; specifically high values as observed in SSA dampen the positive impact of trade on growth. The poor growth of SSA relative to other regions is largely accounted for by the combination of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowments</b> and high transport costs so that the dependence on primary commodity exports has not supported growth...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 35 years, income {{structures}} and poverty levels in Thailand have generally {{followed the same}} patterns as most developing countries. This study shows a growing income inequality between different groups of the Thai population. However, the country's poverty levels, whether expressed {{as a percent of}} the total population or in absolute terms, have reduced significantly. These contrasting results are explained by two main factors: <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowments</b> and the effects of government policies on income distribution. Growth patterns and income structures in each region, especially in the agricultural sector, are primarily determined by <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowments.</b> These regional and sectoral endowments are either strengthened or weakened by government policies. Among these policies, the economic and social development plans have a great impact on income distribution.

40|$|Since {{the breakup}} of the colonial empires {{following}} World War II, many newly independent states have embarked on a path of seeking political and economic development. Scholars studying this phenomenon soon became aware of an interesting puzzle. Why do the economies that have substantial <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowments</b> at their disposal tend to develop at a slower rate than economies that are less endowed with <b>natural</b> <b>resources?</b> From this question, the resource curse theory was derived. The resource curse theory has three main claims. The first claim is that resource rich economies grow at a slower rate than non-resource rich economies. The second claim is that resource rich states are more prone to conflict. The last claim, that resource rich states are more prone to corruption, will be addressed by this study. Using data on resource rents and resource exports, this study utilizes statistical modeling to test the relationship between <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowments</b> and corruption. This study finds that only fuel related <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> have a statistically significant and negative relationship with perceptions of corruption due to asset specificity and relative scarcity...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} examine several forms of communication approaches for disseminating agricultural technology and information. This study was based on a baseline survey conducted in four agroecosystems of South Sumatra Province, i. e. tidal swamp, swamp, dry lowland, and irrigated lowland. Results indicated that the social economic condition and <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowment</b> of farmers in the swamp agro-ecosystem zone (AEZ) of Ogan Komering Ilir is suitable for fishery development instead of food crop agribusiness. However, farmers in the swamp AEZ need technologies that reduce their workload in land cultivation and weeding activities. Further, as field extension workers (FEWs) were considered as the source of agricultural information by most farmers, the involvement of FEWs in agricultural research and technology assessment will increase the effectiveness of the innovation transfer, especially in the tidal swamp and irrigated lowland AEZs. In the four AEZs, the FEWs and farmer group leader can be used as an effective channel to convey agricultural technology and information in South Sumatra Province...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} {{theoretical}} and empirical insights into the puzzling simultaneous rise in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in Africa and capital flight from the continent over the past decades. It specifically explores two questions: Is FDI a potential driver of capital flight? And, is <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowment</b> a possible channel for the capital flight-FDI link? The econometric analysis is based on 32 African countries over the period 1970 - 2013 using dynamic panel data estimation methods. Three important findings emerge from the analysis. First, {{while there is no}} robust evidence that capital flight is fuelled by annual FDI inflows (there is no equivalent to debt-fuelled capital flight), there is a positive relationship between the stock of FDI and capital flight. Second, <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowment</b> is directly related positively to capital flight and resource endowment is associated with a stronger FDI stock-capital flight link, {{especially in the case of}} oil. Third, high-quality institutions somehow weaken the link between FDI and capital flight, although they do not completely eliminate the relationship. The results point to potential gains from improvements in institutional quality in African countries through minimizing the contribution of FDI and natural resources to capital flight...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the complex relationship {{that exists between}} poverty and <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> degradation in developing countries. The rural poor are often concentrated in fragile, or less favorable, environmental areas. Consequently, their livelihoods can be intimately dependent on <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> use and ecosystem services. The relationship between poverty and <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> degradation may depend on a complex range of choices and tradeoffs available to the poor, which {{in the absence of}} capital, labor, and land markets, is affected by their access to outside employment and any <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowments.</b> The paper develops a poverty–environment model to characterize some of these linkages, and concludes by discussing policy implications and avenues for further research. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{relationship}} between <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowment,</b> particularly the type associated with minerals and plantations, and economic development. It may not be <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowment</b> per se but its type that matters, {{when it comes to}} growth and development. Certain types of natural resources such as oil and minerals have a tendency to lead to production and revenue patterns that are concentrated, while revenue flows from other types of resources such as agriculture are more diffused throughout the economy. The former category is dubbed a point-source economies, while the latter type is referred to as diffuse. Most countries in the first group have been prone to growth failure in recent times, with notable exceptions such as Botswana and Indonesia. The paper reviews two sets of models, the first set outlining the onset of the resource curse, and the second category sketching conditions where resource booms actually aid growth, or policies to avoid the resource curse. The vast majority of these models stress intersectoral linkages. Political economy considerations associated with resource rents are also reviewed. The focus is on institutions that determine the policy superstructure. The importance of institutions is highlighted, followed by a sketch of institutional malfunctioning and an overview of the empirical models of institutional determination. An explicit model of growth collapse with micro-foundations in rent-seeking behaviour and contests is also presented. The empirical analysis put forward {{is one of the few}} econometric investigations into the resource curse that includes analysis over time, as it is a panel data estimation. Due to this time series property our proxy for institutional quality is the degree of democracy. Our findings suggest that a point-source type <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowment</b> does retard democratic and institutional development, which in turn hampers economic growth. Institutions and institutional functioning are the crucial link between resource endowments, geography and policies, on the one hand and economic outcomes on the other hand.

40|$|Using {{the work}} – leisure choice model, this paper computes {{equilibrium}} hours-worked {{for a number}} of Arab, non-oil-producing and labor-abundant countries and major oil-producing, tax-free and labor-scarce countries, for which actual data are unavailable. We estimate hours-worked for the G 7, and show that the model fits the data well. We use this evidence as a yardstick to evaluate the model for the Arab countries for which no actual data are available. The model explains hours-worked in Arab, non-oil-producing countries well, but it fails to explain hours-worked in the oil-producing – tax-free countries. With the effective marginal tax rate close to zero, hours-worked increase significantly. We show that <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowment</b> is a required predicting factor for the model in this case. It turned out that natural resource capital acts exactly as a tax. In other words, it increases the wedge between real wages and marginal productivity, hence, natural resource wedge. The higher the <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>endowment</b> the less hours people worked. Most importantly, we provide a wider support to the model and confirm that the labor supply is elastic in all Arab countries. This finding confirms previous research that workers respond to incentives, which has serious implications for tax and social security policies. We also provide some policy simulation pertinent to poverty and welfare. ...|$|E
