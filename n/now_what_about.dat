2500|$|Sir , {{you will}} see that they want to place the word [...] "East Pakistan" [...] instead of [...] "East Bengal." [...] We had demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word [...] "Bengal" [...] has a history, has a {{tradition}} of its own. You can change it only after the people have been consulted. So far as the question of One Unit is concerned it can come in the Constitution. Why do {{you want it to be}} taken up just <b>now?</b> <b>What</b> <b>about</b> the state language, Bengali? We will be prepared to consider one-unit with all these things. So I appeal to my friends on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of referendum or in the form of plebiscite.|$|E
6000|$|SURGE [pocketing his {{envelope}} and {{becoming more and}} more businesslike] Right: I have got that. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> sin? What about the Fall? How do you work them in? ...|$|E
6000|$|Again he made {{no answer}} and I went on, [...] "And <b>now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> this journey to the north? If indeed I must make it, would you wish to {{accompany}} me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are Sir John Foterell's only child, are you not, who allege {{yourself}} to be wife to Sir Christopher Harflete, or so says yonder Prioress? <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> was <b>about</b> to happen to you, and why?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{thinking}} some. I get {{two hundred}} and fifty dollars <b>now,</b> but <b>what</b> <b>about</b> the rest? Suppose I have to wait until you put the job over? How are you going to put it over when Thirlwell holds the claims?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Poor Mrs. King was {{thinking}} of the long winter, and the heavy doctor's bill, and feeling that, after all, suffering and humbling might not be so very far off; but she was too cheerful and full of trust to dwell on the thought, so she smiled and said, 'I only said I was thankful, boys, for the mercy that has kept us up. Go on <b>now,</b> Harold; <b>what</b> <b>about</b> the boy?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A clever man, Sarson," [...] {{he remarked}} coolly, [...] "but no courtier. Never mind, my work pleases me. It {{gives me a}} passing {{sensation}} of happiness. <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> our patient?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If ye'd {{shared it}} {{it would have}} been two pound ten. You should always study your owner in these matters, cap'n. <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> bad weather? Any repairs to the sails?" ...|$|E
6000|$|SIMONE. Did I {{ever tell}} you how I saw a woman {{run over by a}} train? Cut to pieces, literally, to pieces. So disagreeable. I'll tell you later. But <b>now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> your story? ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{outcome of}} the evening was amusingly {{destructive}} of all our kindly plans. Before the women had fairly removed their wraps, Lottridge drew a box of dominoes from his pocket, saying, [...] "I didn't know but you'd be a little short on 'bones,'" [...] and Shane called out, [...] "Well, <b>now,</b> Richard, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> tables?" [...] In five minutes they were all--every mother's son and daughter of them--bent above a row of dominoes! ...|$|R
6000|$|There were {{a hundred}} {{things to be}} said about Fawn Court and the children, and a hundred more things about Lady Linlithgow and Bruton Street. Then, at last, Lady Fawn asked the one {{important}} question. [...] "And <b>now,</b> my dear, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Greystock?" ...|$|R
40|$|Prevention, performance, participation, partnership; {{the four}} {{pillars of the}} Christie Commission are <b>now</b> well-known. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> ‘place’? Here <b>What</b> Works Scotland Research Associate Claire Bynner {{examines}} the role of place-based approaches, what ‘place’ offers to public service development and delivery, and also what it doesn’t...|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ll pick a crew for ’em," [...] said Brisket. [...] "A {{man here}} and a man there. Biddlecombe men ain’t tough enough. And <b>now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> that whisky you’ve been talking so much about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Capital!" [...] Mr. Dane Montague exclaimed. [...] "You are a {{man after}} my own heart, Mr. Pratt. You strike while the iron's hot. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> a little lunch, {{say at the}} Milan, before starting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] said Carnally. [...] "You want to {{remember}} that the moment you give us any cause for suspicion you get fired. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> your partners? How long would it take them to make the cache?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, certainly," [...] said March, and he thought: [...] "It's coming <b>now</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{he intends}} to do with 'Every Other Week.' Well, I {{might as well have}} all the misery at once and have it over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is <b>now</b> <b>what</b> to do <b>about</b> the changed situation. This is {{an offer of}} marriage. It comes in the proper way. It's a very sincere and manly letter. The man has counted the whole cost: he's ready to leave the army and go to America, if she says so. He's in love. How can she refuse him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ken, it's mighty interesting--all this you've {{said about}} trees. Some {{of the things}} are so simple that I wonder I didn't hit on them long ago; in fact, I knew {{a lot of what}} you might call forestry, but the {{scientific}} ideas--they stump me. <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> you said <b>about</b> a pine-tree cleaning itself--come back at me with that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That’ll {{be three}} pounds then," [...] said Tweedie. [...] "If ye’d shared it {{it would have}} been two pound ten. You should always study your owner in these matters, cap’n. <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> bad weather? Any repairs to the sails?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has atoned," [...] his {{companion}} said calmly. [...] "He made his peace {{and he went}} to his death. It seems very fitting that he should have received the dagger which was meant for my heart. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> you, Oscar Immelan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has his work," [...] she replied. [...] "He {{has lots}} of things that {{interest}} him.... I know I've been to that place," [...] she broke off, pointing to a photograph. [...] "But I can't remember where it is--oh, of course it's Oxford. <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> your cottage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of a truth 'tis a brave tale, Albert!" [...] {{the knight}} exclaimed, {{bringing}} {{his hand down}} on the lad's shoulder with hearty approbation. [...] "By my faith, no knights in the realm could have managed the matter more shrewdly and bravely. Well done, Albert; I am indeed proud of my son. As for you, Edgar, you have added a fresh obligation to those I already owe you. 'Tis a feat, indeed, for one of your age to slay five men single-handed, {{even though they were}} inflamed by liquor. <b>Now,</b> wife, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> Aline?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Shorter, {{leaning forward}} again with {{something}} like servile energy, [...] "and <b>now,</b> Mr Swinburne, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> that unhappy man Hawker. I cannot tell what those men meant, or how far {{what they said was}} real. But surely there is danger. I cannot go to the police, for reasons that you perceive. Among other things, they wouldn't believe me. What is to be done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho yis, massa, plenty ob rubbers eberywhar," [...] said Quashy, with a nod, [...] "more nor 'nuff ob dem. You see, massa, Chili an' Proo's a-fightin' wid each oder jus' <b>now.</b> <b>What</b> dey's fightin' <b>about</b> no mortial knows; an', what's more, nobody cares.

60|$|UNDERSHAFT [stopping him] Yes, yes, yes, yes: that's all right, Stephen. She wont {{interfere}} with you any more: your independence is achieved: you have won your latchkey. Don't rub it in; and above all, don't apologize. [He resumes his seat]. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> your future, as between {{one man and}} another--I beg your pardon, Biddy: as between two men and a woman.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When you book your passage you {{can arrange}} for the buggy {{to be taken}} up,' said the storekeeper. 'You might put all the things in it. We shall put all the small items in boxes, and then lash the {{tarpaulin}} well over everything; they will travel safely enough, {{and you will have}} no trouble about them till you {{get to the end of}} the journey. <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> horses? What are you going to do? I reckon you will have to pay a mighty high price if you wait until you get to Omaha.' ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{stranger}} {{was walking}} up and down absorbed in the marked contemplation of the ship's fore and aft trim; but when I saw him squat on his heels in the slush at {{the very edge of the}} quay to peer at the draught of water under her counter, I said to myself, [...] "This is the captain." [...] And presently I descried his luggage coming along--a real sailor's chest, carried by means of rope-beckets between two men, with a couple of leather portmanteaus and a roll of charts sheeted in canvas piled upon the lid. The sudden, spontaneous agility with which he bounded aboard right off the rail afforded me the first glimpse of his real character. Without further preliminaries than a friendly nod, he addressed me: [...] "You have got her pretty well in her fore and aft trim. <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> your weights?" ...|$|E
50|$|Mattia {{accepts the}} {{invitation}} {{and returns to}} Italy. Alice, <b>now</b> unsure <b>about</b> <b>what</b> she saw, avoids telling him why {{she asked him to}} come. The two friends spend an afternoon together during which she kisses him and realizes that she's still in love with him. In spite of this, they both realize they cannot overcome the walls that separate them.|$|R
2500|$|Common Israeli {{attitudes toward}} {{migration}} to Israel and Jews {{living in the}} Diaspora may have shifted polarities in terms of Zionism. In 2009 Hebrew University sociologist Vered Vinitzky-Seroussi said {{the fact that it}} has become commonplace for Israelis to move abroad, either permanently or for a stint, makes it contradictory for their families to look down on Diaspora Jews. Haifa University sociologist Oz Almog said in a recent interview: [...] "Ask Israelis <b>now</b> <b>what</b> they think <b>about</b> Jews coming from countries where they aren't persecuted, like the U.S. and Britain, to live in Israel, and they'll say, 'Those who do are nuts.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see <b>now</b> <b>what</b> I mean <b>about</b> the ladder," [...] {{went on the}} detective; [...] "it's {{the only}} old piece of {{furniture}} here {{and the first thing}} that caught that cockney eye of mine. But there is something else. That loft up there is a sort of lumber room without any lumber. So far as I can see, it's as empty as everything else; and, as things are, I don't see the use of the ladder leading to it. It seems to me, as I can't find anything unusual down here, that it might pay us to look up there." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} this Paul {{asserted}} most strenuously {{that he would not}} return to San Francisco, and, perhaps too ingenuously, gave his partner to understand that he was altogether sick of the great railway, and would under no circumstances have anything more to do with it. Fisker shrugged his shoulders, and was not displeased at the proposed rupture. He was prepared to deal fairly,--nay, generously,--by his partner, having recognized the wisdom of that great commercial rule which teaches us that honour should prevail among associates of a certain class; but he had fully convinced himself that Paul Montague was not a fit partner for Hamilton K. Fisker. Fisker was not only unscrupulous himself, but he had a thorough contempt for scruples in others. According to his theory of life, nine hundred and ninety-nine men were obscure because of their scruples, whilst the thousandth man predominated and cropped up into the splendour of commercial wealth because he was free from such bondage. He had his own theories, too, as to commercial honesty. That which he had promised to do he would do, if it was within his power. He was anxious that his bond should be good, and his word equally so. But the work of robbing mankind in gross by magnificently false representations, was not only the duty, but also the delight and the ambition of his life. How could a man so great endure a partnership with one so small as Paul Montague? 'And <b>now</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> Winifred Hurtle?' asked Fisker.|$|E
5000|$|After {{compiling}} {{an amateur}} record of 19-3, Holmes turned professional on March 21, 1973, winning a four-round decision against Rodell Dupree. Early {{in his career}} {{he worked as a}} sparring partner for Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Earnie Shavers, and Jimmy Young. He was paid well and learned a lot. [...] "I was young, and I didn't know much. But I was holding my own sparring those guys", Holmes said. [...] "I thought, 'hey, these guys are the best, the champs. If I can hold my own <b>now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>about</b> later?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Sir of the Constituent Assembly, {{you will}} see that they want to place the word [...] "East Pakistan" [...] instead of [...] "East Bengal."

6000|$|... "Here," [...] said Beniah, amused at the girl's gaze of astonishment, [...] "ye will be {{safe from}} all your foes till a Higher Power directs us what shall be done with you, for, to say truth, at this moment my mind is a blank. However, our present duty is not action but concealment. Water and dried fruit you will find in this corner. Keep quiet. Let not curiosity tempt you to examine these things--they might fall and cause noise that would betray us. When danger is past, I will come again. Meanwhile, observe <b>now</b> <b>what</b> I am <b>about</b> to do, and try to imitate me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Both of {{you have}} talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> the more than 40 million younger Americans {{who do not have}} health {{insurance}} right <b>now?</b> <b>What</b> would you do about that? ...|$|R

"See now, Slaughterer," [...] she said, [...] "see <b>now</b> <b>what</b> has came <b>about</b> {{because you}} listened to this aged fool!"--that was I, my father--"this fool who calls himself 'Mouth'! Ay, a mouth he is, a mouth out of which proceed folly and lies! What did he counsel you to do?--to go up against these Halakazi and win a girl for Dingaan! And what have you done?--you have fallen upon the Halakazi, and doubtless have killed many {{innocent}} people with that great axe of yours, also you have left {{nearly half of the}} soldiers of the Axe to whiten in the Swazi caves, and in exchange have brought back certain cattle of a small breed, and girls and children whom we must nourish! ...|$|R
