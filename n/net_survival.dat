40|$|SummaryBackgroundAssessment of {{progress}} in cancer control at the population level is increasingly important. Population-based survival trends provide a key insight into the overall effectiveness of the health system, alongside trends in incidence and mortality. For this purpose, we aimed to provide a unique measure of cancer survival. MethodsIn this observational study, we analysed trends in survival with population-based data for 7 · 2 million adults diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive malignancy in England and Wales during 1971 – 2011 and followed {{up to the end}} of 2012. We constructed a survival index for all cancers combined using data from the National Cancer Registry and the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. The index is designed to be independent of changes in the age distribution of patients with cancer and of changes in the proportion of lethal cancers in each sex. We analysed trends in the cancer survival index at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis for the selected periods 1971 – 72, 1980 – 81, 1990 – 91, 2000 – 01, 2005 – 06, and 2010 – 11. We also estimated trends in age-sex-adjusted survival for each cancer. We define the difference in <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> between the oldest (75 – 99 years) and youngest (15 – 44 years) patients as the age gap in survival. We evaluated the absolute change (%) in the age gap since 1971. FindingsThe overall index of <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> increased substantially during the 40 -year period 1971 – 2011, both in England and in Wales. For patients diagnosed in 1971 – 72, the index of <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> was 50 % at 1 year after diagnosis. 40 years later, the same value of 50 % was predicted at 10 years after diagnosis. The average 10 % survival advantage for women persisted throughout this period. Predicted 10 -year <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> adjusted for age and sex for patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2011 ranged from 1 · 1 % for pancreatic cancer to 98 · 2 % for testicular cancer. <b>Net</b> <b>survival</b> for the oldest patients (75 – 99 years) was persistently lower than for the youngest (15 – 44 years), even after adjustment for the much higher mortality from causes other than cancer in elderly people. InterpretationThese findings support substantial increases in both short-term and long-term <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> from all cancers combined in both England and Wales. The <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> index provides a convenient, single number that summarises the overall patterns of cancer survival in any one population, in each calendar period, for young and old men and women and {{for a wide range of}} cancers with very disparate survival. The persistent sex difference is partly due to a more favourable cancer distribution in women than men. The very wide differences in survival for different cancers, and the persistent age gap in survival, suggest the need for renewed efforts to improve cancer outcomes. Future monitoring of the cancer survival index will not be possible unless the current crisis of public concern about sharing of individual data for public health research can be resolved.

40|$|ObjectiveThe lung {{allocation}} {{score was}} initiated in May 2005 to allocate lungs {{on the basis}} of medical urgency and posttransplant survival. However, the relationship between lung allocation score and candidate outcomes remains poorly characterized. The {{purpose of this study was}} (1) to describe outcomes by lung allocation score at the time of listing and (2) to estimate the <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> benefit of transplantation by lung allocation score. MethodsThe United Network for Organ Sharing provided de-identified patient-level data. Analysis included lung transplant candidates aged 12 years or more and listed between May 4, 2005, and May 4, 2009 (n =  6082). Candidates were stratified according to lung allocation score at listing into 7 groups: lung allocation score less than 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, 80 to 89, and 90 or more. Outcomes of interest included the risk of death on the waiting list and likelihood of transplantation. The <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> benefit of transplantation was defined as actuarial median posttransplant graft survival minus actuarial median waiting list survival, where the outcome of interest was death on the waiting list or posttransplant; candidates were censored at the time of transplant or last follow-up. ResultsIn the lowest-priority strata (eg, < 40 and 40 – 49), less than 4 % of candidates died on the waiting list within 90 days of listing. The median <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> benefit was lowest in the lung allocation score less than 40 (− 0. 7 years) and lung allocation score 90 + group (1. 95 years) and highest in the 50 to 59 (3. 44 years), 60 to 69 (3. 49 years), and 70 to 79 (2. 81 years) groups. ConclusionsThe mid-priority groups (eg, 50 – 59, 60 – 69, 70 – 79) seem to achieve the greatest survival benefit from transplantation. Although low-priority candidates comprise the majority of transplant recipients, survival benefit in this group seems to be less than in other groups given the low risk of death on the waiting list. As expected, both the time to transplant and survival on the waitlist are lower in the higher-priority strata (eg, 80 – 89 and 90 +). However, their <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> benefit was likewise relatively low as a result of their poor posttransplant survival...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Global inequalities {{in access}} to health care are {{reflected}} in differences in cancer survival. The CONCORD programme was designed to assess worldwide differences and trends in population-based cancer survival. In this population-based study, we aimed to estimate survival inequalities globally for several subtypes of childhood leukaemia. METHODS: Cancer registries participating in CONCORD were asked to submit tumour registrations for all children aged 0 - 14 years who were diagnosed with leukaemia between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2009, and followed up until Dec 31, 2009. Haematological malignancies were defined by morphology codes in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third revision. We excluded data from registries from which the data were judged to be less reliable, or included only lymphomas, and data from countries in which data for fewer than ten children were available for analysis. We also excluded records because of a missing date of birth, diagnosis, or last known vital status. We estimated 5 -year <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> (ie, the probability of surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis, after controlling for deaths from other causes [background mortality]) for children by calendar period of diagnosis (1995 - 99, 2000 - 04, and 2005 - 09), sex, and age at diagnosis (< 1, 1 - 4, 5 - 9, and 10 - 14 years, inclusive) using appropriate life tables. We estimated age-standardised <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> for international comparison of survival trends for precursor-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). FINDINGS: We analysed data from 89   828 children from 198 registries in 53 countries. During 1995 - 99, 5 -year age-standardised <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> for all lymphoid leukaemias combined ranged from 10 · 6...|$|E
40|$|IF 2. 415 International audienceRectal {{cancer is}} a common and serious disease. The aim of the SUDCAN {{collaborative}} study was to compare the <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> from rectal cancer between six European Latin countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland) and provide trends in <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> and dynamics of excess mortality rates up to 5 years after diagnosis. The data were extracted from the EUROCARE- 5 database. First, <b>net</b> <b>survival</b> was studied over the period 2000 - 2004 using the Pohar-Perme estimator. For trend analyses, the study-period was specific to each country. The results are reported from 1992 to 2004 in France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland and from 2000 to 2004 in Belgium and Portugal. These analyses were carried out using a flexible excess rate modeling strategy. There were some differences between countries in age-standardized net survivals (2000 - 2004). The 5 -year survival ranged from 55 % (Portugal) to 62 % (Belgium). There {{was an increase in}} age-standardized survival rates between 1992 and 2004 as observed at 1 and 5 years. This increase was observed in the 60 and 70 -year age groups, but was less marked in the 80 -year age group. This was related to a decrease in the excess mortality rates between 1992 and 2004, until similar to 24 months after diagnosis in France and Switzerland, whereas it was continuous over the entire study period in Italy and Spain. Considerable improvements in survival from rectal cancer have been achieved. Further improvements are expected through better adherence to the guidelines and the implementation of mass screening.

40|$|Net art {{is one of}} {{the most}} viewed and {{experienced}} artforms, yet some net artworks stop functioning in less than five months. At the heart of this research lies the question of <b>net</b> art’s <b>survival.</b> While <b>net</b> art is hardly accounted for in museum collections – the traditional keepers of cultural heritage – this dissertation explores the material and behaviour of net art. Using a broad range of interdisciplinary resources the chapters open up key theoretical issues that rethink museum practices. Among others, this includes notions of authenticity, authorship, documentation and documents, networks, open source, performativity and processual. Arguing for the need to reconsider traditional attitudes in museums and notions of static conservation as well as acknowledging decentralised and community-based approaches, this dissertation describes an expanded practice of conservation in the computational age. It shows how net art operates through often imperceptible or ambiguous performance of processes and is networked in various ways. It then examines the way these strategies are used and fold back into notions of authenticity, documentation and variability. It is in addressing and answering some of the challenges facing net art that this dissertation makes a distinctive contribution to the field of conservation, curatorial studies as well as to cultural and museum analysis. At the same time, an exploration of net art’s intersections with conservation puts studies on net art into a new perspective. Consequently, the study enables more informed decisions when responding to, critically analysing or working with net art, in particular software-based processes. Surviving FOREVER means embracing rather then fearing ephemerality, loss and obsolescence...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractCampylobacter jejuni is {{the leading}} cause of {{bacterial}} food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide and human infections are frequently associated with handling and consumption of contaminated poultry. The polysaccharide capsule of C. jejuni plays important roles in colonisation of the chicken gut, invasion of epithelial cells and serum resistance and is subject to modification with O-methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) in most strains. In this study, the cytokine responses of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMMs), chicken bone marrow-derived macrophages (chBMMs) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) were measured following infection with C. jejuni 11168 H wild-type (WT) or isogenic mutants lacking either the capsule (Δcj 1439) or its MeOPN modification (Δcj 1417). Consistent with previous observations using murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, mutants lacking the capsule or MeOPN elicited enhanced transcription of IL- 6 and IL- 10 in mBMMs compared to wild-type C. jejuni. However, the lack of capsule and MeOPN did not alter IL- 6 and IL- 10 expression in chBMMs and hMDMs compared to C. jejuni WT. Phagocytosis assays showed the acapsular mutant was not impaired in uptake or <b>net</b> intracellular <b>survival</b> after phagocytosis in both chicken and human macrophages; however, the phagocytosis of the MeOPN mutant was significantly decreased in both chicken and human macrophages. In conclusion, differences in the response of macrophages of varying host origin to Campylobacter were detected. The absence of MeOPN modification on the capsule of C. jejuni did not alter the levels of innate cytokine expression in both chicken and human macrophages compared to the 11168 H WT, but affected phagocytosis by host macrophages...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} model of cancer progression {{is used to}} study how mutations in genes that control tumor initiation and progression accumulate in populations. The model assumes that cancer occurs only after a cell lineage has progressed {{through a series of}} stages. The greater the number of stages, the more strongly the individual is protected against cancer. It is shown that an extra stage initially improves the survival of individuals by decreasing mortality from cancer. However, the additional buffering by an extra stage reduces the impact of any single hereditary mutation and therefore allows the accumulation of more nonlethal mutations in the population. Extra stages thereby lead to the evolution of partially decreased cancer mortality and significantly increased genetic predisposition to disease in the population as a whole. In general, the model illustrates how all robust control networks allow the accumulation of deleterious mutations. An {{increase in the number of}} buffering components leads to significant mutational decay in the protection provided by each buffering component and increased genetic predisposition to disease. An extra buffering component's <b>net</b> contribution to <b>survival</b> and reproduction is often small...|$|R
