50|$|Historically, most psychophysiologists {{tended to}} examine the {{physiological}} responses and organ systems innervated by the autonomic nervous system. More recently, psychophysiologists have been equally, or potentially more, interested in the central nervous system, exploring cortical brain potentials such as the many types of event-related potentials (ERPs), brain waves, and utilizing advanced technology such as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), MRI, PET, MEG, and other <b>neuroimagery</b> techniques.|$|E
50|$|Research has {{occurred}} to designate a specific neural correlate of imagery; however, studies show {{a multitude of}} results. Most studies published before 2001 suggest neural correlates of visual imagery occur in brodmann area 17. Auditory performance imagery have been observed in the premotor areas, precunes, and medial brodmann area 40. Auditory imagery in general occurs across participants in the temporal voice area (TVA), which allows top-down imaging manipulations, processing, and storage of audition functions. Olfactory imagery research shows activation in the anterior piriform cortex and the posterior piriform cortex; experts in olfactory imagery have larger gray matter associated to olfactory areas. Tactile imagery is found {{to occur in the}} dorsolateral prefrontal area, inferior frontal gyrus, frontal gyrus, insula, precentral gyrus, and the medial frontal gyrus with basil ganglia activation in the ventral posteriomedial nucleus and putamen (hemisphere activation corresponds to the location of the imagined tactile stimulus). Research in gustatory imagery reveals activation in the anterior insular cortex, frontal operculum, and prefrontal cortex. Novices of a specific form of mental imagery show less gray matter than experts of mental imagery congruent to that form. A meta-analysis of <b>neuroimagery</b> studies revealed significant activation of the bilateral dorsal parietal, interior insula, and left inferior frontal regions of the brain.|$|E

40|$|Although the n-back task {{has been}} widely applied to <b>neuroimagery</b> {{investigations}} of working memory (WM), the role of practice effects on behavioural performance of this task {{has not yet been}} investigated. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of task complexity and familiarity on the n-back task. Seventy-seven participants (39 male, 38 female) completed a visuospatial n-back task four times, twice in two testing sessions separated by a week. Participants were required to remember either the first, second or third (n-back) most recent letter positions in a continuous sequence and to indicate whether the current item matched or did not match the remembered position. A control task, with no working memory requirements required participants to match to a predetermined stimulus position. In both testing sessions, reaction time (RT) and error rate increased with increasing WM load. An exponential slope for RTs in the first session indicated dual-task interference at the 3 -back level. However, a linear slope in the second session indicated a reduction of dual-task interference. Attenuation of interference in the second session suggested a reduction in executive demands of the task with practice. This suggested that practice effects occur within the n-back ask and need to be controlled for in future <b>neuroimagery</b> research using the task...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{normative}} {{ethics is}} characterized by a debate between two conflic- ting theories, deontologism and utilitarianism. Until recently, this debate has essentially used arguments, objections and thought-experiments of a conceptual nature. Following the progress in <b>neuroimagery,</b> Joshua Greene has introduced empirical elements in the discussion : submitting several subjects to different dilemmas, in particular the trolley problem, he has examined how their brain were reacting. He concluded that deontolo- gists were drawing on their emotions, whereas utilitarians reacted more rationally, and therefore gave a better answer from a moral point of view. Deontologists reasons are even rationalizations and confabulations, rather than authentic moral reasons. Unfortu- nately, if Greene is on the right track in introducing empirical data in this debate, his conclusions are not warranted in my opinion...|$|E

Computerized methods {{have been shown to}} be equally or more e↵ective than human clinicians in diagnosing dementia from neuroimages. Nevertheless, much of the work involves the use of domain expertise to extract hand–crafted features. The key technique in this paper is the use of cross–domain features to represent MRI data. We used a sparse autoencoder to learn a set of bases from natural images and then applied convolution to extract features from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Using this new representation, we classify MRI instances into three categories: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Healthy Control (HC). Our approach, in spite of being very simple, achieved high classification performance, which is competitive with or better than other approaches. 1...|$|E

After defining MI and describing the TMS technique, a short report of MI activities only at cortical level is provided. Then, a main focus on the specificities of cortico-spinal modulations during MI, investigated by TMS, is provided. Finally, a brief overview of sub-cortical mechanisms gives importance to the activation of peripheral neural structures during MI...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{psychology}} {{has shown}} differences between predictions of theory of decision and human choices. Emotions like regret can partly explain these differences. <b>Neuroimagery</b> used {{in combination with}} behavioural economics (neuroeconomics) {{has been used in}} order to try to disentangle the different emotional and rational factors (regret, rejoicing, reward, costs, uncertainty, trade-off between positive and negative aspects of different options). Emotions then appear as much more complex and mixed affective states than usually assumed. Not only might we feel a positive affect in punishing unfair partners, but mixed emotions can, for example, combine transmutation of previous anxiety into relief and elation by comparison with another less exciting option (elating relief). At the level of complexity of these mixed emotions—which we formally represent by comparisons between ‘unexpected utilities’ and expected ones—the main biases that Kahnemann and Tversky have shown can be explained. In spite of the complexity of these mixed emotions, some of these hypotheses might be partially tested by brain imagery...|$|E

Following the description of affective and neurological symptoms in a 37 -year-old female patient five years following COI, we will review, across the literature (Medline 1974 - 2006), the long-term neuropsychiatric consequences, etiopathogenic hypotheses, prognoses and treatments to apply. Subjective symptoms are reported by the quasi-totality of patients for over more than 30 years following Col.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Autistic {{disorder}} is a developmental handicap with an unknown neurological basis. Current neuropsychological models for autism suggest an abnormal construction of visual perceptual representation or a deficit in executive functions. These models predict cerebral lesions in the temporo-occipital or frontal regions of autistic patients. The present study aimed at studying {{the presence of}} symptoms of autism and visual agnosia in a 13 year old girl who had a right temporo-occipital cortical dysplasia that was surgically removed {{at the age of}} 7.  METHODS—Neuropsychological evaluation included Wechsler and Kaufman intelligence scales, a test of word fluency, digit span, Corsi block, California verbal learning, Trail making, Benton facial recognition, Snoodgrass object recognition tests, Rivermead face learning subtest, and developmental test of visual perception. The ADI-R was used to show current and retrospective diagnosis of autistic disorder. <b>Neuroimagery</b> included brain MRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and PET.  RESULTS—Brain MRI showed a right occipital defect and an abnormal hyperintensity of the right temporal cortex. PET and SPECT disclosed a left frontal hypometabolism together with the right occipital defect. Neuropsychological testing showed a visual apperceptive agnosia and executive function deficits. Psychiatric study confirmed the diagnosis of autistic disorder.  CONCLUSIONS—Although the possibilty that autism and visual agnosia were dissociable factors in this patient cannot be excluded, the finding of both deficits supports the possibility that occipito-temporal lesions can predispose to the development of autism. ...|$|E
40|$|Several highly-cited {{experiments}} have presented {{evidence suggesting that}} neuroimages may unduly bias laypeople's judgments of scientific research. This finding has been especially worrisome to the legal community in which neuroimage techniques {{may be used to}} produce evidence of a person's mental state. However, a more recent body of work that has looked directly at the independent impact of neuroimages on layperson decision-making (both in legal and more general arenas), and has failed to find evidence of bias. To help resolve these conflicting findings, this research uses eye tracking technology to provide a measure of attention to different visual representations of neuroscientific data. Finding an effect of neuroimages on the distribution of attention would provide a potential mechanism for the influence of neuroimages on higher-level decisions. In the present experiment, a sample of laypeople viewed a vignette that briefly described a court case in which the defendant's actions might have been explained by a neurological defect. Accompanying these vignettes was either an MRI image of the defendant's brain, or a bar graph depicting levels of brain activity-two competing visualizations that have been the focus of much of the previous research on the neuroimage bias. We found that, while laypeople differentially attended to <b>neuroimagery</b> relative to the bar graph, this did not translate into differential judgments {{in a way that would}} support the idea of a neuroimage bias...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies in}} <b>neuroimagery</b> and {{cognitive}} psychology support {{the view of}} sensory-motor based knowledge: when processing an object concept, neural systems would re-enact previous experiences with this object. In this experiment, a conceptual switching cost paradigm derived from Pecher, Zeelenberg, and Barsalou (2003, 2004) was used to investigate sensory-motor simulation in children's conceptual processing. Adults and 7 -year-old children performed a property verification task involving visual and motor properties of manipulable artifacts. Verification times were compared for target trials preceded by a trial in which the property either involved the same modality or a different one. By 7 years of age, results revealed a modality switching cost with longer verification times in the different modality than in the same modality condition. In addition, the switching effect did not interact with age or property modality type. Results support an embodied view of concepts in both adults and children.

40|$|International audienceThe {{vestibular}} {{system provides}} the brain with sensory signals about three-dimensional head rotations and translations. These signals {{are important for}} postural and oculomotor control, {{as well as for}} spatial and bodily perception and cognition, and they are subtended by pathways running from the vestibular nuclei to the thalamus, cerebellum and the ``vestibular cortex. '' The present review summarizes current knowledge on the anatomy of the thalamocortical vestibular system and discusses data from electrophysiology and neuroanatomy in animals by comparing them with data from <b>neuroimagery</b> and neurology in humans. Multiple thalamic nuclei are involved in vestibular processing, including the ventroposterior complex, the ventroanterior ventrolateral complex, the intralaminar nuclei and the posterior nuclear group (medial and lateral geniculate nuclei, pulvinar). These nuclei contain multisensory neurons that process and relay vestibular, proprioceptive and visual signals to the vestibular cortex. In non-human primates, the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) has been proposed as the core vestibular region. Yet, vestibular responses have also been recorded in the somatosensory cortex (area 2 v, 3 av), intraparietal sulcus, posterior parietal cortex (area 7), area MST, frontal cortex, cingulum and hippocampus. We analyze the location of the corresponding regions in humans, and especially the human PIVC, by reviewing neuroimaging and clinical work. The widespread vestibular projections to the multimodal human PIVC, somatosensory cortex, area MST, intraparietal sulcus and hippocampus explain the large influence of vestibular signals on self-motion perception, spatial navigation, internal models of gravity, one's body perception and bodily self-consciousness.

40|$|Although {{serial killers}} have always existed, individualizing this concept {{as well as}} giving a consensual {{definition}} and universal typology is still a problem nowadays. The authors present an overview based on the current literature, more specifically on definitions, categorization, epidemiology and clinical area. Psychopathological aspects are also developed and focused on different topics: psychopathy, sexual sadism, fantasies, and childhood. Serial murder is a world-wide phenomenon which has an increasing incidence even in the countries where the global criminality rate is decreasing, as for example in the United-States. The reasons are numerous and often lead to inconvenient explanations. A serial killer is generally a Caucasian, aged between 20 and 40, who is often socially and familiarly well integrated, often suffering from personal and especially familial psychiatric conditions. Many serial killers act alone, and plan their crime {{a long time in}} advance. They choose their next victims with highly precise criteria, approached then and win their trust. Few serial killers act in an impulsive way and do not select their victims. In this precise case, these are very often psychotic. Generally, serial killers have a psychopathic personality disorder with a sexual sadistic dimension. Psychopathy implies a lack of affection and a loss or a total absence of empathy. A gravely offended childhood with physical and psychological violence, a chaotic familial dynamic, and lot of sexual, violent and dead fantasies are the common denominator of these murderers. Nowadays, even if they are regularly on the highlights of the media, serial killers still remain an enigma. Neurobiological and neurophysiological approaches, through the functional <b>neuroimagery</b> for example, could be interesting paradigms {{in order to try to}} understand and decode how these people work and, in this way, prevent their emergences. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|Major {{depression}} {{is one of}} the most devastating disorders as measured by years of lives lost and diminished quality of live. According to treatment guidelines, mild depression should mainly be treated by psychotherapy, but moderate and severe disorders need very often pharmacological treatment. Drug therapy has several limitations: delay in treatment response, lack of efficacy, pharmacokinetic interactions, unwanted effects and unsatisfactory compliancy, especially in the long term treatment. About 30 %- 40 % of moderate to severely depressed patients do not achieve remission after 2 antidepressant trials. They subsequently undergo treatment trials which are mainly based on the clinical practice of their prescriber. This is frequently a scientifically uninformed ‘‘trial and error’’ approach. Indeed, solid evidence concerning individual therapeutic approaches is lacking. Electroconvulsive therapy is widely considered as an efficient treatment of last resort. But it is associated with cognitive side effects and high relapse rates. Its use is limited by availability and sometimes a negative perception by the public. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative treatment approaches. Despite tremendous advances in genetics, <b>neuroimagery,</b> basic neurosciences and other research areas, {{depression is}} still considered as a “heterogeneous disorder with a highly variable course, an inconsistent response to treatment, and no established mechanism” (2). In this thesis, we discuss the concept, the clinical course and unmet needs in the treatment of major depression based on selective reviews. A particularly troublesome aspect, emergent suicidality during antidepressant treatment, is illustrated by own work. Electroconvulsive therapy as the paradigmatic, controversial somatic treatment of depression is described, besides newer techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. We present also our own contributions in the field of neurostimulation, especially magnetic seizure therapy, vagus nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation and discuss their place in the treatment armamentarium of depression. We outline ongoing research activity to treat severe depression by modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission using ketamine in a translational approach. We hope to contribute through our studies to better treat and understand depression, one of the major challenges in the field of mental disorders...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores dependence patterns using a {{range of}} statistical methods: from estimating latent factors in multivariate analysis to mixed modeling of spatially and temporally dependent data. The methods may be applied to many scientific problems and types of data, but here {{we focus on the}} application to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the first chapter, we examine differences between independent component analyses (ICAs) arising from different assumptions, measures of dependence, and starting points of the algorithms. ICA is a popular method with diverse applications including artifact removal in electrophysiology data, feature extraction in microarray data, and identifying brain networks in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). ICA {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of principal component analysis (PCA) that takes into account higher-order cross-correlations. Whereas the PCA solution is unique, there are many ICA methods-whose solutions may differ. Infomax, FastICA, and JADE are commonly applied to fMRI studies, with FastICA being arguably the most popular. A previous study demonstrated that ProDenICA outperformed FastICA in simulations with two components. We introduce the application of ProDenICA to simulations with more components and to fMRI data. ProDenICA was more accurate in simulations, and we identified differences between biologically meaningful ICs from ProDenICA versus other methods in the fMRI analysis. ICA methods require non-convex optimization, yet current practices do not recognize the importance of, nor adequately address sensitivity to, initial values. We found that local optima led to dramatically different estimates in both simulations and group ICA of fMRI, and we provide evidence that the global optimum from ProDenICA is the best estimate. We applied a modification of the Hungarian (Kuhn-Munkres) algorithm to match ICs from multiple estimates, thereby gaining novel insights into how brain networks vary in their sensitivity to initial values and ICA method. The manuscript resulting from this research is co-authored by David Matteson, David Ruppert, Ani Eloyan (Johns Hopkins University), and Brian Caffo (Johns Hopkins University). In the second chapter, we develop a new approach for dimension reduction and latent variable estimation by maximizing a non-Gaussian likelihood. Independent component analysis (ICA) is popular in many applications, including cognitive neuroscience and signal processing. Due to computational constraints, principal component analysis is used for dimension reduction prior to ICA (PCA-ICA), which could remove important information. To address this issue, we propose likelihood component analysis (LCA) in which dimension reduction and latent variable estimation is achieved simultaneously by maximizing a likelihood with Gaussian and non-Gaussian components. We present a parametric model using the logistic density and a semi-parametric version using tilted Gaussians with cubic B-splines. We implement an algorithm scalable to datasets common in applications (e. g., hundreds of thousands of observations across hundreds of variables with dozens of latent components). In simulations, our methods recover latent components that are discarded by PCA-ICA methods. PCA-ICA is a popular technique to identify artifacts in functional magnetic resonance imaging. We apply our method to an experiment from the Human Connectome Project with state-of-the-art temporal and spatial resolution, and identify an artifact using LCA that was missed by PCA-ICA. Our results suggest that likelihood component analysis can detect novel signals in <b>neuroimagery.</b> The third chapter is a departure from the previous topics as it develops a model with Gaussian assumptions. Function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to locate which areas of the brain are activated from thoughts and/or behaviors. In order to assess activation, fMRI data are analyzed by fitting univariate models at every location in the brain, which is called the massive univariate approach. Prior to fitting these models, fMRI data are smoothed for two reasons: to increase the power to detect activated locations and to increase the overlap of corresponding features. However, this decreases the precision with which activation is localized. There is no clear answer to how much smoothing should be used. Moreover, technological improvements that increase the resolution of fMRI data can not be used to increase the resolution of localization if too much smoothing is used. We propose a spatiotemporal mixed model that chooses smoothing in a principled manner that balances its costs and benefits. The model includes a vertex random effect common to all subjects that captures local deviations from regional activation, which obviates the need for smoothing to increase power. The model also includes a subject-vertex random effect that allows subject-specific deviations from the population-level activation, which obviates the need for smoothing to increase the overlap between features in different subjects. We apply our method to high resolution (2 x 2 x 2 mm) and high frequency (0. 72 seconds between scans) fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project and demonstrate the ability to automate smoothing via a unified spatiotemporal mixed model involving a covariance matrix with dimensions 326 million by 326 million...|$|E
