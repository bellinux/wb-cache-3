5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occupancy}} of {{the palace}} by Dom Pedro and Maria I, the chapel was central to the daily routine of their court. It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that the chapel was the first part {{of the palace}} to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her husbandâ€”the couple attended mass several times a day. Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies. Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity. Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in Rio de Janeiro in 1816.|$|E
50|$|Supporters of {{alternative}} theories disregard the accidental {{existence of the}} more hundred similarities, claiming that identical phonetics and correspondent meaning {{at the same time}} are <b>no</b> <b>coincidences.</b> A main principle of these theories is that language families were born through aerial language equalization, though the possibility of loanwords supports the theory, rather than refutes it.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a search for}} prompt microwave emissions from supernovae in the central region of the Perseus cluster of galaxies, using a coincidence technique involving five tracking radiometers located at widely spaced sites. <b>No</b> <b>coincidences</b> were found between January and December, 1973, and no supernovae were reported during this period from the optical surveys, in that region of sky...|$|R

5|$|Reports of {{the brutal}} {{policies}} of the organization soon {{made their way to}} Phnom Penh and into the population foretelling the violence that was about to consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn. War was one thing, the offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was quite another. Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence.</b> The concentration of the PAVN effort on South Vietnam allowed the Khmer Rouge to apply their doctrine and policies without restraint for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the West Country Carnival close to the British celebration of Bonfire night on 5 November is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> as {{the roots of the}} {{original}} carnival in Bridgwater date back to 1605.|$|E
25|$|They would dine {{early on}} first Thursdays at a hotel, {{planning}} what to do; {{high on the}} agenda was {{to change the way}} the Royal Society Council did business.

40|$|Anhydrous lithium {{perchlorate}} has been {{examined in the}} crystalline and molten state by infrared and Raman spectroscopy. In the crystalline phase all degenerate modes are split but the Raman and infrared spectra are essentially identical in the internal frequency region. In the molten state the spectra are more simple but <b>no</b> <b>coincidences</b> exist between infrared and Raman spectra. The spectra are interpreted {{in terms of a}} crystalline symmetry perturbation for both the solid and molten salts. The symmetry of the perturbing field is shown to change in going from the solid to the melt. An explanation of the melt spectra in terms of contact ion pairs is considered and dismissed. Observed vibrational frequencies and assignments are given...|$|R

50|$|Probably {{the most}} complex type of car chase {{involves}} going the wrong way at high speed against moderately congested freeway traffic, most notably in To Live and Die in L.A. and Ronin which, by <b>no</b> small <b>coincidence,</b> were directed by William Friedkin (The French Connection) and John Frankenheimer (French Connection II), respectively.|$|R
25|$|This {{political}} void {{was quickly}} {{filled with a}} number of opposition parties which recognized Muslims as a separate nation. Among them was the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, as a document from the 1930s reveals.

25|$|Radiocarbon dating {{traces the}} {{disappearance}} of ground sloths in the United States to around 11,000 years ago. Steadman et al. {{argue that it is}} <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that studies have shown that {{the disappearance of}} ground sloths occur a few years after humans inhabited their living areas, however, recent scientific work is beginning to reveal that climate change had much more of an impact on the decline of the mega fauna in North America.|$|E
25|$|Rogers was philanthropist Edward Harkness's {{favorite}} architect, and Harkness {{would often}} condition {{a gift for}} a new academic or medical building upon the institution's agreement to hire Rogers for the project. It is thus <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Rogers' work is abundant at Yale, Columbia and the other institutions Harkness supported lavishly. Though Harkness loved Rogers's work, when Harkness donated a new home for Wolf's Head, his society at Yale, another architect (Bertram Goodhue) was chosen.|$|E
50|$|The GM {{transmissions}} {{are usually}} numerically designated in Newton Metres. For example: The 6-speed M32 gearbox is fitted to the Opel/Vauxhall Astra VXR (pre-J model) {{and has a}} torque rating of 320 Nm (hence '32' designation). By <b>no</b> small <b>coincidence</b> the maximum torque output of the Astra VXR engine (Z20LEH) is limited to 320 Nm.|$|R
40|$|Identification of {{supernova}} remnants (SNR) in external galaxies {{through the}} combined use of radio, optical and X-ray surveys is discussed. Some 24 likely distant galaxy SNR {{have been found}} in the past six years, though confirmation is often difficult. Radio surveys of other galaxies are restricted by background object contamination in the field, and confirmation of these candidates requires other techniques. Optical measurement of the ratio of the forbidden SII doublet at. 6717 and. 6731 microns to H-alpha, followed by spectroscopic or radio confirmation, has successfully identified SNR in the LMC and other galaxies, though few in number. Most of the SNR in the Magellanic Clouds have been detected as X-ray emitters, but towards M 31 there are <b>no</b> <b>coincidences</b> between the lists of optical SNR and X-ray sources. An increase in SNR identifications should result from use of the Space Telescope and continued use of the VLA...|$|R
40|$|Quantum Information Processing, from {{cryptography}} to computation, {{based upon}} linear quantum optical circuit elements {{relies heavily on}} the ability offered by the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) Effect to route photons from separate input modes into one of two common output modes. Specifically, the HOM Effect accomplishes the path entanglement of two photons at a time such that <b>no</b> <b>coincidences</b> are observed in the output modes of a system exhibiting the effect. In this paper, we prove in principle that {{a significant increase in}} the robustness of the HOM Effect can be accomplished in a scalable, readily manufactured nanophotonic system comprised of two waveguides coupled, on chip, to a ring resonator. We show that by operating such a device properly, one can conditionally bunch coincident input photons in a way that is far more robust and controllable than possible with an ordinary balanced beam splitter.

25|$|The Zamarons are {{the first}} to acknowledge, after {{learning}} of Larfleeze's role in banishing the Orrery of Archangel Invictus into another dimension, that the events like Sinestro becoming a Green Lantern once again, the fall of the Sinestro Corps, the Red Lanterns Central Battery being poisoned, the return of Invictus and the Reach invasion in Odym are <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> a fact that was currently revealed to be the Guardians of the Universe doing as they try to bring about the rise of the Third Army.|$|E
25|$|Deepak's {{works are}} characterised by their tragic, dark endings. His {{characters}} find {{death as a}} constant companion, and often succumb to it. Often, critics have suggested that Deepak walks alongside his characters with a loaded gunâ€”recoiled and ready to fire. Maybe, one can trace the beginnings of Deepak's present mental ordeal to the dark stories that he was writing even in the early 1970s. Perhaps, it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Deepak's favourite authors are Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf, who succumbed to mental agony themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{oldest and}} most celebrated of the chansons de geste is The Song of Roland (earliest version {{composed}} c. 1098), seen by some as the national epic of France (comparable with Beowulf in England, the Song of the Nibelungs in Germany and the Lay of el Cid in Spain). It is perhaps <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that the Song of Roland was first written down at a date very close to that of Pope Urban's call (1095) for the First Crusade; its plot {{may be seen as}} a glorification of the crusader ethos.|$|E

Learning that his meeting with the Oni is <b>no</b> mere <b>coincidence.</b>|$|R
60|$|Examples are {{not wanting}} to {{substantiate}} theory. It is <b>no</b> mere <b>coincidence</b> that the two most impersonal nations of Europe and Asia respectively, the French and the Japanese, are {{at the same time}} the most artistic. Even politeness, which, as we have seen, distinguishes both, is itself but a form of art,--the social art of living agreeably with one's fellows.|$|R

There were less than 1,000year-round residents of Miami Beach in 1920. In the next five years, the resident population of the Miami Beach area grew 440%. People from all over the country flocked to South Florida in hopes of getting rich buying and selling real estate. They sent home tales of riches being made when orange groves and swamp lands were subdivided, sold, and developed.|$|E
25|$|Furman {{may have}} been the most {{successful}} coach in the history of chess, although some would give that title to Mark Dvoretsky. Chess culture has traditionally and typically credited the player for chess success, with the coach recognized in a much lesser fashion, or not at all. Chess coaches were not commonly seen for top players until the post-World War II period, when competition became much stiffer. They were first developed in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries; it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that top players from these nations have dominated chess for the past sixty years. Furman, with a very significant role in Karpov's development from his late teens, building upon earlier roles with World Champion Botvinnik and world-class players such as Bronstein, Korchnoi, and Geller, may have done more than any other coach, from the early 1950s until the late 1970s, to help ensure Soviet dominance.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that as RPI {{merged with}} Medical College of Virginia to form Virginia Commonwealth University, {{the dreams of}} {{building}} a great university propelled the crew. After struggling for three years as a student club, the crew's growing stature earned it varsity status, university funding, and a new coach, D.K. Waybright in 1970. With new shells, new equipment, and Waybright's unorthodox and aggressive coaching philosophy, the crew drew support at home and built a reputation on the road. The crew attracted crowds of picnicking students gathering {{on the banks of}} the James as the crews rowed from south of the 14th Street Bridge to the finish line at Ancarrow's Marina on the south side of the river. On the road, Commonwealth Crew traveled to Washington, Philadelphia, New York, South Carolina, and Miami and acquitted themselves against established crews such as Georgetown, Notre Dame, and even Cambridge University.|$|E
5000|$|Hong Kong films {{centering}} on Hong Kong police {{at the time}} often relied on comedy rather than action. The American film Dirty Harry {{is said to have}} inspired filmmakers to bring a more true-to-life representation of life [...] "behind the shield" [...] to the screen (It is probably <b>no</b> small <b>coincidence</b> that Lee later named his production company [...] "Magnum", after Harry Callahan's weapon of choice).|$|R

If that were untrue it was a dastardly lie; if it were true, what justification is there for opposition to this motion tonight?" ...|$|R
25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the practice of}} quarantine drove Hamilton's work in public health. It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that the Hygienic Laboratory began in an attic at Staten Island's Marine Hospital, near Ellis Island, the single busiest port of entry for immigrants during this period. Earlier on, Hamilton had established a Marine Hospital on Bedloe's Island, future site of the Statue of Liberty. Although MHS would not receive formal authority to issue domestic quarantines until 1893, Hamilton and his staff worked with the Congress to advance incremental changes toward a national policy. Maritime quarantine legislation (Act of August 1, 1888) strengthened the Act of 1878, adding new Federal quarantine stations along the East and West coasts; March 1891 legislation made medical inspection of immigrants part of MHS's duties; and interstate quarantine legislation (Act of March 27, 1890) gave MHS authority to establish quarantines against epidemic cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, and plague. On the request of his successor, Surgeon General Walter Wyman, Hamilton also returned to New York during the 1892 cholera pandemic, {{to set up a}} quarantine camp at Sandy Hook (Camp Low).|$|E
25|$|Distinct trends exist {{regarding}} conservation development. While many countries' {{efforts to}} preserve species and their habitats have been government-led, {{those in the}} North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in natural history, expressed {{at the level of}} the individual and the national, regional or local learned society. Thus countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, etc. had what we would today term NGOs â€“ in the shape of the RSPB, National Trust and County Naturalists' Trusts (dating back to 1889, 1895 and 1912 respectively) Natuurmonumenten, Provincial Conservation Trusts for each Dutch province, Vogelbescherming, etc. â€“ a long time before there were national parks and national nature reserves. This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe, as well as a longstanding interest in laissez-faire government in some countries, like the UK, leaving it as <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that John Muir, the Scottish-born founder of the National Park movement (and hence of government-sponsored conservation) did his sterling work in the USA, where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such NPs as Yosemite and Yellowstone. Nowadays, officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected in some way or the other, and in practice, private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status.|$|E

40|$|All {{cultural}} representations in {{the form}} of songs, pictures, literature, theater, film, television shows, and other media are deeply emotional and ideological, often difficult to define or analyze. Emotions are embedded as a cultural and social soundtrack of memories and minds, {{whether we like it or}} not. Feminist scholarship has emphasized over the past decade that affects and emotions are a foundation of human interaction. The cognitive understanding of the world has been replaced by a critical analysis in which questions about emotions and how we relate to the world as human beings is central (Ahmed 2004 : 5 - 12). It is in this memory-related instance that this article discusses the unexpected reappearance of a long forgotten song, Hasta siempre, as a part of my personal musical memory. It is a personal reflection on the complex interaction between memory, affect and the genre of protest songs as experiences in life and music. What does it mean when a melody intrudes in the middle of unrelated thoughts, when oneâ€™s mind is occupied with rational and purposive considerations? These memories are <b>no</b> <b>coincidences,</b> I argue, they are our forgotten selves singing to us...|$|R
