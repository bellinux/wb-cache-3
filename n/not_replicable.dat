40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} hedging <b>not</b> perfectly <b>replicable</b> contingent claims by using a benchmark, the numerraire portfolio, as reference unit. The proposed concept of benchmarked risk minimization generalizes classical risk minimization, pioneered by Follmer, Sondermann and Schweizer. The latter relies on a quadratic criterion, requesting the square integrability of contingent claims {{and the existence of}} an equivalent risk neutral probability measure. The proposed concept of benchmarked risk minimization avoids these restrictive assumptions. It employs the real world probability measure as pricing measure and identifies the minimal possible price for the hedgable part of a contingent claim. Furthermore, the resulting benchmarked profit and loss is only driven by nontraded uncertainty and forms a martingale that starts at zero. Benchmarked profit and losses, when pooled and sufficiently independent, become in total negligible. This property is highly desirable from a risk management point of view. It is making a symptotically benchmarked risk minimization the least expensive method for pricing and hedging for an increasing number of <b>not</b> fully <b>replicable</b> benchmarked contingent claims. incomplete market; pricing; hedging; numeraire portfolio; risk minimization; benchmark approach...|$|R

In some STV systems (Ireland since 1922, and Australia from 1918 to 1984), electoral officials select 200 ballot-papers randomly from the 1,200.

40|$|Abstract: The Antidirector Rights Index {{has been}} used as a measure of {{shareholder}} protection in over 100 articles.

For example, the corrected index does not bear out widely influential claims that shareholder protection is higher in common than in civil law countries, or that shareholder protection predicts market size, ownership dispersion, or resilience to financial crises.

In particular, no other index provides evidence for the postulated link between shareholder protection and ownership dispersion...|$|R
