40|$|Introduction: Attention to {{patients}} with acute minor illnesses represents a major burden for primary care. Although programs of nurse care for children with acute minor illnesses in primary care started a long time ago, there is limited information about {{the results of these}} programs in current practice. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the feasibility and efficacy of a program of <b>nurse</b> <b>management</b> for unscheduled consultations of children with acute minor illnesses. Methods: Observational study of children seeking unscheduled consultations for 16 acute minor illnesses in 284 primary care practices during a 2 -year period. The program of <b>nurse</b> <b>management</b> used predefined management algorithms. Findings: Among 467, 160 consultations performed, case resolution was achieved in 65. 4 %. The remaining 34. 6 % of cases were not solved by the primary healthcare nurse due to the existence of signs of alarm and were referred to a pediatrician. Return to consultation during a 7 -day period for the same reason as the original consultation was only 2. 6 %. Conclusions: A program that uses management algorithms is effective for <b>nurse</b> care <b>management</b> of children with acute minor illnesses in primary care. Clinical Relevance: Application of programs of <b>nurse</b> <b>management</b> for unscheduled consultations for children with acute minor illnesses is feasible and effective...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypertension is {{the leading}} global risk for mortality. Poor {{treatment}} and control of hypertension in low- and middle-income countries is due to several reasons, including insufficient human resources. <b>Nurse</b> <b>management</b> of hypertension is a novel approach to address the human resource challenge. However, specific barriers and facilitators to this strategy are not known. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate barriers and facilitators to <b>nurse</b> <b>management</b> of hypertensive patients in rural western Kenya, using a qualitative research approach. METHODS: Six key informant interviews (five men, one woman) and seven focus group discussions (24 men, 33 women) were conducted among physicians, clinical officers, nurses, support staff, patients, and community leaders. Content analysis was performed using Atlas. ti 7. 0, using deductive and inductive codes that were then grouped into themes representing barriers and facilitators. Ranking of barriers and facilitators was performed using triangulation of density of participant responses from the focus group discussions and key informant interviews, as well as investigator assessments using a two-round Delphi exercise. RESULTS: We identified a total of 23 barriers and nine facilitators to <b>nurse</b> <b>management</b> of hypertension, spanning the following categories of factors: health systems, environmental, nurse-specific, patient-specific, emotional, and community. The Delphi results were generally {{consistent with the findings}} from the content analysis. CONCLUSION: <b>Nurse</b> <b>management</b> of hypertension is a potentially feasible strategy to address the human resource challenge of hypertension control in low-resource settings. However, successful implementation will be contingent upon addressing barriers such as access to medications, quality of care, training of nurses, health education, and stigma...|$|R

40|$|D. Cur. (Professional Nursing) The {{negative}} experiences reflected by nurses indicate that current management models, {{on which the}} <b>management</b> of <b>nurses</b> is modelled, are not capable of generating solutions towards the present problems and the dilemma of this practice area. Two objectives have been stated in this study. namely {{the design of a}} <b>nurses</b> <b>management</b> model for professional wholeness and to formulate guidelines for a management manual which will facilitate professional wholeness. The construction of this model deliberately deviates from existing management frameworks and a nursing theory is used as basis, since <b>nurses</b> <b>management</b> needs it's own nursing framework to view the nursing organization as a unique organizational entity with corresponding unique interactional patterns. The inherent service and wholeness orientation of "Nursing for the Whole Person Theory" was utilised to construct a management model directed towards professional wholeness. A <b>nurses</b> <b>management</b> model for professional wholeness was generated up to level three of situation-relating theory. The process of model construction was put through three phases by which factor isolation, factor relations and situation relations have been described. The model is based on a wholeness approach by which the <b>management</b> of <b>nurses</b> is viewed as a service built on devotion and stewardship and directed towards the nurse as a whole person being {{an integral part of the}} nursing organization as a protesslonal organizational entity. The nursing organization, similar to the nurse, is viewed as a whole with an external and internal organizational environment. The nursing organization as a whole has bodily/physical, psychological (intellectual, emotional, volitional), spiritual and social dimensions where a state of maximal professional wholeness is reached only by deliberate and dynamic management interaction facilitated in a coordinated and integrated manner by comparable wholeness management processes. The approach of management for wholen ess set as point of departure that nurses who experience professional wholeness to a large extent will have a greater potential to render quality nursing and therefore facilitate health with others. Professional wholeness starts with the nurse manager, who in the quest for own personal wholeness and professional wholeness, facilitates the professional wholeness of the integral parts of the nursing organization namely the individual nurses and the nurse community. Professional wholeness implicates a dynamic movement on a continuum which mirrors the state of professional wholeness. The position on the continuum at anyone stage is dependant on the interactions taking place within the internal organizational en-vironment and between the internal organizational environment and the external organizational environment. The possible outcomes of the managerraent of nurses is a state which varies dynamically between minimal professional wholeness and maximal professional Wholeness. Management strategies which promote, rnalntain and restore, direct the intensity of interactions for facilitating the professional wholeness of nurses, tt 1 enurse community and the nursing organization. The choice of a specific strategy is based on the state of protesslonal wholeness reflected. A list of words has been developed (basEd on a Judeo Christian management ethic) to generate qualitative indices for minimal and maximal professional Wholeness. The quest for wholeness management is to striVe purposely and dynamicaly towards the reflection of a state of maximal professional wholeness by tile nurse, the nurse community and the nursing organization. The model has subsequently been evaluated by experts and from the evaluation it was concluded that the model can make a unique contribution to the practice area of <b>nurse</b> <b>management.</b> The application of the model in the practice area of <b>nurses</b> <b>management</b> will purposely and dynamically contribute towards solving the current dilemma of this practice area by enabling nurses to reach the objectives of nursing namely maximum quality nursing and to facilitate health intentionally. Broad guidelines have been stated as recommendations for further research. In the formulation of hypotheses an attempt has been made to capture the core aspects of wholeness management that need further empirical clarrification. The second objective of this study was addressed by formulating professional wholeness gUidelines for a manual that will facilitate professional wholeness. Eight modules were developed. The guidelines and objectives of the modules were formulated to enable students enrolling for a course in <b>nurse</b> <b>management</b> for professional wholeness to facilitate the principles of wholeness <b>management</b> in the <b>nurse's</b> <b>management</b> pratice area. The module dealing with the intellectual wholeness management processes has been developed as an example to give a more detailed version of the guidelines that have been formulated. In conclusion, the <b>nurse</b> <b>management</b> model for professional wholeness is a vision and an inspiration to return to the original mission of nursing where nursing again will become the central theme. Where the inherent service talent which distinguishes nurses from any other employee and which led them to the choice of nursing as a career will not be brutalized in the management process but will rather be embraced and nurtured...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Aim To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between nurse work environment, job outcomes and nurse-assessed quality of care in the Belgian context. Background Work environment characteristics are important for attracting and retaining professional nurses in hospitals. The Revised Nursing Work Index (NWI-R) was originally designed to describe the professional nurse work environment in U. S. Magnet Hospitals and subsequently has been extensively used in research internationally. Method The NWI-R was translated into Dutch to measure the nurse work environment in 155 nurses across 13 units in three Belgian hospitals. Factor {{analysis was used to}} identify a set of coherent subscales. The relationship between work environments and job outcomes and nurse-assessed quality of care was investigated using logistic and linear regression analyses. Results Three reliable, consistent and meaningful subscales of the NWI-R were identified: nursephysician relations, <b>nurse</b> <b>management</b> at the unit level and hospital management and organizational support. All three subscales had significant associations with several outcome variables. Nursephysician relations had a significant positive association with nurse job satisfaction, intention to stay the hospital, the nurse-assessed unit level quality of care and personal accomplishment. <b>Nurse</b> <b>management</b> at the unit level had a significant positive association with the nurse job satisfaction, nurse-assessed quality of care on the unit and in the hospital, and personal accomplishment. Hospital management and organizational support had a significant positive association with the nurse-assessed quality of care in the hospital and personal accomplishment. Higher ratings of nursephysician relations and <b>nurse</b> <b>management</b> at the unit level had significant negative associations with both the Maslach Burnout Inventory emotional exhaustion and depersonalization dimensions, whereas hospital management and organizational support was inversely associated only with depersonalization scores. Conclusion A Dutch version of the NWI-R questionnaire produced comparable subscales to those found by many other researchers internationally. The resulting measures of the professional practice environment in Belgian hospitals showed expected relationships with nurse self-reports of job outcomes and perceptions of hospital quality...|$|R
