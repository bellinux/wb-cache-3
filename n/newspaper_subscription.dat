25|$|In {{the wake}} of the arrest, it came out that the manager of the {{newspaper}} delivery agency in Higashisumiyoshi Ward had made a report to the police that a <b>newspaper</b> <b>subscription</b> fee of 230,000 yen had been stolen. Afterwards, the manager discovered that the thief was Kobayashi, now working in Kawai. On November 17, 2004, the day of the kidnapping, a judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kobayashi for the embezzlement reported by the manager. However, the manager did not inform the police of this, because he was promised that the suspect would repay him for the stolen money with monthly payments. Therefore, the police were not able to arrest Kobayashi, and he was free to commit his attack.|$|E
25|$|In September 1826, Lovejoy {{graduated}} from Waterville College with first-class honors {{at the top}} of his class. During the winter and spring, he taught at China Academy. Dissatisfied with daily teaching, Lovejoy thought about moving to the South or Western United States. His former teachers at Waterville College advised him that he would best serve God in the West. Agreeing, Lovejoy in May 1827 moved to Boston to earn money for his journey, having settled on Illinois as his destination. Unsuccessful at finding work, he started to Illinois by foot. He stopped in New York City in mid-June, to try to find work. He eventually landed a position with the Saturday Evening Gazette as a <b>newspaper</b> <b>subscription</b> peddler. For nearly five weeks, he walked up and down streets, knocking on peoples' doors and wheedling passersby, in hopes of getting them to subscribe to the newspaper. Struggling with his finances, he wrote to Jeremiah Chaplin, the president of Waterville College, explaining his situation. Chaplin sent the money that his former student so needed. Lovejoy promptly embarked on his journey to Illinois, reaching Hillsboro, Montgomery County, in the fall of 1827. Lovejoy did not think he could do well in Illinois's scantly settled land, so he headed for St. Louis.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout the 1930s {{large parts}} of the United States, {{including}} most farms, did not have electricity. Although organized radio broadcasting had begun in the early 1920s, in rural upstate South Carolina there were no nearby radio stations strong enough to be picked up by battery-less crystal radio receivers, and although battery-powered sets existed, without electrical service there was no convenient way to recharge the batteries. The economic struggles caused by the Great Depression meant that many people could not even afford a <b>newspaper</b> <b>subscription.</b> Thus, {{there was a lack of}} entertainment and a strong sense of isolation in the region. As one person remembered, connecting to the grapevine service meant that [...] "we had 'arrived' and were at last in touch with the outside world".|$|E
50|$|Brian De Palma {{had become}} {{successful}} with his 1968 underground comedy, Greetings, and {{was hired by}} Warner Bros. to direct Get to Know Your Rabbit in 1970, right after he had directed a follow-up to Greetings called Hi, Mom!.

Much of the comedy {{has its roots in}} the traditional British absurdist sense of humor associated with the likes of Monty Python and The Goon Show. Crittenden's screenplay is filled with oddball characters and bizarre situations, such as a bomber who is put on hold when he calls to announce his device will explode in six minutes, or a beautiful young woman who confesses to Donald her crush on the paper boy prompted her to prostitute herself so she could afford a <b>newspaper</b> <b>subscription.</b>|$|E

From 1890 he was actively sought by the authorities of the Russian Empire. Bielinis could not come home and had to hide. He escaped {{at least five times}} after being captured by gendarmes, despite a large monetary reward promised for his capture. This encouraged him to organize the book distribution even better. Bielinis became an ultimate professional book smuggler and the main organizer of the Lithuanian book distribution in northern Lithuania. He founded the Garšviai knygnešiai society, the largest book smuggling organization at the time. Bielinis developed a <b>newspaper</b> <b>subscription</b> system and delivered newspapers and magazines to the subscribers. His organization also delivered forbidden Latvian books to Latvia. For his active participation in underground book smuggling, Bielinis was nicknamed as knygnešių karalius (The King of the Book Carriers).|$|E

40|$|In Japan, {{newspapers}} enjoy {{a special}} exemption from antimonopoly prohibitions against {{resale price maintenance}} (suppliers’ stipulations that bar downstream firms from price discounting), but are each required to set uniform prices throughout Japan. In fact, the newspapers have rarely changed their subscription prices in recent years, and the three leading national dailies, together accounting for about half the total industry circulation, and thirteen other papers accounting for another one eighth of industry circulation, all have set exactly the same price (3, 925 yen per month for combined morning-and-evening editions, and 3, 007 yen per month for morning-only). The remaining local papers all set lower prices. Econometric analysis here shows that Japanese <b>newspaper</b> <b>subscription</b> prices are far below the levels that would maximize joint profit, given the newspaper content. The authorized resale price maintenance, and prohibition against prices that vary geographically, seems to have allowed only modest collusive price increases...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: This study {{focuses on}} a tax policy change towards subscribed {{newspapers}} in the Finnish newspaper market. The Finnish government decided to increase the value added tax rate of subscribed newspapers from 0 % to 9 %, bringing the legislative changes into force {{in the beginning of}} 2012. In earlier research the price elasticity of newspaper demand has been observed to be highly inelastic. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the effects of the 9 % VAT increase on the prices and circulations of subscribed newspapers and to determine whether the price elasticity of newspapers has increased due to the changing newspaper market. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The research is conducted with a difference-in-differences method with controlled individual fixed effects. The Finnish newspaper circulation development is analyzed with newspaper price and circulation panel data from periods 2006 - 2013 and controlled with corresponding data in the Norwegian market. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: According to the results of the study, the 9 % VAT increase moved fully into <b>newspaper</b> <b>subscription</b> prices. As a result, newspaper circulations showed a 3, 4 percent decrease compared to the control group and the newspapers' price elasticity of demand, 0, 37, can be seen as highly inelastic. The findings correspond to an estimation in the government proposal as well as findings in previous studies...|$|E
