25|$|In a 1975 {{interview}} in Alexandria, Harold Montgomery {{said that he}} thought that Tom Colten, the Republican mayor of Minden, had done a good job in office, but he <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> Colten's reported favoritism toward Jack Montgomery, a loyal Democrat, in that Harold Montgomery had sometimes supported Republican candidates, including Barry Goldwater.|$|E
25|$|That {{view was}} {{enforced}} by his very pragmatic approach to politics. Sir Oswald Mosley, for example, said he <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> why Eden was so strongly {{pushed by the}} Tory party, as he felt that Eden's abilities were very much inferior to those of Harold Macmillan and Oliver Stanley. In 1947, Dick Crossman called Eden “that peculiarly British type, the idealist without conviction”.|$|E
25|$|Giving {{control of}} IX. Fliegerkorps to the bomber arm had a {{disastrous}} impact. They were {{not qualified to}} conduct offensive operations and to lead fighter formations. Dissolution and heavy losses were the results. During {{the course of the}} conflict, the OKL <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> the importance of time, the need to rest, plan and recover to prolong defensive operations. Keeping units in the frontline wore them out.|$|E

25|$|After {{living in}} Württemberg for so long, {{she was at}} odds {{politically}} and religiously with her Russian relatives. Her political sympathies lay with Germany {{and she did not}} share the increasingly anti-German view of the Romanovs. Vera Konstantinovna was very religious, but had <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> the Orthodox faith and eventually abandoned it to convert to Lutheranism in 1909, to the consternation of the Romanov family. She then commissioned the building of a Protestant church on the grounds of Villa Berg.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after WCW was {{purchased}} by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001, Bagwell {{was one of the}} first AOL Time Warner contracted wrestlers to accept the offered buy-out on his contract and sign with the WWF. On July 1, 2001, Bagwell faced Booker T at a house show and he made his WWF televised debut on the July 2 episode of Raw is War, facing Booker T for the WCW Championship. The match went to a no-contest after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kurt Angle. When Bagwell arrived to the Raw tapings on July 9 in Atlanta, Georgia, he was informed he was being released from his contract due to complaints about his attitude and an altercation with fellow WCW alumnus Shane Helms. There were also accusations that Bagwell faked an injury at the July 3 SmackDown! tapings after receiving an aided powerbomb from the Acolytes Protection Agency. The accusations also claimed his mother Judy was calling WWF offices to request that her son get time off to heal from an injury supposedly inflicted to Bagwell from the aided powerbomb and to complain about her son's travel arrangements. However, Bagwell himself claims that he <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> why he was fired from the WWF.|$|E

500|$|Accidents have in {{particular}} been {{connected to the}} proportionate amount of time the aircraft spends taking off and landing, which are the most critical phases in flight. Further analysis shows that US Marine senior officers <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> {{the uniqueness of the}} aircraft, that the Harrier design was more complex, like that of helicopters. [...] Cutbacks in senior maintenance personnel and pilot mistakes had a disastrous effect on the safety of the American-operated AV-8B, which gained it a negative reputation in the US press that was not deserved.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, Heisenberg {{wrote to}} Robert Jungk, {{who was then}} working on the book [...] Heisenberg {{explained}} that he had visited Copenhagen to communicate to Bohr the views of several German scientists, that production of a nuclear weapon was possible with great efforts, and this raised enormous responsibilities on the world's scientists on both sides. When Bohr saw Jungk's depiction in the Danish translation of the book, he drafted (but never sent) a letter to Heisenberg, stating that he <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> the purpose of Heisenberg's visit, was shocked by Heisenberg's opinion that Germany would win the war, and that atomic weapons could be decisive.|$|E

500|$|Ratings for Homicide: Life on the Street {{gradually}} declined {{throughout the}} first season, and it ultimately finished 99th in the Nielsen ratings among network shows for the season. It aired Wednesdays at 9p.m. EST and was consistently {{defeated in the}} ratings by a high-rating comedy block featuring Home Improvement and Coach on ABC. Barry Levinson said the scheduling was a serious detriment to Homicide which, like many other drama series at the time, was designed for a 10 p.m. time-slot. Tom Fontana also believed Homicide suffered in the ratings because it aired between Unsolved Mysteries and Law & Order, which he believed was too many police dramas for one night: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> the concept of three hours of people in handcuffs {{as a way to}} entice an audience." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} {{the crew of the}} show enjoyed the episode, for the most part. Co-producer Paul Rabwin said that the episode had some of the funniest {{material}} in The X-Files {{as well as some of}} the most horrific, such as the scene where a cockroach crawled into someone's arm. Gillian Anderson rated the episode one of her favorite episodes of the third season. On a more negative note, writer Darin Morgan ended up being unhappy with the final product, saying [...] "The other day, my girlfriend was saying, 'I <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> that episode,' and I guess I don't either. It was an episode that had a lot of what I thought were really good ideas and never quite got it to work. I was really disappointed with that episode. Some people love it." [...] The plot for [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin, under the title Die, Bug, Die!.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for Complex, Drake stated that his debut album will be [...] "a solid hip hop album" [...] and musically distinct from his So Far Gone mixtape, which received negative comparisons to Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak (2008). He {{expressed a desire to}} work with André 3000, Kid Cudi, and Sade for the album. In {{an interview}} for MTV, Drake cited Nas and André 3000 as influences for parts of Thank Me Later, stating [...] "Nas was somebody that I used to listen to his raps and <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> how he did it. I always wanted to understand how he painted those pictures and his bar structure. I went back and really studied Nas and André 3000 and then came back with this album". In comparing the album to his previous work, he stated [...] "It's gonna be bigger, it's gonna sound happier. More victorious, 'cause that's where I'm at in my life". He told Entertainment Weekly that, [...] "I didn't make this album for commercial purposes. A lot of the verses are extremely long. I just made it to share with people. I hope they can enjoy".|$|E
500|$|Despite this, he was wealthy {{enough to}} {{purchase}} land worth £4,200 in 1648. He was in great demand; law reporters began recording his cases and in 1641 he advised Thomas Wentworth, the first Earl of Strafford, over his attainder for high treason. Although unsuccessful, Hale {{was then called}} to represent William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, during his impeachment by the House of Lords in October 1644. Hale, along with John Herne, argued that none of Laud's alleged offences constituted treason, and that the Treason Act 1351 had abolished all common law treasons. John Wilde, arguing for the prosecution, admitted that none of Laud's actions amounted to treason, but argued {{that all of them}} together did. Herne, in his arguments written by Hale, retorted that [...] "I crave your mercy, [...] I <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> before this time that two hundred couple of black rabbits would make a black horse!" [...] The case against Laud began to fail, but Parliament issued an Act of Attainder which declared him guilty, and sentenced him to death. After the capture of Charles I, Hale was expected to defend him, and indeed offered to do so; the King refused to submit to the court, claiming he did not recognise its jurisdiction. Edward Foss writes, based on the statement of Charles Runnington, that it was Hale who actually provided the King with this defence, and that it was only because the defence prevented any counsel being called for the King that Hale did not appear in court.|$|E

She simply <b>never</b> <b>understood</b> this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although God is {{referred}} to in the Tanakh with masculine imagery and grammatical forms, traditional Jewish philosophy does not attribute gender to God.
