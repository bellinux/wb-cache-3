They lived at 1 avenue Malakoff (now avenue Raymond Poincaré) in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, in an apartment overlooking the place du Trocadéro. The marriage did nothing to reduce her activism. <b>No</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>it</b> was due to her husband {{that she was able}} to hold several feminist meetings in the Civil Engineers premises at 19 rue Blanche.|$|E

According to Coughley, the USAF had full knowledge of the locations of Pakistani border posts, and thus there was no excuse for this incident.|$|E

500|$|On 7 April 2005, {{a body in}} an {{advanced}} state of decomposition was discovered by the French authorities in a valley at Théoule-sur-Mer, Alpes-Maritimes {{on the outskirts of}} Cannes. The police were led to the area by examining the last-known signal from Lord Shaftesbury's cellphone records.

500|$|... "Shine" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Gwen Stefani, featuring collaborative vocals by American entertainer Pharrell Williams. Originally intended for Stefani's band <b>No</b> <b>Doubt,</b> <b>it</b> was written and produced by Williams, with songwriting contributions from Stefani.

Stefani initially disagreed with Williams' choice to use direct references to Paddington in the lyrics, but praised this decision after watching the film with her children. She reported that her involvement with the recording was inspired by her then-husband Gavin Rossdale and her children's connection to England.|$|E
500|$|Tragic Kingdom is {{the third}} studio album by American rock band <b>No</b> <b>Doubt.</b> <b>It</b> was {{released}} on October 10, 1995 by Trauma Records, a division of Interscope Records.

500|$|Musically, [...] "Early Winter" [...] is a [...] "sleek, surging" [...] {{soft rock}} and synthpop ballad. Similar to Stefani's {{work with her}} band <b>No</b> <b>Doubt,</b> <b>it</b> is highly {{influenced}} by new wave music. Clark Collis from Entertainment Weekly termed it a [...] "tortured and not un-Keane-like lament". The lyrics of [...] "Early Winter" [...] are based on {{issues related to the}} end of a relationship, and Jennifer Vineyard from MTV described them to be [...] "poignant lyrics about a couple recognizing the beginning of the end". In the song, Stefani metaphorically compares the end of her relationship with her partner to falling leaves. It was speculated that the song was a reference to Stefani's own relationship with English musician and husband Gavin Rossdale. [...] "Early Winter" [...] was chosen as the fifth and final single from The Sweet Escape, and was released in Europe as a CD single on January 25, 2008 by Interscope Records.

2500|$|Snow Patrol's frontman, Gary Lightbody, {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} writing [...] "Run" [...] in 2000. In an interview with Michael Odell, from Q magazine, Lightbody explained the song was not written about [...] "being a child", as he tended to say. He described: [...] "I was on a massive bender and one night I was drinking in the bar of the Glasgow School of Art. I fell down a full flight of stairs. Jonny Quinn found me in the stairwell with blood {{coming out of my}} head ... I split my head open and my eye was closed and I lost a few teeth ... I wrote Run soon after on this little guitar I'd tried to smash up in my shitty little room near Hillhead. The words 'Light up, light up' gave me this sense of a beacon." [...] In an interview with Daily Mail in 2009, Lightbody added: [...] "We had nothing. I was in a flat in Glasgow. <b>No</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>it</b> was raining. The song was me writing about an imagined world, projecting myself into better times." [...] Beside Lightbody, it was written by Quinn, Nathan Connolly, Mark McClelland and Iain Archer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{impossibility of}} {{answering}} truly {{the question whether}} the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal {{in the evaluation of}} Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until then no one knows what it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire to know. It will only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>it</b> does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most useful, truth, and—triumphantly refute his own contention! ...|$|E
