5|$|The four {{terrestrial}} or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, {{few or no}} moons, and <b>no</b> <b>ring</b> systems. They {{are composed}} largely of refractory minerals, such as the silicates, which form their crusts and mantles, and metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet {{should not be confused}} with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).|$|E
5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears <b>no</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
5|$|NGC 772 is {{a spiral}} galaxy with an {{integrated}} magnitude of 10.3, located southeast of β Arietis and 15 arcminutes west of 15 Arietis. It {{is a relatively}} bright galaxy and shows obvious nebulosity and ellipticity in an amateur telescope. It is 7.2 by 4.2 arcminutes, meaning that its surface brightness, magnitude 13.6, is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude. NGC 772 is a class SA(s)b galaxy, which means {{that it is an}} unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent bulge and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly. The main arm, on the northwest side of the galaxy, is home to many star forming regions; this is due to previous gravitational interactions with other galaxies. NGC 772 has a small companion galaxy, NGC 770, that is about 113,000 light-years away from the larger galaxy. The two galaxies together are also classified as Arp 78 in the Arp peculiar galaxy catalog. NGC 772 has a diameter of 240,000 light-years and the system is 114 million light-years from Earth. Another spiral galaxy in Aries is NGC 673, a face-on class SAB(s)c galaxy. It is a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms. It has <b>no</b> <b>ring</b> and a faint bulge and is 2.5 by 1.9 arcminutes. It has two primary arms with fragments located farther from the core. 171,000 light-years in diameter, NGC 673 is 235 million light-years from Earth.|$|E

500|$|Entoloma sinuatum (commonly {{known as}} the livid entoloma, livid agaric, livid pinkgill, leaden entoloma, and lead poisoner) is a {{poisonous}} mushroom found across Europe and North America. Some guidebooks refer to it by its older scientific names of Entoloma lividum or Rhodophyllus sinuatus. The largest mushroom of the genus of pink-spored fungi known as Entoloma, {{it is also the}} type species. [...] Appearing in late summer and autumn, fruit bodies are found in deciduous woodlands on clay or chalky soils, or nearby parklands, sometimes in the form of fairy rings. Solid in shape, they resemble members of the genus Tricholoma. The ivory to light grey-brown cap is up to 20cm (8in) across with a margin that is rolled inward. The sinuate gills are pale and often yellowish, becoming pink as the spores develop. The thick whitish stem has <b>no</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E

Considered more deadly than the deathcap (Amanita phalloides), G.sulciceps {{has been shown to}} contain the toxins known as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-) and gamma- (γ-) amanitins; a series of poisonings in Indonesia in the 1930s [...] resulted in 14 deaths from the consumption of this species. It has a typical [...] "little brown mushroom" [...] appearance, with few obvious external characteristics to help distinguish it from many other similar nondescript brown species.

500|$|Inocybe cookei has a conical or {{bell-shaped}} cap {{of between}} [...] in diameter. As the mushrooms age, the cap becomes flatter, and an umbo becomes prominent. The {{margin of the}} cap frequently cracks towards the centre. The cap is an ochre colour, and the upper surface is covered in long fibres. The silky fibres thickly cover the cap, starting and the centre and extending to the cap's margin. The species has a whitish or ochre stem of [...] in height by [...] in thickness. There is a distinctive [...] bulb {{at the base of}} the stem, and <b>no</b> <b>ring.</b> The flesh is white, becoming yellow with age. Inocybe cookei mushrooms have closely packed adnexed gills (gills that are attached to the stem only on part of their depth).

500|$|Amanita ceciliae, {{commonly}} called snakeskin grisette and strangulated amanita, is a basidiomycete fungus in the genus Amanita. First described in 1854 by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome, {{it was given}} its current name by Cornelis Bas in 1984. It is characterized by bearing a large fruit body with a brown cap [...] across. The cap has charcoal-grey patches, which are easily removable. The stipe is [...] long, white in colour, and there is <b>no</b> <b>ring</b> on it. It is slightly tapered to the top, and has irregular cottony bands girdling the base. The universal veil is grey. Spores are white, spherical in shape, non-amyloid, and measure 10.2–11.7 micrometres. The mushrooms are considered edible, but field guides typically advise caution in selecting them for consumption, due to risks of confusion with similar toxic species. A.ceciliae is found in woods throughout Europe and North America, where it fruits during summer and autumn.|$|E
500|$|The gill {{attachment}} {{ranges from}} adnate (broadly {{attached to the}} stem) to adnexed (narrowly attached). The spacing of the narrow gills is close to crowded, and the gill color is initially dull gray before maturing spores cause the color to change to purplish-brown. The stem is [...] long and [...] thick, and more or less equal in width throughout its length or slightly larger near the base. The hollow, brittle, stem is pale brown on the upper part, and reddish-brown near the bottom. The stem is densely covered with whitish fibrils that are pressed flat against the surface; the fibrils slough off in maturity to leave a smooth surface. The mushroom has a cortinate partial veil (resembling the webby cortina produced by species of Cortinarius) {{but it does not}} last for long; it occasionally leaves behind sparse remnants of tissue hanging on the cap margin and {{the upper part of the}} stem. <b>No</b> <b>ring</b> remains on the stem after the veil disappears.
