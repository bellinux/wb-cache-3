5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I <b>noticed</b> <b>was</b> that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
5|$|An Allied council met on 1 December {{to discuss}} {{proposals}} for the battle. Most of the Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind: making {{contact with the}} enemy and securing the southern flank that held the communication line to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was more cautious and, as mentioned, he was seconded by Kutuzov, the Commander-in-chief of the Russians and the Allied troops. The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted the plan of the Austrian Chief-of-Staff, Franz von Weyrother. This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies <b>noticed</b> <b>was</b> lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The Russian Imperial Guard was held in reserve while Russian troops under Bagration guarded the Allied right. The Russian Tsar rudely stripped the authority of Commander-in-chief M. I. Kutuzov {{and gave it to}} Franz von Weyrother. In the battle, Kutuzov could only command the IV Corps of the Allied army, although he was still the de facto commander because the Tsar was afraid to take over in case his favoured plan failed.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Maës made a {{critically}} acclaimed screen debut as Ditte Godpige in the filmatization of Martin Andersen Nexø's novel, Ditte Menneskebarn (Ditte, Child of Man). Her {{performance in the}} film about the hardships of a young impoverished girl received international recognition. Especially <b>noticed</b> <b>was</b> her thoroughly wholesome and pure sensualism even while bathing nude. However, film reviewers in the United States (where the movie was seen in an edited version which removed any nudity) dismissed the movie as being too melodramatic. Maës replied in a later interview that the American audience had never been confronted with poverty in such a realistic portrayal on screen. During the 1950s, Maës performed in many of light-hearted films {{in the role of}} the sweet young ingenue. She played starring roles in several family films adapted from the popular Morten Korch novels, the first of which, The Red Horses, became the biggest box-office success in Danish cinema. Maës also was able to bring a more serious side to her acting, and in 1954, she was awarded the Bodil Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of an insane girl in Sven Aage Lorentz's experimental film, Himlen er Blå.|$|E

25|$|Returning to {{his native}} Germany, Schmeling won three of his next four fights, with one draw, {{including}} knockout wins over first Walter Neusel, then another redeeming his previous loss to Steve Hamas. However, many among the American press and fans remained unmoved {{on the idea of}} rooting for Schmeling in light of the Nazi Party's behavior. Articles continued to be published declaring the German 'washed up,' a 'has been,' or a 'Nazi puppet.' When he was matched with undefeated black sensation Joe Louis in 1936 for the German's first fight on American soil in more than two years, he was clearly the betting underdog, considered a name opponent for Louis to roll over on his route to the title. Nevertheless, he was number two contender for the title behind Louis. Prior to the match, Schmeling carefully studied films of Louis's prior fights, dissecting apparent flaws in the Detroit fighter's technique. Among the weaknesses he <b>noticed</b> <b>was</b> the fact that Louis lowered his left hand after throwing a left jab. In the ring, Schmeling exploited this subtle flaw to his own advantage, countering nearly every Louis jab with his best punch, the right cross. The fight proved to be a competitive, hard-hitting affair for the first three rounds, but, in the fourth, a counter right from the German dropped Louis {{for the first time in}} his career. Though Louis rose, he was badly dazed for the remainder of the fight. For a further eight rounds, Schmeling battered Louis, often standing toe-to-toe with the vaunted puncher and landing that same right hand to the jaw repeatedly. In the twelfth, he sent the American tumbling to the floor once more, and this time Louis could not recover. He was counted out on the floor, and Schmeling had scored the most talked-about sports upset of the year.|$|E
500|$|Mohun {{frequently}} {{came into}} conflict with the native tribesmen. [...] When his mail bag and personal papers were stolen and a local chief refused to return them he proceeded to wage war on the chief accompanied by four gunmen and a steamboat. [...] Mohun attacked and burnt at least ten villages before he captured the chief's son whom he threatened to hang. [...] In return for his son's life the chief returned the mail bag, alongside a second that Mohun had not <b>noticed</b> <b>was</b> missing. [...] Another time, seeking to view the native method of making cloth, he visited a remote town accompanied by only six followers covertly armed with revolvers. [...] The party came under attack by spears and poisoned arrows. [...] Having fought off their assailants Mohun captured the town and [...] "burned {{it to the ground}} to teach them a lesson". [...] Mohun was always conscious of his public image and wrote a diary with a view to later publication. [...] Mohun's diary contains {{little in the way of}} self-criticism and he reflects upon his responsibility for this incident by stating that he was [...] "satisfied in my own conscience that I had rid the country of a brute and unnecessary member of society." [...] On another occasion he witnessed the funeral of a local chief who had four of his wives and 10 slaves buried alive with him. [...] Mohun was unable to intervene, in spite of his horror at the situation, as he had only a small escort and was heavily outnumbered.|$|E

2500|$|Upon release, Record Mirror {{reviewed}} the album and concluded: [...] "The numbers offer {{a lot of}} variety. The most immediate thing I <b>noticed</b> <b>was</b> the arrangements - which included some solid bass work that would have done justice to Led Zeppelin. Next, there's the use of backup vocals, something Slade haven't used {{too much in the}} past. Finally, there's the pace, lots of it. It's not an album of singles - it does present tracks that are a lot deeper than I expected. You're right lads, you're nobody's fools!" [...] New Musical Express wrote: [...] "Well if this album is an accurate representation of their album-making ability I doubt it very much. Oh, Slade are an exciting band. Plenty of kick and grit, and their unrefined charm which has been captured from their live performances in the studio environment, but though superficially the music here is of reasonable standard, there's not a lot of depth. Really the album is just a collection of hooky little singles." [...] Music Week wrote [...] "A cracking album, the group is now playing better than ever. Slade has matured {{to the point of being}} able to convert an older audience to their cause." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matt Leone of 1UP.com said of a pre-release {{version of}} the game's PS3 port at E3 2009: [...] "The first thing I <b>noticed</b> <b>was</b> that, {{at the end of}} a normal combo, you can hold down the final button in the string to {{continuously}} fire gunshots—which looks incredibly cool when you kick someone and then keep your leg pointed at their face as your foot pours bullets on it." [...] He added, [...] "I'll be amazed if Bayonetta doesn't end up being one of the best action games this year." [...] Staff at GameSpot UK were also generally impressed with the PS3 port, which they played on June 3. [...] They called the [...] "Witch Time" [...] mechanic a [...] "cool move" [...] and one of the two boss battles they fought were [...] "pretty intense", and said [...] "it's easy to see the similarities between the two over-the-top action games [...] ". [...] They added, [...] "Rampant violence and sexism is par for the course" [...] in the game. [...] 1UP's staff again played a PS3 version for 15 minutes on the weekend of August 31 that year, at PlatinumGames's [...] "Feel Bayonetta" [...] event in Tokyo's Roppongi district. [...] They said that it [...] "was very blurry" [...] compared to a 360 version displayed there, and that its frame rate [...] "was all over the place.... it was often hard to keep track of the action [...] because of the graphical issues on PS3." ...|$|E

2500|$|Researchers used rats {{in order}} to {{investigate}} the effects of novel tactile objects on the long-term evolution of the major rodent forebrain loops essential in species-specific behaviours, including such structures as the hippocampus, putamen, neocortex [...] and the thalamus. [...] The rats were monitored but not bothered for 48–96 hours, allowing normal wake-sleep cycles to occur. [...] At some point four novel tactile objects {{were placed in the}} four corners of the rat's cage. [...] They were all very different from one another and they were there for a total of one hour. [...] The brain activity during this hour was used as a baseline or template to compare. [...] Data analysis implied that the neural assemblies during SWS correlated significantly more with templates than during waking hours or REM sleep. As well, these post-learning, post-SWS reverberations lasted 48 hours, much longer than the duration of novel object learning (one hour), indicating long term potentiation. [...] Further analysis on a neuron to neuron base showed no subset of neurons (brain structure) to be responsible for the reverberations or anti-reverberations (patterns of activity significantly more dissimilar than novel stimulation templates). [...] Another difference <b>noticed</b> <b>was</b> the highest correlation peaks in SWS corresponded with the lowest rate of neuron firing in the forebrain, opposite that of REM sleep and waking where rate of firing is the highest. [...] It is hypothesized that this is due to interference from other incoming stimuli during waking periods. [...] In SWS there is no incoming stimuli so the novel experience can be replayed, without interruption.|$|E
