50|$|Dactylorhiza traunsteineri (<b>Narrow-leaved</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid</b> or Traunstein's dactylorhiza) is a {{terrestrial}} {{species of}} orchid {{native to the}} cooler parts of the Eastern Hemisphere. It is native to Scandinavia, the Alps, and a region extending from Germany to Western Siberia. Although said by some sources to occur in Britain and Ireland, others say that plants identified as this species are actually Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. traunsteinerioides, a view supported by genetic data.|$|E

50|$|Other orchids {{that are}} to be found in Rospuda Valley include: the western <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid</b> (Dactylorhiza majalis), lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus), early coralroot (Corallorrhiza trifida), the common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), Pugsley's <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid</b> (Dactylorhiza traunsteineri), <b>marsh</b> helleborine (Epipactis palustris), fen orchid (Liparis loeselii).

50|$|In Germany {{the western}} <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid</b> is {{widespread}} {{but with several}} gaps. In many places, especially from western to northern Germany, it is extinct.|$|R
50|$|In Switzerland {{the western}} <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid</b> is also quite widespread. A {{significant}} gap is found {{south of the}} Aar between Aarau and Lake Neuchâtel.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} marsh plants, {{the numbers of}} this species have been dwindling for quite some time. The main causes are the entry of {{nitrogen}} via fertilizer, drying out of the habitat, and intensive conversion to pasture. The western <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid</b> does not react so sensitively to changes in its habitat as for example the early <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid,</b> Dactylorhiza incarnata. It is usually {{the last of the}} native orchids to disappear. This tolerance makes it a still relatively common species.|$|R
50|$|This {{site has}} areas of marshland, {{wet and dry}} woodland, and grassland. The flower-rich marshes have {{southern}} <b>marsh</b> <b>orchid,</b> <b>marsh</b> marigold and ragged robin.
