40|$|We {{have used}} the alpha 1 D-adrenoceptor {{selective}} antagonist, BMY 7378, the alpha 1 D-selective agonists, adrenaline and phenylephrine, the alpha 1 A-selective antagonists, (+) -niguldipine, SB 216469 and WB 4101, and the non-subtype-selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, <b>nemonapride,</b> to investigate the presence of alpha 1 D-adrenoceptors in rat tissues at the protein level. Radioligand binding studies using [3 H]prazosin as the radioligand were performed in three tissues containing alpha 1 D-adrenoceptor mRNA, spleen, cerebral cortex and kidney, and in comparison in one tissue not containing alpha 1 D-adrenoceptor mRNA, liver. Cerebral cortex and kidney were also studied upon alpha 1 B-adrenoceptor inactivation by chloroethylclonidine treatment (10 microM, 30 min, 37 degrees C). Experiments with cloned rat alpha 1 -adrenoceptor subtypes transiently expressed in COS cells confirmed the known selectivity of the investigated drugs for alpha 1 -adrenoceptor subtypes or the lack thereof of <b>nemonapride.</b> Accordingly <b>nemonapride</b> had steep and monophasic competition curves in all native and chloroethylclonidine-treated tissues. BMY 7378 also had steep and monophasic competition curves and low affinity in all native tissues. In contrast, adrenaline and phenylephrine (in the presence of 100 microM GTP) had monophasic competition curves of low affinity in liver and spleen but biphasic competition curves in cerebral cortex and kidney. Following chloroethylclonidine treatment competition curves for adrenaline, phenylephrine, (+) -niguldipine, SB 216469 and WB 4101 remained biphasic in cerebral cortex and kidney while those for <b>nemonapride</b> remained monophasic. We conclude that alpha 1 D-adrenoceptors are not readily detectable at the protein level {{in a variety of}} rat tissues where their mRNA is expressed. The biphasic competition curves of some agonists and antagonists in chloroethylclonidine-treated rat tissues do not represent alpha 1 D-adrenoceptors and are not readily explained by the present alpha 1 A/alpha 1 B/alpha 1 D-adrenoceptor classificatio...|$|E
40|$|D 2 -like {{receptor}}s � In vivo binding � Frontal cortex � Olfactory lobes � [3 H]nemonapride Dopamine D 2 receptor blockade {{is thought}} to be mandatory for antipsychotic action because most of the currently used antipsychotics have high affinity at these receptors. Here, we examined the in vivo binding characteristics of the D 2 -like receptor antagonist [3 H]nemonapride in rat brain areas including the striatum, olfactory lobes and frontal cortex and its inhibition by a series of D 2 antagonist antipsychotics. In vivo affinity of [3 H]nemonapride was similar (apparent K d value: 0. 05 � mol/kg) in all brain regions examined. The estimated number of binding sites was higher in the striatum (66 fmol/mg wet weight) than in the olfactory lobes (28 fmol/mg wet weight) and the frontal cortex (21 fmol/ mg wet weight). In the striatum, [3 H]nemonapride binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with the following order of potency (ED 50, mg/kg) : <b>nemonapride</b> (0. 04), raclopride (0. 13), spiperone and risperidone (0. 14), haloperidol (0. 21), clozapine (7. 2) and thioridazine (9. 4); in the olfactory lobes: <b>nemonapride</b> (0. 03), raclopride and spiperone (0. 09), haloperidol (0. 10), risperidone (0. 15), thioridazine and clozapine (11); in the frontal cortex, only the high affinity dopamine D 2 antagonist com-pounds <b>nemonapride</b> (0. 05), haloperidol (0. 09), and raclopride (0. 12) significantly decreased the binding of [3 H]nemonapride.

40|$|The D 2 {{dopamine}} receptor {{exists as}} dimers or as higher-order oligomers, as determined from data from physical experiments. In this study, we sought {{evidence that this}} oligomerization leads to cooperativity by examining the binding of three radioligands ([H- 3] <b>nemonapride,</b> [H- 3] raclopride, and [H- 3] spiperone) to D 2 dopamine receptors expressed in membranes of Sf 9 cells. In saturation binding experiments, the three radioligands exhibited different B-max values, and the B-max values could be altered {{by the addition of}} sodium ions to assays. Despite labeling different numbers of sites, the different ligands were able to achieve full inhibition in competition experiments. Some ligand pairs also exhibited complex inhibition curves in these experiments. In radioligand dissociation experiments, the rate of dissociation of [H- 3] <b>nemonapride</b> or [H- 3] spiperone depended on the sodium ion concentration but was independent of the competing ligand. Although some of the data in this study are consistent with the behavior of a cooperative oligomeric receptor, not all of the data are in agreement with this model. It may, therefore, be necessary to consider more complex models for the behavior of this receptor...|$|E

We have used the two radioligands in parallel to study a range of dopamine receptors [D- 2 (short), D- 2 (long), and D- 3] in different buffers. B-max values derived using either radioligand differ by an average of < 20 %, independent of receptor type or buffer conditions.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{catalepsy}} serves as an experimental animal model of parkinsonism. In this study, the relationship between in vivo dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptor occupancies and catalepsy was investigated to predict the intensity of catalepsy induced by drugs that bind to D 1 and D 2 receptors nonselectively. 3 H-SCH 23390 and 3 H-raclopride {{were used for the}} labeling of D 1 and D 2 receptors, respectively. The ternary complex model consisting of agonist or antagonist, receptor, and transducer was developed, and the dy-namic parameters were determined.

30|$|Our novel {{finding that}} IBZM showed inverse agonism in the cAMP assay {{is in line}} with recent {{findings}} that the antipsychotics <b>nemonapride</b> and sulpiride (similar to IBZM, benzamides), and also antipsychotics from other chemical classes (e.g. butyrophenones like haloperidol), that were initially believed to be DA receptor neutral antagonists are now re-classified as inverse agonists by the results of studies using functional assays [29]. It is alleged that inverse agonists bind preferentially to the inactive state of the receptor [30], so this might indicate that in vivo 123 I-IBZM predominantly binds to striatal D 2 Rs in their inactive low-affinity state. Since 11 C-raclopride PET and 18 F-fallypride are frequently used to assess DA release in vivo[5],[7],[23], it may be of relevance to test whether raclopride and fallypride are also inverse agonists for cAMP instead of antagonists. If our proposition is true that benzamide radiopharmaceuticals in vivo bind predominantly to DA D 2 / 3 Rs in their low-affinity state, this will extend the discussion on why benzamides tracers are less sensitive than agonists D 2 / 3 R radiopharmaceuticals (like 11 C-PHNO) to detect DA release in vivo[5],[7].|$|E
40|$|Amisulpride is a {{substituted}} benzamide antipsychotic with nanomolar affinity {{and high}} selectivity for dopamine D- 2 and dopamine D- 3 receptors.

Binding studies were performed using either [H- 3]spiperone or [H- 3]nemonapride in baculovirus/Spodoptera frugiperda insect (Sf- 9) cell system expressing either the human dopamine recombinant D(2) long (hD(2 L)) or the rat dopamine recombinant D- 3 (rD(3)) receptors. K-i values at dopamine rD(3) receptors were similar regardless of the radioligand used, whereas at hD(2 L) receptors values were higher using [3 H]spiperone than [H- 3]nemonapride, However, the rank order of compound potency against radiolabeled spiperone or <b>nemonapride</b> both at dopamine hD(2 L) and at dopamine rD(3) receptors was similar. (-) S amisulpride displaced [H- 3]spiperone or [H- 3]nemonapride binding from both dopamine hD(2 L) or dopamine rD(3) receptors, being twofold more potent than the racemic form and 38 - 19 -fold more potent than (+) R enantiomer. Both racemic and the (-) S enantiomer exhibited 2 - 4 ([H- 3]spiperone) - and 3 - 4 ([H- 3]nemonapride) -fold higher affinity than haloperidol for dopamine rD(3) receptor, respectively.

40|$|Human {{dopamine}} D(2) (hD(2)) and D(3) (hD(3)) receptors {{were expressed}} at similar, high expression levels in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and their coupling to G proteins and further signal transduction pathways were compared. In competition radioligand-binding experiments, guanosine- 5 '-O-(3 -thio) triphosphate (GTPgammaS) treatment of hD(2 S) - or hD(3) -CHO cell membranes induced a rightward shift and steeping of the dopamine inhibition curve. This effect was pronounced for hD(2) receptors and small for hD(3) receptors. Activation of G proteins {{was investigated in}} [(35) S]GTPgammaS-binding assays. Dopamine stimulated [(35) S]GTPgammaS binding 330 and 70 % over basal levels on hD(2) -CHO and hD(3) -CHO cell membranes, respectively. (+) - 7 -(Dipropylamino) - 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydro- 2 -naphthalenol and PD 128907 were partial agonists for both receptors. Haloperidol, risperidone, raclopride, and <b>nemonapride</b> inhibited dopamine-stimulated [(35) S]GTPgammaS binding with potencies comparable to their binding affinities for hD(2) and hD(3) receptors in CHO cell membranes; inverse agonism could not be detected with this assay. Receptor stimulation by dopamine inhibited forskolin-induced cyclic AMP formation in hD(2) -CHO and hD(3) -CHO cells by 70 %. Furthermore, the extracellular acidification rate increased when hD(2) -CHO and hD(3) -CHO cells were stimulated by dopamine; this effect was abolished by pertussis toxin pretreatment. In this study, we could demonstrate clear functional effects {{at different levels of}} the signaling cascade of hD(2) and hD(3) receptors in CHO cells when expressed at high levels. High-affinity agonist binding to hD(2) and hD(3) receptors was still present, but effects of receptor-G protein uncoupling at hD(3) receptors were small, indicating that hD(3) receptors maintain relatively high-affinity agonist binding in the absence of G proteins. status: publishe...|$|E

Both agonists and antagonists showed 2 - to 25 -fold lower binding affinities at hD 2 receptors in E. coli versus CHO cell membranes (measured with [3 H]spiperone), but the rank order of potencies remained similar. Purported inverse agonists did not display higher affinities for G-protein-free receptors. In CHO membranes, GppNHp decreased high affinity agonist ([3 H] 7 -OH-DPAT) binding at hD 2 receptors but not at hD 3 receptors. Also, [3 H] 7 -OH-DPAT (nanomolar concentration range) binding was undetectable at hD 2 but clearly measurable at hD 3 receptors in E. coli membranes. Addition of a Gi/o-protein mix to E. coli membranes increased high affinity [3 H] 7 -OH-DPAT binding in a concentration-dependent manner at hD 2 and hD 3 receptors; this effect was reversed by addition of GppNHp. The potency of the Gi/o-protein mix to reconstitute high affinity binding was similar for hD 2 and hD 3 receptors. Thus, agonist binding to D 3 receptors is only slightly affected by G-protein uncoupling, pointing to a rigid receptor structure. Furthermore, we propose that the generally reported lower signaling capacity of D 3 receptors (versus D 2 receptors) is not due to its lower affinity for G-proteins but attributed to its lower capacity to activate these G-proteins. ...|$|E

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: While the {{blockade}} of dopamine D 2 receptors {{are necessary for}} antipsychotic action, antipsychotic agents differ nearly a thousand-fold in their affinity for the D 2 receptor. This affinity {{is determined by the}} rate at which the antipsychotic agent binds to (kon) and the rate at which it dissociates from (koff) the D 2 receptors. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between kon, koff and the affinity (Ki) of antipsychotic agents for the D 2 receptors, with particular reference to typical and atypical antipsychotic agents. DESIGN: The koff of several typical as well as atypical antipsychotic agents (<b>nemonapride,</b> spiperone, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, raclopride, olanzapine, sertindole, clozapine and quetiapine) was measured in vitro using the 3 H-radiolabelled analogues of these drugs. The affinity of these drugs for the D 2 receptor was determined by competition with 3 H-raclopride in vitro. The kon was derived from values of affinity and ++koff. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: kon, koff, and the Ki of antipsychotic drugs. RESULTS: The range of affinity values was similar to that conventionally accepted (0. 025 - 155 nmol/L). The koff values varied a thousand-fold from 0. 002 to 3. 013 min- 1, with relatively little variation in kon. The rate at which antipsychotic agents come off the receptor (koff) accounted for 99 % of the variation in their affinity for the D 2 receptor; differences in kon did not account for differences in affinity. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in the affinity of antipsychotic agents are entirely determined by how fast they come off the D 2 receptor. These differences in koff may lead to functionally different kinds of dopamine blockade. Drugs with a higher koff will be faster in blocking receptors, and once blocked, will provide more access to surges in dopamine transmission. Since atypical drugs show a lower affinity and a faster dissociation, a higher koff for the D 2 receptor is proposed as a mechanism for "atypical" antipsychotic effect...|$|E
