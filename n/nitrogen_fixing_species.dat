40|$|New Caledonia {{is renowned}} for its floristic {{diversity}} and high level of endemism. Outcrops of ultramafic rock, the origin of nickel ore, cover 1 / 3 of the Grand Terre (main island) and possess a highly diverse flora (1800 species of phanerogams of which 1150 species are endemic to these outcrops). Nickel mine revegetation practices in New Caledonia are based on three methods. Site rehabilitation is carried out by either artificialy improving substrate conditions, hence favouring exotic species, or by implanting several gregarious <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> (#Casuarinaceae$, #Leguminoseae$), or by establishing a variety of endemic ultramafic colonisers (#Cyperaceae$, #Myrtaceae$, #Proteaceae$ [...] .). These three methods differ {{in their ability to}} both restore the biological conditions of the site and reconstitute its original biodiversity. Studies of the natural and secondary vegetation show the possible effects vegetation composition have on restoring the fertility of the underlying soil. Preliminary results indicate that endemic ultramafic species are slow growing due to the poor nutrient status of the substrate. Many of the species accumulate different plant nutrients. Combining these ultramafic colonizers with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> may increase the growth and eventual establishment of a diverse endemic flora. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

In the case of the Jena-Experiment, the highest NPP was reached by Onobrychis viciifolia (esparsette) as dominant species with few additional subdominant species. Onobrychis also contributes to a large extent to the high NPP at experimental species mixtures.

Relationship between crops have received little attention despite the wide range of advantages that confers species diversity to these systems, such as increased productivity, resilience to disruption and ecological sustainability. Forests and forestry plantations can develop an important role in storing carbon in their tissues, especially in wood which become into durable product. A simplifying parameter to analyze the amount allocated carbon by plantation is the TBCA (total belowground carbon allocation), whereby, for short periods and mature plantations, is admitted as the subtraction between soil carbon efflux and litterfall. Soil respiration depends on a wide range of factors, such as soil temperature and soil water content, soil fertility, presence and type of vegetation, among others. The studied orchard is a mixed forestry plantation of hybrid walnuts(Juglans × intermedia Carr.) for wood and alders (Alnus cordata (Loisel.) Duby.), a nitrogen fixing specie through the actinomycete Frankia alni ((Woronin, 1866) Von Tubeuf 1895). The study area is sited at Restinclières, a green area near Montpellier (South of France). In the present work, soil respiration varied greatly throughout the year, mainly influenced by soil temperature. Soil water content did not significantly influence the response of soil respiration as it was constant during the measurement period and under no water stress conditions. Distance between nearest walnut and measurement was also a highly influential factor in soil respiration. Generally there was a decreasing trend in soil respiration when the distance to the nearest tree increased. It was also analyzed the response of soil respiration according to alder presence and fertilizer management (50 kg N·ha- 1 ·año- 1 from 1999 to 2010). None of these treatments significantly influenced soil respiration, although previous studies noticed an inhibition in rates of soil respiration under fertilized conditions and high rates of available nitrogen. However, treatments without fertilization and without alder presence obtained higher respiration rates in those cases with significant differences. The lack of significant differences between treatments may be due to the high coefficient of variation experienced by soil respiration measurements. Finally an asynchronous fluctuation was observed between soil respiration and litterfall during senescence period. This is possibly due to the slowdown in the emission of exudates by roots during senescence period, which are largely related to microbial activity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: More {{than two}} third tree species were in early {{succession}} and similarly, the {{higher number of}} shrubs and herbs were in early and mid-succession indicates the successional nature of the community. A comparatively higher number of trees and shrubs were recorded on the western aspect where low erosion and greater anthropogenic pressure were present. The total tree density was higher at hilltop of eastern aspect and hill slope of western aspect. Total tree basal area varied from 4. 5 m 2 ha- 1 (hill base) to 11. 9 m 2 ha- 1 (hilltop) on the eastern aspect and from 9. 3 m 2 ha- 1 (hilltop) to 16. 8 m 2 ha- 1 (hill base) on the western aspect. The sap-ling and seedling density was lower on western aspect because higher anthropogenic distur-bances may lead the removal of seedlings {{of most of the}} tree species. The shrub and herb di-versity was higher on both the aspects as compared to tree diversity because opening of canopy provides greater opportunity for the recruitment of shrubs and herbs.

40|$|Erythrophleum fordii (Caesalpiniaceae; <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species)</b> is one of {{traditional}} rosewood species indigenous to Southeast Asia and southern China. Slow growth and {{symptoms such as}} leaf discoloration, curling and defoliation were usually observed in the nursery and its young plantations due perhaps to deficiencies of specific nutrients. Here sand culture experiment was conducted for its seedlings to assess their visual foliar symptoms, growth performance and nutrient interaction in response to six macronutrient deficiencies. Leaves of E. fordii seedlings discolored in all treatments of nutrient deficiency, and sizes of both old and young leaves became small under nitrogen (N) deficiency, while only young leaves grew small  under deficiencies of calcium (Ca) and sulphur (S). Seedling growth was inhibited significantly under deficiencies of N, potassium (K) and phosphorus (P)  except that P deficiency increased diameter at root collar. The difference of seedling N concentration between –N and control was normally much smaller than those for other nutrient elements because -N seedling could acquire N by nitrogen fixation of nodules under N deficiency. In spite of this, N was still major limiting factor for plant growth under N deficiency. Besides in P deficiency, P was also the major limiting factor under deficiencies of magnesium (Mg), Ca and S, which indicated that P {{play an important role}} in nutrient demand and balance for E. fordii. Antagonism or synergism occurred widely between six macronutrients, especially for P, K and Ca, their concentrations increased or decreased in all six deficiency treatments in comparison with the control.

Additionally, carbon and nitrogen contents of the bulk soil and plant material were measured. Plants were harvested from different sites, reflecting 2 (2 a) and 5 (5 a) yr of ecosystem development, of an opencast lignite mining area in the south of Cottbus, Lower Lusatia (Germany) where the artificial catchment "Chicken Creek" was constructed to study the development of terrestrial ecosystems.

40|$|Several strains {{belonging}} to the symbiotic, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> of Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Sinorhizobium {{have been shown to}} encode one or more terminal reductases required for denitrification. Some isolates {{belonging to}} Rhizobium sullae have been shown to express only a copper-containing nitrite reductase, encoded by nirK, which is closely related to nitrite reductases in true denitrifiers, generating the toxic end product nitric oxide. This enzyme cannot support bacterial growth under anoxic conditions and does not require the presence of a nitrogen oxide for its expression, which depends only upon a decrease in oxygen concentration. This behaviour was previously connected with the low oxygen concentration present within the root nodule, but investigations performed so far on its host legume Hedysarum coronarium have not revealed any significant differences between wild type and nitrite reductase-deficient strains for nodulation efficiency, plant growth and nitrogen fixation. The role of this Cu-containing nitrite reductase was also investigated as a detoxification strategy or as a means to reduce the energy content in the bacterial cell in order to induce the VBNC status, so prolonging cell viability under certain conditions. More recent results suggest that the nitrite reductase of R. sullae strains HCNT 1 and A 4 can reduce other physiologically important oxyanions, such as selenite, to elemental selenium, and that strains of the same species that lack Nir (e. g. strain CC 1335) do not show this property. Moreover, inactivation of nirK in strain HCNT 1 resulted in the loss of selenite reduction and the mobilization of nirK into CC 1335 produced a phenotype able to reduce selenite.

They have also been shown to be amongst the most prolific sources of bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs; pentacyclic triterpenoids produced by taxa within the bacterial domain and especially in the proteobacteria) and are considered to be the most environmentally significant source of C- 2 methylated hopanoids. The compounds therefore have the potential for wide application in studies of the contemporary marine carbon cycle as well as providing a means of tracking cyanobacteria back through geological history where organic matter is well preserved. Here, we have used liquid chromatography ion-trap mass spectrometry to investigate the intact BHP distributions in cultured cyanobacteria (pure cultures and enrichment cultures) and in a variety of environmental settings. We present data on the detection and characterisation of BHP structures in 26 cultured cyanobacteria (ranging from marine and freshwater species to isolates from hydrothermal systems), 10 of which have not been tested for hopanoid production. Of the 58 strains of cyanobacteria studied to date, 49 have been shown to produce BHPs and 21 of them produce C- 2 methylated BHPs.

Soil available P was measured as resin P, bicarbonate-extractable inorganic (Pi-HCO 3) and organic (Po-HCO 3). Soil resin-P values (15 ¿ 19 mg P kg? 1) in 100 E were 80 % higher relative to 100 A (8 ¿ 17 mg P kg? 1) at Y 2 R 2 against no difference for both 100 E and 100 A (8 ¿ 12 mg P kg? 1) at EndR 1.

Our data suggests that the risk of shifting from N-limitation to P-limitation system is minor. However, in the long term, P-limitation may eventually occur in pure acacia plantations, due to mining of soil available P by acacia's higher P uptake relative to eucalypt and additional requirement for symbiotic fixation of atmospheric N 2...|$|E

For example, as discussed earlier, V. americana has a higher water use, when compared to M. perforata. V. americana could be taking up most of the water and hindering M. perforata growth in the PMM. The strong competitive interaction between nitrogen-fixing V. americana and non-nitrogen-fixing M. perforata demonstrates that legumes are not always facilitative, and the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixed</b> by these <b>species</b> does not always become available in the short term (Kurdali et al. 1996).|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in mixed species plantation systems because of their potential to provide a range of socio-economic and bio-physical benefits which can be matched to the diverse needs of smallholders and communities. Potential benefits include {{the production of a}} range of forest products for home and commercial use; improved soil fertility especially when <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> are included; improved survival rates and greater productivity of species; a reduction in the amount of damage from pests or disease; and improved biodiversity and wildlife habitats. Despite these documented services and growing interest in mixed species plantation systems, the actual planting areas in the tropics are low, and monocultures are still preferred for industrial plantings and many reforestation programs because of perceived higher economic returns and readily available information about the species and their silviculture. In contrast, there are few guidelines for the design and management of mixed-species systems, including the social and ecological factors of successful mixed species plantings. Methods This protocol explains the methodology used to investigate the following question: What is the available evidence for the relative performance of different designs of mixed-species plantings for smallholder and community forestry in the tropics?This study will systematically search, identify and describe studies related to mixed species plantings across tropical and temperate zones to identify the social and ecological factors that affect polyculture systems. The objectives of this study are first to identify the evidence of biophysical or socio-economic factors that have been considered when designing mixed species systems for community and smallholder forestry in the tropics; and second, to identify gaps in research of mixed species plantations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain {{insights}} on the potential hydrological and biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the response of two nested Mediterranean catchments to long-term changes in atmospheric inorganic nitrogen and sulphate deposition. One catchment was steep and fully forested (TM 9, 5. 9 ha) and the other one had gentler slopes and heathlands in the upper part while side slopes were steep and forested (TM 0, 205 ha). Both catchments were highly responsive to the 45 % decline in sulphate concentration measured in atmospheric deposition during the 1980 s and 1990 s, with stream concentrations decreasing by 1. 4 to 3. 4 μeq L− 1 y− 1. Long-term changes in inorganic nitrogen in both, atmospheric deposition and stream water were small compared to sulphate. The quick response to changes in atmospheric inputs could be explained by the small residence time of water (4 – 5 months) in these catchments (inferred from chloride time series variance analysis), which was attributed to steep slopes and the role of macropore flow bypassing the soil matrix during wet periods. The estimated residence time for sulphate (1. 5 – 3 months) was substantially lower than for chloride suggesting unaccounted sources of sulphate (i. e., dry deposition, or depletion of soil adsorbed sulphate). In both catchments, inorganic nitrogen concentration in stream water was strongly damped compared to precipitation and its residence time was of the order of decades, indicating that this essential nutrient was strongly retained in these catchments. Inorganic nitrogen concentration tended to be higher at TM 0 than at TM 9 which was attributed to the presence of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> in the heathlands. Our results indicate that these Mediterranean catchments react rapidly to environmental changes, which make them especially vulnerable to changes in atmospheric deposition...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Research was {{conducted}} in a mixed-coniferous forest stand that was clearcut, burned, and seeded in order to study early plant succession, grazing influences on native and introduced species, big game use, and environmental relationships vegetation, animal, and environmental research was carried out from 1965 to 1967 in three, five-acre exclosures which had been constructed after treatment in 1963 and 1964. Radical treatments of clearcutting and burning were used to reduce infection of heart rot caused by Indian paint fungus (Echinodontium tinctorium) in grand fir (Abies grandis). Four major tree species [...] Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (pinus ponderosa), western white pine (pinus monticola) and western larch (Larix occidentalis) were planted {{at a rate of}} 880 trees per acre. Minor quantities of grand fir, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) were used to give a total population of 1000 trees per acre. Vegetation analyses showed bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare) to be the most abundant species in early stages of succession. Foliage cover of this species was significantly reduced when competing with introduced grass seedings which included a mixture of timothy (Phleum pralenle), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), tall oatgrass (Arrhenatherum elatius), smooth brome (Bromus inermis), white Dutch clover (Trifolium repens) and two pure stands of mountain brome (Bromus marginatus) and blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus). Most thistle and other weedy production were confined to unseeded plots, Redstem ceanothus (Ceanothus sanguineus), ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), and birchleaf spirea (Spiraea betulifolia) were the most abundant shrubs in the study area. Canada milkvetch (Astragalus canadensis) and redstem ceanothus [...] both <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> [...] were absent from the uncut stand, and burning enhanced their establishment. Crude protein analysis of the 15 major forage species showed the two <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> to be far superior to other forages from this standpoint. Introduced grass species were more sensitive to soil nitrogen levels than were native species. Yearling replacement heifers stocked at a rate approximating one animal unit per acre were grazed in both cattle exclosures and later combined for grazing the game excluded area. A 1. 5 and 2. 1 pound per day gain was achieved over 42 and 35 -day periods in 1966 and 1967, respectively. During these years, the heifers consumed 7. 1 and 7. 5 gallons of water per day which approximated one gallon per hundred pounds of body weight. Heifers preferred Ross' sedge (Carex rossii), orchardgrass, blue elderberry (Sambucus cerulea), and Canada milkvetch. Different preferences might be noted if an earlier grazing season had been used. Some tree seedling browsing occurred in 1967, but this was believed to result from too high an animal concentration within a small area. Game use in the cattle exclosures markedly reduced production of all browse and Canada milkvetch. Some woody species have been eliminated. Pellet count data supported the hypothesis that game, particularly mule deer, might be attracted to the area for feeding purposes. Digging and feeding activities of small mammals caused isolated effects on seral vegetation development. Environmental measurements showed soil temperatures at two inches below the surface to be generally higher in the clearcut than uncut stand. Air temperatures and solar radiation at three feet above the soil were also higher in the clearcut, Surface soil moisture levels in the clearcut and uncut forest stands indicated that depletion rates were similar in both areas. Due to the preliminary nature of these results, no management plans have been developed. It is believed that grazing and forest management are compatible and essential to maximize profits from the mixed-coniferous forest of northeast Oregon. When proper season of use and numbers of animals are determined, conflicts between range and forest interests should be minimized...|$|E
40|$|Mixed-species {{plantations}} of Eucalyptus with a <b>nitrogen</b> (N 2) <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> {{have the}} potential to increase productivity while maintaining soil fertility, compared to Eucalyptus monocultures. However, it is difficult to predict combinations of species and sites that will lead to these benefits. We review the processes and interactions occurring in mixed plantations, 5 and the influence of species or site attributes, to aid the selection of successful combinations of species and sites. Successful mixtures, where productivity is increased over that of monocultures, have often developed stratified canopies, such that the less shade-tolerant species overtops the more shadetolerant species. Successful mixtures also have significantly higher rates of N and P cycling than 10 Eucalyptus monocultures. It is therefore important to select N 2 -fixing species with readily decomposable litter and high rates of nutrient cycling, as well as high rates of N 2 -fixation. While the dynamics of N 2 -fixation in tree stands are not well understood, it appears as though eucalypts can benefit from fixed N as early as the first or second year following plantation establishment. A meta-analysis of 18 published studies revealed several trials in which mixtures were significantly 15 (...|$|R
40|$|The {{compatibility}} {{and effectiveness}} of potentially <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> associations between two Rhizobium strains and thirteen collections of Leucaena leucocephala, five other species of Leucaena, and Albizia occidentalis were determined.

40|$|Planting forests is an {{important}} practice for climate change mitigation, especially in the tropics where the carbon (C) sequestration potential is high. Successful implementation of this mitigation practice requires knowledge {{of the role of}} species identity and diversity on carbon accrual of plantations. Despite this need, solid data on the long-term development of forest plantations are still very scarce. Monospecific and two species mixture plots of a 77 -year-old tree diversity experiment in Yangambi in the Congo basin were fully inventoried. We calculated above-ground C stocks using allometric equations, and soil C stocks by analyzing soil samples at multiple depths. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of taxonomic and functional identity and diversity on the aboveground and soil carbon stocks. A high variability in aboveground C stocks across tree species combinations was observed. Apart from a species identity effect, the proportion of planted species in the total stand basal area (BA(pl)) and effective species richness were identified as compositional parameters with a significant effect on the aboveground carbon (AGC), with BApl being more important. Both AGC and BA(pl) were coupled to the functional identity of the planted species; the planting of short-lived pioneers led to low AGC. We found no clear benefits, but also no drawbacks, for AGC of two species mixture plots over monospecific plots or including <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> in the plantation scheme. However, the latter was the only compositional parameter with a significant positive effect on the soil carbon stock up to 1 m depth. We conclude that the different plantation configurations gave rise to a wide range in carbon stocks. This was predominantly caused by large differences in AGC sequestration over the past 77 years. Altogether, short-lived pioneer species had a low BApl resulting in low carbon sequestration, while partial shade tolerant species achieved the highest AGC stocks. Tolerating spontaneous ingrowth during the plantation development can further increase the AGC stock, given that the appropriate functional type is planted...|$|E
40|$|Many nitrogen-fixing {{tree species}} are {{tolerant}} of acid soils. Planted in agroforestry systems, {{they provide a}} low-input technology that help farmers overcome limitations to plant growth caused by lack of nitrogen. Only recently have researchers begun to evaluate different <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> for agroforestry systems on acid soils. Nitrogen fixing trees for acid soils is a manual produced by the participants who amended a conference of the same title and whose objective it was to produce a practical field guide for selecting, evaluating and growing nitrogen fixing trees on acid soils. Nitrogen fixing trees for acid soils edited by Mark Powells 1996 110 pp Nitrogen Fixing Tree Association, Winrock International 38 Winrock Drive, Morrilton, Arkansas 72110 9537, USA Researchers and farmers have different perspectives when choosing tree species that will give the greatest benefit. These perspectives have to be merged when setting priorities for deciding on which species are to be researched for genetic improvement. The poor knowledge base on multipurpose trees makes estimation of the possible effects on research efforts more difficult to assess than for agricultural commodities. The large number of possible species, and the paucity of information on these species, necessitated {{the design of a}} priority-setting process radically different from traditional scoring or economic surplus approaches. Choosing the right trees setting priorities for multipurpose tree improvement is a research report in which the procedures for setting these innovative priorities for research are documented: they are structured, objective and involve both researchers and farmers.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> <b>species</b> (NFS) in fast-growing tree plantations {{is an alternative}} option to reduce fertilizer inputs. However, the success of mixed-species plantations depends on the balance between positive interactions among species (resulting from facilitation and/or complementarity) and {{the negative effects of}} interspecific competition. Using a carbon budget approach and coupling measurements of standing biomass, aboveground litterfall and soil CO 2 efflux, we assessed the influence of replacing half of eucalypt trees by Acacia mangium on total belowground carbon flux (TBCF), net primary production (NPP) and its partitioning between above- and belowground growth at two tropical sites in Brazil (Itatinga) and in Congo (Kissoko) exhibiting contrasting climates, edaphic conditions and wood productions. Annual soil CO 2 efflux (F-S) was significantly lower in the acacia monocultures than in eucalypt monocultures and mixed-species stands at both sites. Annual F-S was significantly lower at Itatinga compared to Kissoko for all stands while TBCF was significantly lower in the eucalypt stands only. In the eucalypt monocultures we found a significantly lower aboveground NPP (ANPP) and wood production (wood NPP) at Kissoko compared to Itatinga that was almost fully balanced by a significantly higher belowground NPP (BNPP), leading to similar NPP. Similarly, acacia monocultures exhibited significantly higher ANPP and wood NPP at Itatinga than at Kissoko. The mixed-species stands exhibited a significantly lower wood NPP and ANPP than the eucalypt monocultures at the Brazilian site while NPP of the mixture was not significantly different than the average NPP of the two monocultures. At the Congolese site, NPP of the mixture was significantly higher than the average NPP of the two monocultures. NPP was similar in the mixed-species stand and the eucalypt monoculture with a significantly lower partitioning of NPP to belowground production, leading to a one third higher wood biomass at harvest in the mixed-species stand. A positive effect of growing eucalypts with the nitrogen fixing acacia trees on stand wood production occurred at Kissoko but not at Itatinga. Mixed-species plantations with NFS can be advocated at sites where the productive gains resulting from nitrogen fixation are not compromised by other resource limitations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|As {{complementary}} {{resource use}} {{is the main}} cause of additional production, the most promising approach for enhancing volume (biomass) production is the mixing of light-demanding with shade-tolerant species, shallow-rooting with deep-rooting species, fast-growing with slow-growin or deciduous with evergreen species. The benefit of mixing may change with site conditions, however, as it likely depends on the potential of the species assemblage to compensate for the respective growth limiting factor of a given site. Thus, on moist and fertile sites, where light is the limiting factor, combinations of light-demanding and shade-tolerant species may be most beneficial. On dry and nutrient poor sites, in contrast, combinations of deep- and shallow-rooting species may remedy the soil-based resource limitations. Although reported overyielding in volume growth of about 10 – 30 % for commercial tree species in temperate and boreal zones appear moderate in comparison to overyielding of up to 50 % found in the subtropics and tropics and for atmospheric <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> tree <b>species</b> (Forrester et al. 2006, 2007, Kelty 1992), they are nevertheless highly relevant because they can be obtained simply by a smart mixing design. In contrast, the benefits derived from thinning are often lower and require repeated silvicultural entries (Assmann 1970). Overyielding represents a higher efficiency of space use in that a given area of mixed stands yields more stem wood volume and fixes and stores more carbon than equivalent areas of monospecific stands. Of special interest for forest practitioners are mixed-species stands achieving transgressive overyielding, which could result in gains of up to 30 % if the tree species mixture is complementary (Pretzsch and Forrester 2017). As a consequence, annual allowable cuts, and the volumes removed and remaining standing, may change compared with monocultures.|$|R

Among 32 isolated strains, six best isolates (three strains of Azomonas agilis, two strains of Azotobacter chroococcum, and one strain of Alcaligenes sp.) were selected. Best strains were selected by their <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> activities. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> bacteria cannot excrete {{significant amount of}} ammonia into their environment. To improve cellulolytic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> activities, Alcaligenes sp. among six isolates was muatgenized with chemical mutagen, MNNG. From treatment of Alcaligenes sp. with three concentrations of MNNG (7. 5 ppm, 10 ppm and 12. 5 ppm), six potential mutant colonies were obtained. After screening of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> activities of wild type and mutagenized strains, four out of six mutant strains excreted higher amount of ammonium concentration than wild type strain. Although wild type strain of Alcaligenes sp. excreted 46. 64 ppm of ammonium concentration, 101. 35 ppm of ammonium concentration was excreted by mutant strain (M 2 -F) of Alcaligenes sp. According to results obtained, 10 ppm of MNNG was more effective for obtaining better mutant strain for <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixing</b> activity.

40|$|Highly {{productive}} marine upwelling {{regions that}} are located along continental boundaries {{play a critical}} role in the global ocean nitrogen budget. The high organic matter input in combination with the poor regional ventilation result in extremely low water column oxygen concentrations, or so-called oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). OMZs harbor a diverse community of anaerobic microorganisms including an enhanced nitrogen cycle. For instance, the microbial processes anammox and denitrification thrive in these waters, catalyzing the reduction of <b>fixed</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>species</b> (NO 3 -, NO 2 - and NH 4) to the more inert form, N 2 gas, thereby contributing to the loss of <b>fixed</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> Together the five major OMZs (which represent a small 1 % of the global ocean volume) contribute to 30 - 50 % of oceanic nitrogen loss. However, the biological and physical forces that regulate anammox and denitrification activity in OMZs remain poorly constrained. This thesis work aims to elucidate the dynamics that govern the activity and distribution of anammox and denitrifying (e. g. SUP 05 and Arcobacter) bacteria in OMZs. In this work we employed a comprehensive range of techniques including cultivation, metagenomics, 15 N-labeled stable isotope incubation experiments, and single-cell techniques in combination with oceanographic tools...|$|R
