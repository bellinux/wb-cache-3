25|$|Double {{ionization}} is {{a process}} of formation of doubly charged ions when laser radiation is exerted on neutral atoms or molecules. Double ionization is usually less probable than single-electron ionization. Two types of double ionization are distinguished: sequential and <b>non-sequential.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-sequential</b> double {{ionization}} is {{a process}} whose mechanism differs (in any detail) from the sequential one. For example, both the electrons leave the system simultaneously (as in alkaline earth atoms, see below), the second electron's liberation is assisted by the first electron (as in noble gas atoms, see below), etc.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{follows a}} <b>non-sequential</b> structure; it {{switches}} from past memories to present experiences, and often entangles the two. This meshing of memory with sensation creates confusion {{between past and}} present, in which no details are concrete. Words and phrases are repeated throughout the book, highlighting themes and recurring ideas. This redundancy generates a sense of obsession throughout the narrative, Erika's obsession to learn the truth, and Hilde's obsession to forget it. Coupled with repetition, Reichart's use of recurring words—such as alone, exclusion, and guilt—emphasize their importance to the main points and the extreme feelings Hilde feels about them.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to planning his escape, retrieval of the note and wearing of dark glasses indicated Cooper {{had a certain}} level of sophistication in avoiding the things which had aided identifying the perpetrator of the best [...] known case of a ransom: the Lindbergh kidnapping. It is not clear how he could have reasonably expected to ever spend the money, fence it at a discount or otherwise profit. While Cooper made the familiar-from-fiction demand of [...] non-sequentially numbered small bills, [...] mass publicity over the Lindbergh kidnapping had long made it public knowledge that even with thirties technology, getting <b>non-sequential</b> bills in a ransom was no defense against the numbers being logged and used to track down a perpetrator. In the Lindbergh case, fencing what he could as hot money and being very careful with what he did personally pass, the perpetrator had been caught through the [...] ransom money nonetheless, with identification and handwriting evidence only brought in at the trial.|$|E

2500|$|Such as SmartLoader, SpeciMinder, ADAM, Tug Eskorta, and MT 400 with Motivity are {{designed}} for people-friendly workspaces. They navigate by recognizing natural features. 3D scanners or other means of sensing the environment {{in two or three}} dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead-reckoning calculations of the AGV's current position. [...] Some AGVs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms. They are able to operate in complex environments and perform non-repetitive and <b>non-sequential</b> tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab, specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses. For dynamic areas, such as warehouses full of pallets, AGVs require additional strategies using three-dimensional sensors such as time-of-flight or stereovision cameras.|$|E

5000|$|For {{noble gas}} atoms, <b>non-sequential</b> double {{ionization}} was first observed by L'Huillier. The interest to this phenomenon grew rapidly {{after it was}} rediscoveredin infrared fields and for higher intensities. Multiple ionization has also been observed. The mechanism of <b>non-sequential</b> double ionization in noble gas atoms differs from the one in alkaline earth atoms. For noble gas atoms in infrared laser fields, following one-electron ionization, the liberated electron can recollidewith the parent ion.This electron acts as an [...] "atomic antenna", absorbing theenergy from the laser field between ionization and recollision anddepositing it into the parent ion. Inelastic scattering on theparent ion results in further collisional excitation and/orionization. This mechanism {{is known as the}} three-step model of <b>non-sequential</b> double ionization, which is also closely related to the three step model of high harmonic generation.|$|E
