25|$|The Battle of Smolensk {{was another}} severe defeat for the Red Army {{in the opening}} phase of Operation Barbarossa. For the first time, the Soviets tried to {{implement}} a coordinated counter-attack against {{a large part of}} the front; although the counter-attack was almost entirely a failure, the increasing resistance showed that the Soviets were not yet defeated and that the Blitzkrieg towards Moscow was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> easy undertaking. Dissent within the German high command and political leadership was exacerbated. The leaders of the General Staff, Franz Halder and Brauchitsch and commanders like Bock, Hoth and Guderian counselled against dispersing the German armoured units and to concentrate on Moscow. Hitler reiterated the lack of importance of Moscow and of strategic encirclements and ordered a concentration on economic targets such as Ukraine, the Donets Basin and the Caucasus, with more tactical encirclements to weaken the Soviets further. The German offensive effort became more fragmented, leading to the Battle of Kiev and the Battle of Uman. The battles were German victories but costly in time, men and equipment on their approach towards Moscow, allowing the Soviets time to prepare the defenses of the city.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{found himself}} in the Judan once more, this time 14 years after his last bid as {{challenger}} in 1991 against Masaki Takemiya (Cho lost 3–2). Cho {{found himself in}} a league with old friends and rivals, including Masao Kato, Rin Kaiho, and Yoda Norimoto. The league also included young guns Cho U, Shinji Takao, and Keigo Yamashita. Keeping this in mind, it was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> easy campaign for Cho. His first match was against Yujiro Hashimoto. Cho, holding black, won the match by resignation. In his next match, he found himself against another young powerhouse, Kimio Yamada. This time, holding white, Cho squeezed by with a win of just half a point. Cho continued his run, his next opponent being Naoto Hikosaka. Again holding white, Cho went on to win by 2 and a half points. His last match of the main tournament was against Tomoyasu Mimura, of which he held white once more, and cruised past by resignation. His opponent for the challenger final was Shinji Takao, who had beaten at then some of the top players in Japan, Masao Kato and Norimoto Yoda, on his way into the loser's section of the tournament. Cho took white in the game, and won by 1 and a half points. This made Cho the challenger for the 43rd Judan against title holder O Rissei. O had held the title for 4 straight years before being challenged by Cho. The final would prove to be an exciting one, as the first match ended with a half point win for Cho. The next match was a win for O, by 5 and a half points. The third match was a very large win for O, winning by 19 and a half points, which is unusual to see in pro games. This didn't stop Cho, as he would get revenge by forcing O into resignation in the fourth game. The fifth and last game would go Cho's way, with a 5 and a half point win over O. This was Cho's 68th title, and fourth time winning the Judan.|$|E
500|$|The {{station was}} not {{intended}} to be the Flushing Line's terminus. While the controversy over an elevated line in Flushing was ongoing in January 1913, the Whitestone Improvement Association pushed for an elevated to Whitestone, College Point, and Bayside. However, some members of that group wanted to oppose the Flushing line's construction if there was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> extension to Whitestone. After the January 20 vote to demand that the subway line through Flushing be built underground, groups representing communities in south Flushing collaborated to push for an elevated along what was then the LIRR's Central Branch, in the current right-of-way of Kissena Corridor Park. Eleven days later, the PSC announced its intent to extend the line as an el from Corona to Flushing, with a possible further extension to Little Neck Bay in Bayside. There was consensus that the line should not abruptly end in Corona, but even with the [...] extension to Bayside, the borough would still have fewer Dual Contracts route mileage than either Brooklyn or the Bronx. The New York Times wrote that compared to the Bronx, Queens would have far less subway mileage per capita even with the Flushing extension.|$|E

2500|$|When {{war broke}} out, Manning was keen to enlist, {{possibly}} {{to escape from}} a stifling environment and to widen his horizons. [...] A man with his fragile constitution and unhealthy lifestyle was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> attractive proposition for the military authorities, but in October 1915 after several attempts, his persistence paid off and he enrolled in the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. [...] He was a private with the service number 19022. [...] He was selected for officer training, but failed the course. [...] Sent to France in 1916, Manning experienced action with the 7th Battalion at the Battle of the Somme, was promoted to lance-corporal and experienced life in the trenches. [...] He was recalled for further training and posted to Ireland in May 1917 with a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Irish Regiment. The life of an officer {{did not agree with}} him; he seems not to have integrated particularly well and he drank excessively, getting into trouble with his superiors. [...] His inebriation was put down to neurasthenia, but Manning resigned his commission on 28 February 1918.|$|E

Necessity--the mother of invention--being even unthinkable in this case, I {{do not know what}} to invent in the way of discourse; and necessity being also the greatest possible incentive to exertion I don't even know how to begin to exert myself.

And this new cousin, Louise Merrick, why was she coming to Elmhurst? To compete for the prize Beth had already determined to win? In that case she must consider carefully her line of action, that no rival might deprive her of this great estate. Beth felt that she could fight savagely for an object she so much desired. Her very muscles hardened and grew tense at the thought of conflict as she walked down the corridor in the wake of old Misery the housekeeper. She had always resented the sordid life at Cloverton. She had been discontented with her lot since her earliest girlhood, and longed to escape the constant bickerings of her parents and their vain struggles to obtain enough money to [...] "keep up appearances" [...] and drive the wolf from the door. And here was an opportunity to win a fortune and a home beautiful enough for a royal princess. All that was necessary was to gain the esteem of a crabbed, garrulous old woman, who had doubtless but a few more weeks to live. It must be done, in one way or another; but how? How could she out-wit this unknown cousin, and inspire the love of Aunt Jane? ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} days of modern rock music, Elvis Presley never played encores, a {{practice}} his manager Col. Tom Parker intended to leave audiences wanting more.
