In resource-constrained projects, schedule multiplicity {{makes it difficult to}} calculate float and identify critical activities accurately. In this work, new {{concepts of}} float and critical activity are developed to ascertain critical activities more precisely without reference to activity start and end times in specific schedules. The notions of float, group float, float set, <b>negative</b> <b>float</b> and zero critical activity are introduced, which the project manager can use to deal more effectively with critical activities, duration uncertainty, activity buffering, and resource allocation than the currently available tools in literature. For practical implementation, algorithms are provided and tested to calculate the new measures on the PSPLIB benchmark instances, specifically the J 30, J 60 and J 120 test sets, for the resource constrained project management, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed concepts in helping to identify flexibility in scheduling activities...|$|E

40|$|A {{spacecraft}} in a high-density equatorial LEO plasma will <b>float</b> <b>negative</b> {{relative to}} the ambient plasma. Because of the electron collection of exposed conductors on its solar arrays, it may <b>float</b> <b>negative</b> by up to its array voltage. The floating potential depends on the relative areas of electron and ion collection of the spacecraft. Early estimates of the International Space Station (ISS) potential were about - 140 V {{relative to the}} surrounding plasma, because of its 160 V solar array string voltage. Because {{of the possibility of}} arcing of ISS structures and astronaut EMUs (spacesuits) into the space plasma, Plasma Contacting Units (PCUs) were added to the ISS design, to reduce the highly <b>negative</b> <b>floating</b> potentials by emitting electrons (effectively increasing the ion collecting area).

Such drifts may cause an electrically isolated spacecraft surface to float at a substantially increased negative potential {{if it is}} simultaneously shaded and downstream relative to the drift direction. The results showed that: (1) the ion speed ratio at which drift effects become important (i. e. change the floating potential by at least 10 percent) can be as low as 0. 1, and may be decreased if the ambient electrons are non-Maxwellian; (2) the effects of ion speed ratio increase with increasing ion-to-electron temperature ratio; and (3) <b>negative</b> <b>floating</b> potentials for drifting Maxwellian ion velocity distributions with speed ratio unity are typically about {{twice as large as}} the corresponding potentials for nondrifting conditions...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley free-flight tunnel to obtain an experimental verification of the theoretical rudder-free stability characteristics of an airplane model equipped with conventional rudders having <b>negative</b> <b>floating</b> tendencies and negligible friction. The model used in the tests was equipped with a conventional single vertical tail having rudder area 40 percent of the vertical tail area. The model was tested both in free flight and mounted on a strut that allowed freedom only in yaw. Tests were made with three different amounts of rudder aerodynamic balance and with various values of mass, moment of inertia, and center-of-gravity location of the rudder. Most of the stability derivatives required for the theoretical calculations were determined from forced and free-oscillation tests of the particular model tested. The theoretical analysis showed that the rudder-free motions of an airplane consist largely of two oscillatory modes - a long-period oscillation somewhat similar to the normal rudder-fixed oscillation and a short-period oscillation introduced only when the rudder is set free. It was found possible in the tests to create lateral instability of the rudder-free short-period mode by large values of rudder mass parameters even though the rudder-fixed condition was highly stable. The results of the tests and calculation indicated that for most present-day airplanes having rudders of <b>negative</b> <b>floating</b> tendency, the rudder-free stability characteristics may be examined by simply considering the dynamic lateral stability using the value of the directional-stability parameter Cn(sub p) for the rudder-free condition in the conventional controls-fixed lateral-stability equations. For very large airplanes having relatively high values of the rudder mass parameters with respect to the rudder aerodynamic parameters, however, analysis of the rudder-free stability should be made with the complete equations of motion. Good agreement between calculated and measured rudder-free stability characteristics was obtained by use of the general rudder-free stability theory, in which four degrees of lateral freedom are considered. When this assumption is made that the rolling motions alone or the lateral and rolling motions may be neglected in the calculations of rudder-free stability, it is possible to predict satisfactorily the characteristics of the long-period (Dutch roll type) rudder-free oscillation for airplanes only when the effective-dihedral angle is small. With these simplifying assumptions, however, satisfactory prediction of the short-period oscillation may be obtained for any dihedral. Further simplification of the theory {{based on the assumption that}} the rudder moment of inertia might be disregarded was found to be invalid because this assumption made it impossible to calculate the characteristics of the short-period oscillations...|$|R
40|$|Flight 4 A was an {{especially}} critical mission for the International Space Station (ISS). For the first time, the high voltage solar arrays generated {{significant amounts of}} power and long predicted environmental interactions (high <b>negative</b> <b>floating</b> potential and concomitant dielectric charging) became serious concerns. Furthermore, the same flight saw the Plasma Contacting Unit (PCU) deployed and put into operation to mitigate and control these effects. The ISS program office has recognized the critical need to verify, by direct measurement, that ISS does not charge to unacceptable levels. A Floating Potential Probe (FPP) was therefore deployed on ISS to measure ISS floating potential relative to the surrounding plasma and to measure relevant plasma parameters. The primary objective of FPP is to verify that ISS floating potential does not exceed the specified level of 40 volts {{with respect to the}} ambient. Since it is expected that in normal operations the PCU will maintain ISS within this specification, it is equivalent to say that the objective of FPP is to monitor the functionality of the PCU.

By considering {{similarities and differences between}} results obtained with different numerical approaches under well defined conditions, the consistency and validity of our models can be assessed. The impact on model predictions of physical effects of importance in the SPP mission is also considered by comparing results obtained with and without these effects. Simulation results are presented and compared with increasing levels of complexity in the physics of interaction between solar environment and the SPP spacecraft. The comparisons focus particularly on spacecraft floating potentials, contributions to the currents collected and emitted by the spacecraft, and on the potential and density spatial profiles near the satellite. The physical effects considered include spacecraft charging, photoelectron and secondary electron emission, and the presence of a background magnetic field. Model predictions obtained with our different computational approaches are found to be in agreement within 2 % when the same physical processes are taken into account and treated similarly. The comparisons thus indicate that, with the correct description of important physical effects, our simulation models should have the required skill to predict details of satellite-plasma interaction physics under relevant conditions, with a good level of confidence. Our models concur in predicting a <b>negative</b> <b>floating</b> potential Vfl∼− 10 V for SPP at perihelion.

40|$|Current {{collection}} by {{high voltage}} solar arrays on the International Space Station (ISS) drives {{the vehicle to}} <b>negative</b> <b>floating</b> potentials in the low Earth orbit daytime plasma environment. Pre-flight predictions of ISS floating potentials Phi greater than |- 100 V| suggested a risk for degradation of dielectric thermal control coatings on surfaces in the U. S. sector due to arcing and an electrical shock hazard to astronauts during extravehicular activity (EVA). However, hazard studies conducted by the ISS program have demonstrated that the thermal control material degradation risk is effectively mitigated during the lifetime of the ISS vehicle by a sufficiently large ion collection area present on the vehicle to balance current collection by the solar arrays. To date, crew risk during EVA has been mitigated by operating one of two plasma contactors during EVA to control the vehicle potential within Phi {{less than or equal}} to |- 40 V| with a backup process requiring reorientation of the solar arrays into a configuration which places the current collection surfaces into wake. This operation minimizes current collection by the solar arrays should the plasma contactors fail. This paper presents an analysis of F-region electron density and temperature variations at low and midlatitudes generated by space weather events to determine what range of conditions represent charging threats to ISS. We first use historical ionospheric plasma measurements from spacecraft operating at altitudes relevant to the 51. 6 degree inclination ISS orbit to provide an extensive database of F-region plasma conditions over a variety of solar cycle conditions.

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{undergoes}} {{electrical charging}} in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to positively biased, exposed conductors on solar arrays that collect electrical charges {{from the space}} plasma. Exposed solar array conductors predominately collect negatively charged electrons and thus drive the metal ISS structure electrical ground to a <b>negative</b> <b>floating</b> potential (FP) relative to plasma. This FP is variable in location and time {{as a result of}} local ionospheric conditions. ISS motion through Earth s magnetic field creates an addition inductive voltage up to 20 positive and negative volts across ISS structure depending on its attitude and location in orbit. ISS Visiting Vehicles (VVs), such as the planned Orion crew exploration vehicle, contribute to the ISS plasma charging processes. Upon physical contact with ISS, the current collection properties of VVs combine with ISS. This is an ISS integration concern as FP must be controlled to minimize arcing of ISS surfaces and ensure proper management of extra vehicular activity crewman shock hazards. This report is an assessment of ISS induced charging from docked Orion vehicles employing negatively grounded, 130 volt class, UltraFlex (ATK Space Systems) solar arrays. To assess plasma electron current collection characteristics, Orion solar cell test coupons were constructed and subjected to plasma chamber current collection measurements. During these tests, coupon solar cells were biased between 0 and 120 V while immersed in a simulated LEO plasma. Tests were performed using several different simulated LEO plasma densities and temperatures. These data and associated theoretical scaling of plasma properties, were combined in a numerical model which was integrated into the Boeing Plasma Interaction Model. It was found that the solar array design for Orion will not affect the ISS FP by more than about 2 V during worst case charging conditions. This assessment also motivated a trade study to determine acceptable plasma electron current levels that can be collected by a single or combined fleet of ISS-docked VVs...|$|R

40|$|The International Space Station's (ISS) {{power system}} is {{designed}} with high-voltage solar arrays that typically operate at output voltages of 140 to 160 volts (V). The ISS grounding scheme electrically ties the habitat modules, structure, and radiators to the negative tap of the solar arrays. Without some active charge control method, this electrical configuration and the plasma current balance would cause the habitat modules, structure, and radiators to float to voltages as large as - 120 V {{with respect to the}} ambient space plasma. With such large <b>negative</b> <b>floating</b> potentials, the ISS could have deleterious interactions with the space plasma. These interactions could include arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath. A plasma contactor system was baselined on the ISS to prevent arcing and sputtering. The sole requirement for the system is contained within a single directive (SSP 30000, paragraph 3. 1. 3. 2. 1. 8) : "The Space Station structure floating potential at all points on the Space Station shall be controlled to within 40 V of the ionospheric plasma potential using a plasma contactor. " NASA is developing this plasma contactor as part of the ISS electrical power system. For ISS, efficient and rapid emission of high electron currents is required from the plasma contactor system under conditions of variable and uncertain current demand. A hollow cathode plasma source is well suited for this application and was, therefore, selected as the design approach for the station plasma contactor system. In addition to the plasma source, which is referred to as a hollow cathode assembly, or HCA, the plasma contactor system includes two other subsystems. These are the power electronics unit and the xenon gas feed system. The Rocketdyne Division of Boeing North American is responsible for the design, fabrication, assembly, test, and integration of the plasma contactor system.

The Universe hosts a harsh plasma environment and understandingthe complex interactions of bodies immersed in it is therefore indispensable to make progress in space science, especially with the eye of society looking ever further into and beyond our Solar system. In this thesis, we focus on three important topics in the field of space plasma physics connected through their need for detailed simulation studies. First, we present the initial results of a comparative performance studybetween the new Intel Xeon-Phi (MIC) architecture, the Intel Xeon (Sandy Bridge, SB) and a Nvidia graphical processing unit (GPU) running CUDA,for which we use a 1 -D explicit electrostatic Vlasov-Ampère particle-in-cell code. Computing times and speedup of the code for the three different architectures are compared for various number of cores/threadsand compiler options. We find that the GPU consistently obtains shortercomputing times than both the MIC and SB architectures for an increasing numbers of threads as well as better scaling. At this stage, then, we have to conclude that the GPU out-performs the MIC in terms of speed. Secondly, the full-kinetic implicit multi-scale plasma simulation code iPic 3 D is adapted for the analysis of solar wind-spacecraft interactions. We successfully implement a suitable electrostatic solver to enclose the immersed boundary algorithm and create the possibility to handle complex spacecraft geometries. Additionally we discuss a cross-comparison of spacecraft-environment interaction model predictions from five different spacecraft-plasma codes applied to a simplified geometry of the Solar Probe Plus (SPP) spacecraft near perihelion, predicting that SPP will operate in a saturated emission regime with a <b>negative</b> <b>floating</b> potential Φ ≈ − 10 V. Last but not least, we present the first three-dimensional full-kinetic and electromagnetic simulations of the solar wind interaction with Lunar crustal magnetic anomalies (LMAs). We confirm that LMAs may indeed be strong enough to stand off the solar wind from directly impacting the Lunar surface forming a so-called ‘mini-magnetosphere’, as suggested by spacecraft observations and theory. We develop electromagnetic open boundary conditions and, studying in detail the field structure and particle dynamics, we show that the LMA configuration is driven by electron motion because its scale size is small with respect to the gyroradius of the solar wind ions. We identify a population of backstreaming ions, the deflection of magnetized electrons viathe E × B drift motion and the subsequent formation of a halo region ofelevated density around the dipole source. Finally, it is shown that the presence and efficiency of the latter mechanisms are heavily impacted by the upstream plasma conditions and, on their turn, influence the overall structure and evolution of the LMA system. Each of the subjects discussed in this work extends our current scientific knowledge and helps pave the way to new and exciting research and to future human exploration on and beyond our precious planet. nrpages: 216 status: publishe...|$|R

A typical interface circuit response was analyzed {{to show that the}} transients would couple into the Spacecraft System through ground points, which are most vulnerable. A compilation and review was performed on 15 years of available data from electron and ion current collection phenomena. Empirical models were developed to match data and compared with flight data of Pix- 1 and Pix- 2 mission. It was found that large space power systems would <b>float</b> <b>negative</b> and discharge if operated at or above 300 V. Several recommendations are given to improve the models and to apply them to large space systems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{proposal}} of versatile autonomous circuit equivalents of floating and grounded passive elements by means of modern active tectonic blocks, such as current and voltage conveyors of all three generations. Current conveyors range as essential tectonic blocks in a current mode. Concerning signal processing, it encompasses a mixed tectonic block. In most cases, these elements may be substituted for presently insufficient operating amplifiers. The voltage conveyor was defined {{on the basis of}} duality of current and voltage modes. This element could be selected as a suitable active component for circuits operating in a voltage mode. Implementing the connection, a general autonomous circuit is taken into account. By selecting given admittances, a FDNR (<b>floating</b> frequency dependent <b>negative</b> resistance) element, <b>floating</b> capacitance, floating inductance and ground to floating admittance converter may be implemented. The practical part describes connections which fulfill given requirements. The suggested elements are simulated in comparison with ideal elements and subsequently, they are applied to a frequency filter. The second order filter with a proposed induction coil was practically assembled and experimentally measured in a laboratory. The measured results were compared to simulations received by the use of ideal and real models of current and voltage conveyors...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of membrane permeabilization by dermcidin (DCD- 1 L), an antimicrobial peptide present in human sweat, was investigated at a mercury-supported monolayer of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) or dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) {{and at a}} mercury-supported tethered bilayer lipid membrane (tBLM) consisting of a thiolipid (DPTL) with a DOPC or DOPS monolayer self-assembled on top of it. In an unbuffered solution of pH 5. 4, DCD- 1 L is almost neutral and permeabilizes a DPTL/DOPS tBLM at transmembrane potentials, ϕtrans, which are physiological. In a pH 7 buffer solution DCD- 1 L bears two negative charges and {{has no effect on}} a DPTL/DOPC tBLM, whereas it permeabilizes a DPTL/DOPS tBLM only outside the physiological ϕtrans range; however, the presence of zinc ion induces DCD- 1 L to permeabilize the DPTL/DOPS tBLM at physiological ϕtrans values. The effect of zinc ions suggests a DCD- 1 L conformation with its positive N-terminus embedded in the lipid bilayer and the <b>negative</b> C terminus <b>floating</b> on the membrane surface. This conformation can be stabilized by a zinc ion bridge between the His(38) residue of the C terminus and the carboxyl group of DOPS. Chronocoulometric potential jumps from ϕtrans ≅ + 160 mV to sufficiently negative values yield charge transients exhibiting a sigmoidal shape preceded by a relatively long "foot". This behavior is indicative of ion-channel formation characterized by disruption of DCD- 1 L clusters adsorbed on top of the lipid bilayer, incorporation of the resulting monomers and their aggregation into hydrophilic pores by a {{mechanism of}} nucleation and growth...|$|R
40|$|Metamaterials are artificially {{designed}} {{composite materials}} which can exhibit unique and unusual properties {{such as the}} negative refractive index, negative phase velocity, etc. The concept of metamaterials becomes prevalent in the electromagnetic society since the first experimental implementation in the early 2000 s. Many fascinated potential applications, e. g. super lens, invisibility cloaking, and novel antennas that are electrically small, have been proposed based on metamaterials. However, most of the applications still remain in theory and are not suitable for practical applications mainly due to the intrinsic loss and narrow bandwidth (large dispersion) determined by the fundamental physics of metamaterials. In this dissertation, we incorporate active gain devices into conventional passive metamaterials to overcome loss and even provide gain. Two types of active gain negative refractive index metamaterials are proposed, designed and experimentally demonstrated, including an active composite left-/right-handed transmission line and an active volumetric metamaterial. In addition, we investigate the non-Foster circuits for broadband matching of electrically small antennas. A rigorous way of analyzing the stability of non-Foster circuits by normalized determinant function is proposed. We study the practical factors that may affect the stability of non-Foster circuits, including the device parasitics, DC biasing, layouts and load impedance. A stable <b>floating</b> <b>negative</b> capacitor is designed, fabricated and tested. Moreover, {{it is important to}} resolve the sign of refractive index for active gain media which can be quite challenging. We investigate the analytical solution of a gain slab system, and apply the Nyquist criterion to analyze the stability of a causal gain medium. We then emphasize that the result of frequency domain simulation has to be treated with care. Lastly, this dissertation discusses another interesting topic about THz spectroscopy of live cells. THz spectroscopy becomes an emerging technique for studying the dynamics and interactions of cells and biomolecules, but many practical challenges still remain in experimental studies. We present a prototype of simple and inexpensive cell-trapping microfluidic chip for THz spectroscopic study of live cells. Cells are transported, trapped and concentrated into the THz exposure region by applying an AC bias signal while the chip maintains a steady temperature at 37 °C by resistive heating. We conduct some preliminary experiments on E. coli and T cell solution and compare the transmission spectra of empty channels, channels filled with aqueous media only, and channels filled with aqueous medium with un-concentrated and concentrated cells...|$|R
