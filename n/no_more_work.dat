500|$|In November Boito {{took the}} {{completed}} first act to Verdi at Sant'Agata, {{along with the}} second act, which was still under construction: [...] "That act has the devil on its back; and when you touch it, it burns", Boito complained. They worked on the opera for a week, then Verdi and his wife Giuseppina Strepponi went to Genoa. <b>No</b> <b>more</b> <b>work</b> was done for some time.|$|E
500|$|Waugh's diary {{indicates}} that he began writing the story on 21 July, when he completed a dozen pages of the first chapter; {{he thought it was}} [...] "quite good". He appears to have done <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>work</b> on the project until early September, when he confides to his diary that it is [...] "in serious danger of becoming dull", and expresses doubts that it will ever be finished. However, Waugh apparently found fresh inspiration after reading A Cypress [...] Grove, an essay by the 17th-century Scots poet William Drummond of Hawthornden, and considered retitling his story The Fabulous Paladins after a passage in the essay.|$|E

2500|$|Performance and {{continuity}} calls: The existing contract stated that stagehands could only perform work {{related to the}} performance during a performance call. If the producer wishes the stagehand to perform other duties, the producer must issue a one-hour [...] "continuity call," [...] even if the stagehand has <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>work</b> to do. If the one-hour continuity call is not long enough, producers are required {{to pay for a}} four-hour shift. Producers call the rule wasteful, but the union claimed the rule discouraged theaters from forcing employees to work past midnight. The union also noted that many stagehands supplement their income with daytime jobs, and late nights significantly interfere with these arrangements. Producers proposed widening the tasks stagehands may perform during performance calls and reducing the required four hours of pay. The union had agreed to discuss reducing the required four hours of pay in exchange for improving other benefits.|$|E
