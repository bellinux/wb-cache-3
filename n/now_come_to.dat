5|$|After its reconstruction, the Mezhyhirya Monastery {{became a}} {{regional}} {{center of the}} Zaporozhian Host, serving the host as a military monastery. In 1610, the monastery received {{the status of a}} stauropegic monastery (orthodox church autonomy), under the Patriarch of Constantinople. The universal (act) of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky issued on May 21, 1656 transferred the neighboring settlements of Vyshhorod, Novi Petrivtsi, and Moshchany under control of the Mezhyhirya Monastery. In effect, the universal made Khmelnytsky the monastery's ktitor. After the destruction of the Trakhtemyrivskyi Monastery by a Polish szlachta army, the Mezhyhirya Monastery replaced it as the main cossack military monastery. As a military monastery, retired and elderly cossacks from the Zaporozhian Host would <b>now</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the monastery to retire and live in until the end of their lives. At that time, the monastery's expenses were paid off {{with the help of the}} cossack's Sich Host.|$|E

25|$|The other Enlightenment {{debate about}} common sense, {{concerning}} common sense {{as a term}} for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues {{to be important in}} discussion of social science, and especially economics. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of self-interested individuals is a central assumption in much of modern mathematical economics, and mathematical economics has <b>now</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be an influential tool of political decision making.|$|E

25|$|After his somber {{meeting with}} his chieftains, Haile Selassie visited Sir Sidney Barton at the British Legation. He spoke softly to Sir Sidney but to the point. Britain had {{encouraged}} him with fine words and had made many promises. However, Britain had provided Ethiopia with few guns for which the Ethiopians had paid cash. Haile Selassie stressed that he had risked his own life for Ethiopia {{but also for the}} League of Nations. He asked Sir Sidney whether Britain would <b>now</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his aid in this hour of direst need. Shortly afterwards Haile Selassie drove away, his mouth grim with disappointment.|$|E
25|$|After the Meiji Restoration, {{various kinds}} of Western sports were {{introduced}} into Japan. Playing sports was adopted as a school activity and matches between universities became popular. During the 1870s, track and field events, baseball, football, rugby union, cricket and ice skating were introduced. In 1911, an Austrian gave skiing instruction to the Japanese army. In those days, Western sports were played by few people, but through the educational system they spread throughout the country. Western sports were initially stressed {{as a form of}} mental discipline, but Japanese have <b>now</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> enjoy them as recreational activities.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{expanding}} Siegfried's Tod {{into a series}} of two or more operas would have been particularly appealing to Wagner, as he had <b>now</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> realize that {{it would be impossible to}} say all that he wanted to in a single opera without an inordinate number of digressions. The political events of the past few years and his recent discovery of the philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach had greatly enlarged the scope of ideas which he hoped to explore in his new opera. He also wished to incorporate various ideas that he had been mulling over in the works on Jesus, Frederick, Achilles and Wieland (all four of which had been effectively abandoned by now). These ideas ranged over the politics of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin and the philosophy of Hegel and the Young Hegelians.|$|E

500|$|In chapter 38, High {{provides}} more {{detail about the}} einherjar. Gangleri says that [...] "you say that all those men that have fallen in battle {{since the beginning of}} the world have <b>now</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Odin in Val-hall. What has he got to offer them food? I should have thought that there must be a pretty large number there." [...] High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that [...] "there will seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] However, High adds that food is not a problem because there will never be too many people in Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which he calls a boar) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of Grímnismál mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.|$|E
500|$|On August 14 General Washington {{learned of}} de Grasse's {{decision}} to sail for the Chesapeake. [...] The {{next day he}} reluctantly abandoned the idea of assaulting New York, writing that [...] "atters having <b>now</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a crisis and a decisive plan to be determined on, I was obliged ... to give up all idea of attacking New York..." [...] The combined Franco-American army began moving south on August 19, engaging in several tactics designed to fool Clinton about their intentions. [...] Some forces were sent on a route along the New Jersey shore, and ordered to make camp preparations as if preparing for an attack on Staten Island. [...] The army also carried landing craft to lend verisimilitude to the idea. [...] Washington sent orders to Lafayette to prevent Cornwallis from returning to North Carolina; he did not learn that Cornwallis was entrenching at Yorktown until August 30. [...] Two days later the army was passing through Philadelphia; another mutiny was averted there when funds were procured for troops that threatened to stay until they were paid.|$|E
500|$|The Ottomans desperately {{tried to}} secure an {{alliance}} with a great power before the outbreak of World War I in 1914, but almost all of their attempts ended in failure. Even when the Germanophile Ottoman War Minister Enver Pasha directly proposed an alliance on 22 July to the German ambassador in Istanbul, Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim, he was turned down. Kaiser Wilhelm II overruled Wagenheim two days later, and an Ottoman draft for an alliance was delivered in Berlin on 28 July (the same day the war began). The July Crisis had <b>now</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a breaking point and it appeared Germany would be fighting a two-front war with France and Russia. Hesitant to make any more significant military obligations, Wangenheim was authorised by German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg to sign the agreement only if the Ottoman Empire would [...] "undertake action against Russia worthy of its name." [...] On 1 August, Enver offered Wangenheim the new battleship Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel in exchange for German protection. This was likely a clever ploy; United Kingdom officials, in order to bolster the Royal Navy to wage war against Germany, had already seized Sultan Osman-ı Evvel and the battleship Reşadiye, which were under construction in their shipyards. Wagenheim {{and the majority of}} the Ottoman government were unaware of this. Enver probably already knew of the seizure, since actually releasing the battleship to a foreign nation would have caused an uproar from the public and the government. Ambassador Wagenheim signed the treaty the next day, creating the secret Ottoman–German alliance.|$|E

50|$|Events in France <b>now</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{influence}} {{the future of}} the company. A Scottish economist and financier, John Law, exiled after killing a man in a duel, had travelled around Europe before settling in France. There he founded a bank, which in December 1718 became the Banque Royale, national bank of France, while Law himself was granted sweeping powers to control the economy of France, which operated largely by royal decree. Law's remarkable success was known in financial circles throughout Europe, and <b>now</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> inspire Blunt and his associates to make greater efforts to grow their own concerns.|$|R
