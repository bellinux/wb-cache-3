50|$|Hispar is {{a village}} in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, located two {{kilometers}} below the snout of the 49 kilometer-long Hispar Glacier. It can be reached from the Karakoram Highway by the road that leads south of Hunza towards Nagar (<b>Nagir),</b> Hopar (Hoppar) and Hispar, though in August 2006 this road was washed out at {{the confluence of the}} Hispar and Hunza Rivers, eliminating all vehicular access to the valley for a month or two.|$|E

50|$|The Hispar River forms {{from the}} melt {{water of the}} Hispar Glacier - a 49 kilometer-long glacier in the Karakoram {{mountains}} of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. The Hispar Glacier and river both flow northwest, passing through Hispar, Hopar and Nagar (<b>Nagir)</b> villages until the confluence with the Hunza River in the Hunza Valley. Road conditions are spectacular at best, treacherous at worst. In August 2006, a bridge below Hispar village was condemned, and the Hunza River washed the road away at the confluence, eliminating all vehicular access to the entire valley for some months.|$|E

50|$|In April 1870 Chester again {{set forth}} in the HMS Blanche with 25 royal marines and 8 aborigional troopers, 5 of who were {{recently}} released from St Helena's prison where they had served time for rape and armed robbery.

This time the men turned out to be Kulkalaig from <b>Nagir.</b> Cape York Gudang aboriginals with Chester identified three Kulkalaig men as the culprits behind the Sperwer incident, and, on learning this, Chester had the three summarily executed. It is widely thought that the Kaurareg were indeed uninvolved, though the reprisal visited on them for it was responsible for their decimation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Ribosomal DNA {{of several}} species of the {{free-living}} Naegleria amoeba harbors an optional group I intron within the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. The intron (Nae. S 516) has a complex organization of two ribozyme domains (<b>NaGIR</b> 1 and <b>NaGIR</b> 2) and a homing endonuclease gene (NaHEG). <b>NaGIR</b> 2 is responsible for intron excision, exon ligation, and full-length intron RNA circularization, reactions typical for nuclear group I intron ribozymes. <b>NaGIR</b> 1, however, is essential for NaHEG expression by generating the 5 ' end of the homing endonuclease messenger RNA. Interestingly, this unusual class of ribozyme adds a lariat-cap at the mRNA. Results To elucidate the evolutionary history of the Nae. S 516 twin-ribozyme introns we have analyzed 13 natural variants present in distinct Naegleria isolates. Structural variabilities were noted within both the ribozyme domains and provide strong comparative support to the intron secondary structure. One of the introns, present in N. martinezi NG 872, contains hallmarks of a degenerated NaHEG. Phylogenetic analyses performed on separate data sets representing <b>NaGIR</b> 1, <b>NaGIR</b> 2, NaHEG, and ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 ribosomal DNA are consistent with an overall vertical inheritance pattern of the intron within the Naegleria genus. Conclusion The Nae. S 516 twin-ribozyme intron was gained early in the Naegleria evolution with subsequent vertical inheritance. The intron {{was lost in the}} majority of isolates (70 %), leaving a widespread but scattered distribution pattern. Why the apparent asexual Naegleria amoebae harbors active intron homing endonucleases, dependent on sexual reproduction for its function, remains a puzzle. </p...|$|E
40|$|We have {{characterized}} the structural organization and catalytic {{properties of the}} large nucleolar group I introns (NaSSU 1) of the different Naegleria species N. jamiesoni, N. andersoni, N. italica, and N. gruberi. NaSSU 1 consists of three distinct RNA domains: an open reading frame encoding a homing-type endonuclease, and a small group I ribozyme (<b>NaGIR</b> 1) inserted into the P 6 loop of a second group I ribozyme (<b>NaGIR</b> 2). The two ribozymes have different functions in RNA splicing and processing. <b>NaGIR</b> 1 is an unusual self-cleaving group I ribozyme responsible for intron processing at two internal sites (IPS 1 and IPS 2), both close to the 5 ' end of the open reading frame. This processing is hypothesized to lead to formation of a messenger RNA for the endonuclease. Structurally, <b>NaGIR</b> 2 is a typical group IC 1 ribozyme, catalyzing intron excision and exon ligation reactions. <b>NaGIR</b> 2 is responsible for circularization of the excised intron, a reaction that generates full-length RNA circles of wild-type intron. Although it is only distantly related in primary sequence, NaSSU 1 RNA has a predicted organization and function {{very similar to that}} of the mobile group I intron DiSSU 1 of Didymium, the only other group I intron known to encode two ribozymes. We propose that these twin-ribozyme introns define a distinct category of group I introns with a conserved structural organization and function...|$|E
40|$|NaSSU 1 is {{a complex}} nuclear group I intron found in several species of Naegleria, {{consisting}} of a large self-splicing group I ribozyme (<b>NaGIR</b> 2), which itself is interrupted by a small, group I-like ribozyme (<b>NaGIR</b> 1) and an open reading frame (ORF) coding for a homing endonuclease. The GIR 1 ribozyme cleaves in vitro transcripts of NaSSU 1 at two internal processing sites about 400 nt downstream of the 5 ' end of the intron, proximal to the endonuclease ORF. Here we demonstrate that self-cleavage of the excised intron also occurs in vivo in Naegleria gruberi, generating an ORF-containing RNA that possesses a short leader with a sequence element likely {{to be involved in}} gene expression. To assess the functional significance of self-cleavage, we constructed a genetic system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. First, a mutant yeast strain was selected with a mutation in all the rRNA genes, rendering the rDNA resistant to cleavage by the Naegleria endonuclease. Active endonuclease, which is otherwise lethal, could be expressed readily in these cells. Endonuclease activity also could be detected in extracts of yeast harboring plasmids in which the endonuclease ORF was embedded in its native context in the intron. Analysis of the RNA from these yeast cells showed that the excised intron RNA was processed as in N. gruberi. A mutant intron constructed to prevent self-cleavage of the RNA failed to express endonuclease activity. These results support the hypothesis that the <b>NaGIR</b> 1 -catalyzed self-cleavage of the intron RNA is a key event in expression of the endonuclease...|$|E
