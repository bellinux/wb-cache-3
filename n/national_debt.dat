5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt into {{national}} and state, and further divided the <b>national</b> <b>debt</b> into {{foreign and domestic}} debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the <b>national</b> <b>debt</b> held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{government}} reined in inflation {{by making the}} peso equal in value to the U.S. dollar, and privatised numerous state-run companies, using part of the proceeds to reduce the <b>national</b> <b>debt.</b> However, a sustained recession {{at the turn of}} the 21st century culminated in a default, and the government again devalued the peso.

5|$|The <b>national</b> <b>debt</b> {{increased}} {{as a result}} during Hamilton's service as Secretary of the Treasury, but the nation established its good credit.

Many of Washington's fellow Virginians and others were vexed by this, but he considered that they had adequate redress through their Congressional representatives.|$|E
5|$|Greater {{problems}} arose over financial {{speculation and}} {{the management of the}} <b>national</b> <b>debt.</b> Certain government bonds could not be redeemed without the consent of the bondholder and had been issued when interest rates were high; consequently each bond represented a long-term drain on public finances, as bonds were hardly ever redeemed. In 1719 the South Sea Company proposed to take over £31million (three fifths) of the British <b>national</b> <b>debt</b> by exchanging government securities for stock in the company. The Company bribed Lord Sunderland, George's mistress Melusine von der Schulenburg, and Lord Stanhope's cousin, Charles Stanhope, who was Secretary of the Treasury, to support their plan. The Company enticed bondholders to convert their high-interest, irredeemable bonds to low-interest, easily tradeable stocks by offering apparently preferential financial gains. Company prices rose rapidly; the shares had cost £128 on 1 January 1720, but were valued at £500 when the conversion scheme opened in May. On 24 June the price reached a peak of £1,050. The company's success led to the speculative flotation of other companies, some of a bogus nature, and the Government, in an attempt to suppress these schemes and {{with the support of the}} Company, passed the Bubble Act. With the rise in the market now halted, uncontrolled selling began in August, which caused the stock to plummet to £150 by the end of September. Many individuals—including aristocrats—lost vast sums and some were completely ruined. George, who had been in Hanover since June, returned to London in November—sooner than he wanted or was usual—at the request of the ministry.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{felt the}} money from the bonds should not go to the soldiers, but the speculators that had bought the bonds from the soldiers, who had shown little faith in the country's future. The process of {{attempting}} to track down the original bond holders along with the government showing discrimination among the classes of holders if the war veterans were to be compensated also weighed in as factors for Hamilton. As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the <b>national</b> <b>debt</b> and label it as federal debt, for the sake of efficiency on a national scale.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to calling for cuts in federal government spending {{to help reduce}} the <b>national</b> <b>debt,</b> Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of entitlement programs, such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of Social Security and Medicare. He supported substantial increases in military spending and promised to invest more heavily in military weapons programs while {{increasing the number of}} active-duty military personnel. He was very supportive of the directions taken by the budget proposals of Paul Ryan, although he later proposed his own budget plan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few weeks of 2010, there was renewed anxiety about {{excessive}} <b>national</b> <b>debt,</b> with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits. This in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen Eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, {{as in the case of}} Greece and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Ryan has an {{interest}} in political economics and has been a thought leader in Congress on issues of budget reform. He helped bring the issues of the <b>national</b> <b>debt</b> and the national deficit into the national policy debate. Ryan subscribes to supply-side economics. His positions on fiscal policy have included tax cuts, cuts to entitlement programs, freezes on discretionary spending, the elimination of automatic inflation increases in calculating budget baselines, deregulation, and the privatization of social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and education.|$|E
6000|$|This {{disastrous}} {{result is}} to be brought about partly by the mere progress of competition, as sketched in our previous extract by M.

60|$|But Teddy Maroon did {{not admit}} {{the force of}} his friend's arguments. He allowed, indeed, that war was a great work, inasmuch as it was a great evil, whereas lighthouse-building was a great blessing; and he contended, that while the first was a cause of unmitigated misery, and {{productive}} of nothing better than widows, orphans, and <b>national</b> <b>debts,</b> the second was the source of immense happiness, and of salvation to life, limb, and property.|$|R
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} independence, the migration of white settlers and importation of black slave labor into the vast republic was deterred by Texas's unresolved international status {{and the threat of}} renewed warfare with Mexico. American citizens who considered migrating to the new republic perceived that [...] "life and property were safer within the United States" [...] than in an independent Texas. The situation led to labor shortages, reduced tax revenue, large <b>national</b> <b>debts</b> and a diminished Texas militia.|$|R
5|$|Several forts in Confederate {{territory}} {{remained in}} Union hands. Davis sent {{a commission to}} Washington with an offer to pay for any federal property on Southern soil, {{as well as the}} Southern portion of the <b>national</b> <b>debt,</b> but Lincoln refused to meet with the commissioners. Brief informal discussions did take place with Secretary of State William Seward through Supreme Court Justice John A. Campbell. From Alabama, he later resigned from the federal government. Seward hinted that Fort Sumter would be evacuated, but gave no assurance.|$|E
5|$|The most {{pressing}} economic matter the Nazis initially faced was the 30 percent national unemployment rate. Economist Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics, created in May 1933 a scheme for deficit financing. Capital projects were {{paid for with}} the issuance of promissory notes called Mefo bills. When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money to do so. While the <b>national</b> <b>debt</b> soared, Hitler and his economic team expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the debt. Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} {{democracy}} and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by <b>national</b> <b>debt,</b> government corruption, coup attempts, disasters, a persistent communist insurgency, and a military conflict with Moro separatists. During Corazon Aquino's administration, U.S. forces withdrew from the Philippines, due to {{the rejection of the}} U.S. Bases Extension Treaty, and leading to the official transfer of Clark Air Base in November 1991 and Subic Bay to the government in December 1992. The administration also faced a series of natural disasters, including the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991. After introducing a constitution that limited presidents to a single term, Aquino did not stand for re-election.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, {{based on}} an {{analysis}} of the global financial crisis, [...] Parncutt proposed a global wealth tax to stabilize and reduce <b>national</b> <b>debts,</b> finance official development assistance to alleviate global poverty, and finance projects to mitigate climate change. A similar idea was proposed by economist Thomas Piketty in his 2013 book Capital in the 21st Century. Parncutt also supports the introduction of a universal unconditional basic income and proposes combining it with a flat tax on income.|$|R

50|$|Paying {{interest}} on outstanding bonds means tax rates will be higher, but <b>national</b> <b>debts</b> have an advantage: {{they can be}} extremely useful for conducting monetary policy. When a central bank would like to increase the money supply, it can merely purchase previously-issued bonds. When it would like to contract the money supply, it can sell them. This {{is known as the}} secondary market, but for this to work, the bonds, of course, have to have been issued previously in the primary market.|$|R
