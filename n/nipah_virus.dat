5|$|In 1997 an {{outbreak}} of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new paramyxovirus was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named <b>Nipah</b> <b>virus,</b> after the village where he had lived. The infection {{was caused by a}} virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of <b>Nipah</b> <b>virus</b> in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
25|$|At least 30 {{previously}} unknown disease agents {{have been identified}} since 1973, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, hepatitis C, and <b>Nipah</b> <b>virus,</b> for which no cures are available.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the virus}} is {{reported}} to be very similar to both Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses,</b> it does not cause illness in laboratory animals usually susceptible to paramyxoviruses. Animals were able to mount an effective response and create effective antibodies.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Henipavirus genus {{contains}} two highly lethal viruses, the Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses</b> and one, recently discovered, apparently nonpathogenic member; Cedar virus. These three, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, are hosted by fruit bats and use EphrinB 2 receptors {{for entry into}} cells. The Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses</b> are zoonotic pathogens {{that emerged in the}} middle of 90 s and have caused severe, and often fatal, neurologic and/or respiratory diseases in both humans and different animals; including spillover into equine and porcine species. Development of relevant models is critical for a better understanding of viral pathogenesis, generating new diagnostic tools, and assessing anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. This review summarizes available data on several animal models where natural and/or experimental infection has been demonstrated; including pteroid bats, horses, pigs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, ferrets, and nonhuman primates. It recapitulates the principal features of viral pathogenesis in these animals and current knowledge on anti-viral immune responses. Lastly it describes the recently characterized murine animal model, which provides the possibility to use numerous and powerful tools available for mice to further decipher henipaviruses immunopathogenesis, prophylaxis, and treatment. The utility of different models to analyze important aspects of henipaviruses-induced disease in humans, potential routes of transmission, and therapeutic approaches are equally discussed...|$|R
25|$|New {{viruses and}} strains of viruses were {{discovered}} in every decade {{of the second half}} of the 20th century.

40|$|Paramyxoviruses are {{responsible}} {{for a wide variety}} of diseases both in humans and in animals. Common to many paramyxoviruses is the fact that they can cause neurological symptoms in their final host. Newly discovered paramyxoviruses, such as the Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses,</b> show the same pattern of pathogenesis as that of the paramyxoviruses already known. Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a well-studied member of the genus Morbillivirus.

25|$|Hendra virus (HeV) and <b>Nipah</b> <b>virus</b> (NiV) in {{the genus}} Henipavirus {{have emerged in}} humans and {{livestock}} in Australia and Southeast Asia. Both viruses are contagious, highly virulent, and capable of infecting a number of mammalian species and causing potentially fatal disease. Due {{to the lack of}} a licensed vaccine or antiviral therapies, HeV and NiV are designated as biosafety level (BSL) 4 agents. The genomic structure of both viruses is that of a typical paramyxovirus.|$|E
25|$|A {{major factor}} {{contributing}} to the appearance of new zoonotic pathogens in human populations is increased contact between humans and wildlife. This can be caused either by encroachment of human activity into wilderness areas or by movement of wild animals into areas of human activity. An {{example of this is}} the outbreak of <b>Nipah</b> <b>virus</b> in peninsular Malaysia in 1999, when intensive pig farming began on the habitat of infected fruit bats. Unidentified infection of the pigs amplified the force of infection, eventually transmitting the virus to farmers and causing 105 human deaths.|$|E
25|$|Biosafety-level-4 {{laboratories}} {{are used}} for diagnostic work and research on easily transmitted pathogens which can cause fatal disease. These include a number of viruses known to cause viral hemorrhagic fever such as Marburg virus, Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Other pathogens handled at BSL-4 include Hendra virus, <b>Nipah</b> <b>virus,</b> and some Flaviviruses. Additionally, poorly characterized pathogens which appear closely related to dangerous pathogens are often handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or {{to work with them}} at a lower level. This level is also used for work with Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, though this work can only be done at the World Health Organization approved facilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, U.S.A., as well as the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, Russia.|$|E
40|$|Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses</b> (genus: Henipavirus) are novel {{paramyxoviruses}} {{that emerged}} to cause severe {{human and animal}} disease. Studies in both humans and animals suggest that both viral infections are associated with similar pathologies. This is probably related to the common viral receptors that henipaviruses employ to infect the cell. The blood vessels and central nervous system tissues were particularly susceptible. A dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis-associated thrombosis/ microinfarction and direct parenchymal cell infection contributed to acute tissue injury. A unique relapsing encephalitis may also complicate henipavirus infection...|$|R
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of how antibodies are generated and function could help develop effective vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics against viruses such as HIV- 1, SARS Coronavirus (CoV), and Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses</b> (henipaviruses). Although broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the HIV- 1 were observed in patients, elicitation of such bnAbs remains a major challenge {{when compared to other}} viral targets. We previously hypothesized that HIV- 1 could have evolved a strategy to evade the immune system due to absent or very weak binding of germline antibodies to the conserved epitopes that may not be sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an effective immune response. To further explore our hypothesis, we used the 454 sequence analysis of a large na&# 239;ve library of human IgM antibodies which had been used for selecting antibodies against SARS Coronavirus (CoV) receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble G proteins (sG) of Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses</b> (henipaviruses). We found that the human IgM repertoires from the 454 sequencing have diverse germline usages, recombination patterns, junction diversity and a lower extent of somatic mutation. In this study, we identified germline intermediates of antibodies specific to HIV- 1 and other viruses as observed in normal individuals, and compared their genetic diversity and somatic mutation level along with available structural and functional data. Further computational analysis will provide framework for understanding the underlying genetic and molecular determinants related to maturation pathways of antiviral bnAbs that could be useful for applying novel approaches to the design of effective vaccine immunogens and antibody-based therapeutics...|$|R

500|$|Steven Soderbergh was {{motivated}} {{to make an}} [...] "ultra-realistic" [...] film about the public health and scientific response to a pandemic. The movie touches {{on a variety of}} themes, including the factors which drive mass panic and collapse of social order, the scientific process for characterizing and containing a novel pathogen, balancing personal motives against professional responsibilities and rules {{in the face of an}} existential threat, the limitations and consequences of public health responses, and the pervasiveness of interpersonal connections which can serve as vectors to spread disease. Soderbergh acknowledged the salience of these post-apocalyptic themes is heightened by reactions to the September11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The movie was intended to realistically convey the [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "unnerving" [...] social and scientific reactions to a pandemic. The recent real-life epidemics such as the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 flu pandemic have been inspirations and influences in the film. The chain of contagion involving bats and pigs is reminiscent of the trail of the <b>Nipah</b> <b>virus</b> that originated in Malaysia in 1997, which similarly involved the disturbance of a bat colony by deforestation.|$|E
500|$|Ferris Jabr of New Scientist {{approved}} of Contagion for accurately portraying the [...] "successes and frustrations" [...] of science. Jabr cites story {{elements such as}} [...] "the fact that before researchers can study a virus, they {{need to figure out}} how to grow it in cell cultures in the lab, without the virus destroying all the cells" [...] as examples of accurate depictions of science. Carl Zimmer, a science commentator, praised the film, stating, [...] "It shows how reconstructing the course of an outbreak can provide crucial clues, such as how many people an infected person can give a virus to, how many of them get sick, and how many of them die." [...] He also describes a conversation with the film's scientific consultant, W. Ian Lipkin, in which Lipkin defended the rapid generation of a vaccine in the film. Zimmer wrote that [...] "Lipkin and his colleagues are now capable of figuring out how to trigger immune reactions to exotic viruses from animals in a matter of weeks, not months. And once they've created a vaccine, they don't have to use Eisenhower-era technology to manufacture it in bulk." [...] Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccination expert, stated that [...] "typically when movies take on science, they tend to sacrifice the science in favor of drama. That wasn't true here." [...] Offit appreciated the film's usage of concepts such as R0 and fomites, as well as the fictional strain's origins, which was based on the <b>Nipah</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Other viral {{diseases}} {{which can}} be carried by fruit bats include Australian bat lyssavirus and henipavirus (notably Hendra virus and <b>Nipah</b> <b>virus),</b> both of which can prove fatal to humans. [...] These bats {{have been shown to}} infect other species (specifically horses) with Hendra virus in Australian regions. Later, humans became infected with Hendra virus after being exposed to horse bodily fluids and excretions. The discovery of this Australian bat lyssavirus was in 1996, before this all bats on all continents, except Australia, had been recorded to carry this rabies-like disease.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses</b> {{are related}} {{emergent}} paramyxoviruses that infect and cause disease in animals and humans. Disease manifests as a generalized vasculitis affecting multiple organs, {{but is the}} most severe in the respiratory and central nervous systems. The high case fatality and person-to-person transmission associated with the most recent NiV outbreaks, and the recent re-emergence of HeV, emphasize the importance and necessity of effective therapeutics for these novel agents. In recent years henipavirus research has revealed a more complete understanding of pathogenesis and, as a consequence, viable approaches towards vaccines and therapeutics have emerged. All strategies target early steps in viral replication including receptor binding and membrane fusion. Animal models have been developed, {{some of which may}} prove more valuable than others for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic agents and regimes. Assessments of pro-tective host immunity and drug pharmacokinetics will be crucial to the further advancement of therapeutic compounds...|$|R
40|$|Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) {{were first}} {{discovered}} in the late 1950 s. Over the last decade, considerable knowledge about their molecular structure and function has been accumulated. This has led to significant changes in both the nomenclature and taxonomic relationships of these viruses. HPIV is genetically and antigenically divided into types 1 to 4. Further major subtypes of HPIV- 4 (A and B) and subgroups/genotypes of HPIV- 1 and HPIV- 3 have been described. HPIV- 1 to HPIV- 3 are major causes of lower respiratory infections in infants, young children, the immunocompromised, the chronically ill, and the elderly. Each subtype can cause somewhat unique clinical diseases in different hosts. HPIV are enveloped and of medium size (150 to 250 nm), and their RNA genome is in the negative sense. These viruses belong to the Paramyxoviridae family, {{one of the largest}} and most rapidly growing groups of viruses causing significant human and veterinary disease.

40|$|Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses</b> (genus Henipavirus, family Paramyxoviridae) {{are highly}} {{pathogenic}} bat-borne viruses. The need for high biocontainment when studying henipaviruses has hindered {{the development of}} therapeutics {{and knowledge of the}} viral infection cycle. We have performed a genome-wide siRNA screen at biosafety level 4 that identified 585 human proteins required for henipavirus infection. The host protein with the largest impact was fibrillarin, a nucleolar methyltransferase that was also required by measles, mumps and respiratory syncytial viruses for infection. While not required for cell entry, henipavirus RNA and protein syntheses were greatly impaired in cells lacking fibrillarin, indicating {{a crucial role in the}} RNA replication phase of infection. During infection, the Hendra virus matrix protein co-localized with fibrillarin in cell nucleoli, and co-associated as a complex in pulldown studies, while its nuclear import was unaffected in fibrillarin-depleted cells. Mutagenesis studies showed that the methyltransferase activity of fibrillarin was required for henipavirus infection, suggesting that this enzyme could be targeted therapeutically to combat henipavirus infections...|$|R

40|$|SummaryInterferons (IFN) are {{essential}} antiviral cytokines that establish the cellular antiviral state through upregulation {{of hundreds of}} interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), most of which have uncharacterized functions and mechanisms. We identified cholesterol- 25 -hydroxylase (CH 25 H) as a broadly antiviral ISG. CH 25 H converts cholesterol to a soluble antiviral factor, 25 -hydroxycholesterol (25 HC). 25 HC treatment in cultured cells broadly inhibited growth of enveloped viruses including VSV, HSV, HIV, and MHV 68 and acutely pathogenic EBOV, RVFV, RSSEV, and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses</b> under BSL 4 conditions. It suppressed viral growth by blocking membrane fusion between virus and cell. In animal models, Ch 25 h-deficient mice were more susceptible to MHV 68 lytic infection. Moreover, administration of 25 HC in humanized mice suppressed HIV replication and reversed T cell depletion. Thus, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism by which IFN achieves its antiviral state through {{the production of a}} natural oxysterol to inhibit viral entry and implicate membrane-modifying oxysterols as potential antiviral therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|The Paramyxoviridae genus Henipavirus is {{presently}} {{represented by the}} type species Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses</b> which are both recently emerged zoonotic viral pathogens responsible for repeated outbreaks associated with high morbidity and mortality in Australia, Southeast Asia, India and Bangladesh. These enveloped viruses bind and enter host target cells through the coordinated activities of their attachment (G) and class I fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins. The henipavirus G glycoprotein interacts with host cellular B class ephrins, triggering conformational alterations in G {{that lead to the}} activation of the F glycoprotein, which facilitates the membrane fusion process. Using the recently published structures of HeV-G and NiV-G and other paramyxovirus glycoproteins, we review the features of the henipavirus envelope glycoproteins that appear essential for mediating the viral fusion process, including receptor binding, G-F interaction, F activation, with an emphasis on G and the mutations that disrupt viral infectivity. Finally, recent candidate therapeutics for henipavirus-mediated disease are summarized in light of their ability to inhibit HeV and NiV entry by targeting their G and F glycoproteins...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{highlights}} {{research and}} development {{in the field of}} emerging viral causes of encephalitis over the past year. RECENT FINDINGS: There is new evidence for the presence of henipaviruses in African bats. There have also been promising advances in vaccine and neutralizing antibody research against Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses.</b> West Nile virus continues to cause large outbreaks in the United States, and long-term sequelae of the virus are increasingly appreciated. There is exciting new research regarding the variable susceptibility of different brain regions to neurotropic virus infection. Another cluster of solid organ transplant recipients developed encephalitis from organ donor-acquired lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. The global epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis virus has been further clarified. Evidence continues to accumulate for the central nervous system involvement of dengue virus, and the recent deadly outbreak of enterovirus 71 in Cambodian children is discussed. SUMMARY: In response to complex ecological and societal dynamics, the worldwide epidemiology of viral encephalitis continues to evolve in surprising ways.

40|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} for {{a spectrum of}} infectious zoonotic diseases including the recently emerged henipaviruses (Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses).</b> Henipaviruses have been observed both naturally and experimentally to cause serious and often fatal disease in many different mammal species, including humans. Interestingly, infection of the flying fox with henipaviruses occurs {{in the absence of}} clinical disease. The extreme variation in the disease pattern between humans and bats has led to an investigation into the effects of henipavirus infection on the innate immune response in bat cell lines. We report that henipavirus infection does not result in the induction of interferon expression, and the viruses also inhibit interferon signaling. We also confirm that the interferon production and signaling block in bat cells is not due to differing viral protein expression levels between human and bat hosts. This information, in addition to the known lack of clinical signs in bats following henipavirus infection, suggests that bats control henipavirus infection by an as yet unidentified mechanism, not via the interferon response. This is the first report of henipavirus infection in bat cells specifically investigating aspects of the innate immune system...|$|R
40|$|The {{paramyxovirus}} family includes major {{human and}} animal pathogens, including measles virus, mumps virus, and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), {{as well as the}} emerging zoonotic Hendra and <b>Nipah</b> <b>viruses.</b> In the U. S., RSV {{is the leading cause of}} infant hospitalizations due to viral infectious disease. Despite their clinical significance, effective drugs for the improved management of paramyxovirus disease are lacking. The development of novel anti-paramyxovirus therapeutics is therefore urgently needed. Paramyxoviruses contain RNA genomes of negative polarity, necessitating a virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex for replication and transcription. Since an equivalent enzymatic activity is absent in host cells, the RdRp complex represents an attractive druggable target, although structure-guided drug development campaigns are hampered by the lack of high-resolution RdRp crystal structures. Here, we review the current structural and functional insight into the paramyxovirus polymerase complex in conjunction with an evaluation of the mechanism of activity and developmental status of available experimental RdRp inhibitors. Our assessment spotlights the importance of the RdRp complex as a premier target for therapeutic intervention and examines how high-resolution insight into the organization of the complex will pave the path toward the structure-guided design and optimization of much-needed next-generation paramyxovirus RdRp blockers...|$|R
