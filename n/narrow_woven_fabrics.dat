The enhancement of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> in HAH sandwich panel further strengthens the sandwich panel especially in ballistic tests. Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> showed extensive pull out (rupture of yarns) when less than 6 layers of fabric impacted by ballistic projectile at a velocity of 293 m/s. Sandwich panel consisting of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> incorporated with aluminium honeycomb showed no pull out when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 312. 5 m/s. However, when sandwich panel arrangement {{was in the}} following order: 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> and a final layer of HAH, Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> pull out was observed when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 277. 8 m/s. This indicated that the ballistic projectile was impacting on 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> (followed by another 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric)</b> at a time instead of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> based on {{the arrangement of the}} sandwich panel. The overall sandwich panels for both arrangements had the same amount of materials but one failed the ballistic test and the other passed. One possible reason behind the improved ballistic test is that the areal density of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> is the highest when the layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> are assembled together. Therefore, it is crucial to have ballistic projectile entrapped within the Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> layers before prioritising the arrangement of sandwich panel...|$|R

In the present paper, the effect of pp between two adjacent yams on the elastic properties of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> lamina and the effect of laminate configuration for different number of layers on the elastic properties of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates for different material systems are studied. An optimum gap between adjacent yams gives higher Young's moduli, and it depends upon the fabric structure and material system. A basic building block is found which gives higher elastic properties than with any other configuration with the same number of layers. Such a basic building block can then be used for making thicker laminates.

40|$|Development of the {{wrinkled}} fabrics {{depends on}} geometry and relaxation {{behavior of the}} multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> After bleaching and relaxation, the new shapes and sizes of crinkles were recorded. The results prove that the manner of fabric deformation during relaxation depends upon the multilayer fabrics structure. The quantities of the crinkles on the fabric {{are related to the}} float length type. Multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> with longer float length show higher crinkled, and its deformation behavior is non-linear. Thus, connected deformations are closely related to the stretch potential and influence multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> draping and fitting of the garment. For this purpose, we have postulated new model for the relationship between fabric geometry and stretch potential. The suggested hypotheses make it possible to predict mathematically the crinkle of multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> and prediction of suitable-sett of warp and weft.

It has been reported that <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> based on high strength and high modulus fibers with dense structures have the advantage of shear resistance (Tien et al. 2010). Also due to interlacement of tows or yarns, <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> offer high resistance to damage, superior energy absorption (Karahan et al. 2008) and remarkably high values of strain at failure in tension, and loadings (Chou and Ko 1989; Dixit and Mali 2013).
