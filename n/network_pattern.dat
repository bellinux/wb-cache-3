25|$|A street <b>network</b> <b>pattern</b> {{can affect}} the {{production}} of pollutants {{by the amount of}} car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to pedestrians. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of pollutant emissions. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20 mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50 mph. This effect is accentuated with high traffic density in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Localized <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> {{are assumed}} to {{represent}} an optimal design principle in different biological networks. A widely used method for identifying functional components in biological networks is looking for network motifs – over-represented <b>network</b> <b>patterns.</b> A number of recent studies have undermined the claim that these over-represented patterns are indicative of optimal design principles and question whether localized <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> are indeed of functional significance. This paper examines the functional significance of regulatory <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> via their biological annotation and evolutionary conservation. Results We enumerate all 3 -node <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> in the regulatory network of the yeast S. cerevisiae and examine the biological GO annotation and evolutionary conservation of their constituent genes. Specific 3 -node patterns {{are found to be}} functionally enriched in different exogenous cellular conditions and thus may represent significant functional components. These functionally enriched patterns are composed mainly of recently evolved genes suggesting that there is no evolutionary pressure acting to preserve such functionally enriched patterns. No correlation is found between over-representation of <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> and functional enrichment. Conclusion The findings of functional enrichment support the view that <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> constitute an important design principle in regulatory networks. However, the wildly used method of over-representation for detecting motifs is not suitable for identifying functionally enriched patterns. </p...|$|R

40|$|Genes that {{underlie}} human disease are important subjects of systems biology research. In the present study, we demonstrate that Mendelian and complex disease genes have distinct and consistent protein–protein interaction (PPI) properties. We show that five different network properties {{can be reduced}} to two independent metrics when applied to the human PPI network. These two metrics largely coincide with the degree (number of connections) and the clustering coefficient (the number of connections among the neighbors of a particular protein). We demonstrate that disease genes have simultaneously unusually high degree and unusually low clustering coefficient. Such genes can be described as brokers in that they connect many proteins that would not be connected otherwise. We show that these results are robust to the effect of gene age and inspection bias variation. Notably, genes identified in genome-wide association study (GWAS) have <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> that are almost indistinguishable from the <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> of nondisease genes and significantly different from the <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> of complex disease genes identified through non-GWAS means.
