5|$|In 1808, Erman and Simon {{suggested}} {{using the}} term metalloid {{to refer to the}} <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> elements sodium and potassium.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{while on}} a fishing trip {{on the coast of}} Queensland with his father, Irwin {{discovered}} a new species of turtle. Later given the honour of naming the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> species, he named it Irwin's turtle (Elseya irwini) after his family. Another <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> Australian animal – a species of air-breathing land snail, Crikey steveirwini, was named after Irwin in 2009.|$|E
5|$|H. G. Wells {{introduced}} giant wasps in his 1904 novel The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth, {{making use}} of the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> growth hormones to lend plausibility to his science fiction.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the element is credited to the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth. While he was working in his experimental laboratory in Berlin in 1789, Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely sodium diuranate) by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide. Klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder, which he thought was the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> metal itself (in fact, that powder was an oxide of uranium). He named the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> element after the planet Uranus (named after the primordial Greek god of the sky), which had been discovered eight years earlier by William Herschel.|$|E
5|$|When the October journées took place, France's revolutionary decade, 1789–1799, {{had barely}} begun. The revolution's {{capacity}} for violence was as yet not fully realized. The storming of the Bastille had occurred {{less than three}} months earlier. Flush with <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> power, the common citizens of France – particularly in the teeming capital, Paris – felt a <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> desire to participate in politics and government. The poorest among them were almost exclusively concerned with the issue of food: most workers spent nearly half their income on bread. In the post-Bastille period, price inflation and severe shortages in Paris became commonplace, as did local incidents of violence in the marketplaces.|$|E
5|$|A novel {{interaction}} between millipedes and mosses {{was described in}} 2011, in which individuals of the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> Psammodesmus bryophorus {{was found to have}} up to ten species living on its dorsal surface, in what may provide camouflage for the millipede and increased dispersal for the mosses.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, army {{lieutenant}} {{and part-time}} chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a heavy black rock {{in an old}} quarry near the Swedish village of Ytterby (now part of the Stockholm Archipelago). Thinking {{that it was an}} unknown mineral containing the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> element tungsten, he named it ytterbite and sent samples to various chemists for analysis.|$|E
5|$|In Survivor's Quest, Zahn's 2004 {{sequel to}} Vision of the Future, Luke and Mara journey to {{investigate}} the wreckage of Outbound Flight, a Jedi expedition destroyed by Thrawn years before. <b>Newly</b> <b>discovered</b> by the Chiss, the remains {{turn out to be}} the lure in a trap laid by the bloodthirsty Vagaari to avenge themselves on the Chiss.|$|E
5|$|It is the co-existence of the long-known large ring-like {{feature in}} the gas of Messier 31, {{together}} with this <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> inner ring-like structure, offset from the barycenter, that suggested a nearly head-on collision with the satellite M32, a milder version of the Cartwheel encounter.|$|E
5|$|More recently, June Schlueter {{has found}} {{evidence}} that Martin the Elder was in London when the engraver of the First Folio portrait {{was known to be}} in Madrid. Although she began her archival research hoping to prove Edmond's assertion that the elder Martin was the Shakespeare engraver, Schlueter concludes that the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> evidence actually supports the younger.|$|E
5|$|The {{discoveries of}} the high-radii planets HAT-P-33b and HAT-P-32b, {{along with that}} of WASP-17b, contributed to the {{question}} of what factors, besides temperature, contribute to the large radii of these inflated planets. The discrepancy lies in planet WASP-18b, which is far hotter than the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> HAT planets and WASP-17b, but has a far smaller radius.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{relationships}} with other basal sauropod genera remain unclear. Ronan Allain and colleagues (2004, 2008) found that Vulcanodon is most closely related to Tazoudasaurus, a <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> sauropod genus from Morocco. These researchers suggested reintroducing the name Vulcanodontidae to name the clade containing Vulcanodon and Tazoudasaurus. However, this sibling relationship between Tazoudasaurus and Vulcanodon could not be confirmed by other analyses.|$|E
5|$|Bell was an {{energetic}} and skilful entrepreneur {{as well as}} an innovative metallurgist. He was involved in multiple partnerships with his brothers to make iron and alkali chemicals, and with other pioneers including Robert Stirling Newall to make steel cables. He pioneered the large-scale manufacture of aluminium at his Washington works, conducting experiments in its production, and in the production of other chemicals such as the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> element thallium. He was a director of major companies including the North Eastern Railway and the Forth Bridge company, then the largest bridge project in the world.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire and had taken a step back from his {{businesses}} to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer George R. Lawrence and cartoonist John T. McCutcheon. Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> tomb of King Tutankhamun.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Columbus {{discovered}} the New World for the Kingdom of Castile and Leon in 1492. Private adventurers thereafter entered into {{contracts with the}} Spanish Crown to conquer the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> lands in return for tax revenues {{and the power to}} rule. The Spanish founded Santo Domingo on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in the 1490s. In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's fire balloons. These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc on American soil. Local high school girls made these fire balloons out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used to help these bombs use the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} after its discovery, the {{evolutionary}} origins of Triceratops remained largely obscure. In 1922, the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> Protoceratops was seen as its ancestor by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but many decades passed before additional findings came to light. Recent years have been fruitful for the discovery of several dinosaurs related to ancestors of Triceratops. Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, was described in the late 1990s, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 1790, Manuel Quimper of the Spanish Navy {{set sail}} from Nootka, a {{temporary}} settlement on Vancouver Island, with orders {{to explore the}} <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> Strait of Juan de Fuca. Accompanying Quimper was first-pilot Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, who drew detailed charts during the six-week expedition. Although Quimper's journal of the voyage does not refer to the mountain, one of Haro's manuscript charts includes a sketch of Mount Baker. The Spanish named the snowy volcano , as it reminded them of the white-clad monks of the Carmelite Monastery.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger—several hundred light-years across—and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> extended clusters.|$|E
5|$|In {{defense of}} the text's authenticity, Ariel Shisha-Halevy, Professor of Linguistics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a leading expert on Coptic language, {{concluded}} that the language itself offered no evidence of forgery. King also found examples from a new discovery in Egypt that has {{the same kind of}} grammar, showing that at least one unusual case is not unique. While some experts continue to disagree about the other case, King notes that <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> texts often feature grammatical or spelling oddities which expand our understanding of the Coptic language.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, flashbacks reveal why Hurley is {{hesitant}} {{at his new}} job of distributing food {{found in}} the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> Swan station. Meanwhile, a few castaways become worried that the raft sent by them for rescue may have not {{gone as far as}} they hoped. Jack and Sayid explore the hatch, while Sawyer, Jin, and Michael find out that their captors are from the tail section of the plane..|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals can}} learn {{behaviours}} by imitation, but ants {{may be the}} only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis will lead a naive nest-mate to <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> food by the process of tandem running. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, 1941, Seaborg, {{physicist}} Emilio Segrè and Kennedy {{were able}} to demonstrate not only the presence of plutonium, but that was fissile, an important distinction that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research. Arthur Wahl then began exploring the chemistry of the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> element. In 1966, Room 307 of Gilman Hall on the campus at the Berkeley, where they did this work, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, 2016, Comey {{notified}} Congress {{that the}} FBI started looking into <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> emails. Law enforcement officials stated while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered e-mails related to Clinton's private server on {{a laptop computer}} belonging to Anthony Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion reached in July. The notification was later cited by Clinton {{as a factor in}} her loss in the 2016 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Siddiqui's first {{breakthrough}} in research {{came when he}} successfully isolated an antiarrhythmic agent in 1931 from the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina. He named the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> chemical compound as Ajmaline, after his mentor Hakim Ajmal Khan {{who was one of}} the illustrious practitioners of Unani system of medicine in South Asia. Later on, Siddiqui also extracted other alkaloids from Rauwolfia serpentina that included Ajmalinine, Ajmalicine (C21H24N2O3), Isoajmaline, Neoajmaline, Serpentine and Serpentinine. Many of these are still used worldwide for treatment of mental disorders and cardiovascular ailments, especially as antiarrhythmic agents in Brugada syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The DVD for The Blair Witch Project was {{released}} on October 26, 1999 by Artisan, presented in a 1.33:1 windowboxed aspect ratio and Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. Special features include the documentary Curse of the Blair Witch, a five-minute <b>Newly</b> <b>Discovered</b> Footage, audio commentary, production notes, and cast and crew biographies. The audio commentary presents directors Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sánchez, and producers Rob Cowie, Mike Monello and Gregg Hale, in which they discuss the film's production. The Curse of the Blair Witch feature provides an in-depth look inside {{the creation of the}} film.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Valley is {{surrounded}} by a number of interconnected fault systems and is vulnerable to both moderate and strong earthquakes as well as earthquake swarms. The area was equipped with an array of strong motion seismographs for analyzing the fault mechanisms of nearby earthquakes and seismic characteristics of the sediments in the valley. The earthquake was significant in the scientific community for studies of both fault mechanics and repeat events. Four of the region's known strike-slip faults and one additional <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> normal fault all broke the surface during the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{synthesis}} of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the genetic mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As more was understood about these mechanisms {{it came to be}} held that there was no naturalistic way in which the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> mechanism of heredity could be far-sighted or have a memory of past trends. Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the methodological naturalism of the sciences.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} soon embraced by wider culture. In 1930, Walt Disney was {{apparently}} inspired by {{it when he}} introduced for Mickey Mouse a canine companion named Pluto, although Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen could not confirm why the name was given. In 1941, Glenn T. Seaborg named the newly created element plutonium after Pluto, {{in keeping with the}} tradition of naming elements after <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> planets, following uranium, which was named after Uranus, and neptunium, which was named after Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The rings were {{directly}} imaged when the Voyager 2 spacecraft {{flew through the}} Uranian system in 1986. Two more faint rings were revealed, bringing the total to eleven. The Hubble Space Telescope detected an additional pair of previously unseen rings in 2003–2005, bringing the total number known to 13. The discovery of these outer rings doubled the known radius of the ring system. Hubble also imaged two small satellites for the first time, one of which, Mab, shares its orbit with the outermost <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> μ ring.|$|E
5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E
5|$|British {{palaeontologist}} David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable {{it is that}} Owen, {{who previously}} had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus though it {{could serve as a}} prime example of this hypothesis and its fossil {{was one of the most}} complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even more interesting <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Columbus {{discovered}} the New World for the Kingdom of Castile and Leon in 1492. Private adventurers thereafter entered into {{contracts with the}} Spanish Crown to conquer the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> lands in return for tax revenues {{and the power to}} rule. The Spanish founded Santo Domingo on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in the 1490s. In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. After the discovery of Honduras by Columbus in 1502, no concerted effort to conquer the territory took place until 1524.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the {{identification}} of <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> genes and new techniques for DNA sequencing led to {{the appearance of a}} distinct field of molecular and genomic laboratory medicine; in 1995, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) was formed to give it structure. In 1999, the AMP co-founded The Journal of Medical Diagnostics. Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical Diagnostics in 2001. From 2002 onwards, the HapMap Project aggregated information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human populationthe single nucleotide polymorphismsand their relationship with disease. In 2012, molecular diagnostic techniques for Thalassemia use genetic hybridization tests to identify the specific single nucleotide polymorphism causing an individual's disease.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Michael Faraday, then an {{assistant}} in Davy's lab, successfully liquefied chlorine {{and went on}} to liquefy all known gaseous elements, except for nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. Shortly after, in 1869, Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a gas and coined the term critical point to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases, and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the theoretical framework which allowed the prediction of critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures. By 1908, James Dewar and Heike Kamerlingh Onnes were successfully able to liquefy hydrogen and then <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> helium, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the <b>newly</b> <b>discovered</b> extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E
