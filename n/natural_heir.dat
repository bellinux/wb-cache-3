5|$|Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 {{before he}} could draw up his last will. Since his son Richard had predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, claimed the inheritance. The Dudleys {{maintained}} that Guildford's daughter Jane was the <b>natural</b> <b>heir.</b> They finally won the resulting court case {{with the assistance of}} Thomas Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|Finally on 10 June 1917, Charles Jonnart, the Entente's High Commissioner in Greece, ordered King Constantine {{to give up}} his power. On {{the threat}} of Entente forces landing in Piraeus, the king conceded and agreed to go into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while {{determined}} to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with another member of the royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the <b>natural</b> <b>heir,</b> was ruled out by the Allies because they thought him too pro-German, like his father. Instead, they considered installing Constantine's brother (and Alexander's uncle), Prince George, but he had tired of public life during his difficult tenure as High Commissioner of Crete between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne. As a result, Constantine's second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.|$|E
25|$|Helene Kottanner {{then brought}} the crown {{secretly}} to queen Elisabeth, who was hiding from her enemies at the castle of Komorn. She witnessed {{the birth of}} Ladislaus the Posthumous, who in her eyes was the <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> to the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia.|$|E
25|$|Lady Mount Stephen died in 1933 at Cuckfield, Sussex, England. As Lord Mount Stephen {{had left}} no <b>natural</b> <b>heirs</b> by either of his wives, his titles died with him.|$|R

5000|$|He died on 26 December 1777, imparting a {{few words}} to his friend and confessor, Juan Miguel Kayser. A {{subsequent}} lawsuit between his <b>natural</b> <b>heirs</b> - namely, his cousin Eduardo Wall and family - and those of his confessor, somewhat clouded his memory for a while.|$|R
25|$|By the Union of Sweden and Norway on 4 November 1814 Charles became king of Norway {{under the}} name Carl II of Norway. After eight years as king only by title, Charles died without a <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> on 5 February 1818, and Bernadotte succeeded him as King Charles XIV John.|$|E
25|$|When David is old and bedridden, Adonijah, {{his eldest}} {{surviving}} son and <b>natural</b> <b>heir,</b> declares himself king. Bathsheba and Nathan go to David and obtain his agreement to crown Bathsheba's son Solomon as king, according to David's earlier promise, and the revolt of Adonijah is put down. David dies {{at the age}} of 70 after reigning for 40 years, and on his deathbed counsels Solomon to walk in the ways of God and to take revenge on his enemies.|$|E
25|$|In January 1827, Pathkiller, the Cherokee's {{principal}} {{chief and}} last hereditary chief, and, two weeks later, Charles R. Hicks, Ross's mentor, both died. Ross, {{as president of}} the National Committee and Major Ridge, as speaker of the National Council, were responsible for the affairs of the tribe. In a letter dated February 23, 1827, to Colonel Hugh Montgomery, the Cherokee agent, Ross wrote that with the death of Hicks, he had assumed responsibility for all public business of The Nation. Charles Hicks' brother William served briefly as interim chief until a permanent chief could be elected. Although he believed he was the <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> to his brother's position, William Hicks had not impressed the tribe with his abilities. A majority of the people knew that during the year Ross, not Hicks, had taken care of all of the mundane business of the tribe. On October 17, 1828 the Cherokee elected John Ross as principal chief.|$|E
50|$|The Tianqi Emperor died in 1627 and was {{succeeded by}} his fifth and sole {{surviving}} brother, Zhu Youjian, {{because he had}} no sons to succeed him. Zhu Youjian was enthroned as the Chongzhen Emperor. As both the Tianqi Emperor's daughters died early too, it seems that there are no <b>natural</b> <b>heirs</b> from the emperor left alive.|$|R

I give you my honour, my account in bank is under $20,000." ...|$|R
50|$|The Denham baronetcy {{was created}} for Sir William Denham, Master of the Mint for Scotland; he had {{purchased}} the estate of Westshield from the Earl of Carnwath. He had no children, and the patent of the baronetcy permitted him to assign the baronetcy, in default of <b>natural</b> <b>heirs.</b> In 1711, he entailed his property and title {{to the children of}} his sisters, as follows.|$|R
500|$|In Scotland, James' Catholicism {{was less}} {{important}} than his rights as the Stuart heir to the Scottish throne. His unpopularity in England meant in 1681 {{he was sent to}} Edinburgh as Lord High Commissioner where he was warmly received. In August, the Scottish Parliament passed the Succession Act confirming the divine right of kings, the rights of the <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> 'regardless of religion,' the duty of all to swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. It went beyond ensuring James's succession to the Scottish throne by stating the aim was also to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the fatall and dreadfull consequences of a civil war.' Using the Scottish Parliament to bypass resistance in the English House of Commons was a policy continued by James.|$|E
500|$|At {{the chaotic}} August 1968 Democratic National Convention, Mayor of Chicago Richard J. Daley {{and some other}} party factions feared that Hubert Humphrey could not unite the party, and so {{encouraged}} Ted Kennedy to make himself available for a draft. The 36-year-old Kennedy {{was seen as the}} <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> to his brothers, and [...] "Draft Ted" [...] movements sprang up from various quarters and among delegates. Thinking that he was only being seen as a stand-in for his brother and that he was not ready for the job himself, and getting an uncertain reaction from McCarthy and a negative one from Southern delegates, Kennedy rejected any move to place his name before the convention as a candidate for the nomination. He also declined consideration for the vice-presidential spot. George McGovern remained the symbolic standard-bearer for Robert's delegates instead.|$|E
2500|$|Charles has {{expressed}} scepticism that his father's genuine {{intention was to}} disinherit him dynastically, [...] "Without doubt, he had a mood swing, exploited by conservative elements in his entourage with whom I have long clashed.... I am fighting so that my family ceases to be the victim of attempted manipulation." [...] Moreover, Prince Charles denies {{that his father had}} the authority, by law or tradition, to exclude him from the order of succession: [...] "Even if I accept their premise, referring me to the Senatus Consultus of Napoleon III, divorce did not exist under the Second Empire, so it cannot be taken into account for the succession.... Moreover, the hypocrisy of this argument is exposed by the dates: My father's will was written in May 1996. I only re-married in October. All that matters is the Bonaparte tradition, which makes the eldest son the <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> of his father." ...|$|E
50|$|Initially {{he was a}} {{follower}} of George Grenville's faction but he increasingly lined up as a supporter of Lord North and, in 1769, he made this alliance formal. Then, in 1769, Lady Elizabeth Germain died without <b>natural</b> <b>heirs,</b> and left her estates to him. This not only improved his finances, it also gave him the chance to take that name formally. After 1770, {{he was known as}} Lord George Germain.|$|R
50|$|The {{status of}} women was {{generally}} {{equal to that of}} men. However, in case of a divorce, the wife was granted only one-fourth of her own property, the rest being kept by the husband. In case the wife was involved in a serious crime such as theft or adultery, she had to relinquish all rights over her property. Adoption was allowed, and the adopted children had same rights as the <b>natural</b> <b>heirs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{signing of}} the Chanyuan Treaty {{was the first time}} that the Liao forced the Song, who {{considered}} themselves the <b>natural</b> <b>heirs</b> to the Central Kingdom (Zhong Yuan), to recognize them as peers. This relationship lasted until 1125, when the Song broke the treaty by inviting the Jurchens (later known as Manchus) to attack the Liao. The Jurchen attack in fact brought an end to both the Liao and the Northern Song relationship.|$|R

Of {{the name and}} blood of Effingham, neither has a {{relative}} nearer than the other, for, though but cousins in the third degree, our family is so small as to render the husband, in this case, the <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> of the wife, and the wife the <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> of the husband. Now your father proposes that his estates be valued, and that my father settle on you a sum of equal amount, which his wealth, will fully enable him to do, and that I become the possessor in reversion, of the lands that {{would otherwise have been}} yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then,' {{said the}} Ambassador, 'you may hold it as certain that those parchments {{give you some}} {{advantage}} which he hears, since {{he is willing to}} purchase it at so heavy a price. Otherwise he himself would be the <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> of those lands.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'His {{father died}} in debt,' he said; 'the whole {{property}} is mortgaged, and the sole chance for the <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the creditor's heart, {{that he may be}} inclined to deal leniently towards him.' ...|$|E
50|$|Lord Brooke left no <b>natural</b> <b>heirs,</b> and {{his senior}} (Brooke) barony passed to his cousin and adopted son, Robert Greville (1608-1643), {{who took the}} side of Parliament part in the English Civil War, and {{defeated}} the Royalists in a skirmish at Kineton in August 1642. Robert was killed during the siege of Lichfield on 2 March 1643, having survived the elder Greville by only fifteen years. His other barony (Willoughby de Broke) was inherited by his sister Margaret who married Sir Richard Verney.|$|R
50|$|The first Indian war of Independence, {{referred}} to as ‘The Mutiny’ by the British, as told by Sri John Lawrence, {{was caused by the}} Cartridge affair. But this is a very shallow reading of the situation. Lord-Dalhousie's forward policy had gone too fast for conservative India; by the ruthless application of the doctrine of lapse (that is, the refusal to all adoption {{in the case of the}} failure of <b>natural</b> <b>heirs</b> to an India ruler) he had rendered the Indian process intensely sullen and suspicious. As a climax to this came the annexation of Oudh.|$|R
5000|$|Dunn had no <b>natural</b> <b>heirs</b> {{and left}} his fortune to charity. In his will, dated 4 November 1908, Dunn {{prescribed}} that his inheritance {{had to be made}} available for the advancement of Christianity and the benefit of children and young people, for the support of hospitals, as well as [...] "to alleviate human suffering, to encourage education and promote emigration". Dunn allotted about half his capital himself and created the Dunn Chair of New Testament Theology at Westminster College, Cambridge. The settlement of the rest of his inheritance he left to his trustees.|$|R

"He {{had been}} most {{unjustly}} disinherited," [...] he said, [...] "by his own father--his brother's will had repaired the disgrace, {{if not the}} injury, by leaving the wreck of his property to Frank, the <b>natural</b> <b>heir,</b> and he was determined the bequest should take effect." ...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt {{from the}} introduction: Placing {{contemporary}} design within an historical framework is not easy. While a few prominent designers {{look like the}} <b>natural</b> <b>heirs</b> to the modern movement—one thinks of Jonathan Ive, whose work wins praise from Dieter Rams—much contemporary design finds its inspiration elsewhere; in the imitation of natural forms and processes; in objects that many modernists would have regarded as kitsch; in rituals such as the Japanese tea ceremony; and {{in the sort of}} cultural enquiry more usually associated with fine art. How are design historians to make sense of this variety, and what are the implications for our research agenda...|$|R
50|$|The Ossian Wilbur Goss Reading Room is a {{historic}} library building at 188 Elm Street in the Lakeport village of Laconia, New Hampshire. The architecturally eclectic single-story brick building was designed by Boston architect Willard P. Adden and built in 1905-06 after {{the collection of the}} former Lakeport library was moved to the recently built Gale Memorial Library in the center of Laconia. Its construction was funded by a bequest from Ossian Wilbur Goss, a local doctor who had died without <b>natural</b> <b>heirs.</b> The building officially became a branch of the Laconia library system in 1909, and continues to administered in part by trustees of Goss's legacy.|$|R
60|$|When Nature {{should have}} {{terminated}} the headship of the Empire-Kingdom, she, as <b>natural</b> <b>heir,</b> would creep southward through the German-speaking provinces. Thus Austria, of course kept in ignorance of her neighbour's ultimate aims, had to extend towards the south. She had been barred in her western movement {{by the rise}} of the Irredentist party in Italy, and consequently had to withdraw behind the frontiers of Carinthia, Carniola, and Istria.|$|E
60|$|To begin with, {{almost all}} the {{shareholders}} in the affair had perished by the stern decree of Providence, {{and he was the}} <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> of their interests. In other words, the treasure, if it was recovered, was henceforth his property. Further, when they came to hear the story, the Government would set down Brant's fortune as hopelessly lost, so that the galling competition from which he had suffered so much was at an end.|$|E
6000|$|... "In that case," [...] said I, {{having taken}} {{two or three}} minutes for consideration,--"in that case, I presume the {{property}} would be confiscated by law, and would go to his <b>natural</b> <b>heir.</b> Now if his <b>natural</b> <b>heir</b> be then your wife, it will be just the same as though the property were yours." [...] Young Grundle shook his head. [...] "I don't know what more you would want. At any rate, there is no more for you to get." [...] I confess that at that moment the idea of my boy's chance of succeeding with the heiress did present itself to my mind. According to what my wife had said, Jack would have jumped at the girl with just what she stood up in; and had sworn to his mother, when he had been told that morning about the kiss behind the door, that he would knock that brute's head off his shoulders before many days were gone by. Looking at the matter merely on behalf of Jack, it appeared to me that Little Christchurch would, in that case, be quite safe, let Crasweller be deposited,--or run away to Sydney.|$|E
60|$|Some of the hostiles {{think that}} Mrs. Eddy's idea in {{protecting}} this {{property in the}} interest of her heirs, and in accumulating a great money fortune, is, that she may leave her <b>natural</b> <b>heirs</b> well provided for when she goes. I think it is a mistake. I think she is of late years giving herself large concern about only one interest-her power and glory, and the perpetuation and worship of her Name--with a capital N. Her Church is her pet heir, and I think it will get her wealth. It is the torch which is to light the world and the ages with her glory.|$|R

50|$|The {{foundation}} of the Editorial Galaxia in 1950, publishing house promoting Galician culture and Galician language, was a visible act of resistance. Clandestine organizations supporting the cause of Marxism (as an opposition to the dictator) flourished in the 1950s and 1960s following the example of Editorial Galaxia and {{taking advantage of a}} timid relaxation of the dictatorial regime. Those new organizations and movements openly labelled themselves as nationalist, seeing themselves as the <b>natural</b> <b>heirs</b> of the early Galicianists (for example the Galician People's Union (UPG) was founded by some old Galicianists among other new members). All those organizations would claim Alfonso Daniel Rodríguez Castelao's classic work, Sempre en Galiza (1944), as the ideological cornerstone for Galician contemporary nationalism and even for their own foundational principles.|$|R
