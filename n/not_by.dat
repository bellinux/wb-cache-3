5|$|Bulls and Bears, a farce {{performed}} at Drury Lane on 2 December 1715, {{was attributed to}} Cibber but was never published. The Dramatic Works of Colley Cibber, Esq. (London, 1777) includes a play called Flora, or Hob in the Well, but it is <b>not</b> <b>by</b> Cibber. Hob, or the Country Wake. A Farce. By Mr. Doggett was attributed to Cibber by William Chetwood in his General History of the Stage (1749), but John Genest in Some Account of the English Stage (1832) thought it was by Thomas Doggett. Other plays attributed to Cibber but probably <b>not</b> <b>by</b> him include Cinna's Conspiracy, {{performed at}} Drury Lane on 19 February 1713, and The Temple of Dullness of 1745.|$|E

Since (see divisibility rule for a refresher) 2135 is <b>not</b> divisible <b>by</b> 2, it is <b>not</b> divisible <b>by</b> 4; since 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 11 and it is <b>not</b> divisible <b>by</b> 3 (11 is <b>not</b> divisible <b>by</b> 3), it is <b>not</b> divisible <b>by</b> 15. Then only 7 is left; and, indeed: 305 times 7 is 2135.|$|R

5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but <b>not</b> <b>by</b> eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again. However the fortress, though <b>not</b> <b>by</b> then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E

The defense also attempted to attribute Farrar's poisoning to Tim, who did much of the cooking in the household.|$|E

5|$|According to Mifune, in 1904 Maeda lost to Yoshitake Yoshio by hane goshi, after {{defeating}} three adversaries in succession, but in {{a following}} tsukinami-shiai defeated eight adversaries {{in a row and}} was awarded the rank of 4th dan (yondan). Mifune also states that Maeda {{was one of the most}} vigorous promoters of judo, although <b>not</b> <b>by</b> teaching the art, instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines. Maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike, throwing them as if in real combat. He reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students, but it was often misunderstood and frightened many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.|$|E
5|$|After George Lazenby {{left the}} series, {{producers}} Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli tested other actors, but studio United Artists wanted Sean Connery back, paying a then-record $1.25 million salary {{for him to}} return. The producers were inspired by Goldfinger; as with that film, Guy Hamilton was hired to direct, and Shirley Bassey performs vocals on the title theme song. Locations included Las Vegas, California, Amsterdam and Lufthansa's hangar in Germany. Diamonds Are Forever was a commercial success, but received criticism for its humorous camp tone. The film marked the final appearance of the SPECTRE organization (though <b>not</b> <b>by</b> name) in Eon's Bond films until the 2015 film of the same name.|$|E

5|$|Ain't is a {{contraction}} for am not, is not, are not, has not, {{and have}} not in the common English language vernacular. In some dialects ain't is also used as a contraction of do not, does not, and did not. The development of ain't for {{the various forms of}} to be not, to have not, and to do not occurred independently, at different times. The usage of ain't for the forms of to be not was established by the mid-18th century, and for the forms of to have <b>not</b> <b>by</b> the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Although {{named the}} Jersey Act by a {{critical}} foreign press, after Lord Jersey, the new regulation {{did not have}} the force of law as it was promulgated by the registration authorities of the Thoroughbred horse, <b>not</b> <b>by</b> the United Kingdom government. Nor was it promulgated by the Jockey Club, which had no authority over registration, only over racing matters. The regulation required that any horse registered in the General Stud Book trace in every line to a horse that had already been registered in the General Stud Book, effectively excluding most American-bred Thoroughbreds.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a source of law.

Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
