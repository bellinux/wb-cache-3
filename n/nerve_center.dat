25|$|Despite its fraternal {{and local}} beginnings, B'nai B'rith spoke out for Jewish rights early {{in its history}} and used its growing {{national}} chain of lodges {{as a way to}} exercise political influence on behalf of world Jewry. In 1851, for example, it circulated petitions urging Secretary of State Daniel Webster to demand the end of Jewish disabilities in Switzerland, during on-going trade negotiations. Into the 1920s the B'nai B'rith continued in its political work by joining in Jewish delegations and lobbying efforts through which American Jews sought to influence public policy, both domestic and foreign. B'nai B'rith also {{played a crucial role in}} transnational Jewish politics. The later spread of the organization around the world made it a <b>nerve</b> <b>center</b> of intra-Jewish communication and mutual endeavor.|$|E
25|$|Formidable {{barriers}} frustrated Albanian leaders' {{efforts to}} instill in their people an Albanian rather than an Ottoman identity. Divided into four vilayets, Albanians had no common geographical or political <b>nerve</b> <b>center.</b> The Albanians' religious differences forced nationalist leaders to give the national movement a purely secular character that alienated religious leaders. The most significant factor uniting the Albanians, their spoken language, lacked a standard literary form and even a standard alphabet. Each of the three available choices, the Latin, Cyrillic, and Arabic scripts, implied different political and religious orientations opposed by one or another element of the population. In 1878 there were no Albanian-language schools in the most developed of the areas claimed by the League, Gjirokastër, Berat, and Vlorë—where schools conducted classes either in Turkish or in Greek.|$|E

500|$|Coffin began {{sheltering}} fugitive {{slaves in}} his Indiana {{home during the}} winter of 1826–27. Word of Coffin's activities quickly spread throughout the community.

The group formed a more formal route to move the fugitives from stop to stop until they reached Canada. Coffin referred to the system as the [...] "mysterious road" [...] and as time progressed the number of escaping slaves increased. Coffin estimated that, on average, he helped one hundred escape annually. The Coffin home became the convergent point of three major escape routes from Madison and New Albany, Indiana, and Cincinnati, Ohio. On some occasions when runaways gathered at his home, two wagons were required to transport them further north. Coffin moved the escaping slaves to the next stops along the route during the night.

Annually, some 850 students, faculty, and staff volunteer more than 16,000 community service hours. The Princeton Review has described the Meelia Center as [...] "the <b>nerve</b> <b>center</b> of Saint Anselm's bustling service community", adding that [...] "the center, according to the school, 'employs nearly sixty student service leaders, who in turn recruit, place, and support over 200 volunteers and 210 service learners each semester who perform weekly service in over thirty community agencies. An additional 350 volunteers serve in occasional one-day service events. In 2010, the Meelia Center alone accounted for the coordination of 20,000 service hours by Saint Anselm students. New students are introduced to the service commitment through the New Student Day of Service. As part of freshman orientation, students are sent in teams of thirty to partnership sites and other community non-profit agencies. Upperclassmen work throughout the summer to organize these orientation events that involve anywhere from fifteen to twenty sites around New Hampshire.|$|E
