50|$|Some {{national}} authorities keep statistics on tramway incidents. An {{example of an}} authority collecting accident and incident reports from {{national authorities}} is the European Railway Agency. The Agency has a public safety database on railway licences, certificates, safety indicators, <b>national</b> <b>safety</b> <b>rules,</b> and accident investigations. In the European Union, the safety of railways has been regulated with directives, which also require e.g. the collection of common safety indicator statistics from member countries. In the EU, common safety methods (CSMs) and common safety targets (CSTs) have been set for European railways.|$|E
30|$|The European {{rail freight}} industry, {{developed}} on a domestic focus with powerful incumbent railway undertakings, {{has not yet}} developed the necessary collaborative or integrated approach needed {{for the kind of}} total pan-European transport chain widely practiced by maritime shipping lines, for example. There are various reasons for this, including the fact that the multiple actors in multimodal transport chains have, at times, opposing interests. This, coupled with the high level of entry barriers faced by private new entrants, has failed to generate the development of industrialised, pan‐European services to respond to market needs. Moreover, no modern studies of this market have been conducted to evaluate its evolution, anticipate the needed revolution, or suggest new business models suitable to face the challenges due to, among other things, the protectionist attitude of the incumbents towards their market share. The bundling of the various categories of traffic (bulk, containers), the creation of efficient nodes to de-bottleneck by optimising the use of existing infrastructure, the development of fully interoperable Trans‐European Rail Freight Corridors with a powerful governance platform, and coordination with national infrastructure managers, are all progressing too slowly. Overcoming the patchwork of <b>national</b> <b>safety</b> <b>rules,</b> through powerful action by the European Railway Agency (ERA), is progressively arriving at an urgent need to increase the pace. All of these elements have hindered the introduction of pan-European rail services.|$|E

50|$|Berringer was {{expected}} to be selected in the 1996 NFL draft, but he {{died in a plane crash}} just two days before the draft. A private pilot, Berringer was in control of a 1946 Piper Cub over Raymond, Nebraska, when the aircraft went down in an alfalfa field. The <b>National</b> Transportation <b>Safety</b> Board <b>ruled</b> that the probable cause of the crash was the fuel valve not being fully open, resulting in fuel starvation, engine failure, and a subsequent loss of control of the airplane. http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20001208X05520&ntsbno=CHI96FA135&akey=1.

50|$|The <b>National</b> Transportation <b>Safety</b> Board <b>ruled</b> {{that the}} {{derailment}} {{was caused by}} the train's engineer (driver) becoming distracted by other radio transmissions and losing situational awareness, and said {{that it would have been}} prevented by positive train control, a computerized speed-limiting system that was operational elsewhere on the Northeast Corridor, but whose activation at the wreck site had been delayed due to regulatory requirements. The track in question was also not equipped with ATC (automatic train control), an older and simpler system which had been operational for years on the southbound track of the curve at which the derailment occurred, and which also would have limited the train's speed entering the curve. Shortly after the derailment, Amtrak completed ATC installation on the northbound track.|$|R

50|$|Born in Richmond, Virginia, Johnson {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} near Cleveland, Ohio. The <b>National</b> Transportation <b>Safety</b> Board <b>ruled</b> the {{probable}} cause was pilot error, specifically attempting to fly visually in unsuitable weather and structurally overloading the airplane. He drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1950-1952 and 1955-1966 seasons with 33 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races in all of those years but the first two. He finished in the top ten 9 times, with his best finish in 3rd position, in 1959 at Trenton. Late in his career, Johnson frequently came to Indianapolis without an assigned car only to be signed on to a team which needed a driver to put a struggling car in the race. In 1965, Johnson became the last person on the track in the Indianapolis 500 mile race with a naturally aspirated Offenhauser in a roadster. Johnson was flagged to finish in 10th place. Johnson was a high school acquaintance of 1950 Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny Parsons.|$|R

40|$|Every {{technology}} and activity has <b>safety</b> <b>rules,</b> {{which are usually}} formulated explicitly, taught to those operating {{in the system and}} imposed on them. <b>Safety</b> <b>rules</b> also determine liability after accidents. Yet there is very little systematic scientific or management literature on how to devise and manage <b>safety</b> <b>rules.</b> This paper uses a simple framework to draw together what is known of good and bad practice in this area, particularly in deciding what rules should be explicitly formulated and imposed. It draws on the literature on violations, on rule learning and on organizational control. The paper concludes with a case study of <b>safety</b> <b>rules</b> in the railways, derived from a larger European study of <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> management for railway operations. It shows that the nature of the system dynamics and the current communications within railway operations result in a largely open loop operation of the system. This makes it vulnerable to any form of deviation from strictly defined operations. <b>Safety</b> <b>rules</b> are part of the apparatus to render the behaviour of the various people in the system sufficiently predictable that this openloop operation can succeed in a large proportion of situations. However this requires that adherence to rules is very strict and has great problems coping with any deviations, even those required to respond to situations which cannot be dealt with following the existing rules. This requirement conflicts with much of the available literature on organisational control and high reliability organisations. However, the more interactive derivation of rules specific to the range of system conditions requires a far greater communication between system operators than the railway system currently requires. The room for manoeuvre in optimising <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> use in railways is therefore currently limited. 1...|$|R
