5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and <b>niche</b> requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological <b>niche.</b> A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared <b>niche</b> occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the <b>niche</b> is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E
5|$|Images of the parshvadevatas (attendant deities) {{are placed}} in the central niches of the outer wall (bada) on three sides: the eight-armed Durga slaying Mahishasura on the south; the six-armed goddess Chamunda {{standing}} on Shiva on the west and an empty <b>niche</b> on the north, which probably had a goddess figure that was stolen. The lintel of the attendant deity <b>niche</b> has Gaja Lakshmi figurines. The frames of the niches are decorated with scrollwork and kirtimukha motifs and two female attendants accompany each <b>niche.</b> The uppermost part of the outer wall has ten horizontal mouldings, ornate with scrollwork, kirtimukha and lotus and floral motifs. Within the vimana lies the garbhagriha (sanctum), which is topped with a pancharatha-style, curvilinear temple pinnacle.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions {{fit in the}} <b>niche</b> between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs).|$|E
5|$|Monument 25 is {{a heavily}} eroded relief {{sculpture}} of a figure seated in a <b>niche.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main edifice at {{the site}} was also built from red sandstone, and is {{decorated}} with white marble inlay. The prayer chamber has a central arched <b>niche</b> with five niches flanking it which are about one third {{the size of the}} central <b>niche.</b> The mosque has three marble domes, the largest of which is located in the centre of the mosque, and which is flanked by two smaller domes.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposite}} side altar {{on the right}} side houses another early 19th century image of the Nuestra Señora de la Consolación (Our Lady of Consolation) in the central <b>niche.</b> Joining the Marian image are Augustinian Saints: Saint Augustine, Saint Monica and Saint Nicolas de Tolentino. Another smaller neoclassical retablo built in 1875 {{on the right side}} houses the image of Saint Joseph in the main <b>niche</b> and Saint Isidore.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} other {{consoles}} released during the seventh generation time period. Generally, {{they are either}} <b>niche</b> products or less powerful.|$|E
5|$|Whale was cremated per {{his request}} and his ashes were interred in the Columbarium of Memory at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale. Because of his habit of {{periodically}} revising his date of birth, his <b>niche</b> lists the incorrect date of 1893. When his longtime companion David Lewis died in 1987, his executor and Whale biographer James Curtis had his ashes interred in a <b>niche</b> across from Whale's.|$|E
5|$|Although Itanium did attain {{limited success}} in the <b>niche</b> market of {{high-end}} computing, Intel had originally hoped it would find broader acceptance {{as a replacement for}} the original x86 architecture.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{evolutionary}} {{developmental biology}} (eco-evo-devo) integrates research from developmental biology and ecology {{to examine their}} relationship with evolutionary theory. Researchers study concepts and mechanisms such as developmental plasticity, epigenetic inheritance, genetic assimilation, <b>niche</b> construction and symbiosis.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{remarked that}} here Darwin {{anticipated}} the modern {{concept of an}} ecological <b>niche.</b> He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In September 2005, Pope Benedict XVI blessed a newly {{installed}} {{statue of}} Josemaría Escrivá {{placed in an}} outside wall <b>niche</b> of St Peter's Basilica, a place for founders of Catholic organizations.|$|E
5|$|Monument 15 {{is a large}} boulder with an Olmec-style relief {{sculpture}} of the head, shoulders and arms of an anthropomorphic figure emerging from a shallow <b>niche,</b> the arms bent inwards at the elbow. The back of the boulder is carved with the hindquarters of a feline, probably a jaguar.|$|E
5|$|New Age spirituality {{has led to}} a {{wide array}} of {{literature}} on the subject and an active <b>niche</b> market, with books, music, crafts, and services in alternative medicine available at New Age stores, fairs, and festivals.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, {{but there seems to}} be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location that will help them adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized <b>niche</b> to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental <b>niche.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{compounds}} {{of barium}} find only <b>niche</b> applications, {{limited by the}} toxicity of Ba2+ ions (barium carbonate is a rat poison), {{which is not a}} problem for the insoluble BaSO4.|$|E
5|$|Population ecology {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of species populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment. A population consists of individuals {{of the same species}} that live, interact, and migrate through the same <b>niche</b> and habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} evolutionary synthesis (EES) is {{an extension}} of the Modern Synthesis of evolution which revisits the relative importance of different factors at play in evolutionary theory. EES includes concepts and mechanisms such as multilevel selection theory, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, <b>niche</b> construction and evolvability.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} Santa Cruz, the town's patron, {{was located in}} a small shrine {{on top of another}} {{containing}} the wooden statue of San Vicente Ferrer, the town's secondary patron, on the central <b>niche</b> of the retablo-mayor. Above the central <b>niche</b> was the image of the Holy Trinity. On both sides, above the two other niches on the main altar, were paintings of the allegories of the Finding and Veneration of the True Cross. The rest of the retablos in the transept contained images of saints.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} facade, oriented {{southwest and}} located behind the portico, was built {{together with the}} stone church built by the Jesuits in 1727. The facade is simply designed with its upper half hidden by an extended choir loft which houses an 1824 pipe organ. A way of glazed blue tiles connects the facade and the portico. The portico was added as an extension to the facade in 1875 by the Augustinian Recollects. An inscription on the portico's pediment based on the year of construction of the facade (1875) was invisible due to church renovations. Two religious images, both dated 1885, is found on the portico's niches: St. Joseph and the child Jesus on the uppermost <b>niche</b> and the Immaculate Conception, patroness, on the central <b>niche.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Boise, Idaho. She claims that while growing up she was painfully shy as a child. Wilson found her <b>niche</b> in many school activities, {{including}} cheerleading, dance, and was very competitive in track and field.|$|E
5|$|Within {{parallel}} computing, {{there are}} specialized parallel devices that remain <b>niche</b> areas of interest. While not domain-specific, {{they tend to}} be applicable to only a few classes of parallel problems.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the hall}} {{is a second}} hall, forming part of the Duchess' suite of rooms. An oratory in the south wall, {{overlooking}} the courtyard, contains a piscina and credence <b>niche.</b> The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to the walkway along the curtain wall. The timber ceiling of the Duchess' hall, and the timber floors and roof above, are of the 1880s. The upper parts of the stonework are among the repairs dating from 1580.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split {{does not seem to}} have been driven by competition for resources but instead by the fact that each species adopted a different ecological <b>niche</b> and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E
5|$|Alligators {{have created}} a <b>niche</b> in wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of {{vegetation}} that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral {{to the survival of}} aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. The alligators then feed upon some of the animals that come to the hole.|$|E

5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it never took {{off as a}} distribution method due to worries {{about the quality of}} the cartridges and piracy. Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and <b>niche</b> products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E
5|$|Among ectoparasites, bats carry fleas and mites, {{as well as}} {{specific}} parasites such as bat bugs and bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae). However, {{they are one of}} the few non-aquatic mammalian orders that do not host lice. This may be due to competition from more effective, specialized parasites which occupy the same <b>niche.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among pterodactyloids {{a greater}} {{variation}} in diet is present. Pteranodontia contained many piscivorous taxa, such as ornithocheirans, boreopterids, pteranodontids and nyctosaurids. Some amount of <b>niche</b> partitioning {{seems to have}} been present: ornithocheirans and the later nyctosaurs were aerial dip-feeders like today's frigatebirds, while boreopterids were freshwater diving animals similar to cormorants or Platanista river dolphins, and pteranodonts were pelagic plunge-divers akin to boobies and gannets. The biggest exception among this group are the istiodactylids, which were likely primarily scavengers.|$|E
5|$|An {{octagonal}} baptistry {{connected to}} the near the altar of Saint Mary Magdalene in the gospel transept was constructed in 1853. Inside the baptistry is an earlier image of San Juan Bautista, a baptismal font and an unusual retablo built in 1852 housing the Santo Entierro in a glass coffin and the Nuestra Señora de los Dolores in the central <b>niche.</b>|$|E
5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top of {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, though there is some evidence of <b>niche</b> differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E
5|$|As of mid-2011, direct green {{laser diodes}} at 510nm and 500nm have become {{generally}} available, although the price remains relatively prohibitive for widespread public use. The efficiency of these lasers (peak 3%) {{compared to that}} of DPSS green lasers (peak 35%) may also be limiting adoption of the diodes to <b>niche</b> uses.|$|E
5|$|Bada Gumbad was {{constructed}} in 1490 CE, and {{is believed to have}} the earliest constructed full dome of any building in Delhi. Its construction is generally attributed to Sikandar Lodhi. A mihrab (prayer <b>niche)</b> in the Friday mosque (Jama Masjid) of the Bara Gumbad gives the date of construction as 900 AH (Anno Hegirae) of the Islamic lunar calendar.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain <b>niche</b> uses as antiepileptics.|$|E
5|$|Colonial {{architecture}} characterizes {{many buildings}} in Darjeeling, exemplified by several mock Tudor residences, Gothic churches, the Raj Bhawan, Planters' Club and various educational institutions. Buddhist monasteries showcase the pagoda style architecture. Darjeeling {{is regarded as}} a centre of music and a <b>niche</b> for musicians and music admirers. Singing and playing musical instruments are common pastimes among the resident population, who take pride in the traditions and role of music in cultural life.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are often}} {{sympatric}} with mouse lemurs, such as M.murinus, {{though they are}} typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the Marosalaza forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages <b>niche</b> differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E
