25|$|Classical {{liberalism}} in Britain {{developed from}} Whiggery and radicalism, was also {{heavily influenced by}} French physiocracy and represented a new political ideology. Whiggery had become a dominant ideology following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and {{was associated with the}} defence of Parliament, upholding {{the rule of law and}} defending landed property. The origins of rights were seen as being in an ancient constitution, which had existed from time immemorial. These rights, which some Whigs considered to include freedom of the press and freedom of speech, were justified by custom rather than by natural rights. They believed that the power of the executive had to be constrained. While they supported limited suffrage, they saw voting as a privilege rather than as a right.

Founded by José Francisco Basora, a Puerto Rican revolutionary and friend of Ramón Emeterio Betances, the group had connections within the wealthy sugar industry in the larger antille. Bonds for quantities of 100, 500 and 1,000 pesos were printed between June 1 and November 1, 1869, in order to cover the expenses of the two planned revolutions. On August 17, 1869, the board issued notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 pesos, these were produced to establish an affordable alternative to the bonds. All of these issues circulated throughout North and South America {{as well as the}} Caribbean. Although they were widespread in the Spanish processions, their use was kept clandestine to avoid imprisonment by the royal authorities.
