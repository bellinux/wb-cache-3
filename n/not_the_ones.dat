25|$|At {{the height}} of the century, the heavy cavalry was already at its peak, {{although}} it showed signs of declining tendencies. The striking power and the ability to charge without backup made them capable of forcing a decisive outcome in most battles. Although they were rarely deployed on their own, if they were, they would take square formations. Such turning points occurred at the Battle of Breadfield (1479). Usually, they made up one-sixth of the army and, with mercenary knights, were in the majority. Their armament was well prepared and of high quality except for the noble banners. This stands for proprietary arms, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> provided by the king.|$|E

They reach the bank and halt the transfer. Wesley arrives, and as a delaying tactic, shoots both officers and Ershon in their arms. Mauch finally arrives with police backup, rescuing the two and arresting Ershon for his embezzlement, and Wesley for multiple counts of murder. Ershon's arrest leads to a stock market crash and the subsequent federal bailout of Lendl Global. Terry marries Francine, and Allen reunites with his wife.

25|$|Manifest Destiny was {{the idea}} that it was God’s will for the United States to expand because it is Protestant, democratic, and white. It {{promoted}} the notion of American racial superiority, casting all nonwhites, including Native Americans, Mexicans, and blacks, as inferior beings. John L. O'Sullivan coined the phrase in 1845, first using it in his newspaper, the United States Democratic Review. Manifest destiny soon became an important element of American political rhetoric. It called for the expansion of the United States and was a justification used by southerners for extending slavery. An example of this was the annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk used the argument of manifest destiny to support his intentions of claiming Texas. In 1845, Texas entered the United States as the fifteenth slave state. Since whites were seen as superior beings, slavery didn’t seem like such a brutal practice. The whites were <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> suffering, and that is all that mattered.|$|E

Hence, I wonder whether they were police personnel or cadres of the Bajrang Dal." [...] Another resident, Marcel Henry Ferao, alleged that [...] "prohibitory orders were imposed on those who were inside the church compound {{and not on the}} Bajrang Dal cadres who were outside the church compound and were pelting stones". Dinal Saldanha of Kulshekar alleged that the police used tear-gas shells which were past their expiry date on the premises, and that exposure to the gas resulted in problems with her eyesight. Many Catholic women reported incidents of police violence to the Deputy Commissioner M. Maheshwar Rao and other government officials, revealing their bruises, and demanding that action be taken against them.|$|E

In 1259 the Provisions of Westminster ordained that it {{shall not be}} lawful for men of religion to enter the fee of anyone without the license of the lord of whom the land is held. The provisions were first considered law, then not rigorously enforced depending on who had political sway: barons or king. Most of the provisions in Westminster were re-enacted by the Statute of Marlborough in 1267, but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> mentioned.

Given its lack of historicity, Carolyn Pressler in her commentary for the Westminster Bible Companion series suggests that readers of Joshua should give priority to its theological message ("what passages teach about God") and be aware of what these would have meant to audiences in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE. Richard Nelson explains: The needs of the centralised monarchy favoured a single story of origins, combining old traditions of an exodus from Egypt, belief in a national god as [...] "divine warrior," [...] and explanations for ruined cities, social stratification and ethnic groups, and contemporary tribes.|$|E
