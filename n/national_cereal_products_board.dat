He re-established his own laboratories, the <b>National</b> <b>Cereal</b> <b>Products</b> Laboratory, with facilities in Washington, D.C. and Manhattan. The address of the Manhattan facility is listed on his WWII draft registration as 156 Chambers Street. He remained as a consultant, however, to the Bureau of Chemistry throughout his lifetime. Jacobs also was retained throughout {{the rest of his life}} by C.F. Mueller Company to oversee the nutritional enrichment of their macaroni, noodles, and pasta products as they developed the nationally distributed brand that is still a recognized leader in the food industry.|$|R

In practical part 15 kinds of <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> were analyzed. In these materials some group parameters - total phenolics, total flavonoids and total antioxidant activity were measured by spectrophotometry. RP-HPLC/UV-VIS method was performed for analysis of selected individual flavonids. The highest content of phenolic compounds was measured in cereals containing fruits (raspberries, blueberries, tropical and red fruit), cacao, crusty fruits (hazel nuts, sunflower seeds) and buckwheat. All <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> contain catechine, epicatechine, catechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, chlorogenic and ferulic acid.

40|$|International audienceA {{database}} {{has been}} compiled with {{the levels of}} important contaminants (mycotoxins, heavy metals and pesticides) measured from 2002 to 2005 in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) grown in Belgium according to the organic and conventional farming systems. Assuming no further change in contaminant levels during cereal processing and during the preparation of foodstuffs, conservative intakes are estimated for the consumers of <b>cereal</b> based <b>products</b> such as flour, bread, breakfast cereals, dough and pastry. The results show that for the consumer of organic foodstuffs, estimated daily intakes are 0. 56 µg deoxynivalenol (DON), 0. 03 µg zearalenone (ZEA), 0. 19 µg Cd, 0. 28 µg Pb and 0. 0006 µg Hg kg- 1 body weight, {{taking into account the}} average contaminant levels in unprocessed grains and the average <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> consumptions in Belgium. For the consumers of conventional foodstuffs, the corresponding estimated daily intakes are 0. 99 µg DON, 0. 06 µg ZEA, 0. 17 µg Cd, 0. 12 µg Pb and 0. 0007 µg Hg kg- 1 bw.

Popular belief is that these <b>cereal</b> <b>products,</b> rich in carbohydrates, produce a high glycaemic response and may not be a contributing factor to the obesity epidemic throughout the world. Recently the food industry has investigated ways of improving the overall nutritional balance of carbohydrate rich foods and focused on increasing their dietary fibre (DF) contents at the expense of readily digestible carbohydrates. It is well documented that dietary fibre is involved in disease prevention and enhanced health of consumers. Moreover, the food industry {{can take advantage of the}} physicochemical properties of fibre to improve the viscosity, texture, sensory characteristics and shelf-life of their products. The focus of this review paper is on the influence of DFs (inulin, fructo-oligofructose, beta-glucans, arabinoxylans and resistant starch) supplementation on the quality and nutritional aspects of common foods containing cereals- pasta, bread, muffins/cakes and extruded snacks.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The South African breakfast market {{consists}} of several brand <b>products</b> for <b>cereal</b> <b>products,</b> {{and some of}} the products are produced locally while others are imported. <b>Cereal</b> <b>products</b> are classified under fast moving consumer goods (FMCG). The majority of the <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> are easy to serve. The following brands are common in South Africa and have been listed according to their popularity with consumers: Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Kellog's Special K, Jungle Oats, Cheerios and Weet Bix. Kellogg's Corn Flakes are made from maize (corn) and provides guidelines daily amounts (GDA) for each of the nutrients. Branding may consist of building an emotional response or cultural response. As consumers are bombarded with a variety of products to meet the same needs, branding provides a way for consumers to reduce their decision-making to consider only those products that they feel are relevant to them or that have met their needs acceptably in the past. If brand loyalty were a random event, there would be no purpose in making it the object of applied scientific enquiry. Verbal reports are insufficient for defining brand loyalty. Such loyalty requires that statements of bias be accompanied by biased purchasing behaviour. The study was conducted to determine factors that influence the consumers to constantly use a particular brand, and prefer it above other <b>cereal</b> <b>products.</b> A literature and empirical study form part of this study. Questionnaires were used as a measuring instrument to determine which factors the consumer considers important in choosing a particular <b>cereal</b> <b>product.</b> Data analysis was done by means of a factor analysis. A brand loyalty framework developed by Moola was used in classifying the brand loyalty influences. To a large extent the research concluded that brand loyalty in the cereal market is similar to that found in bread, coffee and toothpaste (as per mentioned model). However, some differences with regard to the brand loyalty influences have been found. This study did not determine if these differences are related to cereal as FMCG, or the specific consumer market that was analysed. Master...|$|R
