In 2010, a major Korean studio, Myung Films, released a No Gun Ri feature film, A Little Pond, {{written and directed}} by Lee Saang-woo and featuring Song Kang-ho, Moon So-ri and other Korean stars who donated their work. Besides commercial release in South Korea, the movie was screened at international film festivals, including in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London.</b>|$|E
5|$|Speyer {{was born}} on 7 September 1862 in New York City, the second son of German Jewish parents, Gustav Speyer and Sophia Speyer (née Rubino) from Frankfurt. His father was an {{international}} banker with businesses in Frankfurt, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London.</b> Speyer was educated at the Realgymnasium in Frankfurt. On 10 February 1902, in Hamburg, Speyer married the American violinist Leonora von Stosch. They had met at a concert held by Maude Valerie White at which Leonora performed. They had three daughters: Pamela, Leonora, and Vivien.|$|E
5|$|Stigwood and Russell {{decided to}} hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's {{worldwide}} productions, with an undisclosed number performing screen tests in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London.</b> In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at Elstree Studios. Karla DeVito {{was among those who}} auditioned for the role of Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested Liza Minnelli wearing a blonde wig and custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better suited for the role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted Elaine Paige, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed the outlines of the stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on gurneys in white corridors as she is being treated for cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.|$|E

In September 1950 Pan Am {{completed}} the $17.45million purchase of American Overseas Airlines from American Airlines. That month Pan Am ordered 45 Douglas DC-6Bs. The first, Clipper Liberty Bell (N6518C), inaugurated Pan Am's all-tourist class Rainbow service between <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London</b> on May 1, 1952 {{to complement the}} all-first President Stratocruiser service. From June 1954, DC-6Bs began replacing DC-4s on Pan Am's internal German routes.|$|E
25|$|Today, it is {{less likely}} that a sole producer, such as David Merrick or Cameron Mackintosh, backs a production. Corporate {{sponsors}} dominate Broadway, and often alliances are formed to stage musicals, which require an investment of $10 million or more. In 2002, the credits for Thoroughly Modern Millie listed ten producers, and among those names were entities composed of several individuals. Typically, off-Broadway and regional theatres tend to produce smaller and therefore less expensive musicals, and development of new musicals has increasingly taken place outside of <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London</b> or in smaller venues. For example, Spring Awakening, Fun Home and Hamilton were developed Off-Broadway before being launched on Broadway.|$|E
25|$|Following the film's completion, Led Zeppelin had {{a falling}} out with Peter Clifton. Suspecting {{that he had}} 'stolen' negatives of the film, Grant ordered that his house be searched. They did find some footage, but {{this turned out to}} be a {{collection}} of the best 'home movie' footage which Clifton had intended to give to the band members as a gift. Clifton was also annoyed at the decision to remove from the film's credits the names of all the people who had worked on editing, make up and effects. Unlike Massot, however, Clifton was invited to both the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London</b> premieres of the film.|$|E

25|$|The {{loading gauge}} is small {{compared}} to those of newer metro systems (but {{comparable to that of}} early European metros), with capacities of between about 560 and 720 passengers per train on Lines 1–14. Many other metro systems (such as those of <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London)</b> adopted expanded tunnel dimensions for their newer lines (or used tunnels of multiple sizes almost from the outset, in the case of Boston), at the cost of operating incompatible fleets of rolling stock. Paris built all lines to the same dimensions as its original lines. Before the introduction of rubber-tire lines in the 1950s, this common shared size theoretically allowed any Metro rolling stock to operate on any line, but in practice each line was assigned a regular roster of trains.|$|E
25|$|C. The All-Ireland Senior Football Championship is {{the premier}} inter-county competition, contested by 31 of Ireland's 32 {{counties}} (plus <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London).</b> Each county participates {{in their respective}} provincial championship (in Derry's case the Ulster Championship) which operate through a knock-out cup competition format. The winners {{of each of the}} four Provincial Championships earn one of eight places in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. The 28 teams that fail to win their respective provincial championships receive a second opportunity to reach the All-Ireland quarter-finals via the All Ireland Qualifiers. The counties enter the Qualifiers at different stages (depending on how far they reached in their provincial championship). Four teams come through this system and join the four provincial champions in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. See here for more details.|$|E
25|$|The Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet {{opened the}} 10th International Stars of the White Nights Festival with their {{reconstruction}} of La Bayadère at the Mariinsky Theatre on May 31, 2002, with Daria Pavlenko as Nikiya, Elvira Tarasova as Gamzatti, and Igor Kolb as Solor. The production received a mixed {{reaction from the}} St. Petersburg audience, which largely comprised the most prominent persons of the Russian ballet. The celebrated Ballerina of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet Altynai Asylmuratova was seen weeping after the performance, allegedly because of her shock at seeing the ballet presented in this way. When the company included the production on their tours, it caused a sensation around the world, particularly in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London.</b> To date the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet only perform the Vikharev production on special occasions.|$|E

25|$|Citi Capital Advisors (CCA), {{formerly}} Citi Alternative Investments, was a Citi Hedge {{fund that}} offers various investment strategies across multiple asset classes, ranging from market strategies to infrastructure and private equity investing for institutional and high-net-worth investors. Due to US regulations {{as part of}} the Volcker rule to limit bank ownership in hedge funds to no more than 3%, Citi spun off its hedge fund unit with its managers owning {{a significant part of the}} new company. The spin-off of CCA created Napier Park Global Capital, a $6.8 billion hedge fund with more than 100 employees in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London.</b> The new company will be managed by Jim O’Brien and Jonathan Dorfman, who would serve as co-CEOs and were former Citi executives managing CCA. Citigroup will continue to retain a sizable minority position in the new firm, but will slowly withdraw its capital over time by the July 2014 deadline stipulated by the Volcker Rule.|$|E
25|$|Beginning on May 22, 2008, five-days of festivities {{celebrated the}} 125th {{anniversary of the}} bridge's opening. The events kicked-off with a live {{performance}} of the Brooklyn Philharmonic in Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park, followed by special lighting of the bridge's towers and a fireworks display. Other events held during the 125th anniversary celebrations, which coincided with the Memorial Day weekend, included a film series, historical walking tours, information tents, a series of lectures and readings, a bicycle tour of Brooklyn, a miniature golf course featuring Brooklyn icons, and other musical and dance performances. Just before the anniversary celebrations, artist Paul St George installed the Telectroscope, a video link between <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>London,</b> on the Brooklyn side of the bridge. The installation lasted {{for a few weeks}} and permitted viewers in New York to see people looking into a matching telectroscope near London's Tower Bridge.
