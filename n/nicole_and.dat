5|$|<b>Nicole</b> <b>and</b> its {{precursor}} disturbance brought great rainfall {{to much of}} Jamaica over {{a period}} of several days. A maximum of 37.42inches (940mm) was recorded in Belleisle, Westmoreland Parish, from September26 to 30; most other parishes received more than 12in (300mm) during the same period. With a return period of 30years, these quantities tripled the monthly rainfall average for September at several locations. Though the broad-scale wind regime over the island remained gentle, the storm's intense convective bands produced three microburstssmall downdrafts of intense winds. With dozens of river banks and waterways blocked, the worst effects were due to landslides and particularly severe flooding across numerous communities primarily in southern parishes.|$|E

All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called.

Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel.
