2500|$|Seddon {{classified}} {{facial nerve}} injuries into three broad categories: neuropraxia, <b>neurotmesis,</b> and axonotmesis. [...] Neuropraxia {{is the most}} common form of injury associated with Bell’s palsy, and it is characterized by paralysis without a degeneration of the peripheral nerve. [...] Electroneuronography would yield a normal or mildly impaired response, as the nerve fibers are still whole but unresponsive to conscious control. [...] <b>Neurotmesis</b> is regarded as the worst possible outcome, with electroneuronography readings equivalent to a flat line, or no response to stimulation. [...] This represents total degradation of the facial nerve. [...] Lastly, axonotmesis consists of damage to the inner nerve fibers while the outer covering remains whole, and also yields a flat line in response to stimulation. [...] Because of their similar recordings, electroneuronography cannot, by itself, distinguish between the latter two forms of nerve injury.|$|E
50|$|Fourth-degree is {{included}} within Seddon's <b>Neurotmesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurotmesis</b> is {{the most}} serious degree of nerve injury. It {{involves}} the disruption of the nerve and the nerve sheath.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurotmesis</b> is {{the most}} severe lesion with no {{potential}} of full recovery. It occurs on severe contusion, stretch, laceration, or Local Anesthetic Toxicity. The axon and encapsulating connective tissue lose their continuity. The last (extreme) degree of <b>neurotmesis</b> is transsection, but most neurotmetic injuries do not produce gross loss of continuity of the nerve but rather internal disruption of {{the architecture of the}} nerve sufficient to involve perineurium and endoneurium as well as axons and their covering. Denervation changes recorded by EMG are the same as those seen with axonotmetic injury. There is a complete loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function. If the nerve has been completely divided, axonal regeneration causes a neuroma to form in the proximal stump. For <b>neurotmesis,</b> it is better to use a new more complete classification called the Sunderland System.|$|E
50|$|With Seddon's {{classification}} of nerve injuries, {{it is often}} tough to identify whether a particular nerve injury is <b>neurotmesis,</b> or axonotmesis, which has damage to the nerve fibres but preservation of the nerve trunk. Due to the damage involved {{in both of these}} conditions they will both show paralysis of muscles that are supplied by nerves below the site of the lesion, and will have sensory deficits in accordance with the individual nerves that are damaged. The only way to know for sure if a nerve injury is in fact <b>neurotmesis</b> is to allow for the normal progression of nerve regeneration to take place (nerves regenerate at a rate of approximately 2-4 mm/day proximal to the lesion), and if, after that time, there is still profound muscle paralysis and degeneration in these areas, then it is likely to have been a <b>neurotmesis</b> injury.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of <b>neurotmesis</b> include but are {{not limited}} to pain, dysesthesias (uncomfortable sensations), and {{complete}} loss of sensory and motor function of the affected nerve.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a total}} {{severance}} or {{disruption of}} the entire nerve fiber.A peripheral nerve fiber contains an axon (Or long dendrite), myelin sheath (if existence), their schwann cells, and the endoneurium. <b>Neurotmesis</b> may be partial or complete.|$|E
50|$|The classifications {{of nerve}} damage have been {{well-defined}} by Sir Herbert Seddon and Sunderland {{and are still}} in use today. The table at the right details the forms (neurapraxia, axonotmesis and <b>neurotmesis)</b> and degrees of nerve injury that occur {{as a result of}} exposure to various temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Seddon {{classified}} {{facial nerve}} injuries into three broad categories: neuropraxia, <b>neurotmesis,</b> and axonotmesis. Neuropraxia {{is the most}} common form of injury associated with Bell’s palsy, and it is characterized by paralysis without a degeneration of the peripheral nerve. Electroneuronography would yield a normal or mildly impaired response, as the nerve fibers are still whole but unresponsive to conscious control. <b>Neurotmesis</b> is regarded as the worst possible outcome, with electroneuronography readings equivalent to a flat line, or no response to stimulation. This represents total degradation of the facial nerve. Lastly, axonotmesis consists of damage to the inner nerve fibers while the outer covering remains whole, and also yields a flat line in response to stimulation. Because of their similar recordings, electroneuronography cannot, by itself, distinguish between the latter two forms of nerve injury.|$|E
50|$|People {{who suffer}} from <b>neurotmesis</b> often face a poor prognosis. They will more than likely never regain full {{functionality}} of the affected nerve, but surgical techniques do give people a better chance at regaining some function. Current research is focused on new ways to regenerate nerves and advance surgical techniques.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Neurotmesis</b> (in Greek tmesis signifies [...] "to cut") {{is part of}} Seddon's {{classification}} scheme used to classify nerve damage. It {{is the most serious}} nerve injury in the scheme. In this type of injury, both the nerve and the nerve sheath are disrupted. While partial recovery may occur, complete recovery is impossible.|$|E
50|$|Cryoneurolysis {{treatments}} which utilize {{liquid nitrogen}} (boiling point of -195.8 °C) as the coolant {{fall into the}} range of a <b>neurotmesis</b> injury, or 3rd degree injury according to the Sunderland classification. Treatments of the nerve in this temperature range are irreversible. Nerves treated in this temperature range experience a disruption of both the axon and the endoneurium connective tissue layer.|$|E
5000|$|A neuron's {{response}} to trauma {{can often be}} determined by the severity of the injury, classified by Seddon's classification. In Seddon's Classification, nerve injury is described as either neurapraxia, axonotmesis, or <b>neurotmesis.</b> Following trauma to the nerve, a short onset of afferent impulses, termed [...] "injury discharge", occurs. While lasting only minutes, this occurrence has been linked to the onset of neuropathic pain.|$|E
50|$|Peripheral nerve {{injuries}} can {{be classified}} in two different ways. <b>Neurotmesis</b> is classified under the Seddon system which is defined by three grades of nerve injury. The mildest grade {{is referred to as}} neurapraxia and is characterized by a reduction or complete blockage of conduction across a segment of nerve while axonal continuity is maintained and nerve conduction is preserved. These injuries are almost always reversed and a recovery takes place within days or weeks. The second classification of the Seddon system is referred to as axonotmesis which is a more severe case of peripheral nerve injury. Axonotmesis is classified by an interruption of the axons, but a preservation of the surrounding connective tissues around the axon. These injuries can heal themselves at about 1mm/day, therefore resulting in recovery to be possible but at a slower rate than neurapraxia. The last and most severe case of peripheral nerve injury is known as <b>neurotmesis,</b> which in most cases cannot be completely recovered from even with surgical repair.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurotmesis</b> is {{diagnosed}} through clinical evaluation of symptoms, physical evaluation, and other diagnostic studies. Patients often undergo {{a series of}} muscle strength tests, sensory exam which includes feeling the sensation of light touch, pinprick, vibration, and others. Other tests involved with diagnosis of nerve injury are electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS). These help to distinguish upper from lower motor neuron disorder as well as diagnose primary muscle disease.|$|E
50|$|The second {{classification}} of nerve injury {{is known as}} the Sunderland classification which is more complex and specific. This classification uses five different degrees of nerve injury, the first one being the least severe and the equivalent to neurapraxia and the most severe being the fifth degree and having the same classification as <b>neurotmesis.</b> The second through fourth degrees are dependent on the variance of axon discontinuity and are classified under Seddon’s {{classification of}} axonotmesis.|$|E
50|$|Denervation may be {{the result}} of nerve injury. The three main types of nerve injury are neurapraxia, axonotmesis and <b>neurotmesis.</b> These three types {{distinguish}} between the severity of the nerve damage and the potential for recovery after the damage. After an injury in which some nerves are damaged, the brain has shown capabilities in rewiring or rearranging neuronal circuitry. This plasticity allows for the brain to compensate for the loss in neuronal communication resulting from injury.|$|E
50|$|Classification of {{peripheral}} nerve injury assists in prognosis and determination of treatment strategy. Classification of nerve injury was described by Seddon in 1943 and by Sunderland in 1951. The lowest degree of nerve injury in which the nerve remains intact but signaling ability is damaged is called neurapraxia. The second degree in which the axon is damaged but the surrounding connecting tissue remains intact is called axonotmesis. The last degree in which both the axon and connective tissue are damaged is called <b>neurotmesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Neurotmesis: The {{most severe}} form of nerve injury, {{in which the}} nerve is {{completely}} disrupted by contusion, traction or laceration. Not only the axon, but the encapsulating connective tissue lose their continuity. The most extreme degree of <b>neurotmesis</b> is transsection, although most neurotmetic injuries do not produce gross loss of continuity of the nerve but rather, internal disruption of the nerve architecture sufficient to involve perineurium and endoneurium as well as axons and their covering. It requires surgery, with unpredictable recovery.|$|E
50|$|Neurapraxia {{results in}} {{temporary}} {{damage to the}} myelin sheath but leaves the nerve intact and is an impermanent condition; thus, Wallerian degeneration does not occur in neurapraxia. In order for the condition to be considered neurapraxia, according to the Seddon classification system of peripheral nerve injury, {{there must be a}} complete and relatively rapid recovery of motor and sensory function once nerve conduction has been restored; otherwise, the injury would be classified as axonotmesis or <b>neurotmesis.</b> Thus, neurapraxia is the mildest classification of peripheral nerve injury.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurotmesis</b> {{occurs in}} the {{peripheral}} nervous system and most often in the upper-limb (arms), accounting for 73.5% of all peripheral nerve injury cases. Of these cases, the ulnar nerve was most often injured. Peripheral nerves are structured so that the axons are surrounded by most often a myelinated sheath and then an endoneurium. A perineurium surrounds that and the outermost layer is considered the epineurium. When injury occurs, “local vascular trauma leads to hemorrhage and edema (swelling), which results in vigorous inflammatory response resulting in scarring of the injured segment. In most cases, due to the extreme nature of the injury, there is typically complete loss of function.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the least}} severe form of nerve injury, with {{complete}} recovery. In this case, the axon remains intact, but there is myelin damage causing an interruption in conduction of the impulse down the nerve fiber. Most commonly, this involves compression of the nerve or disruption to the blood supply (ischemia). There is a temporary loss of function which is reversible within hours to months of the injury (the average is 6-9 weeks). Wallerian degeneration does not occur, so recovery does not involve actual regeneration. There is frequently greater involvement of motor than sensory function with autonomic function being retained. In electrodiagnostic testing with nerve conduction studies, there is a normal compound motor action potential amplitude distal to the lesion at day 10, and this indicates a diagnosis of mild neuropraxia instead of axonotmesis or <b>neurotmesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|A nerve {{injury in}} {{continuity}} results when axonal function is nonexistent but {{the structure of}} the connective tissue is preserved. More severe nerve injury like axonotmesis or <b>neurotmesis</b> warrant the repair of the epineurium because the connective tissue is damaged. The epineurium is preserved in a nerve injury in continuity by definition and the severity of the injury varies with the amount of the connective tissue preserved. Typical indications for surgery are if the patient who presented with a laceration has no conduction along the axon, signal transmitted across the nerve, or does not recover within a week. Numbness and paralysis varies depending on the amount of functional loss due to the axonal interruption. The lack of signal being sent from the brain across the gap is caused by the laceration. The procedure can be applied to any nerve epineurium. The procedure is used to repair different-sized fascicles and non-grouped fascicles compared to group fascicular and perinuerial repair.|$|E
5000|$|Nerve injury: This is {{primarily}} {{an issue with}} extraction of third molars, but can occur with the extraction of any tooth should the nerve {{be close to the}} surgical site. Two nerves are typically of concern, and are found in duplicate (one left and one right): 1. the inferior alveolar nerve, which enters the mandible at the mandibular foramen and exits the mandible at the sides of the chin from the mental foramen. This nerve supplies sensation to the lower teeth on the right or left half of the dental arch, as well as sense of touch to the right or left half of the chin and lower lip. 2. The lingual nerve (one right and one left), which branches off the mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve and courses just inside the jaw bone, entering the tongue and supplying sense of touch and taste to the right and left half of the anterior 2/3 of the tongue as well as the lingual gingiva (i.e. the gums on the inside surface of the dental arch). Such injuries can occur while lifting teeth (typically the inferior alveolar), but are most commonly caused by inadvertent damage with a surgical drill. Such injuries are rare and are usually temporary, but {{depending on the type of}} injury (i.e. Seddon classification: neuropraxia, axonotmesis, & <b>neurotmesis),</b> can be prolonged or even permanent.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{diagnostic sensitivity}} of electroneurography (ENoG) for facial <b>neurotmesis.</b> METHODS: The data of 24 patients suffering from facial <b>neurotmesis</b> on one side, having non-emergency operation, and having preoperative records of ENoG were collected. Among the patients, 18 were men and 6 were women, aged from 3 to 55 years (median 28). The duration of injury before ENoG examination was from 1 to 56 days (mean 23. 6 days) for them. The electroneurographic examination {{was carried out}} for facial nerves on both sides preoperatively. Percentages of evoked potential amplitude reduction on affected sides were calculated according {{to the value of}} normal side. The 90 % reduction of amplitude was used as a cutting point. The facial <b>neurotmesis</b> was observed during operation. The sensitivity and false negative proportions of ENoG were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 24 patients with facial <b>neurotmesis,</b> 22 had ENoG amplitude reduction over 90 %, and 2 having this reduction less than 90 %. The sensitivity and false negative proportions of ENoG in patients with facial <b>neurotmesis</b> were 91. 7 % and 8. 3 % respectively. CONCLUSION: The preoperative ENoG examination is high sensitivity for facial <b>neurotmesis.</b> The patients whose ENoG reduction over 90 % should be advised to have a facial neurorrhaphy as soon as possible. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Discrimination between axonotmesis and <b>neurotmesis</b> {{is crucial}} in {{traumatic}} nerve injury. We present {{the case of a}} 43 -yearold woman which presented hypoesthesia in the fourth and fifth right fingers, started after surgery for Dupuytren syndrome. At ultrasound study, the ulnar digital sensory branch was identified. Before the division into the two terminal branches, a neuroma was observed, while <b>neurotmesis</b> was excluded. This case shows the utility of ultrasonography in peripheral nervous system examination and the possibility of visualization of very small nerves and their terminal branches...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{repair of}} <b>neurotmesis</b> {{has been proven}} most {{challenging}} in regenerative medicine. Progress in this field has shown that functional repair not only requires axon regeneration, but also selectivity in target reinnervation. Although selectivity in target reinnervation still involves relatively unexplored avenues, evidence-based medicine, in the end, requires behavioral proof of repair. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for tests assessing behavioral deficits after <b>neurotmesis.</b> To date, behavioral tests for detecting both dynamic and static parameters are limited. The CatWalk gait analysis has been shown to detect a multitude of speed-controlled dynamic and static gait deficits after experimental spinal cord injury. Therefore, we here evaluated its use in detecting both dynamic and static gait deficits after <b>neurotmesis.</b> After rat sciatic nerve resection CatWalk testing was performed for 8 weeks. A large amount of dynamic and static gait parameters were detected to be immediately and severely affected in the ipsilateral paw, sometimes reaching levels of only 15 % of those of the unaffected paw. We conclude that the CatWalk objectively detects dynamic and static gait impairments after sciatic nerve resection and future experiments are now required to prove which of these parameters are of particular interest to detect functional repair...|$|E
30|$|In 1943, Seddon [2] {{introduced}} a classification of nerve injuries based on three main types of nerve fibre injury {{and whether there}} was continuity of the nerve: <b>neurotmesis,</b> axonotmesis and neurapraxia [2]. <b>Neurotmesis</b> is the most severe injury. It is a lesion in which the axon and its encapsulating connective tissue lose their continuity, resulting in Wallarian degeneration. Axonotmesis is also a degenerative lesion in which the relative continuity of an axon and its myelin sheath is lost, with preservation of its connective tissue framework. Neurapraxia is a non-degenerative lesion {{in which there is}} a local conduction block, typically of large myelinated fibres. Anatomical continuity is preserved with selective demyelination. Neurology may deteriorate as a result of progressive damage to the nerve. Neurapraxia commonly results from compression and/or ischaemia of peripheral nerves. Recovery occurs by Schwann cell repair, which occurs over weeks to months [1].|$|E
30|$|Mechanical nerve {{injuries}} during endodontic {{treatment may}} be classified, {{based on the}} time course and the potential sensory recovery into: Neuropraxia (cases {{in which there is}} a brief altered sensation); Axonotmesis (partial damage to the nerve fibers that may fully recover within 2 – 12  months); and <b>Neurotmesis</b> (a nerve that has been entirely cut, with poor prognosis for recovery) (Rosen, 2014; Juodzbalys et al., 2011; Seddon, 1942).|$|E
40|$|Objective: To analyse {{perceived}} impairments, disability, job {{restrictions and}} job changes {{in subjects with}} a neurapraxia and <b>neurotmesis</b> of the ulnar nerve five years after trauma. Design: Retrospective, descriptive follow-up study. Setting: Department of Rehabilitation of a University Hospital. Subjects: Sixteen subjects with a <b>neurotmesis</b> (NT-group) and 20 subjects with a neurapraxia (NP-group) were compared {{by means of a}} structured interview assessing perceived impairments and change in job and a questionnaire assessing disabilities (Groningen Activity Restriction Scale: GARS). Results: The NP-group perceived significantly more pain, loss of strength and sensation, loss of dexterity and perceived more job-related restrictions than the NT-group. The NP-group had significantly higher scores on the GARS. There was a moderate correlation between the visual analogue score of the pain and the GARS in the NP- and NT-groups. No significant difference was found between the groups with respect to job changes. Conclusions: This study shows that subjects with a neurapraxia of the ulnar nerve perceive more impairments and disabilities compared with those subjects with a neuro tmesis.

40|$|A 7 -year-old male entire West Highland white terrier was {{referred}} to the Small Animal Hospital at the University of Glasgow for bilateral, chronic, medically unresponsive otitis media and externa. A history of cranio-mandibular osteopathy was also reported. Bilateral total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy was performed {{with the aid of}} a pneumatic burr. Extensive bone proliferation was present bilaterally originating from the caudal mandibular ramus and tympanic bulla which incorporated the horizontal canal on each side. The right facial nerve was identified leaving the stylomastoid foramen and running in a cranial direction through a 1. 5 cm diameter cuff of bone surrounding the horizontal canal and external acoustic meatus. Despite careful dissection, a facial nerve <b>neurotmesis</b> ensued which required microsurgical epineurial repair. Neurologic examination performed 12 h post-operatively revealed abnormalities consistent with right facial nerve paralysis. At 3 months, the facial nerve function was found to have improved significantly and was assessed to be normal four months after surgery. To the authors’ knowledge, this clinical communication described the first reported clinical case where unilateral facial nerve paralysis resulting from iatrogenic facial nerve <b>neurotmesis</b> was successfully treated by microsurgical epineurial repair...|$|E
40|$|In {{peripheral}} nerves MSCs can modulate Wallerian degeneration and {{the overall}} regenerative response by acting through paracrine mechanisms directly on regenerating axons or upon the nerve-supporting Schwann cells. In the present study, the effect of human MSCs from Wharton’s jelly (HMSCs), differentiated into neuroglial-like cells associated to poly (DL-lactide-ε-caprolactone) membrane, on nerve regeneration, was evaluated in the <b>neurotmesis</b> injury rat sciatic nerve model. Results in vitro showed successful differentiation of HMSCs into neuroglial-like cells, characterized by expression of specific neuroglial markers confirmed by immunocytochemistry and by RT-PCR and qPCR targeting specific genes expressed. In vivo testing evaluated during the healing period of 20 weeks, showed no evident positive effect of HMSCs or neuroglial-like cell enrichment at the sciatic nerve repair site {{on most of the}} functional and nerve morphometric predictors of nerve regeneration although the nociception function was almost normal. EPT on the other hand, recovered significantly better after HMSCs enriched membrane employment, to values of residual functional impairment compared to other treated groups. When the <b>neurotmesis</b> injury can be surgically reconstructed with an end-to-end suture or by grafting, the addition of a PLC membrane associated with HMSCs seems to bring significant advantage, especially concerning the motor function recovery...|$|E
40|$|Damage to {{peripheral}} nerves {{results in}} partial or complete dysfunction. After peripheral nerve injuries, a full functional recovery usually cannot be achieved despite the standard surgical repairs. Neurotrophic factors and growth factors stimulate axonal growth {{and support the}} viability of nerve cells. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the neurotrophic effect of exenatide (glucagon like peptide- 1 analog) in a rat sciatic nerve <b>neurotmesis</b> model. We injected 10 μg/d exenatide for 12 weeks in the experimental group (n = 12) and 0. 1 mL/d saline for 12 weeks in the control group (n = 12). We evaluated nerve regeneration by conducting electrophysiological and motor functional tests. Histological changes were evaluated at weeks 1, 3, 6, and 9. Nerve regeneration was monitored using stereomicroscopy. The electrophysiological and motor functions in rats treated with exenatide were improved at 12 weeks after surgery. Histological examination revealed a significant increase in the number of axons in injured sciatic nerve following exenatide treatment confirmed by stereomicroscopy. In an experimentally induced <b>neurotmesis</b> model in rats, exenatide had a positive effect on nerve regeneration evidenced by electromyography, functional motor tests, histological and stereomicroscopic findings...|$|E

A synchronous one-stage neurovas-cular reconstruction was undertaken in these patients; 75. 5 % of the traumas involved the clavioaxillary region, producing 32 regional aneurysms (71. 1 %), 2 major vascular lacer-ations (4. 4 %), {{and a high}} degree of <b>neurotmesis</b> (48. 8 %) and axonotmesis (26. 7 %) in the brachial plexus (BP). Lower limb vascular lesions included 5 aneurysms associated with significant regional <b>neurotmesis.</b> The follow-up rate was poor and declined from 100 % at six weeks to 70. 5 % at one year and 22. 7 % at five years. Initial vascular patency rate of 95. 5 % at six weeks persisted throughout in a similar manner, but the declining reatten-dance rate drastically reduced statistical reliability.
