He is disrespectful to most elders in the town. Emoticon dresses in a flashy style, including a fur coat, several necklaces and assorted other jewellery. His most distinctive feature, however, is a mask he wears, which covers his entire face. The mask displays his current emotions via a LCD screen, which expresses said emotion as a text [...] "smiley". This mask apparently translates Emoticon's true feelings at the given moment and does not allow any attempts at concealment (effectively rendering him unable to lie.) Emoticon also speaks in <b>netspeak,</b> saying [...] "lol" [...] rather than actually laughing, and saying [...] "All caps!" [...] before yelling. Currently, Emoticon is being held on charges of being an accessory to Mr. Articulate's murder and possibly on the charge of assaulting a police officer. Emoticons face is horribly disfigured and without his mask he cannot see, the mask itself has a pair of replacement eyeballs for him, apparently a [...] "gift" [...] from the Typist himself who blinded and disfigured him {{as a way to}} bring a bit of [...] "tragedy" [...] in his secret origins. As an act of kindness, Sheriff Lindo allowed him to keep wearing his mask even after his incarceration so as to spare him the shame and fear of being imprisoned without it.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to explore the presence and pedagogical implications of <b>Netspeak</b> in English language classroom. <b>Netspeak</b> is the type of language that evolves within the electronic environment, and it is classified as an informal language. The goal of {{this research}} is to examine how <b>Netspeak</b> is accepted by high school and university English language teachers from Finland and Serbia, and whether and how they implement <b>Netspeak</b> in their teaching. The topic of the educational use of <b>Netspeak</b> has not yet been widely explored, and, therefore, there are not many researches done on this matter. In this regard, researching the use of <b>Netspeak</b> for teaching purposes is a relatively new field, and this MA thesis brings new results on the subject and paves the way for further researches. It is a multidisciplinary research which combines linguistic research with media education. The data are collected through 18 interviews of the English teachers working in high schools and universities in Finland and Serbia, and through the review of 3 segments of written teaching materials in which the use of <b>Netspeak</b> is present. The method used in this qualitative study is inductive qualitative content analysis (IQCA). The findings show that the pedagogical potential of <b>Netspeak</b> is noticed by the teachers. The theory which comes out of the overall result of the research is that the majority of English language teachers implement <b>Netspeak</b> in their teaching.

The research goal is to examine word-formation and semantics patterns in synchronous chat. Critical review of the secondary sources combined with linguistic analysis of the corpus of chat texts were chosen as the research methods. The research confirmed the proposed hypothesis: <b>Netspeak</b> follows the word-building patterns of Standard English but the intensity of application of these patterns differs between the “regular” language and <b>Netspeak,</b> as well as various Internet using situations. In <b>Netspeak</b> use of any word-formation pattern is possible with any word. Synchronous chat favours word-formation patterns allowing economy of time and space, as well as showing adherence to the group.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Doctor in Counselling Psychology. Internet-based therapies are growing in number and popularity and cover a diverse range of practices for both individuals and groups. In concordance with the hyperpersonal theory and online disinhibition effect, people more readily disclose personal information when conducted via the internet. Due to technological constraints and social interactions, a non-standard language developed and has widely been termed “netspeak” (Crystal, 2006). Emotional words are processed differently to non-emotional words. Further, people do not connect with abbreviations on the same emotional level as they do when the words are written in full. Three studies were conducted: the first focused on assessing if a short emotionally evocative mini-biography had an emotional impact on participants. This material was then used in a second study which was a mass-testing of 62 young people on whether <b>netspeak</b> can change the impact on mood. The study used 3 conditions whereby participants re-wrote the mini-biography into either full English, using <b>Netspeak</b> or in their own words. A new vignette was created from the <b>Netspeak</b> condition to use as material for a third study. This final study was conducted via email into how much a psychological therapist understood what had been written in the <b>Netspeak</b> vignette. No differences were seen from re-writing an emotional biography in <b>netspeak</b> to English. Although psychological therapists demonstrated some understanding of the <b>netspeak</b> vignette, there was evidence of misinterpretation, presumption and misunderstanding suggesting that there may be some barrier to communication in internet therapy. The clinical implications of this research suggest that psychological therapists need to reflect on their practice in order {{to be aware of the}} level of assumption that can be made during therapy...|$|E

40|$|Syntactic {{analysis}} of Estonian <b>netspeak</b> using Constraint Grammar" The paper {{provides an overview}} of an attempt to adapt the Estonian Constraint Grammar rule set for <b>netspeak.</b> The rule set has been developed by Kaili Müürisep and Tiina Puolakainen for shallow and dependency parsing of Estonian literary language, and it has previously been adapted for shallow parsing of spoken Estonian by Kaili Müürisep and Heli Uibo. First, in order to adapt the rules, a chatroom corpus was parsed with the existing rule set. The corpus was manually revised and based on the errors that were found, changes were made to the rule set. The changes regarded detection of clause boundaries and particle verbs, as well as assignment of syntactic tags and dependency relations. Extensive use of discourse particles and direct addresses, short sentence length, and small percentage of attributes among the syntactic functions used in text appeared to be the most distinctive features of <b>netspeak,</b> as well as the large amount of elliptical sentences from which, in addition to other syntactic functions, a predicate can be left out. As a result of adapting the rule set, the results of both shallow and dependency parsing improved. The most error-prone syntactic functions were subjects, predicatives, and adverbials. In dependency parsing, the largest number of errors was made in determining the governors of adverbials...|$|E

40|$|<b>NETSPEAK</b> is a Web service {{which helps}} writers in finding {{alternative}} expressions {{for what they}} want to say. 1 It provides a large index of writing samples in the form of n-grams, n ≤ 5, along with an efficient means to retrieve them by the use of wildcard queries. When in doubt about a phrasing, a user can get additional evidence by retrieving samples that match a given context. The figure below shows the results for a query where a user is interested in the two most frequently written words between “looks” and “me”. The first two columns give an idea about the customariness of each result, and the user can select the one most appropriate for her sentence. To provide a rich choice of writing samples we index the Google n-gram corpus which was compiled from {{a large portion of the}} English Web and which consists of more than 3 billion n-grams along with their occurrence frequencies [2]. We have developed a space-optimal inverted index based on minimal perfect hashing. The hash function maps the vocabulary V of the corpus to the storage positions of postlists. A hash function is perfect if it does not produce hash collisions for the key set V, and it is minimal if the number of storage positions required does not exceed |V |. The hash function is constructed with the CHD algorithm which produces a space overhead of 2. 07 × |V | bits [1]. Moreover, the index provides a top-k retrieval strategy to find the n-grams matching a query; details can be found in [3].

40|$|Abstract This paper {{introduces}} <b>NETSPEAK,</b> a Web service which assists {{writers in}} finding adequate expressions. To provide statistically relevant suggestions, the service indexes more than 1. 8 billion n-grams, n ≤ 5, {{along with their}} occurrence frequencies on the Web. If in doubt about a wording, a user can specify a query that has wildcards inserted at those positions where she feels uncertain. Queries define patterns for which a ranked list of matching n-grams along with usage examples are retrieved. The ranking reflects the occurrence frequencies of the n-grams and informs about both absolute and relative usage. Given this choice of customary wordings, one can easily select the most appropriate. Especially second-language speakers can learn about style conventions and language usage. To guarantee response times within milliseconds we have developed an index that considers occurrence probabilities, allowing for a biased sampling during retrieval. Our analysis shows that the extreme speedup obtained with this strategy (factor 68) comes without significant loss in retrieval quality. ...|$|E

D. Abstract The present thesis concerns use of a specific language code, typical for computer-mediated communication and online environment. Such code is more often than not associated with younger generations, namely the millennials and generation Z, and have been raising worries as to what impact it might have on teenage literacy and their capacity to properly communicate. The aim of the thesis is to verify whether use of Internet by these generations indeed may influence Portuguese language in a negative way.
