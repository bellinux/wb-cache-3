30|$|Finally, to {{generate}} the more rarely seen beam distributions (12 % of observations), a number of mechanisms may play a role. If electrostatic fields indeed prove responsible for the observed energy dependent electron reflection, these fields will also accelerate secondary electrons and/or pho-toelectrons from the surface, producing an upward-going beam. This beam should prove unstable to various streaming instabilities, <b>naturally</b> <b>spreading</b> it in energy and angle, commensurate with observations. These instabilities would also affect the incoming population, possibly leading to the isotropized downward-going flux that we observe for beam distributions, either directly through a streaming instability, or via production of whistlers that could then cause pitch angle diffusion.|$|R

50|$|Pennisetum pedicellatum, known {{simply as}} desho or as desho grass, is an {{indigenous}} grass of Ethiopia belonging to the Poaceae family of monocot angiosperm plants.

Orthopoxvirus has been sometimes associated with <b>naturally</b> <b>spreading</b> disease in domestic and wild animals.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{color as}} a case study for the analysis of phenomena that pertain to several levels of reality and are typically framed by different sciences and disciplines. Color, in fact, is studied by physics, biology, phenomenology and aesthetics, among others. Our thesis is that color is a different entity for each level of reality, and that for this reason color generates different observables in the epistemologies of the different sciences. By analysing color as a paradigmatic case of an entity <b>naturally</b> <b>spreading</b> over different levels of reality, the paper raises the question as to whether making explicit the usually implicit ontological assumptions embedded within the different observables exploited by the different sciences may eventually clarify some of the difficulties of developing a comprehensive theory of color...|$|R

With a little practice a stone can be placed gracefully and forcefully and with a big click. The keys to a loud click are the force of the middle finger and the late release of the stone. Once the stone has been placed, the middle finger and hand slowly lifts off the stone (trying to avoid wobbling the stone) and gently retreats back to the player.|$|R

TSWV is <b>naturally</b> <b>spread</b> to potato by thrips of which Thrips tabaci {{is the most}} important. Prior studies indicated possible non-preference of potato cultivars to T. tabaci. Select potato cultivars were assessed for non-preference to T. tabaci in paired and group choice trials. Cultivars 'Bismark', 'Tasman' and 'King Edward' were less preferred than 'Atlantic', 'Russet Burbank' and 'Shepody'. Green leaf volatiles were sampled using solid-phase microextraction from the headspace of potato cultivars of two ages that differed in T. tabaci preference. Analysis of headspace volatile data using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves identified individual volatiles associated with T. tabaci preference and non-preference, young and old plants and individual cultivars.

40|$|Introduction There are now {{a number}} of hints {{indicating}} that functional genes can <b>naturally</b> <b>spread</b> across species boundaries. The existence and mechanism for such transfer are well documented, especially in the prokaryotic world. In bacteria transfer of DNA is facilitated by plasmids, by phages or by direct ingestion. The genes can be established within the cell {{by a variety of}} means. If they are on a plasmid, they can be replicated autonomously, and if they are on a nonreplicating molecule, they can be incorporated into the bacterial chromosome, either by general recombination or through the action of transposable elements. Transposable elements are genes which are capable of moving from one chromosome to another (Kleckner, 1981). If we then consider the fact that the transposable elements have the ability to pick up the normally stable chromosomal genes when they move (Guarente et al., 1980) we can see how it is possible to transfer any gene among many differe...|$|R

Although being easily propagated through grafting, plantation in large areas {{may have some}} problems, due to the environmental stress. Embryos, nodal segmets of mature shoots and shoot tips of two A. communis L. cultivars, Garrigues and Yaltsinki, were cultured on MS media supplemented with several concentrations and combinations of cytokinins and auxins, for in vitro micropropagation. The best root formation in embryo cultures for both cultivars was obtained in the media without growth regulators. The highest stem development was obtained with 4. 0 mg L - 1 of IAA in Garrigues. Callus developed from cultured shoot tips. MS media supplemented with 4. 0 mg L - 1 BAP induced fast growing-fragile callus growth. The best nodal explant development occurred with MS contained 2. 0 mg L - 1 BAP and 0. 5 mg L - 1 IAA. Results obtained demonstrated that the nodal explants {{could be used for}} direct embryogenesis of Garrigues and Yaltsinki varieties...|$|R

50|$|Blackface ewes are {{excellent}} mothers and will often attempt {{to defend their}} lambs against predators. They are good milkers {{and are able to}} yield a lamb crop and a wool clip even when on marginal pastures. The breed spread from the border areas during the 19th century to the highlands and the Scottish islands. They also crossed to Northern Ireland and the US. There are flocks scattered across the USA but this robust little breed has remained a minor breed in North America. Blackface lambs yield a carcass ideal for the modern consumer. The meat is free of superfluous fat and waste and is known the world over for its distinct flavour. Although they are not large sheep they have enormous potential for the production of high quality lean lamb for today's health conscious consumer.
