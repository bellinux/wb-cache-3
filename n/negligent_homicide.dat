After the outbreak of World War I, she was reactivated and returned to front-line service.

The ship sank quickly with heavy loss of life, though sources disagree on {{the exact number of}} fatalities.

5|$|On 8 September 1994 the DoD {{announced}} the actions {{it would take}} {{in response to the}} investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of <b>negligent</b> <b>homicide</b> by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an Article 32 hearing in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that he was sure of his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he was not sure of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.|$|E
5|$|The Ashley Smith inquest was an Ontario coroner's inquest {{into the}} death of Ashley Smith, a {{teenager}} who died by self-inflicted strangulation on 19 October 2007 while under suicide watch in custody at the Grand Valley Institution for Women. Despite guards watching her on video monitors, Smith was able to strangle herself with a strip of cloth, and it was 45 minutes before guards or supervisors entered her cell and confirmed her death. The warden and deputy warden were fired after the incident; although the four guards and supervisors in immediate contact with Smith were initially charged with <b>negligent</b> <b>homicide,</b> those charges were withdrawn a year later. Smith's family brought {{a lawsuit against the}} Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) for negligence; this lawsuit was settled out of court in May 2011.|$|E

MEF commander General Stephen Johnson later said that civilian deaths occurred [...] "all the time", and did not find the high number of deaths to be particularly unusual. He referred to the deaths as [...] "the cost of doing business on that particular engagement."
