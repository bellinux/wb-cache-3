5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{takes place}} {{primarily}} on the four continents of a world named Gaia. Most of Gaia's population reside on the Mist Continent, named so because the entire continent is blanketed in thick Mist. Lands outside the Mist Continent—the Outer, Lost and Forgotten continents—are uncharted territories not explored until midway through the game. Several locations in the parallel world of Terra and the dream land of Memoria round out the game's areas. The Mist Continent features four nations: Alexandria, Lindblum, Burmecia, and Cleyra. Alexandria is a kingdom to the northeast of the Mist Continent ruled by a monarchy located in Alexandria Castle. The technologically advanced Lindblum, governed by a regent, is nestled on a plateau to the southwest where airships regularly fly by. The Kingdom of Burmecia, whose capital is showered by eternal rain is to the northwest and nearby to the isolated Cleyran civilization, which is <b>nestled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> giant tree in the desert, protected by a powerful sandstorm. Treno, a large, perpetually dark city, heavily populated by both aristocrats and paupers, {{is located in the}} southeast part of the continent. The Mist Continent is extremely mountainous resulting in a natural barrier between many of the ruling nations.|$|E

500|$|Adult {{macaroni}} penguins typically {{begin to}} breed late in October, and {{lay their eggs}} in early November. The nest itself is a shallow scrape in the ground which may be lined with some pebbles, stones, or grass, or <b>nestled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clump of tussock grass (on South Georgia Island). Nests are densely packed, ranging from around 66cm apart {{in the middle of}} a colony to 86cm at the edges. A fertile macaroni penguin will lay two eggs each breeding season. The first egg to be laid weighs , 61–64% the size of the [...] second, and is extremely unlikely to survive. The two eggs together weigh 4.8% of the mother's body weight; the composition of an egg is 20% yolk, 66% albumen, and 14% shell. Like those of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick to minimise risk of breakage, and the yolk is large, which is associated with chicks born in an advanced stage of development. Some of the yolk remains at hatching and is consumed by the chick in its first few days.|$|E

2500|$|The United States Forest Service {{was given}} {{responsibility}} for the Oregon Caves National Monument in 1909. [...] Due to the caves remote location the first permanent road to the site was not completed until 1922. [...] In 1934, oversight of the monument passed to the National Park Service. [...] Over the next nine years, the Park Service worked with the Civilian Conservation Corps to develop and landscape the Oregon Caves site to attain {{the look of a}} [...] "rustic alpine village" [...] <b>nestled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mountain canyon. [...] The Park Service’s naturalistic design principles dictated the use of indigenous materials and rustic stone work. [...] Every element was careful set in place to highlight the rugged character of the canyon. Cedar-bark sheathing was used as a unifying design element on all the buildings. [...] While some changes have been made to the original structures, the buildings still retain their unique rustic character which is enhanced by the surrounding park landscape.

2500|$|In {{the north}} and centre of the county the {{substrate}} is the rocks of the Chalk Group, which form the Hampshire Downs and the South Downs. These are high hills with steep slopes where they border the clays to the south. The hills dip steeply forming a scarp onto the Thames valley to the north, and dip gently to the south. The highest point in the county is Pilot Hill, which reaches a height of 286m (938ft), and lies {{on the border with}} West Berkshire. Butser Hill near Petersfield is the second highest point at 271 metres (889ft) and lies in the South Downs National Park. The highest village in Hampshire at between 235-240m above sea level is Ashmansworth, located between Andover and Newbury. [...] The downland supports a calcareous grassland habitat, important for wild flowers and insects. A large area of the downs is now protected from further agricultural damage by the East Hampshire Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Itchen and Test are trout rivers that flow from the chalk through wooded valleys into Southampton Water. <b>Nestled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> valley on the downs is Selborne, and the countryside surrounding the village was the location of Gilbert White's pioneering observations on natural history. Hampshire's county flower is the Dog Rose.|$|E
