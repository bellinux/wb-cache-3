5|$|According to a {{national}} ranking of how well bishōjo games sold nationally in Japan, the original Kanon release for Windows achieved its highest rank at number two in the ranking. Three years later in June 2002, the original release ranked in again at 45, and then again at 46 the following two weeks. The original release also made the ranking after that at number 41 in early July 2002. The Kanon Standard Edition premiered at number 16 in the rankings. The Kanon Standard Edition remained on the top 50 list {{for the next two}} months, achieving the rankings of 47 and 35.

5|$|Impact crater diameters seen {{range from}} 0.1kma limit {{defined by the}} imaging resolutionto over 100km, <b>not</b> <b>counting</b> <b>the</b> multi-ring structures. Small craters, with diameters less than 5km, have simple bowl or flat-floored shapes. Those 540km across usually have a central peak. Larger impact features, with diameters in the range 25100km, have central pits instead of peaks, such as Tindr crater. The largest craters with diameters over 60km can have central domes, which are thought to result from central tectonic uplift after an impact; {{examples}} include Doh and Hár craters. A small number of very largemore 100km in diameterand bright impact craters show anomalous dome geometry. These are unusually shallow and may be a transitional landform to the multi-ring structures, as with the Lofn impact feature. Callisto's craters are generally shallower than those on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{enclosures}} {{accounted for}} about 4.5 million acres {{of what had been}} open fields, <b>not</b> <b>counting</b> <b>the</b> enclosure of common land and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; {{by the end of the}} enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.|$|E
