5000|$|... 2. Navigation, {{gas and oil}} canals: Throughout the 1960s and 1980s, {{activity}} {{for oil and gas}} exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Louisiana coastline increased. Dredging canals was seen as a necessity for these companies to create deeper channels for easier navigation and the laying of pipelines. Over time, 10 major <b>navigation</b> <b>canals</b> and more than 9,300 miles of pipelines were placed throughout coastal Louisiana, which currently serve around 50,000 oil and gas production facilities. The impact of dredging and pipeline placement results in the direct loss of wetlands, and according to a report filed by the Department of the Interior, these actions accounted for 30 to 59% of wetland loss in Louisiana from 1956-1978.|$|E
5000|$|According to the World Commission on Dams, a key {{difference}} between a barrage and a dam is that a dam is built for water storage in a reservoir, which raises the level of water significantly. A barrage is built for diverting water, and raises the water level only a few feet; they are generally built on flat terrain across wide, often meandering rivers. Similar distinctions are used in Egypt, where it is noted: [...] "In this system a [...] "dam" [...] is a structure that forms a reservoir for the storage of water during the annual flood period of the Nile in order to supplement the natural flow of the river during the low-water period; a [...] "barrage" [...] merely raises the river or canal level, when necessary, to the height required for adequate flow into the canals that take off above it. [...] Barrages are usually larger than the headworks of irrigation and <b>navigation</b> <b>canals,</b> {{with which they are}} associated.|$|E
50|$|Throughout its {{geological}} history, the Mississippi River Delta experienced {{natural processes}} {{of growth and}} retraction {{as a result of}} sediment deposition from the river. However, in recent history, the processes of land loss have far surpassed the river’s land-building properties due to a number of factors. Some of the causes of delta land loss stem from natural causes, like hurricanes and other effects of climate change. However, the Mississippi River Delta also suffers from a lack of sedimentation due to the levee systems, <b>navigation</b> <b>canals</b> and other man-made structures within the region. These structures have proven to be detrimental to the natural land-building power of the river as many of the structures slow or eliminate the river’s flow into certain areas, increasing salt-water intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico into freshwater wetlands. The salt water weakens these freshwater ecosystems, making them more vulnerable to destruction by hurricanes and unable to withstand heavy storm surge.|$|E

40|$|<b>Navigation</b> <b>canals</b> {{are used}} for {{transport}} purposes. In order to allow safe navigation the water level {{should be kept in}} a certain range around the Normal Navigation Level (NNL). The water level is disturbed by known and unknown inputs, like tributaries, municipal water flows, rain, etc. Some of these inputs can be used to control the water level. If the geometry requires it, canal reaches are connected by locks. The operation of these locks sometimes can disturb the water level, if the difference between the upstream and downstream water level is large. The objective is to minimize the disturbances caused by these lock operations on the water level {{in order to maintain the}} NNL. In this work the global management of the canal reach is discussed and an option to maintain the NNL by active control is introduced. Some inputs to the system, such as other confluences or gates on the side of the locks, can be controlled automatically to react to the disturbances caused by the lock operations using model predictive control to maintain the desired water level.
