5|$|Harvey had {{his best}} {{first-class}} season in 195051, scoring 490 runs at 37.69, including his maiden first-class century against a full-strength New South Wales team with several Test bowlers. However, he struggled the following season and was dropped, and did <b>not</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> single first-class match in 195253. Recalled the following season, he overcame {{a slow start}} to score two centuries later in the summer to end with 421 runs at 38.27 for the summer.

5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did <b>not</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
5|$|However, an {{analysis}} of the distribution of megalodon over time suggests that climate change did <b>not</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> major role in its extinction. Its distribution during the Miocene and Pliocene did not correlate with warming and cooling trends; while abundance and distribution declined during the Pliocene, megalodon did show a capacity to inhabit anti-tropical latitudes. It was found in locations with a mean temperature ranging from , with a total range of , indicating that the global extent of suitable habitat should not have been greatly affected by the temperature changes that occurred.|$|E

5|$|In {{neighbouring}} Denmark, motte-and-bailey castles appeared somewhat {{later in}} the 12th and 13th centuries and in more limited numbers than elsewhere, due to the less feudal society.
