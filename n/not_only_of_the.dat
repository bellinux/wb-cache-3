5|$|Such was the {{disappointment}} at losing the Ashes, Collins was stripped <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New South Wales captaincy {{but also that}} of his local club, Waverley. Former players, including his former Waverley captain, the influential Monty Noble, publicly criticised Collins' captaincy. Hunter Hendry, viewing the match from the stands, suspected Collins threw the match. Despite {{his reputation as a}} gambler, there is no material evidence that Collins ever fixed the result of any cricket match.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009 the International Baseball Federation {{created a}} ranking {{system so that}} the nations {{involved}} in international competition could be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish {{at the end of}} tournaments. The system takes into account results <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are {{based on the number of}} teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), and in the case of continental tournaments such as the Oceania Baseball Championship the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process; the most recent was the 2009 Baseball World Cup.|$|E
5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism and conspicuous intrepidity {{above and}} {{beyond the call of duty}} as Commanding Officer of the 1st Marine Raider Battalion, with Parachute Battalion attached, during action against enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands on the night of 13–14 September 1942. After the airfield on Guadalcanal had been seized from the enemy on August 8, Col. Edson, with a force of 800 men, was assigned to the occupation and defense of a ridge dominating the jungle on either side of the airport. Facing a formidable Japanese attack which, augmented by infiltration, had crashed through our front lines, he, by skillful handling of his troops, successfully withdrew his forward units to a reserve line with minimum casualties. When the enemy, in a subsequent series of violent assaults, engaged our force in desperate hand-to-hand combat with bayonets, rifles, pistols, grenades, and knives, Col. Edson, although continuously exposed to hostile fire throughout the night, personally directed defense of the reserve position against a fanatical foe of greatly superior numbers. By his astute leadership and gallant devotion to duty, he enabled his men, despite severe losses, to cling tenaciously to their position on the vital ridge, thereby retaining command <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guadalcanal airfield, but also of the 1st Division's entire offensive installations in the surrounding area.|$|E

5|$|Swiatek and Breen {{described}} the Alabama half dollar as {{caught up in}} the presidential election of 1920, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to dampen sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a new pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive {{at the time of the}} 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the Montgomery Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S., but of any country.|$|E
