40|$|Nonlinear spatial {{encoding}} {{fields for}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) hold great promise to improve on the linear gradient approaches by, for example, enabling reduced imaging times. Imaging schemes that employ general <b>nonlinear</b> <b>encoding</b> fields are difficult to analyze using traditional measures. In particular, the resolution is spatially varying, characterized by a position-dependent point spread function (PSF). Likewise, the use of <b>nonlinear</b> <b>encoding</b> fields creates an additional spatial dependence on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Although the two properties of resolution and SNR are linked, in this work {{we focus on the}} latter. To this end, we examine the pixel variance, which requires a computation that is often not feasible for <b>nonlinear</b> <b>encoding</b> schemes.

Published schemes include PatLoc, O-Space, Null Space, 4 D-RIO, and others, but the large variety of possible approaches to exploiting nonlinear SEMs remains mostly unexplored. Before, we have presented a new approach, Fast ROtary Nonlinear Spatial ACquisition (FRONSAC) imaging, where the nonlinear fields provide a small rotating perturbation to standard linear trajectories. While FRONSAC encoding greatly improves image quality, at the highest accelerations or weakest FRONSAC fields, some undersampling artifacts remain. However, the under-sampling artifacts that occur with FRONSAC encoding are relatively incoherent and well suited to the compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction. CS provides a sparsity-promoting convex strategy to reconstruct images from highly undersampled datasets. The work presented here combines the benefits of FRONSAC and CS. Simulations illustrate that this combination can further improve image reconstruction with FRONSAC gradients of low amplitudes and frequencies.

For this approach, a sampling operator (as well as its adjoint) is needed that maps data from PatLoc k-space to the final image space. It is shown {{that this can be}} realized as a type- 3 nonuniform fast Fourier transform, which is implemented by a combination of a type- 1 and type- 2 nonuniform fast Fourier transform. Using this operator, it is also possible to implement an iterative conjugate gradient SENSE based method for PatLoc reconstruction, which leads to a significant reduction of computation time in comparison to conventional PatLoc image reconstruction methods.

However, previous solutions usually require all-to-all connectivity, inconsistent with the sparse connectivity seen in the brain. Here we propose a principled algorithm that provably reaches the MAP inference solution but using sparse connectivity.

All previous countermeasures against fault injection attacks based on error detecting codes assume that the attacker cannot simultaneously control the fault-free outputs of a device-under-attack and error patterns.

In this paper, we propose optimal algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) codes based on the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>encoding</b> functions and the random number generators. The proposed codes can provide a guaranteed high error detecting probability even if the attacker can fully control the fault-free outputs of a device-under-attack as well as the error patterns. As a case study, we present the protection architectures based on AMD codes for multipliers in Galois fields used for the elliptic curve cryptography. The results show that the proposed architecture can provide a very low error masking probability at the cost of a reasonable area overhead.

40|$|Balanced {{steady-state}} free precession (SSFP) imaging {{is sensitive}} to off-resonance effects, {{which can lead to}} considerable artifacts during a transient phase following magnetization preparation or steady-state interruption. In addition, <b>nonlinear</b> k-space <b>encoding</b> is required if contrast-relevant k-space regions need to be acquired at specific delays following magnetization preparation or for transient artifact reduction in cardiac-gated k-space segmented CINE imaging. Such trajectories are problematic for balanced SSFP imaging due to nonconstant eddy current effects and resulting disruption of the steady state. In this work, a novel acquisition strategy for balanced SSFP imaging is presented that utilizes scan time reduction by parallel imaging for optimized “double average” eddy current compensation and artifact reduction during the transient phase following steady-state storage and magnetization preparation. Double average parallel SSFP imaging was applied to k-space segmented CINE SSFP tagging as well as nongated centrically encoded SSFP imaging. Phantom and human studies exhibit substantial reduction in steady-state storage and eddy current artifacts while maintaining spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and similar total scan time of a standard SSFP acquisition. The proposed technique can easily be extended to other acquisition schemes that would benefit from nonlinear reordering schemes and/or rely on interruption of the balanced SSFP steady state...|$|R

40|$|The {{inherent}} {{structure of}} the encoding in {{early stages of the}} visual system is investigated from a combined information-theoretical, psychophysical, and neurophysiological perspective. We argue that the classical modeling in terms of linear spatial filters is equivalent to the assumption of a Cartesian organization of the feature space of early vision. We show that such a linear Cartesian feature space would be suboptimal for the exploitation of the statistical redundancies of natural images since these have a radially separable probability-density function. Therefore a more efficient representation can be obtained by a <b>nonlinear</b> <b>encoding</b> that yields a feature space with polar organization. This prediction of the information-theoretical approach regarding the organization of the feature space of early vision is confirmed by our psychophysical measurements of basic discrimination capabilities for elementary Gábor patches, and the necessary nonlinear operations are shown to be closely related to cortical gain control and to the phase invariance of complex cells.

Within this study, thischaracteristic property of <b>nonlinear</b> <b>encoding</b> is investigatedwith regard to {{its potential to}} accelerate MRI acquisitions. Theory: A dependency between k-space coverage and localresolvability of the image causes k-space samples to have aspatially localized contribution to {{the reconstruction of the}} spindensity.

Conventional nonlinear {{optical microscopy}} techniques, e. g. two photon fluorescence and second harmonic generation, are based on detecting a small light signal emitted at a new wavelength that is well separated from the excitation light. However, there are also many other nonlinear processes, such as two-photon absorption and self-phase modulation, that do not generate light at new wavelengths and {{that have not been}} extensively explored for imaging. This dissertation extends the accessible mechanisms for contrast to the later nonlinear optical processes by combining femtosecond laser pulse shaping and homodyne detection. We developed a rapid pulse shaper with a relatively simple and compact instrument design that modifies the spectrum of individual laser pulses from an 80 MHz mode-locked laser. The pulse shaper enables simultaneous two-photon absorption and self-phase modulation imaging of various nanoparticles in-vitro with high sensitivity. We also applied this imaging technique to study the nonlinear optical response in graphene. Because our technology detects the <b>nonlinear</b> signature <b>encoded</b> within the laser pulse itself, we achieve intrinsic contrast of biological and non-biological samples in highly scattering media.

One recently developed approach to these data focuses on estimation of computational encoding models that describe how stimuli are transformed into brain activity measured in individual voxels. Here we aim at building encoding models for fMRI signals recorded in primary visual cortex of the human brain. We use residual analyses to reveal systematic nonlinearity across voxels not taken into account by previous models. We then show how a sparse nonparametric method (Ravikumar et al., 2009 b) can be used together with correlation screening to estimate <b>nonlinear</b> <b>encoding</b> models effectively. Our approach produces encoding models that predict about 25 % more accurately than models estimated using other methods (Kay et al., 2008 a).

One benefit of quantitative encoding models is that estimated models can be used to decode brain activity, in order to identify which specific image was seen by an observer.

It is shown that any nonlinear control system which can be globally asymptotically stabilized by "standard" (i. e. with no encoding) state feedback can also be globally asymptotically stabilized by encoded state feedback, provided that the number of bits used to encode the samples is not less than an explicitly determined lower bound. By means of this bound, we are able to establish a direct relationship between the size of the expected region of attraction and the data rate, under the stabilizability assumption only, a result which-to the best of our knowledge-does not have any precedent in the literature.
