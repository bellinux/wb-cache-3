5|$|The {{show has}} {{frequently}} {{been criticized for}} perpetuating <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> about Italian Americans.

5|$|Many {{cultures}} {{throughout history}} have viewed obesity {{as the result}} of a character flaw. The obesus or fat character in Ancient Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times the food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of sloth and lust. In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and obesity is commonly associated with various <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes.</b> People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes,</b> and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E

5|$|Appian Way later {{produced}} another biopic, Public Enemies (2009), a Michael Mann-directed mob drama starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. Following {{the final}} years of the notorious bank robber John Dillinger (Depp) as he is pursued by FBI agent Melvin Purvis during Great Depression, the film was an adaptation of Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34. A commercial success, it also received generally positive reviews, though critics found historical inaccuracies in the film. The company, along with Dark Castle Entertainment, released the 2009 psychological horror film Orphan, which told the story of a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious 9-year-old girl. The film was considered by the adoption community to promote <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> about orphans. Although the film received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success.|$|E

5000|$|A {{present study}} extends {{the studies of}} Fein and Spencer in which the {{principal}} behavior examined was avoidance behavior. In the study, Macrae et al. (2004) found that participants that had a salient <b>negative</b> <b>stereotype</b> of [...] "skinheads" [...] attached, physically placed themselves further from a skinhead target compared to those in which the stereotype was not as apparent. Therefore, greater salience of a <b>negative</b> <b>stereotype</b> led participants to show more stereotype-consistent behavior towards the target.|$|R
40|$|There {{is a lack}} {{of women}} in mathematics-related fields. This might be due to {{stereotype}} threat, when a person performs worse than usual when presented with a <b>negative</b> <b>stereotype</b> because they are worried they will prove the stereotype to be correct (Steele, 1997). As practice schedules can affect performance (Carlson & Yaure, 1990), this experiment measured math performance after implementing blocked or random practice schedules and an activated or inactivated <b>negative</b> <b>stereotype.</b> Forty-eight college students learned probability from worked examples and practice problems and were tested on overall math performance and other aspects of learning. Results suggest that, in general, a blocked order tends to yield greater math performance, especially under the effects of a <b>negative</b> <b>stereotype.</b> Future research should examine retention, in addition to acquisition, of the learning materials.

40|$|Despite {{all of the}} advancements {{women have}} made {{in the field of}} mathematics, the <b>negative</b> <b>stereotype</b> {{regarding}} women’s mathematical competence persists. Stereotype threat research demonstrates that the <b>negative</b> <b>stereotype</b> contributes to significant gender differences in attitudes, academic achievement, and educational and career attainment in math. The current longitudinal study focused on stereotype threat as an explanation for how a <b>negative</b> gender <b>stereotype</b> influences the mathematical performance of middle school girls in math in a single-sex setting. In particular, the study examines how the girls’ gender identification moderates the effects of stereotype threat. The results of the study indicate that stereotype threat does operate in a single-sex setting and that participants’ math performance varies significantly depending on their overall gender identification...|$|R

25|$|A common {{criticism}} of drag queens {{is that they}} promote <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> of women, comparable to blackface (a racially offensive portrayal of black people by white performers that was popular throughout the 19th to early 20th century).

40|$|Coate and Loury (1993) {{suggest the}} impact of affirmative action on a <b>negative</b> <b>stereotype</b> is {{theoretically}} ambiguous leading to either: a benign equilibrium in which affirmative action eradicates the <b>negative</b> <b>stereotype</b> and leads to equal proportional representation of the two groups; or alternatively a patronising equilibrium in which the stereotype persists. The current paper examines this theoretical ambiguity {{within the context of}} a laboratory experiment. Although benign and patronising equilibria are equally plausible in theory, the laboratory experiments easily replicate most features of the benign equilibrium, but diverge from the theoretically predicted patronising equilibrium. <br /...|$|R
25|$|The term Sufism {{came into}} being, not by Islamic texts or Sufis {{themselves}} but by British Orientalists {{who wanted to}} create an artificial divide between what they found attractive in Islamic civilization (i.e. Islamic spirituality) and the <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes</b> that were present in Britain about Islam. These British orientalists, therefore, fabricated a divide that was previously non-existent. The term Sufism has, however, persisted especially in the Western world ever since.|$|E
25|$|Biphobia is aversion toward {{bisexuality}} {{and toward}} bisexual {{people as a}} social group or as individuals.

People of any sexual orientation can experience or perpetuate biphobia, and it is a source of social discrimination against bisexual people.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{critics have}} been no kinder to the film and cite its {{portrayal}} of black characters as offensive and reliant on <b>negative</b> <b>stereotypes.</b> Musicologist Daniel Goldmark interprets the film as a send-up of black religion and culture and the increasing identification of 1930s white audiences of jazz music with black culture. Religion scholar Judith Weisenfeld sees Clean Pastures {{as a metaphor for}} the replacement of rural, minstrel show stereotypes of blacks for modern, urban ones.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{replicate}} Harris, Harris, and Bochner’s (1982) early experiment on obesity stereotyping {{to examine whether}} <b>negative</b> obesity <b>stereotypes</b> persist and in what form. Method: A sample of psychology students (N = 506) read {{a description of a}} target described as female or male, overweight or average weight, and wearing glasses or not, who they subsequently rated on 12 descriptors. Results : Overweight targets were rated as significantly less active, assertive, athletic, attractive, happy, hardworking, masculine, popular, and successful than average weight targets. This <b>negative</b> <b>stereotype</b> effect of target weight was much larger than effects observed for sex or wearing glasses. There were no differences in effect sizes for target weight between this study and the original study. Conclusions: It was concluded that the <b>negative</b> obesity <b>stereotypes</b> reported by Harris et al. have persisted over a 30 -year period, despite the fact that people who are overweight are no longer a minority. Efforts are needed to challenge <b>negative</b> <b>stereotyping</b> of this group. Future research could examine why stereotypes of overweight people are resistant to change...|$|R
