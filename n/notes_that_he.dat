Marcinkus also wrote that he was {{gathering}} skills and knowledge {{in order to make}} a contribution towards liberating Lithuania and restoring its independence.|$|E
5|$|Michael <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had gotten}} high at an Alicia Keys concert. During Michael's anti-drug meeting, he misidentifies hookah as an illegal drug; Toby {{points out the}} fact that it is merely a pipe. Dwight notes that he'll have to bring in his bō staff, a long staff weapon used in Okinawa and feudal Japan, to protect the office. Jim later notes that Dwight was dressed like a member of the disco group the Village People.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the city, countryside, and {{building}} interiors {{are essential to}} Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages. As he did with the people around him, Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had made on previous visits.|$|E

5|$|The book {{describes}} each {{island that}} he visited in turn, giving {{a detailed account}} of its physical and human geography, its volcanoes, and the variety of animals and plants that he found and collected. At the same time, he describes his experiences, the difficulties of travel, and the help he received from the different peoples that he met. The preface <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> travelled over 14,000 miles and collected 125,660 natural history specimens, mostly of insects though also thousands of molluscs, birds, mammals and reptiles.|$|E
5|$|Greb (Alex Diakun) {{shares his}} tale, of a {{television}} censor called Waylon Figgleif. Figgleif's overzealous approach to censorship leads Greb to try pushing his limits. Greb assumed {{the form of a}} small demonic baby and reveals himself to Figgleif, who breaks down and starts attempting to censor everyday life. Greb repeats this trick, and encourages Figgleif to go on a killing spree—Figgleif takes a gun, bursts onto the taping of a science-fiction show about alien abduction, and kills several actors. Greb's methods and effectiveness are dismissed until he reveals the story's epigram. Figgleif's spree was caught on camera, and broadcast by another network as a found footage special. However, Greb also <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> too was spotted by Black during this.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E

5|$|Having {{left the}} others, Xavier {{returns to the}} safe room and finds a colored number {{on the back of}} Gus's neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding the clue {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{surprised}} {{they were allowed}} to do the pickle gag, which consisted of Stewie placing a cucumber on the sofa where Patrick's imaginary wife is sitting, but inserting it into her imaginary vagina (to see if it would turn into a pickle), but suggests that maybe broadcasting standards did not fully understand the scene. The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers. The musical composition was recorded at Fox studios on the Gary Numan stage. George W. Bush is portrayed hiding in a tree house and being informed by Brian of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was offered the opportunity to voice himself, but declined.|$|E
5|$|At the wedding, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{arrives with}} her husband Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), where Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) surprises them with a baby, his son Drake, that he had with a former girlfriend who then {{abandoned}} them both. Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition, he {{is not allowed to}} be best man as he is younger than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. At the reception, Michael shows Pam pictures of his kids with Holly Flax, and Pam <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is paying for two phones just to hold all the images. Ryan deliberately gives Drake an allergic reaction so that Ravi, a pediatrician, can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away. Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the two can start a new life together. Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving, but Nellie, who has still been wanting a child, takes Drake instead.|$|E

5|$|Later that evening, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss killing Jeff, with Joe (as {{a police}} officer), {{against the idea}} saying that Quagmire could be arrested for murder and it doesn't matter, while Quagmire says that it does and {{explains}} that people like Jeff never change. Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it look like an accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, behind the wheel of Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wishes he could kill someone else and gets an idea about Mort before the episode ends.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mention of}} John occurs in 1188 {{when he was}} {{teaching}} at Oxford. This record <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> witnessed a legal case decided by delegated judges for the Bishop of Lincoln. Along with a few other instructors, including Simon of Southwell, Honorius of Kent, and possibly Nicholas de Aquila, John {{was among the first}} securely attested legal teachers at Oxford. While at Oxford he lectured on the Decretum Gratiani {{and was one of the}} teachers of Thomas of Marlborough, later writer of the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Chronicle of the Abbey of Evesham. It is not quite clear when John taught Thomas, but Thomas attests in his Chronicon that John was one of Thomas' teachers. Nothing else is known of John's early life or where he studied law, but presumably like other early English canon lawyers, he studied somewhere on the Continent before returning to England to teach or practice. It is possible that he served as a canon of Lincoln Cathedral during the 1190s, but this is not securely attested. By the late 1190s, John was a member of the household of Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Besides Walter, another of his patrons was Walter de Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen.|$|E

25|$|The first {{preserved}} {{sketch of}} the horn comes from this treatise.

He further noted that this ability was normal in birds and could be acquired by humans by maintaining spiritual purity claiming that he knew {{of at least three}} Indian Yogis and numerous saints in the past with this ability of aethrobacy.|$|E
25|$|Eadwulf was consecrated in 796. He died between 836 and 839. His {{profession}} of obedience to Æthelhard, the Archbishop of Canterbury, {{is the first}} surviving profession to Canterbury. It <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been a pupil of Æthelhard, and is undated. The actual document names Eadwulf as Bishop of York, which indicates {{that at some point}} the document was altered, probably after the Norman Conquest of England, as part of the Canterbury-York dispute over the primacy of Britain. The rest of the profession appears genuine, however.|$|E
25|$|Also unknown {{is whether}} {{he was part of}} a dynasty that governed Jerusalem or whether he was put on the throne by the Egyptians. Abdi-Heba himself <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> holds his {{position}} not through his parental lineage but by the grace of Pharaoh, but this might be flattery rather than an accurate representation of the situation. At this time the area he administered from his garrison may have had a population of fifteen hundred people and Jerusalem would have been a 'small highlands stronghold' in the fourteenth century BC with no fortifications or large buildings.|$|E
