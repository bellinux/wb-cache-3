Finally, the geographer Strabo says that the people of Chios adduced the Homeridae as evidence that Homer came from Chios; which implies, though Strabo does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> that the Homeridae, too, came from Chios.|$|E

Only the prints not found by the FBI and allegedly discovered after Heirens's arrest were mentioned at the sentencing hearing and not the two front prints that were supposedly [...] "indisputable" [...] proof of Heirens's culpability. They were hardly mentioned, nor were they linked to Heirens, in a court hearing in which the witnesses had to testify under oath.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 December 1891 Gladstone said that: [...] "It is a lamentable fact if, in {{the midst}} of our civilisation, and {{at the close of the}} nineteenth century, the workhouse is all that can be offered to the industrious {{labourer}} at the end of a long and honourable life. I do not enter into the question now in detail. I do <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is an easy one; I do not say that it will be solved in a moment; but I do say this, that until society is able to offer to the industrious labourer at the end of a long and blameless life something better than the workhouse, society will not have discharged its duties to its poorer members".

2500|$|The epithet Dapalis is on {{the other}} hand {{connected}} to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus. Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef and a cup of wine to Jupiter : it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however Cato' s prayer of s one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as summus. The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> This interpretation finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of the epulum Iovis, from which the god derives the epithet of [...] Epulo [...] and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.|$|E
2500|$|The oft-cited quote [...] "The bowler's Holding, the batsman's Willey" [...] {{supposedly}} {{occurred when}} Michael Holding of the West Indies was bowling to Peter Willey of England in a Test match at The Oval in 1976. Johnston claimed {{not to have}} noticed saying anything odd during the match, {{and that he was}} only alerted to his gaffe by a letter from [...] "a lady" [...] named [...] "Miss Mainpiece". According to Christopher Martin-Jenkins, his Cricinfo biography, and the biography by Johnston's son Barry, Johnston never actually made the remark. Barry Johnston says [...] "It was too good a pun to resist ... but Brian never actually said that he had spoken the words on air." [...] Holding himself has expressed his doubt about the phrase ever being said, pointing out that no recording of it exists. Henry Blofeld and former TMS Producer Peter Baxter said that Johnston did not come up with the phrase and did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> during commentary.|$|E
2500|$|The {{state of}} Georgia became {{involved}} in a contentious dispute with the Cherokee, culminating in the 1832 Supreme Court decision in Worcester v. Georgia. In that decision, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, writing for the court, ruled that Georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands, as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople. Jackson is frequently attributed the following response: [...] "John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it." [...] The quote, apparently indicating Jackson's dismissive view of the courts, was attributed to Jackson by Horace Greeley, who cited as his source Representative George N. Briggs. Remini argues that Jackson did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> because, while it [...] "certainly sounds like Jackson...here was nothing for him to enforce." [...] This is because a writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries. The Court also did not ask federal marshals {{to carry out the}} decision, as had become standard.|$|E

2500|$|After a {{grant of}} {{immunity}} from prosecution, Trafficante testified before the HSCA the following day, September 28, and refuted the allegation that he told Aleman that [...] "Kennedy {{was going to be}} hit". He stated that he was positive that he did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> because he always spoke to Aleman in Spanish, and said {{that there was no way}} to state the phrase in Spanish. Trafficante also stated that he had no recollection of meeting Oswald or Oswald's assassin, Jack Ruby. During his testimony, Trafficante also admitted for the first time that he had worked with the CIA from 1960 to 1961 for an attempt to poison Castro, but stated that his role was only as an interpreter between CIA officials and Cuban exiles. He testified that he was brought into the plot by Roselli and Giancana, who had been recruited by Maheu. Trafficante said that he introduced the trio to Cuban exiles in Florida. He stated that he received no payment for his involvement and that he acted out of patriotism.|$|E
