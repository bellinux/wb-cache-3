This study investigated the presence of thiocarbamates in gloves and on glove-mixed impression putties by an iodine/azide spot test. This study also used oscillating rheometry to monitor the setting behavior of a polyvinyl siloxane impression material (President) following mixing with natural latex and hypoallergenic <b>latex</b> rubber <b>gloves.</b> To detect chemical interaction between <b>latex</b> <b>gloves</b> and the impression material, Differential Scanning Calorimetry was employed non-isothermally to set impression putties with and without o. 2 % zinc dithiocarbamate. The {{results of this study}} showed that while natural <b>latex</b> <b>gloves</b> retard {{the setting of}} polyvinyl siloxane impression putties, hypoallergenic <b>latex</b> <b>gloves</b> totally inhibit it. It has also been found that thiocarbamates are transferred from the gloves to the putties and consequently, interact with them.

40|$|The use of <b>latex</b> <b>gloves</b> {{by health}} care workers has {{increased}} over recent years.

While employees have a professional responsibility to reduce longer contact with <b>latex</b> <b>gloves</b> and use other safer alternatives, employers may also contribute through better education provisions, more strict monitoring and control of glove usage and purchasing gloves that are safer. An Infection Control Nurse can support both employees and management by developing and supporting better education and guidance for glove usage and an Employee Health Nurse could provide better care and support to affected workers.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the prevalence of latex gloves-related complaints among dental students and to establish the etiology of these problems. Material and Methods: 122 dental students completed a questionnaire. Those with latex glove-related complaints were evaluated for latex sensitivity by assessment of skin prick test and for cell-mediated sensitivity to rubber additives and occupational hazards by assessment of patch test. Results: 8. 2 % of dental students had skin hand complaints wearing <b>latex</b> <b>gloves.</b> 3 of them (30 %) showed a positive skin prick to latex and 1 of them (10 %) showed a positive patch test to rubber additives.

Among health care workers, dental working personnel have extensive use of <b>latex</b> <b>gloves.</b> A few numbers of researches {{have been done in}} Iran about prevalence of these reactions but there is no comprehensive study for dental workers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate reactions to <b>latex</b> <b>gloves</b> amongst dental workers in military dental health centers. Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive survey, dental workers with a minimum of three months length of employment and most often use of <b>latex</b> <b>gloves</b> were asked to fill standard questionnaire (derived from South Carolina Medical University) regarding latex related clinical manifestation and personal medical history and predisposing factors Data analysis was done by &chi; 2 and Student's t test. Results: In our study 330 personnel were assessed. The mean age and length of employment was 31. 6 and 8 years respectively. The most occupation was dentistry. A total of 232 subjects (70. 3 %) reported latex gloves-allergic symptoms. 72 (21. 8 %) of persons have history of atopy and food allergy was seen in 114 (34. 5 %). 63 (19. 1 %) of subjects reported history of hand dermatitis. All of these predisposing factors had positive regression with dermal and respiratory reactions. Conclusion: In this survey the prevalence of allergic reactions was higher than similar studies which may be due to type of gloves, lack of preemployment assessments and other factors. Use of diagnostic methods such as serologic measures, SPT and pulmonary function testing (such as spirogram) could be considered as tools for confirmatory and differential diagnosis and important complementary for these studies.

40|$|Latex allergy {{is still}} a crucial concern for <b>latex</b> <b>glove</b> users and manufacturers.

Therefore, we conducted a study to determine the prevalence of latex sensitization in nurses and identify risk factors associated with sensitization. Methods: A questionnaire, providing information on personal characteristics, ill-health, working conditions and symptoms related to latex product use, was administered to 363 female nurses working in two tertiary hospitals in southern Thailand. Latex sensitization was confirmed using a solid phase immunoassay to detect anti-latex IgE antibodies. Total glove protein levels were determined by using a modified Lowry method and latex aeroallergens by a competitive inhibition immunoassay. Results: The overall prevalence of latex sensitization was 4. 4 %. Respiratory symptoms related to <b>latex</b> <b>glove</b> use {{were significantly associated with}} latex sensitization (OR = 5. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 57 - 19). Total glove protein levels ranged 87. 8 - 250. 8 μg protein/dm 2.

Furthermore, latex sensitization prevalence increased from 3 % to 5 % with increased average departmental aeroallergen concentrations.
