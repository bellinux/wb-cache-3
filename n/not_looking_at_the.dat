The difficulty with this is that it's <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> complete traffic picture for a site. Large sites usually hire the services of companies such as the Nielsen NetRatings or Quancast, but their reports are available only by subscription.|$|E

500|$|British Trotskyite publication, the Socialist Review, praised Chomsky's {{discussion}} {{of the impact of}} neoliberalism in the US, however they asserted that [...] "when it comes to crucial questions - how do we fight and what are we fighting for - Chomsky's response is lacking." [...] They assert that his claims that communities can challenge the Republican and Democrat domination of the electoral system are [...] "somewhat bizarre" [...] given that he has already established how [...] "corrupt and biased" [...] that system is. Criticising him for <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> concept of a potential revolution, they also express disagreement with his view that the [...] "solution for the 99%" [...] can be found within [...] "the framework of capitalism".|$|E

[...] On July 24, 2011, in the midst of Democrats' and Republicans' inability to agree on a budget plan and thus an increase in the federal debt limit, the Washington Post published a blog post about groups organizing third party approaches. It focused on Bloomberg as the best hope for a serious third-party presidential candidacy in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Cortez motioned {{the fighters}} back {{together}} {{to resume the}} fight, without putting them in a neutral corner. Both fighters touched gloves, and Ortiz gave Mayweather another hug. At that moment, Cortez was <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having his hands up and unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz then looked at the referee, and Mayweather connected with a flush right hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, {{and was unable to}} beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather. After the fight Ortiz claimed that he was merely obeying the referee's instructions when he was [...] "blindsided" [...] by Mayweather, who defended his actions by saying that [...] "In the ring, you have to protect yourself at all times".|$|E

[...] "Air View" [...] and [...] "Air Gestures" [...] implement gestures and other functionality (such as previewing images or messages) by holding or swiping a hand or finger slightly above the screen, similarly to Samsung's Galaxy Note series, and adds a feature known as [...] "Quick Glance", which uses the proximity sensor to wake the phone so it can display notifications. The [...] "Group Play" [...] feature allows ad hoc sharing of files between Galaxy phones, along with multiplayer games and music streaming between S4 phones. The S4 also introduces Knox in the Android 4.3 update, a suite of features which implements a sandbox for enterprise environments that can co-exist with a user's [...] "personal" [...] data.
