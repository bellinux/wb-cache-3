50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2008, the Ukrainian President, Prime Minister and head of parliament sent an official letter {{to apply for the}} Membership Action Plan. The idea of Ukrainian membership in NATO has gained support from a number of NATO leaders. At the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer declared in a press conference that Georgia and Ukraine will join NATO. Within the <b>NATO-Ukraine</b> working <b>commission,</b> NATO officials reassured Ukraine officials {{that they are willing to}} invite their country to join the Alliance. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, Alexander Grushko, announced that NATO membership for Ukraine was not in Russia's best interests and wouldn't help the relations of the two countries.|$|R

50|$|Relations officially {{began when}} Ukraine {{became the first}} CIS country to enter NATO's Partnership for Peace program in February 1994. In the summer of 1995 NATO stepped up to help to {{mitigate}} consequences of the Kharkiv Drinking Water Disaster. This was the first cooperation between NATO and Ukraine. On May 7, 1997 the first-ever official NATO Information and Documentation Center opened in Kyiv, aimed to foster transparency about the alliance. A Ukrainian public opinion poll of May 6 showed 37% in favor of joining NATO with 28% opposed and 34% undecided. On July 9, 1997, a <b>NATO-Ukraine</b> <b>Commission</b> was established. In 2002 relations with {{the governments of the}} United States and other NATO countries deteriorated after one of the recordings made during the Cassette Scandal revealed an alleged transfer of a sophisticated Ukrainian defense system to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. At the NATO enlargement summit in November 2002, the <b>NATO-Ukraine</b> <b>commission</b> adopted a Ukraine-NATO Action Plan. President Kuchma's declaration that Ukraine wanted to join NATO (also in 2002) and the sending of Ukrainian troops to Iraq in 2003 could not mend relations between Kuchma and NATO. Currently, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are working with NATO in Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|The {{topic of}} {{enlargement}} {{was the main}} focus of the summit. The result of the summit was that Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic were invited to join NATO. Fellow Visegrád Group member Slovakia was excluded from this invitation. Slovakia had held a referendum on NATO membership in May 1997, but turnout in the referendum failed to achieve the required 50% of eligible voters and government sabotage was blamed, which in turn was viewed as one of a string of undemocratic measures taken by Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar. A majority of NATO members reportedly supported France's proposal to also immediately invite Romania and Slovenia as members, but this was strongly opposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton, and even a [...] "iron-clad guarantee" [...] that they could be invited in two years time was watered-down in favor of an [...] "open door" [...] policy for new potential members. A main concern for the United States was the cost of potentially raising the military standards of the new Eastern European members. Estimates put this cost at as much as $10 billion USD, which participants worried could lead to the treaty recognizing the new members being rejected by the Republican-held U.S. Senate. Additionally, a [...] "Charter on a Distinctive Partnership" [...] was signed between NATO and Ukraine, creating the <b>NATO-Ukraine</b> <b>Commission</b> and establishing relations between the two, and a declaration supporting peace efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina was read and signed by participants.|$|E
5000|$|The NATO summit held in Warsaw in July 2016 {{approved}} {{the plan to}} move four battalions totaling 3,000 to 4,000 troops on a rotating basis by early 2017 into the Baltic states and eastern Poland and increase air and sea patrols to reassure allies who were once part of the Soviet bloc. The adopted Communique explained that the decision was meant [...] "to unambiguously demonstrate, {{as part of our}} overall posture, Allies’ solidarity, determination, and ability to act by triggering an immediate Allied response to any aggression." [...] The summit reaffirmed NATO′s previously taken decision to [...] "suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation between NATO and Russia, while remaining open to political dialogue with Russia". Heads of State and Government [...] "condemned Russia’s ongoing and wide-ranging military build-up" [...] in Crimea and expressed concern over [...] "Russia’s efforts and stated plans for further military build-up in the Black Sea region". They also stated that Russia’s [...] "significant military presence and support for the regime in Syria", and its military build-up in the Eastern Mediterranean [...] "posed further risks and challenges for the security of Allies and others". NATO leaders agreed to step up support for Ukraine: in a meeting of the <b>NATO-Ukraine</b> <b>Commission,</b> the Allied leaders reviewed the security situation with president of Ukraine Poroshenko, welcomed the government’s plans for reform, and endorsed a Comprehensive Assistance Package for Ukraine aimed to [...] "help make Ukraine’s defence and security institutions more effective, efficient and accountable". At the meeting of the Russia-NATO Council at the level of permanent representatives that was held shortly after the Warsaw summit, Russia admonished NATO against intensifying its military activity in the Black Sea. Russia also said it agreed to have its military aircraft pilots flying over the Baltic region turn on the cockpit transmitters, known as transponders, if NATO planes acted likewise.|$|E
