It's such a {{tremendous}} risk that we, ought to go round begging people to think twice, to count a hundred, or a <b>nonillion,</b> before they fall in love to the marrying-point. I don't mind their flirting; that amuses them; but marrying is a different thing. I doubt if Papa Triscoe would take kindly {{to the notion of}} a son-in-law he hadn't selected himself, and his daughter doesn't strike me as a young lady who has any wisdom to throw away on a choice. She has her little charm; her little gift of beauty, of grace, of spirit, and the other things that go with her age and sex; but what could she do for a fellow like Burnamy, who has his way to make, who has the ladder of fame to climb, with an old mother at the bottom of it to look after? You wouldn't want him to have an eye on Miss Triscoe's money, even if she had money, and I doubt if she has much. It's all very pretty to have a girl like her fascinated with a youth of his simple traditions; though Burnamy isn't altogether pastoral in his ideals, and he looks forward to a place in the very world she belongs to. I don't think it's for us to promote the affair." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In a {{reply to}} our review {{entitled}} “Breathing Retraining: A Rational Placebo?, ” Ley has raised {{a number of}} comments (Clinical Psychology Review, 13, pp. 393 - 408). We {{do not agree with}} most of his remarks. Where his comments may be right, his opinion does not contr~i&t our general conclusion. We maintain oar <b>nonillion</b> #hut (Q) there are no good reasons for assuming thut the effects of breathing retraining are caused by decreasing the tendency to hyperventilate and (6) experimental evidence does not support the hyperventilation syndrome (HVS) modelforpanic. In a recent article in this journal (Garssen, de Ruiter, & van Dyck, 1992), we reviewed 13 studies pertaining to the effects of breathing retraining in patients with panic disorder and/or hyperventilation syndrome (HVS). We discussed the questions of whether ciini-tally relevant effects had been demonstrated in these studies and whether findings suppor...|$|E
40|$|When young {{children}} attempt {{to locate the}} positions of numerals on a number line, the positions are often logarithmically rather than linearly distributed. This finding has been taken {{as evidence that the}} children represent numbers on a mental number line that is logarithmically calibrated. This article reports a statistical simulation showing that log-like positioning is a consequence of 2 factors: the bounded nature of the number line and greater uncertainty about the meaning of the larger, less frequent number words. Two experiments likewise show that even college students produce log-like placements under the same 2 conditions. In Experiment 1, participants identified positions on a number line for a set that included both conventional and fictitious numbers (e. g., a zillion). In Experiment 2, participants did the same for conventional numbers that included some larger, unfamiliar items (e. g., a <b>nonillion).</b> Both experiments produced results better fit by logarithmic than by linear functions...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a collective state atomic interferometer (COSAIN) with the signal fringe {{as a function}} of phase-difference or rotation narrowed by √(N) compared to a conventional interferometer - N being the number of atoms - without entanglement. This effect arises from the interferences among collective states, and is a manifestation of interference at a Compton frequency of ten <b>nonillion</b> Hz, or a de Broglie wavelength of ten attometer, for N= 10 ^ 6 and v = 300 m/s. The population of the collective state of interest is detected by a null measurement scheme, in which an event corresponding to detection of zero photons corresponds to the system being in that particular collective state. The signal is detected by collecting fluorescence through stimulated Raman scattering of Stokes photons, which are emitted predominantly against the direction of the probe beam, for a high enough resonant optical density. The sensitivity of the ideal COSAIN is found to be given by the standard quantum limit. However, when detection efficiency and collection efficiency are taken into account, the detection scheme of the COSAIN increases the quantum efficiency of detection significantly in comparison to a typical conventional Raman atomic interferometer employing fluorescence detection, yielding a net improvement in stability by as much as a factor of 10. We discuss how the inhomogeneities arising from the non-uniformity in experimental parameters affect the COSAIN signal. We also {{describe a}}n alternate experimental scheme to enhance resonant optical density in a COSAIN by using cross-linearly polarized counter-propagating Raman beams.
