5000|$|<b>Nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> or nevus achromicus {{is a loss}} of pigment in {{the skin}} which can be easily {{differentiated}} from vitiligo. Although age factor has not much involvement in the <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> but in about 19% of the cases these are noted at birth. Their size may however grow in proportion to growth of the body. The distribution is also fairly stable and are nonprogressive hypopigmented patches. The exact cause of <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> is still not clearly understood. A sporadic defect in the embryonic development has been suggested to be a causative factor.It {{has been described as}} [...] "localised albinism", though this is incorrect. Those with <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> may be prone to sunburn {{due to the lack of}} pigment, and the patient should use good sun protection. Sunscreen should be applied to all exposed skin, since reduced tanning of normal skin will decrease the contrast with hypopigmented skin. Most patients with <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> do not pursue treatment for their lesion. There is no way to repigment the skin. If, however, the lesion is of cosmetic concern, camouflage makeup is effective. If the lesion is small one could also consider excision.|$|E

40|$|Background : <b>Nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> is a congenital, nonprogressive hypopigmented disorder. Various {{therapeutic}} {{methods have}} been attempted to repigment nevus with variable results. Objective : The objective {{of this study is}} to report our experience of treatment of <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> with a combination of noncultured melanocyte-keratinocyte transplantation (MKTP) and excimer laser sessions. Materials and Methods : Six patients (male 1, female 5) of <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> were treated with a combination of noncultured melanocyte-keratinocyte transplantation and excimer laser. One patient was lost to follow-up. Remaining five patients were observed for a period ranging from 7 to 30 months. Results : Two patients responded poorly to MKTP. The remaining three patients responded with repigmentation ranging from 80 % to 100 % but the quality of repigmentation was unsatisfactory in two of them.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundNevus depigmentosus is a congenital, non-progressive, hypopigmented macule or patch that {{is stable}} in its {{relative}} size and distribution throughout life. The lesions are often single {{but may be}} multiple, circumscribed and either isolated, dermatomal or in whorls. The lesions are uniformly hypomelanoic but not amelanotic. The aetiopathogenesis of <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> is not yet fully understood. A defect in the transfer of melanosomes from melanocytes to keratinocytes has been reported. ObjectiveThis work aimed at evaluation of the clinical and ultrastructural characteristics of <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> in a trial to understand its pathogenesis. Patients and methodsThis study included 15 patients having <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus.</b> Ultrastructural study was performed for 5 patients. 2 punch biopsies were taken from each patient, one {{from the center of}} the lesion and another from the nearby apparently normal skin as a control. ResultsThe lesions were mostly present before 3 years of age, mostly on the trunk. Six patients (40 %) had the isolated type and 9 (60 %) had the segmental type. Under Wood's lamp, the lesions exhibited an off-white accentuation without fluorescence. Ultrastructural study showed apparent reduction in melanosomal content of lesional melanocytes and keratinocytes. Immature and aggregated melanosomes were more present in lesional keratinocytes. Electron microscopic DOPA oxidase reaction was decreased in lesional skin compared to control indicating a reduced tyrosinase activity. ConclusionThe results of this study support the hypothesis that <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> is caused by functional defect of melanocytes and morphologic abnormalities of melanosomes...|$|E

Later on at the age of 5, numerous hyperpigmented punctiform spots appeared exclusively on the hyperpigmented area. On sun exposure, the hypopigmented area neither reddened nor burnt. On diascopy the margin of the hypopigmented lesion remained delineated.

40|$|Background: Hypopigmentary {{disorders}} are common group of dermatoses in pediatric age group. Aim: To study {{the frequency and}} patterns of hypopigmentary disorders in children. Materials and Methods: This study was a descriptive clinical study spanning {{over a period of}} 23 months. A total of 113 children (61 boys and 52 girls) were included in this study. Results: The frequency of hypopigmentary disorders among children was 3. 28 per 1000 children attending the dermatology out patient department. The mean age of the children was 7. 2 years. The mean of age of onset was 7. 36 years. Most common hypopigmentary disorder in our study was pityriasis alba (24. 7 %), followed by vitiligo (20. 4 %), leprosy (11. 5 %), <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> (10. 18 %), and tinea versicolor (6. 2 %). Others were hypomelanosis of Ito (5), post-inflammatory hypopigmentation (5), pityriasis rosea (4), steroid-induced hypopigmentation (4), lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (3), pityriasis lichenoides chronica (3), lichen striatus (2), oculocutaneous albinism (2), tuberous sclerosis complex (2), pigmentary mosaicism (1), and Griscelli syndrome (1). Conclusion: Pityriasis alba, vitiligo, leprosy, <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> and tinea versicolor are the five most common hypopigmentary disorders in children...|$|E
40|$|Hypomelanosis of ito (HI) is a {{multisystemic}} disorder {{characterized by}} cutaneous, neurologic disorder, and musculoskeletal disorder.

40|$|<b>Nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> (ND) is {{characterized}} by a congenital hypopigmented macule or patch. The pathophysiology of ND is poorly understood, but likely associated with a functional defect in melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes 1. ND is known to remain generally stable in size and distribution throughout life 1. Herein, we describe a case of a 6 -year-old boy whose ND disappeared, suggesting the possibility of spontaneous resolution of ND. A 10 -month-old male was brought to our clinic because of whitish patches on his right leg that had been present since his birth.

40|$|<b>Nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> (ND) is a congenital, non-progressive, hypopigmented lesion that {{is usually}} stable {{throughout}} an affected individual's lifetime. The clinical features of vitiligo {{are similar to those}} of ND, but the two diseases have different treatment responses and prognoses. We report here on a rare case of vitiligo that was coexistent with ND. Both conditions were treated with narrow-band UVB. An 11 -year-old boy presented with two distinct types of hypopigmented lesions, one on the forehead and the other on his back. The first was a hypopigmented patch with leukotrichia, and it was incidentally discovered 3 months before the child was examined at our clinic and it had rapidly increased in size. The second hypopigmented patch was detected at birth and it had slowly been increasing in size. The hypopigmented lesion on the child's forehead was diagnosed as vitiligo, and the one on his back as ND. Once- or twice-weekly narrow-band UVB treatment was initiated. Improvements in the two lesions were assessed with clinical photography and using a Mexameter® (Courage-Khazaka Electronic, Germany), which is a pigment-measuring device...|$|E
40|$|Subcellular defects of hypomelanosis in {{tuberous}} sclerosis (TS) (28 subjects) were compared by light and electron microscopy with {{other forms of}} congenital circumscribed hypomelanosis that occur in <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> (ND) (8 subjects) and in piebaldism (PB) (4 subjects), respectively. On the light microscopic level in both TS and ND, the population density of functioning melanocytes was normal but each perikaryon was small, and dopa activity was decreased. On the ultrastructural level, the hypomelanotic skin and hair of TS were associated with {{a decrease in the}} synthesis, melanization, and size of melanosomes; the decrease in the size of melanosomes resulted in the aggregation of melanosomes (i. e., a melanosome complex) in the keratinocytes in all the specimens examined. In ND, there were no obvious changes in the size and melanization of melanosomes. There was, however, an aggregation of melanosomes within the melanocytes. The hypomelanosis of ND is related to the decreased synthesis and also, perhaps, abnormal transfer of melanosomes. In PB, the hypomelanosis of the skin and hair results from the absence of functional melanocytes. The hypermelanotic areas of PB, however, characteristically contain melanocytes that synthesize abnormal (spherical and granular) as well as normal (ellipsoidal and lamellar) melanosomes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite {{having been}} {{declared}} eliminated in December 2005 from India {{as a public}} health problem, the prevalence of leprosy exceeds 1 / 10, 000 population in certain districts/states of India. A spurt in its prevalence by 60 % - from 0. 74 to 1. 18 within 1 -year from 2012 to 2013 in the area under Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) of Pune district of Maharashtra, wherein our institution is located, motivated us to carry out this study. Aims and Objectives: This prospective study entailed recording of the epidemiological data of cases of leprosy and carrying out correlation of their clinical and histopathological diagnoses as per Ridley–Jopling scale along with inclusion of indeterminate and pure neuritic types. Materials and Methods: Eighty fresh untreated patients hailing from areas under PCMC–in whom leprosy was clinically considered to be either the diagnosis or the differential diagnosis-reporting to the department of dermatology of our tertiary care hospital were enrolled. Their age, sex, and clinical findings were recorded on a proforma. Slit skin and scrape smear were stained by the Ziehl–Neelsen method. Punch biopsies–processed and stained by hematoxylin and eosin and Fite-Faraco method for morphological assessment and identification of the lepra bacilli, respectively–were evaluated histopathologically and a clinico-histopathological correlation, attempted. Results: Male to female ratio of the study patients was 2. 3 : 1; their age ranged from 14 to 74 (mean, 36. 67) years. The overall clinico-histopathological concordance observed was 70 %. Five cases of indeterminate leprosy (IL) emerged on histopathological examination from among the nine skin biopsies on patients of dermatoses mimicking leprosy (pityriasis alba, postinflammatory hypopigmentation, <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus,</b> etc.). Conclusion: This study enabled us to detect additional cases of IL (from among dermatoses mimicking leprosy) and led to more accurate typing, thereby underscoring the importance of clinico-histopathological correlation as an important diagnostic aid...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{determine}} the incidence and {{demographic characteristics of}} skin diseases presenting with hyperpigmentation in children applying to the dermatology department. Methods: A total of 2815 {{children between the ages}} of 0 to 16 who applied to the dermatology clinic with the complaints of hyperpigmentation disorders were evaluated. The age, gender, socioeconomic status, place of residence and demographic characteristics of children with abnormal pigmentation skin lesions were investigated. Results: A total of 2815 children applied to the dermatology clinic during the study period. Of these patients 1491 were female (53 %) and 1324 were male (47 %). Of these 266 (9. 4 %) were diagnosed with skin disorders presenting with hyperpigmention. The causes of hyperpigmentation in these patients were was follows; pityriasis alba (2. 6 %), melanocytic nevus (2. 1 %), vitiligo (1. 8 %) postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (0. 5 %), and postinflammatory hypopigmentation (0. 5 %). According to the gender, p. alba, vitiligo, Becker nevus, acanthosis nigricans, tuberosclerosis and albinism were seen more in boys and <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> ephelis, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation and melanocytic nevus were seen more in the girls. Pitriyazis versicolor was seen equally in both genders. According to age groups, melanocytis nevus were found to be more frequent between the ages of 0 - 2 and 12 - 16, whereas pityrsasis versicolor was more frequent in ages 12 - 16 and P. alba in the 3 - 11 age group. Conclusions: There are quite a substantial number of pigmentation diseases occurring in children. Early diagnosis and treatment are important because although these diseases mainly cause cosmetic problems, they can decrease the quality of life. Here, we attempted to define the demographic characteristics of diseases presenting with disorders in pigmentation in children...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVitiligo is a {{refractory}} skin disease. To {{investigate the}} risk factors and treatment responses of patients with vitiligo in Japan, we recorded and analyzed the details of 713 vitiligo patients (comorbidity, treatment responses, family history, age, and sex) who visited the dermatology clinic of the Nagoya City University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan between January 2004 and August 2010 (mean age, 35. 2 years; 302 men, 411 women) using logistic regression analysis. The results are expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Patients were diagnosed with vitiligo [n =  644; 338 generalized type (47. 4 %), 170 segmental type (23. 8 %), and 136 localized type (19. 1 %) ], <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> (n =  53, 7. 4 %), halo nevus (n =  14, 2. 0 %), and hypomelanosis of Ito (n =  2, 0. 3 %). For generalized and localized types, none of the analyzed factors were statistically significant. For the segmental type, antinuclear antibody (OR =  1. 005; 95 % CI, 1. 00 – 1. 01; p  55 years (OR =  0. 0171; 95 % CI, 0. 00333 – 0. 0879; p <  0. 001). The treatment response rates for narrow-band UV-B, topical vitamin D 3, and punch graft (1  mm minigraft) were, respectively, as follows: (1) generalized type: 46. 3 %, 21. 1 %, and 38. 9 %; (2) segmental type: 20. 3 %, 29. 0 %, and 77. 3 %; and (3) localized type: 29. 2 %, 54. 8 %, and 73. 3 %. We report the comorbidities and efficacy rates of these treatments. The response data for these treatments, in particular, would be of assistance to the previous explanations, because {{there were only a}} few reports on the response data for these treatments. The appropriate treatment should be selected depending on the type of vitiligo...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of birthmarks in Taiwanese newborns {{has not been}} well studied. How gender and maturity of newborns affect presentation and prevalenceof vascular birthmarks, in particular, has not been well documented. The aim of this survey was to catalog the above-mentioned problems. Methods: From May 9 through July 14, 2000, 500 newborns in Linkou and TaipeiChang Gung Memorial Hospital nurseries were examined for the presence ofbirthmarks. The data were collected and stored in Excel® software and analyzedusing x 2 -test and Fisher’s exact test for statistical association. Results: The most common pigmentary birthmark was the Mongolian spot (61. 6 %),followed by congenital melanocytic nevi (0. 6 %), café-au-lait spots (0. 4 %),and nevi depigmentosus (0. 4 %). Vascular birthmark frequency was: salmonpatch (27. 8 %), Port-Wine stain (0. 6 %), and hemangioma (0. 2 %). Other miscellaneouschanges included preauricular sinus (0. 6 %), skin tag (0. 6 %), andaccessory auricle (0. 2 %). Prevalence of the vascular salmon patch birthmarksin female infants and male infants was 31. 0 % and 26. 6 %, respectively,but {{the difference was not}} statistically significant (p = 0. 51). The prevalenceof vascular salmon patch birthmarks in full-term infants was 28. 0 %, and 25. 8 % in preterm infants. However, there was also no statistical difference (p= 0. 96) between the two. The two <b>nevus</b> <b>depigmentosus</b> cases were isolatedtypes and neither of these were distributed along the Blaschko lines. Conclusions: The Mongolian spot was the most common birthmark in Taiwanese newborns,followed by the salmon patch. All of the other birthmarks had prevalenceof less than 1 %. The {{prevalence of}} vascular salmon patch birthmarkswas noted in 31. 0 % of female infants and in 26. 6 % of male infants.
