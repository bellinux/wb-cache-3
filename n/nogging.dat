25|$|The {{house is}} a simple two-room {{structure}} with a central chimney. Its framework is composed of a dozen heavy so-called H-bents, visible on {{the interior of the}} house, that resemble goal posts with diagonal braces. This is an ancient northern European method of construction that contrasts with the boxlike house frames that evolved in England. The house had a high-pitched roof that created a large loft for storage. The roof was covered with shingles, and the exterior walls were clad with horizontal wood clapboard siding. A section of the clapboard has been removed at one corner to expose a reconstruction of the brick <b>nogging</b> used as insulation. The interior walls were stuccoed between the upright supports of the H-bents.|$|E

2500|$|The whole terrace has a timber-framed façade with brick <b>nogging</b> (infilling) {{and covered}} with black glazed {{mathematical}} tiles. These were laid in an interlocking pattern to mimic brick, and were frequently used in Brighton in the late 18th century. The glazing produced an iridescent effect which reflected sunlight in a visually pleasing way, and also coped better than bricks with sea-spray and other weathering effects. The houses were originally built with bow windows, but after critics argued that this spoilt the visual effect of the concave curve of the crescent, they were replaced (except at numbers 12 and 14) by canted bay windows with three sides. A parapet, running above numbers 7–10, has the painted legend [...] When the painter of the lettering, a Mr Leggatt, leant back to check his work, he fell off his ladder and was fatally impaled on the metal railings below.|$|E

50|$|Vic and <b>Nog</b> bond quickly, but at {{the expense}} of <b>Nog's</b> {{relations}} with his friends and family; he gets in a fight with Jake and a meeting with his father Rom and stepmother Leeta is short and awkward. Vic and <b>Nog</b> continue to grow closer, and as a Ferengi, <b>Nog</b> is happy to help Vic with his finances, and even recommends Vic expand his business. The two plan to build a new casino, and as <b>Nog</b> becomes more confident, he relies less and less on his cane. Ezri, impressed by Vic's results, reminds him that <b>Nog</b> needs to leave soon; Vic had been enjoying himself so much that he had forgotten <b>Nog</b> was there for rehabilitation. Vic then urges <b>Nog</b> to leave, and when he refuses, Vic self-terminates the program, forcing <b>Nog</b> back into the real world.|$|R

50|$|Brick nog, (<b>nogging</b> or nogged, beam filling) is a {{construction}} technique in which bricks {{are used to}} fill the vacancies in a wooden frame.

40|$|Plant defense {{responses}} at stomata and apoplast are {{the most}} important early events during plant-bacteria interactions. The key components for the signaling of stomatal defense and nonhost resistance have not been fully characterized. Here we report the newly identified small GTPase, Nucleolar GTP-binding protein 1 (<b>NOG</b> 1), functions for plant immunity against bacterial pathogens. Virus-induced gene silencing of <b>NOG</b> 1 compromised nonhost resistance in N. benthamiana and tomato. Comparative genomic analysis showed that two <b>NOG</b> 1 copies are present in all known plant species: <b>NOG</b> 1 - 1 and <b>NOG</b> 1 - 2. Gene downregulation and overexpression studies of <b>NOG</b> 1 - 1 and <b>NOG</b> 1 - 2 in Arabidopsis revealed the novel function of these genes in nonhost resistance and stomatal defense against bacterial pathogens, respectively. Specially, <b>NOG</b> 1 - 2 regulates guard cell signaling in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli through jasmonic acid (JA) - and abscisic acid (ABA) -mediated pathways. The results here provide valuable information on the new functional role of small GTPase, <b>NOG</b> 1, in guard cell signaling and early plant defense in response to bacterial pathogens...|$|R

40|$|The <b>NOG</b> gene encodes noggin, a {{secreted}} polypeptide that {{is important}} for regulating multiple signaling pathways during human development, particularly in cartilage and bone. The hallmark of <b>NOG</b> ‐related syndromes is proximal symphalangism, defined by abnormal fusion of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands and feet. Many additional features secondary to <b>NOG</b> mutations are commonly but inconsistently observed, including a characteristic facies with a hemicylindrical nose, congenital conductive hearing loss due to stapes fixation, and hyperopia. The variable clinical presentations led to the designation of five different autosomal dominant syndromes, all subsequently found to have resulted from <b>NOG</b> mutations. These include (1) proximal symphalangism; (2) multiple synostoses syndrome 1; (3) stapes ankylosis with broad thumbs and toes; (4) tarsal‐carpal coalition syndrome; and (5) brachydactyly type B 2. Herein, we review the phenotypic features associated with mutations in the <b>NOG</b> gene, demonstrating the overlapping characteristics of these syndromes. Due to the variable phenotypic spectrum within families and among families with the same mutation, we propose a unifying term, <b>NOG</b> ‐related symphalangism spectrum disorder (<b>NOG</b> ‐SSD), {{to aid in the}} clinical recognition and evaluation of all affected individuals with these phenotypes.

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{is focusing on}} the word pair men <b>nog</b> (‘but probably), and trying to see the differences in its use in Finnish-Swedish and Swedish-Swedish.

The simple word <b>nog</b> (‘probably’) is used with slightly different definitions in Finnish-Swedish and Swedish-Swedish, which affects the meaning and function of men <b>nog.</b> In this paper it’s the written language that’s being focused on, since there is more material to analyse.
