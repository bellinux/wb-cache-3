25|$|The Greeks {{used the}} term nitron, which was Latinised to nitrum or nitrium, while earlier Hebrews and Egyptians used words with the consonants n-t-r, which leads some to {{speculate}} that the Latin term {{is closer to the}} original than the Greek term.

40|$|Abstract—The {{effects of}} {{asbestos}} wet-stripping agents on {{the efficiency of}} <b>niters</b> used in asbestos removal have been assessed by field measurements, simulations and laboratory studies. Pleated glass-fibre paper filters, the type most commonly used in industry, are unaffected by wet-stripping agents beyond a slight and usually transitory increase in airflow resistance. Resin-wool <b>niters</b> are unaffected by the relatively coarse sprays that we observed in wet-stripping, but are degraded by very fine sprays of wetting agents or penetrating agents, though not by water or encapsulating agent. Both louvres and prefilters significantly reduce the quantity of sprays that reach a filter cartridge during real or simulated wet-stripping. Filter degradation neither progresses nor recovers after exposure to sprays has stopped, and so aerosol penetration measured at any time after exposure should equal the maximum obtained in use. Slurry applied to the surfaces of the filters does not release particles or penetrate through the filters. Crown copyright © 1996 Published b...|$|R

500|$|The English word {{nitrogen}} (1794) {{entered the}} language from the French nitrogène, coined in 1790 by French chemist Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1756–1832), from the French nitre (potassium nitrate, also called saltpeter) and the French -gène, [...] "producing", from the Greek -γενής (-genes, [...] "producer, begetter").

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} multivariate {{bandpass}} filter {{based on the}} trend plus cycle decomposition model. The underlying multivariate dynamic factor model relies on specific formulations for trend and cycle components and produces smooth business cycle indicators with bandpass filter properties. Furthermore, cycle shifts for individual time series are incorporated {{as part of the}} multivariate model and estimated simultaneously with the remaining parameters. The inclusion of leading, coincident, and lagging variables for the measurement of the business cycle is therefore possible without a prior analysis of lead-lag relationships between economic variables. This method also permits the inclusion of time series recorded with mixed frequencies. For example, quarterly and monthly time series can be considered simultaneously without ad hoc interpolations. The multivariate approach leads to a business cycle indicator that is less subject to revisions than those produced by univariate <b>niters.</b> The reduction of revisions is a key feature in real-time assessment of the economy. Finally, the proposed method computes a growth indicator as a byproduct. The new approach of tracking business cycle and growth indicators is illustrated in detail for the Euro area.

40|$|PURPOSE. These {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} study the effect of cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) on rat retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell tight junctions in vitro. METHODS. Cultures of confluent RPE cells from retinas of PVG rats (a strain susceptible to development of experimental uveitis) were prepared on <b>niters</b> and incubated with various stimulants. The function of the tight junction was evaluated by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of the cell monolayer and the passive permeation of [3 H]inulin across confluent RPE cells. The morphology of the intercellular junctions was visualized by immunolocalization of the tight junction-associated protein zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) and F-actin. RESULTS. Seventy-two hours after plating, the RPE cell monolayer showed a mean TER level of 67. 6 ± 18. 8 fl/cm 2. A decrease in TER was observed after treatment with interferon-y (IFN-y) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The addition of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) accelerated the decrease of TER, whereas A^-monomethyR-arginine (L-NMMA) (an NO synthase [NOS] inhibitor) did not further modify the resistance decrease. In contrast, 3 -morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN- 1), a sydnonimine analog and NO donor, increased the TER.

The changes in Gibbs free energy are estimated for different steps of the living-matter origination process; special attention is paid to the processes of proto-cell formation. Just the occurrence of the gas-hydrate periodic honeycomb matrix filled with LMSEs almost completely in its final state accounts for size limitation in the DNA functional groups and the nonrandom location of N-bases in the DNA chains.

40|$|Spectral {{content and}} decay {{characteristics}} with {{time of the}} coda waves from local earthquakes are studied using the data of narrow band-pass <b>niters</b> of six stations distributed in the Kanto district, Japan, and some properties {{of the effects of}} attenuation, excitation and radiation at the source on the coda waves are obtained. The decay characteristics of coda waves determined at a given station are independent of the epicenter location and source size, and depend only upon the duration time measured from the origin time as suggested by AKI (1969). The apparent Q derived from the coda waves at four stations increase with frequency, approximately proportionally to the square root of the frequency, with the values increasing from 120 - 250 at 0. 75 Hz to 800 - 2500 at 24 Hz. The coda excitation at the six stations located on different geological formations also depends on frequency. The difference of coda amplitudes measured at the same lapse time between the stations located on the sediment and the granitic rocks is, on the average 20 times at 0. 75 Hz and less than 1 / 10 at 24 Hz. This behavior suggests the differences in intrinsic Q and inhomogeneity size of the earth's crust beneath the station. The scaling laws of the earthquake source spectra are constructed using the spectral ratios of coda source factors and the source spectrum of the smallest earthquake used in the estimation of coda source factors. The local variation of the source spectrum is found within the area of the Kanto district, which may be attributed to the difference in rupture strength of the earth's crust...|$|R

Since the 1990 s, physical modelling of instruments has become easily implementable in real time, and physical models are now a standard synthesis tool. Source modeling offers a path to further predict, and thus code, target audio signals. Because physical models are difficult to parameterize, however, {{they have not been}} adopted in audio coders outside of speech coding. With the influence of the internet frequently making audio consumers become audio creators as well, interactivity and meaningfulness of representation have become desirable features of future audio coders in their own right. Meanwhile, the MPEG- 4 audio coding standard introduced in 1998 includes tools that allow any subsequent instrument models or algorithms to be implemented and used to code audio. With the objective of increasing the meaningfulness of parameterization, decreasing bit-rate and improving quality, this thesis investigates, through simulation, audio coders that contain source/physical modeling experts and perceptual experts. In Chapter l, we define what we mean by “quality”, discusses the importance of bit rate, meaningfulness of data representation, and outlines the general trends in audio coding which have lead to the current research. Last, the structure of the thesis is outlined. Chapter 2 provides a theoretical and practical background to the techniques which are {{to be used in the}} subsequent studies. These include: an introduction to the human auditory system and a simple perceptual model; warped-linear prediction coding (WLPC); the extended Karplus-Strong algorithm, digital waveguides and physical modeling; and MPEG 42 ̆ 7 s Structured Audio - a generalized system for implementing synthesizers and coding algorithms. Chapter 3 describes the first experiment, in which an adaptively warped audio codec - a codec for which the frequency resolution of the coder is adjusted according to the spectral content of the target audio - is studied using a simple computer interface. A listening test of the adaptively warped audio coder 2 ̆ 7 s quality is made, and the results are discussed. It is found that an improvement in perceived audio quality can be achieved for some classes of sounds, such as guitar, flute and clarinet. Further optimizations of the technique do not seem possible, however, because the algorithm does not allow further source knowledge to be exploited. Chapter 4 describes the second experiment. Here a simple plucked string model (an extension of the Karplus-Strong algorithm introduced in Chapter 2) is used ire concert with warped linear prediction in two separate topologies (WLPCME (Warped Linear Prediction Coding of Model Error) and WLPCMX (Warped Linear Prediction Coding of Model eXcitation)) in an attempt to improve quality. Tests of a simulated codec are made using source guitar recordings that extend beyond the scope of the physical model, thereby testing the ability of the WLP stage to compensate for the simplicity of the physical model stage. Results demonstrate improved quality for the WLPCMX topology. The investigations of the following chapters attempt to improve the physical model stage to further increase quality and, in Chapter 6, to find a parameterization which will improve the WLPCME topology results beyond those for standard WLPC. Chapter 5 introduces a plucked string model for varying fingering pressure. The model uses two waveguides and calculates conditional reflections occuring at the fret immediately following the finger. The reflections are conditional on the pressure applied by the guitar player and the current displacement of the string at the fret. The computationally efficient model is realized in Matlab and PureData and captures some of the nuance of real playing with weak fingering pressure. Extraction of fingering performance controls from a recording remains a difficult problem, however, and synthesis-by-analysis of“rattling string”sounds from insufficient fingering pressure is beyond the scope of the study. Chapter 6 introduces a dual polarization string model (representing horizontal and vertical transverse waves using extended a Karplus-Strong model for each polarization) along with a genetic algorithm (GA) used to parameterize them. As its fitness function, the GA uses the perceptual model introduced in Chapter 2 to evaluate the similarity of the reproduced tone to the original target. The same codec topology as used in Chapter 4 is investigated and the results are compared. The genetic algorithm parameterization for both simple and dual polarization string models yields better sound quality than the codec of Chapter 4, and both WLPCME and WLPCMX outperform the WLPC control case. The benefits of the more complex model are weighed against the increased algorithmic complexity. Additionally, the effects of tension modulation on pitch and their relevance to the string model are discussed. Chapter 7 summarizes the results from the proceeding chapters and concludes the thesis...|$|R
