40|$|Neuro-Linguistic Programming {{is not a}} science, {{although}} it {{has its roots in}} one, psychotherapy, however it can be also used as a method in teaching. The term NLP has three components: <b>neuro,</b> <b>linguistic</b> and <b>programming.</b> The <b>Neuro</b> component refers to the activity of the nervous system of each person; we perceive the world {{with the help of the}} nervous system and the five senses and only then does the information reach the brain. The Linguistic component of NLP deals with how our own language reflects the unique way in which we transmit our reality. The programming part of the concept “looks at the consistent ways in which we think or behave. Just like a computer, each of us runs specific programmes to produce our behavior. ” (Revell J. &Norman S.,In Your Hands, Saffire Press,p. 14, 2002) Teaching by convincing, not manipulating...|$|R

Modelling the training process in sport training can be achieved by applying <b>neuro</b> - <b>linguistic</b> techniques, mental training techniques. Methods We have applied the following test methods: AP 2 - focusing attention, AD - distributive attention, MA - spiritual observation. Findings and results The study took place in groups of junior practitioners of skiing. Tests were applied to participants Ski Clubs Championship of Romania in April 2013, aged 11 - 15 years. The main objective of mental training through techniques <b>neuro</b> - <b>linguistic</b> is to support individual and group sporting activity in any situation: workout or competition in order to increase performance capacity. Other mental training objectives pursued in this study are: increasing attention and concentration reduce anxiety and stress. Conclusion The results show us the profile of the junior skier.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> logic <b>programming,</b> {{which is}} a combination of fuzzy logic programming, introduced by P. Vojtáˇs, and hedge algebras in order to facilitate the representation and reasoning on human knowledge expressed in natural languages. In fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> logic <b>programming,</b> truth values are linguistic ones, e. g., VeryTrue, VeryProbablyTrue, and LittleFalse, taken from a hedge algebra of a linguistic truth variable, and linguistic hedges (modifiers) can be used as unary connectives in formulae. This is motivated by the fact that humans reason mostly in terms of linguistic terms rather than in terms of numbers, and linguistic hedges are often used in natural languages to express different levels of emphasis. The paper presents: (i) the language of fuzzy linguistic logic programming; (ii) a declarative semantics in terms of Herbrand interpretations and models; (iii) a procedural semantics which directly manipulates linguistic terms to compute a lower bound to the truth value of a query, and proves its soundness; (iv) a fixpoint semantics of logic programs, and based on it, proves the completeness of the procedural semantics; (v) several applications of fuzzy linguistic logic programming; and (vi) an idea of implementing a system to execute fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> logic <b>programs...</b>|$|R

The Andalusian Government promoted, under the Instructions of 30 th of June 2013, the implementation of <b>linguistic</b> <b>programs</b> {{in order to encourage}} and support global projects based on the linguistic communication improvement (including non-linguistic subjects) focusing on reading, creativity, writing and multiple literacies. This paper aims to present <b>linguistic</b> <b>programs</b> and projects implemented in Andalusia as a way of sharing good teaching practices. Programs are divided in two groups according to level of participation of teachers. On the one hand, the only program of level 1 is the School Language Project. It requires the participation of 50 % of teachers and it promotes the educational innovation in order to build a linguistic project that will take part in the annual plan of the centre (including all areas). It is also linked to the integrated language curriculum that tries to implement the same structure and strands for Spanish as a mother tongue and English and French as foreign languages. On the other hand, level 2 programs required the participation of 10 % of teachers of an educational centre. These are: Classic Readings, Reading Families, Literary Creativity and Communication. Each program contains a syllabus with different activities and a collaborative space with a specialised community of teachers that are available on line (Portal de Lectura de la Junta de Andalucía). Examples of good teaching practices and projects will be shown during the paper to assess teachers of all areas and to be taken as a referee in other regions and countries. Universidad de Málaga.

The writing {{styles of}} TIME and Newsweek are {{analyzed}} using a specially developed <b>linguistic</b> <b>program.</b> These two news magazines were chosen {{because of their}} wide popularity. As for the results, {{it became obvious that}} both the frequency curve of words and that of characters have not changed for the past 60 years. Also, we have found that the frequency curves have some inflection points and that the genre of English writings can be identified by these points. After counting the percentage of required vocabulary for junior high school students and high school students in English writings, we can derive the relative difficulties of them using fuzzy reasoning. Fuzzy rules are constructed using features of the characteristic curves. We feel {{it would be a good}} guide index when selecting textbooks or supplementary readers...|$|R
