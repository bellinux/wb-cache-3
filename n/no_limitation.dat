5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that since Article 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution is pitched at a high level of generality, there is <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> in the ordinary natural meaning of the phrase. Thus, there is no requirement in the Constitution for personal liberty to be construed narrowly to mean only freedom from physical restraint.|$|E
5|$|One hundred {{players were}} chosen {{to be on the}} ballot for the All-Star Game (minimum of two players from each team), but fans were also given the option to write in any player who was not listed. Ballots were all digital for the fourth {{consecutive}} time, giving fans the ability to cast votes online at NHL.com and Facebook. Votes could also be cast via text messages from mobile devices and Smartphone users could vote by way of a mobile ballot feature. The NHL put <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> on the number of votes an individual could cast. When fan balloting ended, 14.3 million votes had been cast and the top six were named to the All-Star Game. The six top vote recipients were from only two teams, the Pittsburgh Penguins (4) and Chicago Blackhawks (2). Individually, Sidney Crosby led all players with 635,509 votes, while teammate Kris Letang was elected as a write-in candidate. The six players elected by the fans are listed below with their vote totals.|$|E

The chest x-ray in pectus excavatum can show an opacity in the right lung area that can be mistaken for an {{infiltrate}} (such as that seen with pneumonia).

25|$|It is {{said that}} there are countless beings who have {{attained}} buddhahood. Buddhas spontaneously, naturally and continuously perform activities to benefit all sentient beings. However it is believed that one's karma could limit the ability of the Buddhas to help them. Thus, although Buddhas possess <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> from their side on their ability to help others, sentient beings continue to experience suffering {{as a result of the}} limitations of their own former negative actions.|$|E

25|$|During the 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy made {{increasing}} use {{of naval}} aviation as scouts for its cruiser and destroyer squadrons. Due to restrictions imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty and London Naval Treaty, the number of aircraft carriers was strictly regulated; however, there was <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> as to seaplane tenders. Nisshin was a follow-on to the purpose-built seaplane tender design begun with the Chitose-class and was ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy under the 3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme of 1937.|$|E

The Minutes of each meeting of the Board of Directors are published in the band's monthly newsletter, “PBB News and Views” in which playout announcements and other items of general interest are published.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the first}} stage, {{launched}} in 1887, was generally completed by 1892 under general management of architect Konstantin Bykovsky (1841–1906). Bykovsky personally designed most of state-funded buildings. Additions were being built continuously after this date, most notably Roman Klein-designed Gynecology Institute (1896) and Pirogov monument by Vladimir Sherwood (1897). The project was unique to Russia and widely praised overseas: {{for the first time}} in national history, a large medical institution was designed and built with virtually <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> in funds and land, so Bykovsky provided a generous margin for future expansion.|$|E

25|$|Stone (1936): A Boolean algebra is {{the set of}} all clopen sets of a topological space. It is <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> {{to require}} the space to be a totally {{disconnected}} compact Hausdorff space, or Stone space, that is, every Boolean algebra arises in this way, up to isomorphism. Moreover, if the two Boolean algebras formed as the clopen sets of two Stone spaces are isomorphic, so are the Stone spaces themselves, {{which is not the}} case for arbitrary topological spaces. This is just the reverse direction of the duality mentioned earlier from Boolean algebras to Stone spaces. This definition is fleshed out by the next definition.|$|E
500|$|In his {{capacity}} as UGG general counsel, Brownlee {{was responsible for}} its restructuring. [...] Its bylaws provided that only farmers could buy shares directly from the company, but placed <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> on who could buy them from other shareholders. [...] This {{had the effect of}} limiting capital inflow, since few farmers could afford to buy shares during the depression, and transferring control of the company to non-farmers, who were purchasing shares from impoverished farmers. [...] Brownlee's solution was to create two classes of share: an investment share with a par value of $20, and a voting share with a par value of $5. [...] The former could be held by any person, to a maximum of 250 shares per person, while the latter could be held only by farmers, to a maximum of 25 shares per person.|$|E
500|$|As in most Westminster system parliaments, Australia's {{government}} is {{formed by the}} party enjoying {{the confidence of the}} lower House of Parliament, the House of Representatives. However, Australia's Parliament also has a powerful upper house, the Senate, which must pass any legislation initiated by the House of Representatives if it is to become law. The composition of the Senate, in which each state has an equal number of senators regardless of that state's population, was originally designed to attract the Australian colonies into one Federation. The Constitution forbids the Senate to originate or amend a money bill, but places <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> on the Senate's ability to defeat one. In 1970, Gough Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition, had stated of a budget bill, [...] "Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is no mere formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy this Budget and destroy the Government which has sponsored it." ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives—To {{examine a}} new method for {{classifying}} disability subtypes by combining self-reported and performance-based tools to predict mortality in Chinese older adults. Design—Prospective cohort study. Setting—Community-dwelling old adults. Participants— 16, 020 Chinese adults over age 65 from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Measurements—Self-reported Basic Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and physical performance (PP) tests (chair standing, lifting {{a book from}} floor, turning 360 degrees) cross-classified to create mutually exclusive disability subtypes: subtype 0 (<b>no</b> <b>limitations</b> in PP or ADL), subtype 1 (<b>limitations</b> in PP, <b>no</b> <b>limitations</b> in ADL), subtype 2 (<b>no</b> <b>limitations</b> in PP, limitations in ADL), and subtype 3 (limitations in both PP and ADL). Outcome was mortality over three years. Results—Cox proportional hazard models, controlling for sociodemographics, living situation, healthcare access, social support, health status, and life style, showed that older adults without an...|$|R

2500|$|Until 1957, {{there was}} <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> on fielders behind square {{on the leg}} side. [...] The change is often {{attributed}} to the desire to thwart bodyline, but the Bodyline Controversy was in 1933. The conservative instincts of cricket, and the intervention of World War II, may have been factors in the delay, but as the bodyline article explains, {{there was more than}} one reason for the change.|$|E
2500|$|There is also <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> on the Khaleefah’s {{period in}} office, [...] "so {{as long as}} he abides by the sharia’". [...] Critics (Houriya Ahmed and Hannah Stuart of The Centre for Social Cohesion) {{complain}} that non-Muslims living the caliphate are not included among those giving [...] "popular consent" [...] nor able to serve in the government, while the judges ruling over any recall attempt of the caliph are appointed by him or by a judge (the Supreme Judge) who is appointed by the Caliph.|$|E
2500|$|English {{commissions}} in the 19th century {{determined that}} there should be <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> on trawling. [...] They believed that bottom trawling, like tilling of land, actually increased production. [...] As evidence, they noted that a second trawler would often follow a first trawler, and that the second trawler would often harvest even more fish than the first. [...] The reason for this peculiarity is that the destruction caused by the first trawl resulted in many dead and dying organisms, which temporarily attracted a large number of additional species to feed on this moribund mass.|$|E

While earlier presidents were exceptionally cautious in delivering speeches and on almost every occasion submitted them for vetting, Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese made much more use {{of their right to}} speak without government approval, with McAleese doing many live television and radio interviews. Nonetheless, by convention Presidents refrain from direct criticism of the Government.|$|E
2500|$|The United States social {{insurance}} system {{is funded by}} a tax similar to an income tax. Social Security tax of 6.2% is imposed on wages paid to employees.

2500|$|Although <b>no</b> <b>limitation</b> or {{prohibition}} against women's travelling alone is {{mentioned in the}} Quran, there is a debate in some Islamic sects, especially Salafis, regarding whether women may travel without a mahram (unmarriageable relative). Some scholars state that a woman may not travel by herself on a journey that takes longer than three days (equivalent to [...] in medieval Islam). According to the European Council for Fatwa and Research, this prohibition arose from fears for women's safety when travel was more dangerous. Some scholars relax this prohibition for journeys likely to be safe, such as travel with a trustworthy group of men or men and women, or travel via a modern train or plane when the woman will be met upon arrival.|$|E
