40|$|The {{problem of}} {{spurious}} increase in volume fraction of second-phase particles during computer simulations of coarsening is examined. The origin {{of this problem}} is traced {{to the use of}} too long a time step (used for numerical integration of growth rates with respect to time) which leads to small particles with large negative growth rates shrinking to negative radii {{at the end of the}} time step. Such a shrinkage to <b>negative</b> <b>sizes</b> has the effect of pumping solute into the system. It is therefore suggested that the length of the time step be chosen in accordance with the size of the smallest particle present in the system. It is shown that spurious increase in particle Volume has a significant effect on the particle size distributions in the scaling regime (making them broader and more skewed in the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner model). Its effect on coarsening kinetics, however, is found to be small...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} work studied a size-aware type system for functional programs with non-monotonic polynomial size dependencies. In that approach output sizes depended only on input sizes. That is rather restrictive since {{in many cases}} the size of the output can differ for different input data of the same size. In this paper we remove that limitation by presenting value-sensitive size dependencies via indexed families of polynomials. When a program has a family of polynomials as its output-on-input size dependency, then for each actual input value there is an index such that the corresponding polynomial in the family precisely defines the size of the output. We introduce and study a novel size-aware type system in which size annotations are indexed families of max 0 -polynomials; max 0 -polynomials extend polynomials with the max 0 -operation to prevent <b>negative</b> <b>sizes.</b> We prove soundness of the type system and we give several decidability results for different variants of annotations...|$|R
50|$|In 1996 {{a smaller}} format called Advanced Photo System (APS) was {{introduced}} by a consortium of photographic companies {{in an attempt to}} supersede 135 film. Due in part to its small <b>negative</b> <b>size,</b> APS was not taken seriously as a professional format, despite the production of APS SLRs. In the point-and-shoot markets at which the format was primarily aimed, it enjoyed moderate initial success, but still never rivalled the market penetration of 135. Within five years of its launch, cheap digital compact cameras started becoming widely available, and APS sales plummeted.|$|E
5000|$|Development {{of various}} film camera systems must {{ultimately}} {{cater to the}} placement of the frame in relation to the lateral constraints of the perforations and the optical soundtrack area. One clever wide screen alternative, VistaVision, used standard 35 mm film running sideways through the camera gate, so that the sprocket holes were above and below frame, allowing a larger horizontal <b>negative</b> <b>size</b> per frame as only the vertical size was now restricted by the perforations. There were even a limited number of projectors constructed to also run the print-film horizontally. Generally, however, the 1.50:1 ratio of the initial VistaVision image was optically converted to a vertical print (on standard four-perforation 35 mm film) to show with the standard projectors available at theaters, and was then masked in the projector to the US standard of 1.85:1. The format was briefly revived by Lucasfilm in the late 1970s for special effects work that required larger <b>negative</b> <b>size</b> (due to image degradation from the optical printing steps necessary to make multi-layer composites). It went into obsolescence largely due to better cameras, lenses, and film stocks available to standard four-perforation formats, in addition to increased lab costs of making prints in comparison to more standard vertical processes. (The horizontal process was also adapted to 70 mm film by IMAX, which was first shown at the Osaka '70 Worlds Fair.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{other six}} ratios are {{discarded}} {{because they are}} {{just the opposite of}} these, and hence they have exactly the same length, but an opposite direction (i.e., a descending direction, a ratio smaller than 1/1, and a <b>negative</b> <b>size</b> in cents). We obtain commas of four different sizes: the diaschisma, the lesser diesis, the syntonic comma, and the greater diesis. Since S1 (the just A1) and S3 (the just m2) are the most often occurring semitones in this 12-tone scale (see tables above), the lesser diesis, being defined as the ratio between them, is the most often observed comma.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of group size on {{cooperation}} in voluntary contribution mechanism games. As in previous experiments, we study four- and eight-person groups in high and low marginal per capita return (MPCR) conditions. We find a positive effect of group size in the low MPCR condition, as in previous experiments. However, in the high MPCR condition we observe a <b>negative</b> group <b>size</b> effect. We extend the design to investigate two- and three-person groups in the high MPCR condition, and find that cooperation is highest of all in two-person groups. The findings in the high MPCR condition {{are consistent with those}} from n-person prisoner’s dilemma and oligopoly experiments that suggest it is more difficult to sustain cooperation in larger groups. The findings from the low MPCR condition suggest that this effect can be overridden. In particular, when cooperation is low other factors, such as considerations of the social benefits of contributing (which increase with group size), may dominate any <b>negative</b> group <b>size</b> effect...|$|R

50|$|It {{was filmed}} in May 1956 at Colonial Williamsburg. Whereas the usual 35mm flat-screen 1.33:1 ratio {{cinematography}} {{would have been}} considered extravagant for an orientation film, Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot was filmed and exhibited in VistaVision, a high definition widescreen process with approximately the same <b>negative</b> <b>size</b> as 35mm still photography. It was a unique VistaVision film in that it was shown with six-channel stereo sound, whereas most films in that process were either shown in mono or in Perspecta sound. The music for the film was composed and conducted by Bernard Herrmann, who was at the time best known for scoring several Alfred Hitchcock films.|$|E
5000|$|As its 16mm cameras {{had been}} growing {{increasingly}} large through the addition of more features, Minolta introduced a new and much smaller model, the 16 MG, in 1966. It lacked automatic exposure, but included a light meter and match-needle that were almost as {{easy to use and}} offered the added bonus of manual exposure control. The aperture and shutter speed were set at the same time using a single [...] "exposure" [...] dial. The meter was a selenium unit, which did not require a battery and hence allowed the camera to be made smaller. The 16 MGS of 1970 was similar but used single-perforated film, which allowed the <b>negative</b> <b>size</b> to be increased and picture quality improved.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, Kodak {{introduced}} the Pocket Instamatic series {{for its new}} 110 format. The 110 cartridge had the same easy-load design as the 126 format but was much smaller, allowing the cameras to be very compact (hence the [...] "Pocket" [...] designation). The top-of-the-line model was the Pocket Instamatic 60, which featured a stainless steel body, rangefinder, and automatic exposure. More than 25 million Pocket Instamatics were produced in under three years, and the 110 format remained popular into the 1990s. However the small <b>negative</b> <b>size</b> limited quality when using the film emulsion of the period, although in practice most prints were small so this was not as apparent until they were 'blown up' to a larger size.|$|E

50|$|Disc film did {{not prove}} hugely successful, mainly because {{the image on}} the {{negative}} was only 10 mm by 8 mm, leading to generally unacceptable grain and poor definition in the final prints from the analog imaging equipment used at the time. The film was intended to be printed with special 6-element lenses from Kodak, but many labs simply printed discs with standard 3-element lenses used for larger negative formats. The resulting prints often disappointed the consumer. Few labs made the investment required to get the best out the small <b>negative</b> <b>size.</b> A problem with labs of the time was the manual nature of processing the color negative film. This was essentially a manual process, unlike spool-based films, whose chemical processing could be fully automated.|$|E
5000|$|HABS, HAER, and HALS also {{requires}} the increased resolution of large format film. A sheet of 5×7" [...] film has almost twice {{the resolution of}} 4×5" [...] film, and 4×5" [...] is almost 16 times larger than a 35 mm film image (24×36 mm). This added <b>negative</b> <b>size</b> not only allows for more detail, but the large format polyester film is also far more durable than acetate 35 mm stock. HABS, HAER, and HALS require that all submissions to the Library of Congress include the original film (archivally washed) and it must also include contact prints on fiber-based paper; these contact are {{the same size as}} the film being submitted, 4×5", 5×7", 8×10" [...] and the large size allows people to readily see the prints, while 35 mm contacts would be too small and would require magnification.|$|E
50|$|Since {{this process}} {{produces}} neither enlargements nor reductions, {{the image on}} the print is exactly the same size as {{the image on the}} negative. Contact prints are used to produce proof sheets from entire rolls of 35 mm negative (from 135 film cassettes) and 120 (2 film rolls) in order to aid in the selection of images for further enlargement, and for cataloging and identification purposes. For 120 roll film (once a common <b>negative</b> <b>size</b> for popular cameras) and larger film, contact prints are often used to determine the final print size. In medium and large format photography, contact prints are prized for their extreme fidelity to the negative, with exquisite detail that can be seen with the use of a magnifying glass. A disadvantage to using contact prints in the fine-arts is the laboriousness of modifying exposure selectively, when the use of an enlarger can achieve the same purpose.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the 'Diana' labeled cameras, there are over fifty similar variants of the basic design, {{some of which may}} have been produced by other factories and/or manufacturers. The camera was sold under a variety of model names, often accomplished by merely affixing a different stick-on label to the same product. [...] In other cases, slight modifications to the basic design were incorporated. Some Diana clones use a slightly different molding and plastic composition, while other models have a 'bulb' setting for time exposures. Other variants incorporate a 6×6 cm <b>negative</b> <b>size</b> (like the Diana Deluxe), while others have provision for different controls or even separate flash illumination. The 3 aperture version of the classic Diana/Diana clone has apertures of , , and , and it takes 32 mm clip-on filters. The Diana Deluxe variant offers , , and , and takes a 46-49 mm step-up ring, unusual for such a low-end camera. The modern Diana F+ offers four apertures, including a pinhole. Shutter speed is often variable due to manufacturing vagaries, and can vary from 1/200th to 1/30th of a second. [...] As there is no shutter lock, and the shutter mechanism is always held in tension by a spring, multiple exposures with the Diana can be achieved by multiple operations of the shutter release without advancing the film.|$|E
5000|$|Paper texture limits {{what can}} be done with the calotype process. This texture can be seen by holding a piece of copier paper up to the light: the way fibers clump in the paper making process causes a {{relatively}} low contrast pattern that may remind one of bushes growing on a hillside. [...] This pattern persists when paper is waxed, as similarly examining a piece of commercial waxed paper used for wrapping food will show. Since the contrast in the pattern is low, it does not interfere with tracing a drawing if the paper is thin enough for dark lines to show through. But it is very effective at obscuring low contrast patterns and textures and making them invisible. Consequently, calotype photographs can show bold outlines and high-contrast details clearly, but low-contrast details and textures tend to be lost because of non-uniform paper transmittance. Paper texture effects are limiting in nature photography, for example, where one expects to capture subtle patterns such as those produced by plants growing in close proximity or pebbles in a streambed. Early calotype photographers appear to have dealt with texture by composing with an eye for high contrasts and bold outlines. However, they sometimes resorted to inking in the sky areas of their negatives to eliminate distracting mottling. [...] Information given in various works where calotype images are reproduced indicates that negative sizes of 20 x 25 cm (8 x 10 in) or greater were not unusual. [...] This seems practical for a professional who planned to profit from the sale of contact prints that would be {{the same size as the}} original negative, but less so for an amateur because of the large amounts of silver nitrate required. The way paper texture effects become relatively more pronounced as <b>negative</b> <b>size</b> decreases can be demonstrated with a digital camera by photographing a sheet of paper lit from behind, first at a distance where the sheet just overfills the field of view, and then at a closer distance where the field of view is perhaps one third as wide. (A stack of the same paper will appear much more uniform if it is viewed by reflected light with diffuse illumination.) Anyone who wishes to make calotypes today should expect that otherwise successful negatives will suffer in comparison to the best surviving early work if a relatively small format such as 10 x 10 cm (4 x 4 in) is used. Despite the use of large formats and careful paper selection, continuing dissatisfaction with paper stimulated the invention of the collodion on glass process (see Collodion process) that quickly displaced calotypes after 1851, even though paper was the easier medium to work with.|$|E

40|$|Life {{history has}} been implicated as a {{determinant}} of variation in rate of molecular evolution amongst vertebrate species because of a negative correlation between bode size and substitution rate for many Molecular data sets. Both the generality {{and the cause of}} the <b>negative</b> bode <b>size</b> trend have been debated, and the validity of key studies has been questioned (particularly concerning the failure to account for phylogenetic bias). In this study, a comparative method has been used to test for an association between a range of life-history variables-such as body size age at maturity, and clutch size-and DNA substitution rate for three genes (NADH 4, cytochrome b, and c-mos). A negative relationship between body size and rate of molecular evolution was found for phylogenetically independent pairs of reptile species spanning turtles. lizards. snakes, crocodile, and tuatara. Although this Study was limited by the number of comparisons for which both sequence and lite-history data were available, the results, suggest that a <b>negative</b> bode <b>size</b> trend in rate of molecular evloution may be a general feature of reptile molecular evolution. consistent with similar studies of mammals and birds.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that the {{generally}} observed negative sibsize-education association is much less consistent in developing nations, partly because of different cultural customs reflected in family organization. Using data from a national survey in the early 1990 s and from the 1996 census, the present study assesses the effect of number of siblings on education in South Africa. In a multi-level framework, I link family arrangements to the sibship size effect on education for two major population groups with distinctive family arrangements, Whites and Blacks. A negative effect exists for Whites, who have adopted a Western nuclear family system, whereas no effect is shown for Blacks, whose family life operates under extended family organization. The study goes beyond previous efforts by explicitly testing the hypothesis that it is extended family arrangements that protect children from <b>negative</b> sibship <b>size</b> effects: results show that the absence of a <b>negative</b> sibship <b>size</b> effect is restricted to extended households; in Black nuclear and fostering families, by contrast, the negative effect holds just as it does for White families.
