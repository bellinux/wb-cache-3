2500|$|In 1801, Bradford was a rural {{market town}} of 6,393 people, where wool {{spinning}} and cloth weaving {{was carried out}} in local cottages and farms. Bradford was thus <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> nearby Keighley (5,745) and was significantly smaller than Halifax (8,866) and Huddersfield (7,268). This small town acted as a hub for three nearby townships – Manningham, Bowling and Great and Little Horton, which were separated from the town by countryside.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the course}} of the {{communal}} realignment in North Rhine-Westphalia (1975) Gladbeck, original a county borough, and the village Kirchhellen were incorporated into the neighbouring town Bottrop. Censors of the realignment criticized a sparse population between Gladbeck and Bottrop and emphasized that Bottrop was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> Gladbeck. ´Glabotki is nich´ (Glabotki is not) was their catchphrase. [...] With the help of a court decision Gladbeck successfully left Bottrop, thereby cancelling the fusion. [...] Since July 1976 Gladbeck is part of the district of Recklinghausen.|$|E

2500|$|A village would {{challenge}} another village to a game, {{and the two}} villages would then negotiate a day and place for the match. After the Spanish missions were established, the games usually took place on a Sunday afternoon, from about noon until dark. The two teams kicked a small ball (<b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> a musket ball), made by wrapping buckskin around dried mud, trying to hit the goalpost. The single goalpost was triangular, flat, and taller than it was wide, on a long post (Bushnell described it, based on a drawing in a Spanish manuscript, as [...] "like a tall, flat Christmas tree with a long trunk"). There were snail shells, a nest and a stuffed eagle {{on top of the}} goalpost. Benches, and sometimes arbors to shade them, were placed {{at the edges of the}} field for the two teams. Spectators gambled heavily on the games. As the Apalachee did not normally use money, their bets were made with personal goods.|$|E
2500|$|Ambon {{first came}} under attack from Japanese {{aircraft}} on 6 January. Against the Japanese seaplane bombers, the limited Allied air defences held out, but on 24 January Japanese carrier-based Zeroes began appearing and eventually the remaining aircraft were withdrawn, having been completely out-classed. On 30 January, [...] a Japanese fleet including two aircraft carriers and about 5,000 Japanese marines and soldiers reached Ambon. Although the Japanese ground forces were numerically <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the Allies, they had overwhelming superiority in air support, naval and field artillery, and tanks. In {{the belief that the}} terrain of the southern side of the island was too inhospitable for landings, the Allied troops were concentrated in the north. However, the initial Japanese landings were in the south, while other landings found the more lightly defended southern beaches. [...] The Australians had been tasked with defending the Bay of Ambon, and the Laha and Liang airfields.|$|E

50|$|For example, the {{condition}} number {{associated with the}} linear equationAx = b gives a bound on how inaccurate the solution x will be after approximation. Note that this is before the effects of round-off error are taken into account; conditioning is a property of the matrix, not the algorithm or floating point accuracy of the computer used to solve the corresponding system. In particular, one should think of {{the condition}} number as being (very roughly) {{the rate at which}} the solution, x, will change with respect to a change in b. Thus, if the condition number is large, even a small error in b may cause a large error in x. On the other hand, if the condition number is small then the error in x will <b>not</b> be <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the error in b.|$|R

Will this Commission have the backbone to politically assess a project that threatens EU unity and its core values, undermines the Union’s commonly agreed commitment to building an Energy Union and facilitates Russia’s aggression against Ukraine?

5000|$|Bill Fay's work {{enjoyed a}} growing cult {{status in the}} 1990s. His first two albums were re-issued in 1998, an event which Bill Fay {{described}} in 2012 as follows: Up until 1998, when some people reissued my albums, as far as I was concerned, I was gone, deleted. No one was listening. But then I got the shock that people remembered my music. I was doing some gardening, and listening to some of my songs on cassette, {{and a part of}} me thought they were quite good. I thought, [...] "Maybe somebody will hear them someday." [...] That same evening, 14 years ago, I {{got a call from a}} music writer telling me that my two albums were being reissued. A shock is <b>not</b> gonna get <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> that, David ... It was astonishing to me. I won't ever really be able to believe that it happened. That's how I feel about it. I had come to terms with the fact that I was deleted, but that I had always kept writing songs anyway and that was good enough.|$|R
60|$|It {{is certain}} my Don Quixote was in two small, stout volumes <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> each <b>than</b> my Goldsmith's 'Greece', bound {{in a sort}} of law-calf, well fitted to {{withstand}} the wear they were destined to undergo. The translation was, of course, the old-fashioned version of Jervas, which, whether it was a closely faithful version or not, was honest eighteenth- century English, and reported faithfully enough the spirit of the original. If it had any literary influence with me the influence must have been good. But I cannot make out that I was sensible of the literature; it was the forever enchanting story that I enjoyed. I exulted in the boundless freedom of the design; the open air of that immense scene, where adventure followed adventure with the natural sequence of life, and the days and the nights were not long enough for the events that thronged them, amidst the fields and woods, the streams and hills, the highways and byways, hostelries and hovels, prisons and palaces, which were the setting of that matchless history. I took it as simply as I took everything else in the world about me. It was full of meaning that I could not grasp, and there were significances of the kind that literature unhappily abounds in, but they were lost upon my innocence. I did not know whether it was well written or not; I never thought about that; it was simply there in its vast entirety, its inexhaustible opulence, and I was rich in it beyond the dreams of avarice.|$|R

60|$|I {{forgot the}} beauty of those hills as we drew into the station. It was {{the morning after the}} {{surrender}} of Nicholson's Nek. I had come to join an army already tremendously astonished and shattered. The sunny prospect of a triumphal procession to Pretoria which had been still in men's minds at Durban had vanished altogether. In rather less than a fortnight of stubborn fighting we had displayed a strategy that was flighty rather than brilliant, and lost a whole battery of guns and nearly twelve hundred prisoners. We had had compensations, our common soldiers were good stuff at any rate, but the fact was clear that we were fighting an army <b>not</b> only very <b>much</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> ours but better equipped, with bigger guns, better information, and it seemed superior strategy. We were being shoved back into this Ladysmith and encircled. This confused, disconcerted, and thoroughly bad-tempered army, whose mules and bullocks cumbered the central street of the place, was all that was left of the British Empire in Natal. Behind it was an unprotected country and the line to Pietermaritzburg, Durban, and the sea.|$|R
