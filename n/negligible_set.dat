In the sub-Riemannian Heisenberg group {{equipped}} with its Car-not-Carathéodory metric {{and with a}} Haar measure, we consider isodiametric sets, i. e. sets maximizing the measure among all sets with a given diameter.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 The {{pollination}} {{biology of}} lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea subsp. minus L.) was researched to determine possible modes of pollination and methods to enhance pollination for increased fruit set.

40|$|AbstractThe {{fire risk}} in the {{photovoltaic}} systems has emerged {{over the years as}} not <b>negligible,</b> <b>setting</b> in motion a process, which involves various organizations (control Authorities, standardization bodies, modules manufacturers, etc.) for achieving the codification of construction, design and installation of these systems and their components to minimize fire risk. Currently, European standards focused specifically on fire behavior of PV modules don’t exist yet, so test protocols focused on other equipment are used to test PV modules reaction to fire. About that, a research program was carried out to do a short analysis of PV systems fire events, to analyze the current test protocols and for identifying their criticalities and possible improvements. In particular, some variants of these protocols have been developed basing on some of the existing test protocols in standard harmonized at European level about reaction to fire of construction products. These variants have been designed for being specific test tools for determination of reaction to fire features of PV modules with main attention to important peculiarities such as: modules inclination, initial fire particularly aggressive...|$|R

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{open question}} is whether every countable collection of Lipschitz functions on a Banach space X with separable dual has a common point of Fréchet differentiability. We show {{that the answer is}} positive for some infinite-dimensional X. Previously, even for collections consisting of two functions this has been known for finite-dimensional X only (although for one function the answer is known to be affirmative in full generality). Our aims are achieved by introducing a new class of null sets in Banach spaces (called Γ-null sets), whose definition involves both the notions of category and measure, and showing that the required differentiability holds almost everywhere with respect to it. We even obtain existence of Fréchet derivatives of Lipschitz functions between certain infinite-dimensional Banach spaces; no such results have been known previously. Our main result states that a Lipschitz map between separable Banach spaces is Fréchet differentiable Γ-almost everywhere provided that it is regularly Gâteaux differentiable Γ-almost everywhere and the Gâteaux derivatives stay within a norm separable space of operators. It is easy to see that Lipschitz maps of X to spaces with the Radon-Nikod´ym property are Gâteaux differentiable Γ-almost everywhere. Moreover, Gâteaux differentiability implies regular Gâteaux differentiability with exception of another kind of <b>negligible</b> <b>sets,</b> so-called σ-porous sets. The answer to the question is therefore positive in every space in which every σ-porous set is Γ-null. We show that this holds for C(K) with K countable compact, the Tsirelson space and for all subspaces of c 0, but that it fails for Hilbert spaces. 1...|$|R
