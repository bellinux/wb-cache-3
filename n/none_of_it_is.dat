25|$|The river has {{provided}} the power {{for a number of}} water mills along its course. At Twyford, there have been mills since at least 1365, and a silk mill was built in 1810. Silk worms thrive on mulberry trees, and Queen Elizabeth I had encouraged planting of them during her reign. The Wokingham area was known for its production of silk stockings, and Thomas and George Billing, who were from Macclesfield and were brothers, hoped to create a profitable business processing the silk. The spun silk was woven on looms set up in cottages, and for a while the Billings were reasonably successful, although labour costs were kept down by employing children who should have been at Polehampton School. The law changed to allow silk to be imported more freely from France, and only mills equipped with up-to-date equipment could compete. Thomas died in 1824, and the mill was sold to become a flour mill soon afterwards. The wooden building was burnt down in a fire in 1891. A new mill was built, and in 1927 was bought by Berks, Bucks and Oxon Farmers Ltd, a group of farmers who operated as a co-operative to mill animal feed. The mill was powered by water wheels and diesel engines until the early 1960s, when it was converted to use electric motors. A distribution warehouse was added in 1969, but another fire destroyed the building in 1976, and construction of a new mill was completed in 1979. The owners became bankrupt in the 1990s, and in 2001 the site was redeveloped for housing. Although <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> original, much of the building has four storeys, as did the pre-1976 building, and incorporates cosmetic features to suggest the previous use of the site.|$|E

[...] Essayist Amy Britton interpreted the artwork as an allusion to the Bush administration's [...] "road map for peace" [...] plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Joseph Tate, likening the art to the paintings of French artist Jean Dubuffet, found it depicted a [...] "homogenized and heavily regimented" [...] portrayal of [...] "capitalism's glaring visual presence: an oppressive sameness of style and color that mirrors globalization's reduction of difference."

AllMusic's Andy Kellman felt that, despite Usher's shift to dance music, [...] "he's more of a creative force when he's working with slower, soul-rooted material". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times described the album as not genre defying, but instead utilises the music styles of the [...] era– it's [...] "more pop than it is revolutionary". Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club said that [...] "not all of it works, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unpleasant, either", and commended Usher for branching out and taking risks.
