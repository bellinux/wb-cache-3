5|$|Scully is told by {{the scarred}} man that William is part alien and that she {{is being used to}} raise the child. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Doggett tell Scully that the man's DNA is a match to Mulder's, but Scully refuses to believe it. While the three are talking, the scarred man quietly slips into William's room with a syringe. Though William's crying alerts the agents, the scarred man manages to sneak out of the room before they reach William. Reyes and Scully take the baby to the {{hospital}} and Doggett discovers the man's syringe. The doctor reports that William is fine except for an elevated amount of iron in his blood. In interrogation, Scully confronts the scarred man about his motives. It is revealed that he is actually Jeffrey Spender, a former FBI agent supposedly killed by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) three years earlier. Spender is also Mulder's half-brother. Spender admits his actions were a ruse and that the syringe contained magnetite meant to make William normal. He explains that the aliens need the child in order to successfully invade the world, but <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> lost him. However, he notes that the conspirators will always pursue the child, despite what he has done. Spender says that he acted out of his hatred for his father, since the new conspiracy was created by The Smoking Man after the alien rebels burned the original group.|$|E
5|$|With the Autobots gone, the Decepticons {{launch a}} {{full-scale}} assault on New York City, randomly annihilating buildings and causing mayhem {{as part of}} a simultaneous galaxy-wide assault. The initial human aerial counterattack is annihilated. Even opposed by Colonel Daniel Witwicky, the Decepticons decimate all further military assaults and destroy all bridges and tunnels leading into the city. The Decepticon assault moves to other cities in the country, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., as the Constructicons begin to build in what was once Manhattan. On Cybertron, the dispirited and beaten Autobots begin to fall apart as Ironhide clashes with Prowl over the traitor in their midst. Another group of Autobots under Kup's command crashed on the planet after the Decepticons gained the access codes, where it is revealed that the situation is grave: Megatron has taken the Matrix. The humans attempt to send in a small commando team to assassinate Megatron, but the party is killed by Ratbat before even making across the river - all save their commander Spike. As the Decepticon assault spreads to other parts of Earth, the Decepticons begin to fall apart internally, with even Megatron worrying about the leadership challenges he will face <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no enemy. The slaughter in Israel and Beijing worries other nations enough for them to contemplate using nuclear weapons on New York. On Cybertron the Swarm emerge, forcing the Autobots to flee once more.|$|E

25|$|Elbegdorj met Khajidsuren Bolormaa at a Mongolian students' {{party in}} Lviv, Ukraine {{when they were}} students. After their {{marriage}} in Ulaanbaatar, their first son was born in Lviv, Ukraine. They helped over 300 orphans through their Bolor Foundation. They adopted twenty children from the state run Orphan Care Center (orphanage) in Ulaanbaatar after being the children's patrons for some time. <b>Now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> twenty five children: four sons {{of their own and}} twenty one adopted children.|$|E
25|$|Aydın {{city centre}} is still {{relatively}} small but growing, centred on one palm-lined avenue of shops and cafes, and {{a maze of}} narrow side streets, dotted with orange trees. The people are traditional and family-oriented, so there is little night life, or cultural amenities for young people, although presumably <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a university this will change. There {{are a number of}} mosques, high schools, dersane (private courses cramming students for the university entrance exams) and other public buildings. Like all Turkish cities Aydın is now spreading as the middle-classes are leaving their flats in the city for smarter apartments or houses slightly out of town.|$|E

25|$|I wish to firmly {{state that}} the Friars and Sisters of the {{religious}} community in Bethlehem cannot be considered as hostages. They have freely chosen to remain in that place, the custody {{of which has been}} entrusted to them by the Holy See, and which constitutes their home. The other 200 Palestinians besieged inside the Basilica have taken refuge there by force in order to flee from the sweep and search by the Israeli army, just as had happened to the 5 Italian journalists during {{the first day of the}} siege. Up to <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not committed any act of violence or abuse of power against the religious community.|$|E
25|$|While amate {{is made in}} a {{few small}} villages in {{northern}} Puebla, northern Veracruz and southern Hidalgo state, only San Pablito in Puebla manufactures the paper commercially. San Pablito is a village in the municipality of Pahuatlán located in the Sierra Norte de Puebla. Tulancingo, Hidalgo is the closest urban center. The area is very mountainous and the village itself {{is on the side}} of a mountain called the Cerro del Brujo. The making of the paper is the primary economic activity of the community and has alleviated poverty in the village. Before the villagers only had very small houses made of wood, but <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> much larger houses made of block. The paper makers here guard the process greatly and will sever contact with anyone seeking to replicate their work. In addition to providing income to the paper makers themselves the craft has been employing an increasing number of people to harvest bark, over an area which now extends over 1,500km2 in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region. The village manufactures large quantities of paper, still using mostly pre-Hispanic technology and various tree species for raw material. About half of this paper production is still sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero.|$|E

500|$|The first {{official}} trailer for X-Men: Days of Future Past {{was released in}} October 2013. Jason Callina of Herald News gave the trailer a positive response, saying, [...] "it is fantastic to see characters that I grew up with in the flesh...we still {{have to wait till}} the end of May to see if Fox succeeded, but for <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> my interest". Ben Child of The Guardian criticized the trailer for the amount of characters that will appear in the film. Child wrote, [...] "overloading the movie with superheroes might please fans of the comic books, but the rest of us will be chewing on our own spleens when the umpteenth brightly coloured dude turns up to spout one line of dialogue, then drop off the map".|$|E
500|$|The album artwork was {{designed}} by John Lorenzi, who contributed to the covers on Megadeth's two previous albums, Endgame and United Abominations (2007). The title was revealed as 13, with Mustaine commenting [...] "I started playing guitar at 13 and this is our 13th record and I was born on the 13th. As soon as I said I {{was going to call}} it '13', I started noticing 13 everywhere. They never used to have 13th floors in hotels but <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> them again." [...] One day later, the band revealed that the title would be rendered as [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] instead of 13. Drover stated in a subsequent interview that [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] had originally been the working title for the album. The cover artwork and track list for the album were revealed on September 7, 2011.|$|E

[...] a major problem [...] People at the highest levels of the military are involved in the facilitation [...] In other African countries government officials are part of the problem. In Guinea-Bissau, it is the government itself that is the problem." [...] A sentiment echoed by regional UN staff. The head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for West and Central Africa Pierre Lapaque also said: [...] "There has clearly been an increase in Guinea-Bissau in the last several months. We are seeing more and more drugs regularly arriving in this country;" [...] while the EU's ambassador to the country Joaquin Gonzalez-Ducay added: [...] "As a country it is controlled by those who formed the coup d’état. They can do what they want to do. <b>Now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> free rein." ...|$|E
