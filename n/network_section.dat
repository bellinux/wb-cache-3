30|$|While {{programmable}} wireless devices (such as SDRs and CRs) do {{serve as}} the building block for programmable wireless networking infrastructures, it is pertinent to note here that the task of building programmable wireless networks is much more nuanced.

Historically, most of the CR research has focused on optimizing at a device level, with network-level programmability being a recent afterthought[64]. In the subsequent sections, we will see how trends of software-defined <b>networks</b> (<b>Section</b> 4.1) and cognitive <b>networks</b> (<b>Section</b> 4.2) allow us to extend the programmability concepts to network proportions.|$|R
