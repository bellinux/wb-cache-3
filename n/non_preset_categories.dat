40|$|Abstract Objective: Develop a {{representation}} of clinical observations and actions and a method of processing free-text patient documents to facilitate applications such as quality assurance Design: The Linguistic String Project (LSP) system of New York University utilizes syntactic analysis, augmented by a sublanguage grammar and an information structure that are specific to the clinical narrative, to map free-text documents into a database for querying. Measurements: Information precision (I-P) and information recall (I-R) were measured for queries {{for the presence of}} 13 asthma-health-care quality assurance criteria in a database generated from 59 discharge letters. Results: I-P, using counts of major errors only, was 95. 7 % for the 28 -letter training set and 98. 6 % for the 31 -letter test set. I-R, using counts of major omissions only, was 93. 9 % for the training set and 92. 5 % for the test set. n J Am Med Informatics Assoc. 1994; 1 : 142 - 160. The attention currently being given to the computer-based patient record 1, 2 adds impetus to the devel-opment of representational structures for ‘clinical data. It is hoped that standardized structures can be de-veloped to serve as a framework for combining pa-tient data from multiple sources. In the evolution of computerized patient record systems, the contro-versy between free text and <b>preset</b> <b>categories</b> for re-cording patient data has not been resolved. The need for standards pushes toward <b>preset</b> <b>categories</b> and controlled vocabularies, while the need for expressive power, so as not to distort the patient data, speaks for allowing some amount of free-text reporting. A compromise that is not compromising is called for. It is the aim of this paper to show that the techniques of linguistic analysis and natural-language processing (NLP) can contribute to this effort. Within medical informatics there has been a long-standing concern with medical language. In a 197...|$|R
50|$|Here Neal {{analyzes}} {{the many ways}} in which black masculinity is constructed, reconstructed, read and misread in contemporary American culture. His thesis argues that black boy and men are bound by their legibility; their ability to be clearly stereotyped and placed into <b>preset</b> <b>categories.</b> This type of profiling divvies up black masculinity into something non-threatening enough for White America to accept and be at peace with. The illegible areas thus become unsettling. That which does not fit into say the thug or criminal category is incomprehensible and thus don't belong to black masculinity. Through looking at black male figures such as Jay Z, Luther Vandross and R. Kelly, Neal explores how varied representations of the black man are able to break the public antagonism against black male bodies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Concept-to-Speech systems include Natural Language Generators {{that produce}} linguistically enriched text {{descriptions}} {{which can lead}} to significantly improved quality of speech synthesis. There are cases, however, where either the generator modules produce pieces of non-analyzed, non-annotated plain text, or such modules are not available at all. Moreover, the language analysis is restricted by the usually limited domain coverage of the generator due to its embedded grammar. This work reports on a language-independent framework basis, linguistic resources and language analysis procedures (word/sentence identification, partof-speech, prosodic feature annotation) for text annotation/processing for plain or enriched text corpora. It aims to produce an automated XML-annotated enriched prosodic markup for English and Greek texts, for improved synthetic speech. The markup includes information for both training the synthesizer and for actual input for synthesising. Depending on the domain and target, different methods may be used for automatic classification of entities (words, phrases, sentences) to one or more <b>preset</b> <b>categories</b> such as “emphatic event”, “new/old information”...|$|R
40|$|We present two simple {{statistical}} methods for analyzing spoken language as represented in transcription corpora. The methods are strictly data-driven, {{in the sense}} that no <b>preset</b> grammatical <b>category</b> system and no lexical knowledge are assumed. The first method (called Siblings) is used for word type clustering within one language; the second method (called Cousins) is used for word-to-word translation between two cognate languages. Examples are given using Danish and Swedish transcription data. We conclude with a discussion of how the methods could be applied to languages that do not have a writing system at all – and no record of linguistic description. 1...|$|R
40|$|Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a {{quantitative}} marker for ovarian reserve, {{has been suggested}} to be independent of the classical endocrine fluctuations of the menstrual cycle. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine whether AMH levels are constant throughout the menstrual cycle, compared with those of FSH, LH, and estradiol. Frequent blood sampling was performed in 44 fertile, regularly cycling, female volunteers during one full menstrual cycle. The study was conducted at a university hospital. AMH, FSH, LH, and estradiol measurements were allocated to one of seven cycle phases, and a multilevel analysis was performed. Consistent fluctuation patterns were tested by fitting sine patterns to the data. Finally, the frequency in which randomly selected individual samples would remain in one of five <b>preset</b> level <b>categories</b> (quintiles) for each of the variables was studied. A sine pattern fitted to the AMH data was not statistically significant (P = 0. 40). In contrast, sine patterns for FSH, LH, and estradiol were highly significant. Comparing the seven cycle phases, no significant differences could be observed between phase-specific AMH levels (P = 0. 06). Repeated selection of AMH samples for each individual showed that in 71. 5 % of selections, AMH values remained in the same quintile, whereas in 27. 9 % values fell in an adjacent quintile. AMH levels measured through a full menstrual cycle did not show consistent fluctuation patterns in contrast to levels of FSH, LH, and estradiol.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} a {{political}} speech given by {{the leader of the}} opposition party during the run up to the UK elections in 2005. Using this speech as a starting point, we attempt to trace the path of ‘racism’ within a text that makes explicit claims to being ‘not racist’. Drawing on a number of theoretical and methodological resources, this paper approaches the analysis by focusing on a number of conceptually heterogeneous elements that, in relation with each other, function to produce, re-produce and stabilize ‘racism’. One of the difficulties commonly encountered in social psychological work, we would suggest, is that an explicit statement of allegiance to a particular methodological and theoretical tradition can also result in a restriction of theorization to a particular ‘level of analysis’. That is to say, a methodological process that constructs a pre-given <b>category,</b> <b>presets</b> the criteria by which ‘racism’ can be identified and fixes the ‘level of analysis’ at which it can be studied risks ignoring the multiple points of contact at which ‘racism’ can be made visible or made to disappear...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about online dating relationships, or the online dating persona that {{intentionally}} forms and develops interpersonal relationships through online matchmaking services. Online dating relationships are becoming more prevalent, especially in South Africa. However, research studies focussing on online dating relationships seems to be lacking. Hence, a scientific psychological enquiry into online dating relationships, and more specifically the online dating persona, is indicated. Focussing on 100 online dating members from DatingBuzz, this comparative research study investigated online dating relationships and the online dating persona. More specifically, this study examined, first, online dating relationships specifically within the South African context compared to online dating relationships internationally; and second, the South African online dating persona. This was done by creating a profile focussing on (a) sociodemographic characteristics, (b) personality characteristics, (c) level of emotional intelligence and, (d) life effectiveness skills. A quasi-comparative research design was used with a non-probability, non-random sample of convenience. The realised sample for this research was 100 participants (N= 100), with the total sample (n= 100) reporting on online dating relationships and 67 participants (n= 67) reporting on the online dating persona. The online matchmaking service, DatingBuzz, consented to post an advertisement for research participation. Using an Internet-based questionnaire with <b>preset</b> response <b>categories</b> in a Likert type format, data collection continued consecutively for six months in 2005. Instruments included (a) a set of self-constructed questions assessing online dating relationships and the sociodemographic characteristics of the online dating persona, (b) Sauciers’ 40 Mini-marker Set to examine the Big Five personality traits, (c) the 33 -item EIS scale to investigate emotional intelligence and, (d) the LEQ – H to examine life effectiveness skills. The data were statistically analysed using the SAS programme and included descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA) in terms of gender, age, relationship status, geographical location and relationship type. Consistent with previous findings, this research study found comparisons between South African and international online dating relationships. Looking at the online dating persona profile, significant findings pertaining to sociodemographic traits, Big Five personality traits, level of emotional intelligence and life effectiveness skills. These preliminary findings are discussed in relations to methodological and research issues. Dissertation (MA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008. Psychologyunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} In order {{to apply the}} Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) to {{products}} or services, specific rules [Product Category Rules (PCR) ] have to be issued to ensure comparability among different declarations within the same service group. The aim {{of the present study}} is to describe the reasons leading to each choice in the development of PCR applied to Collecting and Treatment Service of Municipal Wastewater and to evaluate, through life cycle analysis (LCA), their influence on the potential environmental impact of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), analysed as a case study. Specific data were collected during the year 2003 from an Italian active sludge treatment plant with separate wastewater and sludge treatment lines. Materials and methods The PCR 2005 : 5 (Collecting and treatment service of municipal wastewater (MWW). Product group/service type: refuse disposal, sanitation and similar activities, NACE code: 90) document was prepared by the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering “G. B. Bonino” (University of Genoa, Italy). This PCR was tested on the Collection and Treatment Service of Municipal Wastewater in a wastewater treatment plant located in Savona, Italy (Consorzio per la Depurazione delle Acque di Scarico). The PCR 2005 : 5 document was issued in an open and participatory process between companies and organizations having good knowledge of the specific environmental aspects of the service {{to be included in the}} EPD® system. PCR, LCA, and EPD studies were developed according to the document “Requirements for an International EPD Scheme” (EU funded LIFE Env 2003 program, INTEND Project, www. intendproject. net). Results The following LCA-based information was considered in preparing the PCR: definition of service type, definition of functional unit, choice and description of system boundaries, choice of cutoff criteria, choice of allocation rules, description of quality requirements for data, choice of selected LCI results or other selected parameters for description of environmental performance to be included in the declaration, description of parameters contributing to each <b>preset</b> <b>category,</b> description of specific information to be included in the use stage of the declaration, other environmental information. Ecotoxicity characterization factors, evaluated by the model Uniform System for the Evaluation of Substances (USES-LCA), was added to the PCR as an Annex. The potential environmental impacts of the considered case study were evaluated separately for the following phases: sewer net and plant construction, sewer net and plant management, sludge management. Alternative sludge management techniques were investigated. Discussion PCR of Collecting and Treatment Service of Municipal Wastewater (MWW) was prepared in an open and participatory process between companies and organizations having in-depth knowledge of the specific environmental aspects of the service, in order to safeguard the provision and input of appropriate product-specific knowledge from relevant companies and branch organizations. The main problems characterizing the open consultation regarded are functional unit, system boundaries, boundary in time, parameters to be declared, and other information. Conclusions The annual amount of treated wastewater was considered as a functional unit. In order to evaluate water quality aspects, the request for additional information [biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) /chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrient removal] was added to the PCR document. These characteristics aim to complete the lack of information about wastewater quality due to the use of a fixed amount of wastewater as a functional unit. The following parameters were identified: resources use (use of nonrenewable resources, use of renewable resources, water consumption, electricity consumption), pollutant emissions as potential environmental impact (global warming, acidification, ozone depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, eutrophication), and new standard parameters (fresh aquatic ecotoxicity, fresh sediment ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, marine sediment ecotoxicity). The reference model used for the calculation of toxicity potentials was the global nested multimedia fate, exposure and effects model USES-LCA. The comparison of the LCA results obtained for the considered life cycle phases shows that sewer net and plant construction have less than 10 % of the total impacts for all the considered categories. Plant management has a higher impact with respect to sewer net and sludge management. In general, sludge treatment for agricultural land application has a lower impact than its treatment in landfill, but the specific results depend on the impact categories. Recommendations and perspectives One of the most important properties of EPDs is that they provide possibilities to add up and accumulate information along the supply chain as well as to make comparisons between declarations with regard to the environmental performance of products and services. Therefore, the PCR 2005 : 5 document has been prepared to ensure comparability between declarations within collecting and treatment service of municipal wastewater. However, a new revised version of these rules has to be prepared according to the newly published ISO standard for EPD (ISO 14025) and to the incoming revision document of the international EPD® system...|$|R
