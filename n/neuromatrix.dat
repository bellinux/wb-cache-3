40|$|The elucidation upon fly's {{neuronal}} patterns as a link {{to computer}} graphics and memory cards I/O's, is investigated for the phenomenon by propounding a unified theory of Einstein's two known relativities. It is conclusive that flies could contribute {{a certain amount of}} <b>neuromatrices</b> indicating an imagery function of a visual-computational system into computer graphics and storage systems. The visual system involves the time aspect, whereas flies possess faster pulses compared to humans' visual ability due to the E-field state on an active fly's eye surface. This behaviour can be tested on a dissected fly specimen at its ommatidia. Electro-optical contacts and electrodes are wired through the flesh forming organic emitter layer to stimulate light emission, thereby to a computer circuit. The next step is applying a threshold voltage with secondary voltages to the circuit denoting an array of essential electrodes for bit switch. As a result, circuit's dormant pulses versus active pulses at the specimen's area are recorded. The outcome matrix possesses a construction of RGB and time radicals expressing the time problem in consumption, allocating time into computational algorithms, enhancing the technology far beyond. The obtained formulation generates consumed distance cons(x), denoting circuital travel between data source/sink for pixel data and bendable wavelengths. Once 'image logic' is in place, incorporating this point of graphical acceleration permits one to enhance graphics and optimize immensely central processing, data transmissions between memory and computer visual system. The phenomenon can be mainly used in 360 -deg. display/viewing, 3 D scanning techniques, military and medicine, a robust and cheap substitution for e. g. pre-motion pattern analysis, real-time rendering and LCDs.

50|$|Opposition to the <b>neuromatrix</b> theory exists {{largely because}} {{it fails to}} explain why relief from phantom sensations rarely {{eliminates}} phantom pains. It also does not address how sensations can spontaneously end and how some amputees do not experience phantom sensations at all.

50|$|The <b>neuromatrix</b> theory {{proposes that}} there is an {{extensive}} network connecting the thalamus and the cortex, and the cortex and the limbic system. It is a theory that extends beyond body schema theory and incorporates the conscious awareness of oneself. This theory proposes that conscious awareness and the perception of self are generated in the brain via patterns of input that can be modified by different perceptual inputs. The network is genetically predetermined, and is modified throughout one’s lifetime by various sensory inputs to create a neurosignature. It is the neurosignature of a specific body part that determines how it is consciously perceived. The input systems contributing to the neurosignature are primarily the somatosensory, limbic, and thalamocortical systems. The <b>neuromatrix</b> theory aims to explain how certain activities associated with pain lead to the conscious perception of phantom pain. The persistence of the neurosignature, even after limb amputation, may be the cause of phantom sensations and pain. Phantom pain may arise from abnormal reorganization in the <b>neuromatrix</b> to a pre-existing pain state.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The <b>neuromatrix</b> {{theory of}} pain proposes that pain is a multidimensional {{experience}} produced by characteristic “neurosignature ” patterns of nerve impulses {{generated by a}} widely distributed neural network—the “body-self neuromatrix”—in the brain. These neurosignature patterns may be triggered by sensory inputs, but {{they may also be}} generated independently of them. Acute pains evoked by brief noxious inputs have been meticulously investigated by neuroscientists, and their sensory transmission mechanisms are generally well understood. In contrast, chronic pain syndromes, which are often characterized by severe pain associated with little or no discernible injury or pathology, remain a mystery. Furthermore, chronic psychological or physical stress is often associated with chronic pain, but the relationship is poorly understood. The <b>neuromatrix</b> theory of pain provides a new conceptual framework to examine these problems. It proposes that the output patterns of the body-self <b>neuromatrix</b> activate perceptual, homeostatic, and behavioral programs after injury, pathology, or chronic stress. Pain, then, is produced by the output of a widely distributed neural network in the brain rather than directly by sensory input evoked by injury, inflammation, or other pathology. The <b>neuromatrix,</b> which is genetically determined and modified by sensory experience, is the primary mechanism that generates the neural pattern that produces pain. Its output pattern is determined by multiple influences, of which the somatic sensory input is only a part, that converge on the <b>neuromatrix...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} rehabilitation of pain patients. The fundamental principles of the approach are (i) pain is an output {{of the brain that}} is produced whenever the brain concludes that body tissue is in danger and action is required, and (ii) pain is a multisystem output that is produced when an individual-specific cortical pain <b>neuromatrix</b> is activated. When pain becomes chronic, the efficacy of the pain <b>neuromatrix</b> is strengthened via nociceptive and non-nociceptive mechanisms, which means that less input, both nociceptive and non-nociceptive, is required to produce pain. The clinical approach focuses on decreasing all inputs that imply that body tissue is in danger and then on activating components of the pain <b>neuromatrix</b> without activating its output. Rehabilitation progresses to increase exposure to threatening input across sensory and non-sensory domains. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Although multiple models of control stimulations have been applied to address the specificity of the needling effect clinically, their impacts have not been evaluated by functional neuroimaging. With the advantage of objective parameter setting, electroacupuncture (EA) {{was used in this}} study to devise three distinct controls for real EA, i. e., mock EA (no stimulation), minimal EA (superficial and light stimulation), and sham EA (same stimulation as real EA) applied at nonmeridian points. Fifteen healthy volunteers received real EA at analgesic point Gallbladder 34 (Yanglinquan), sham EA, and one of either mock EA or minimal EA over the left leg in counter-balanced orders. Multi-subject analysis showed that sham EA and real EA both activated the reported distributed pain <b>neuromatrix.</b> However, real EA elicited significantly higher activation than sham EA over the hypothalamus and primary somatosensory-motor cortex and deactivation over the rostral segment of anterior cingulate cortex. In the comparison of minimal EA versus mock EA, minimal EA elicited significantly higher activation over the medial occipital cortex. Single-subject analysis showed that superior temporal gyrus (encompassing the auditory cortex) and medial occipital cortex (encompassing the visual cortex) frequently respond to minimal EA, sham EA, or real EA. We concluded that the hypothalamus-limbic system was significantly modulated by EA at acupoints rather than at nonmeridian points, while visual and auditory cortical activation Was not a specific effect of treatment-relevant acupoints and required further investigation of the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms.

The <b>neuromatrix</b> theory postulates a genetically determined representation of body image, which is modified by sensory input to create a neurosignature. Persistence of the neurosignature may be responsible for painless phantom limb sensations, whereas phantom limb pain may be due to abnormal reorganisation within the <b>neuromatrix.</b> This study assessed the clinical outcome of deep brain stimulation of the periventricular grey matter and somatosensory thalamus for the relief of chronic neuropathic pain associated with phantom limb in three patients. These patients were assessed preoperatively and at 3 month intervals postoperatively. Self-rated visual analogue scale pain scores assessed pain intensity, and the McGill Pain Questionnaire assessed the quality of the pain. Quality of life was assessed using the EUROQOL EQ- 5 D scale. Periventricular gray stimulation alone was optimal in two patients, whilst a combination of periventricular gray and thalamic stimulation produced the greatest degree of relief in one patient. At follow-up (mean 13. 3 months) the intensity of pain was reduced by 62 % (range 55 - 70 %). In all three patients, the burning component of the pain was completely alleviated. Opiate intake was reduced in the two patients requiring morphine sulphate pre-operatively. Quality of life measures indicated a statistically significant improvement.

A-tDCS of M 1 and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) significantly increased brain excitability in M 1 (p < 0. 05) for at least 30 min. Following application of a-tDCS over the S 1, the amplitude of the N 20 -P 25 component of SEPs increased immediately after the stimulation (p < 0. 05), whilst M 1 stimulation decreased it. Compared to baseline values, significant STh and PTh increase was observed after a-tDCS of all three stimulated areas. Except in M 1 stimulation, there was significant PTh difference between a-tDCS and sham tDCS. a-tDCS of M 1 is the best spots to enhance brain excitability than a-tDCS of S 1 and DLPFC.

40|$|There {{remains a}} high degree of scepticism about {{acupuncture}} since its theoretical basis has no clear reference in Western medical and scientific terms, making any associations between neurophysiology and specific acupuncture concepts difficult to determine. Using neuroimaging and engineering approaches to understand its physiological basis may engender greater acceptance of and improvement in the clinical application of acupuncture. Research into the efficacy of acupuncture has raised a number of difficult methodological issues, particularly in relation to the selection of appropriate controls. Separating specific effects from non-specific effects is complex because acupuncture is a physical, invasive, manual procedure involving time and ritual. Sham acupuncture results show only the difference between sham and real acupuncture not the real affect of acupuncture, and other controls may produce distinct subjective and objective effects. Point injection (the injection of a small amount of a substance at an acupoint), a recent innovation of traditional acupuncture, aims to enhance and prolong the stimulation effect in a standardised, reproducible manner. By providing precise, measurable acupoint stimulation applied incrementally in a specifically designed paradigm, an acupoint could act as its own control. This firstly requires injection to be validated against traditional needling. Aims 1. To develop an instrument for reproducible saline delivery at an acupoint. 2. To cross-validate saline acupoint injection (PI) with traditional needle acupuncture (TA). 3. To demonstrate central nervous system (CNS) effects of acupuncture both in health and chronic pain. Hypothesis The primary hypothesis is that stimulation of specific acupoints with linearly incremental saline injection produces differential effects within the CNS observable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allowing investigation of acupuncture in health and chronic pain. Novelty As neuroimaging has not yet clearly defined the brain structures that may be modulated by acupuncture, this project is exploratory in nature. It is expected that acupuncture effects can be robustly imaged with fMRI in healthy subjects and those suffering chronic pain. The demonstrated effects will result from the acupuncture process of progressive point stimulation by tissue distension rather than needle insertion or biological noise. It is proposed to examine the putative modulation of pain by acupuncture within the extensively mapped <b>neuromatrix</b> of cortical and subcortical regions, including the somatic, insula, and limbic cortices, and thalamus. Detailed information regarding differences in brain response between acupuncture in normal and diseased states will expand understanding of acupuncture as a clinical tool. The dilemma of sham stimulation or arbitrary controls will be addressed by confirming PI as a valid, reproducible stimulation method. Methods and Results A series of empirical experiments was designed and conducted {{to determine the effects of}} stimulation of different acupoints. 1. Chapters 1 and 3 outline the current understanding of acupuncture in the Western milieu and a review of the neuroimaging literature respectively. 2. In Chapter 2, the report of PI tested against TA in healthy volunteers to determine equivalence of physiological effect demonstrates no statistically significant differences between the methodologies. 3. Chapter 4 reports the design and validation of a task specific microprocessor controlled syringe driver. 4. Four differing acupoints were tested during an fMRI experiment described in Chapter 5; different activation areas were demonstrated across the acupoints providing early support for the hypothesis that different acupoints may have different effects. A subset of brain areas recognised within the pain <b>neuromatrix</b> was delineated, congruent spatially and directionally with those reported in pharmacological analgesia studies. 5. As outlined in Chapter 6, heart rate variability can be measured rapidly in a stressful environment to provide meaningful data on the response of the autonomic nervous system to acupuncture stimulation. 6. The hypothesis of different acupoints having different effects was tested in subjects suffering chronic pain by contrasting an accepted and a neutral acupoint, the results being reported in Chapter 7. Conclusion Despite a long history of clinical usage, appropriate scientific studies have not yet addressed the basic effectiveness and efficacy of acupuncture.

40|$|Abstract Background Pain {{is known}} to be {{processed}} by a complex neural network (<b>neuromatrix)</b> in the brain. It is hypothesized that under pathological state, persistent or chronic pain can affect various higher brain functions through ascending pathways, leading to co-morbidities or mental disability of pain. However, so far the influences of pathological pain on the higher brain functions are less clear and this may hinder the advances in pain therapy. In the current study, we studied spatiotemporal plasticity of synaptic connection and function in the hippocampal formation (HF) in response to persistent nociception. Results On the hippocampal slices of rats which had suffered from persistent nociception for 2 h by receiving subcutaneous bee venom (BV) or formalin injection into one hand paw, multisite recordings were performed by an 8 × 8 multi-electrode array probe. The waveform of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP), induced by perforant path electrical stimulation and pharmacologically identified as being activity-dependent and mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors, was consistently positive-going in the dentate gyrus (DG), while that in the CA 1 was negative-going in shape in naïve and saline control groups. For the spatial characteristics of synaptic plasticity, BV- or formalin-induced persistent pain significantly increased the number of detectable fEPSP in both DG and CA 1 area, implicating enlargement of the synaptic connection size by the injury or acute inflammation. Moreover, the input-output function of synaptic efficacy was shown to be distinctly enhanced by the injury with the stimulus-response curve being moved leftward compared to the control. For the temporal plasticity, long-term potentiation produced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) conditioning was also remarkably enhanced by pain. Moreover, it is strikingly noted that the shape of fEPSP waveform was drastically deformed or split by a TBS conditioning under the condition of persistent nociception, while that in naïve or saline control state was not affected. All these changes in synaptic connection and function, confirmed by the 2 -dimentional current source density imaging, were found to be highly correlated with peripheral persistent nociception since pre-blockade of nociceptive impulses could eliminate all of them. Finally, the initial pharmacological investigation showed that AMPA/KA glutamate receptors might play more important roles in mediation of pain-associated spatiotemporal plasticity than NMDA receptors. Conclusion Peripheral persistent nociception produces great impact upon the higher brain structures that lead to not only temporal plasticity, but also spatial plasticity of synaptic connection and function in the HF. The spatial plasticity of synaptic activities is more complex than the temporal plasticity, comprising of enlargement of synaptic connection size at network level, deformed fEPSP at local circuit level and, increased synaptic efficacy at cellular level. In addition, the multi-synaptic model established in the present investigation may open a new avenue for future studies of pain-related brain dysfunctions at the higher level of the <b>neuromatrix.</b> </p...|$|E

Methods 23 {{patients with}} CP pain and 14 controls were studied in a 3 T MR scanner. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (ie, diffusivity of water) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (ie, organisation of fibres) values were assessed in the amygdala, cingulate cortex, insula, prefrontal cortex and secondary sensory cortex. Daily pain scores and the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form were collected 1 week before the investigation.

40|$|Pain {{has many}} {{valuable}} functions. It often signals injury or disease, generates {{a wide range}} of adaptive behaviors, and promotes healing through rest. Despite these beneficial aspects of pain, there are negative features that challenge our understanding of the puzzle of pain, including persistent phantom limb pain after amputation or total spinal cord transection. Pain is a personal, subjective experience influenced by cultural learning, themeaning of the situation, attention, and other psychological variables. Pain processes do not beginwith the stimulation of receptors. Rather, injury or disease produces neural signals that enter an active nervous system that (in the adult organism) is the substrate of past experience, culture, {{and a host of other}} environmental and personal factors. These brain processes actively participate in the selection, abstraction, and synthesis of information from the total sensory input. Pain is not simply the end product of a linear sensory transmission system; it is a dynamic process that involves continuous interactions among complex ascending and descending systems. The <b>neuromatrix</b> theory guides us away from the Cartesian concept of pain as a sensation produced by injury, inflammation, or other tissue pathology and toward the concept of pain as a multidimensional experience produced by multiple influences. These influences range from the existing synaptic architecture of the neuromatrix—which is determined by genetic and sensory factors—to influences from within the body and from other areas in the brain. Genetic influences on synaptic architecture may determine—or predispose toward—the development of chronic pain syndromes...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{represents}} an architecture {{overview of the}} <b>NeuroMatrix</b> NM 6403 neuroprocessor designed for 32 -bit and 64 -bit data processing. The paper includes {{brief description of the}} neuroprocessor pinout, structure and functional units. The neuroprocessor comprise original RISC core, vector coprocessor (VCP) and some peripheral units. RISC core provides general control functions, 32 -bit program and data address generation, 32 -bit arithmetic, logic and shift operations. The main neuroprocessor operational unit is VCP, applied for variable bit-length vector data arithmetic, logic and saturation operations. The base VCP operation is matrix by vector multiplication with accumulation. Each data vector is a 64 -bit word of packed data word. It is formed by set of variable bit length operands with user defined bit length in a range from 1 to 64 bits. Neuroprocessor includes two external 64 -bit buses. The programmable memory interface units allow to use static or dynamic memory having wide range of time parameters without external controller. The neuroprocessor support shared memory mode for each of the external buses. With conjunction of two byte width communication ports this one makes it easy to design multiprocessor systems. Also this paper represents addressing modes, instruction set, supported interrupts. The neuroprocessor is designed using CMOS 0. 5 μm technology, power supply voltage is 3. 3 V, clock rate is 50 MHz with one instruction per clock cycle performance.

40|$|Abstract Background Occipital nerve {{stimulation}} (ONS) has raised new hope for drug-resistant chronic cluster headache (drCCH), a devastating condition. However its {{mode of action}} remains elusive. Since the long delay to meaningful effect suggests that ONS induces slow neuromodulation, we have searched for changes in central pain-control areas using metabolic neuroimaging. Methods Ten drCCH patients underwent an 18 FDG-PET scan after ONS, at delays varying between 0 and 30 months. All were scanned with ongoing ONS (ON) and with the stimulator switched OFF. Results After 6 - 30 months of ONS, 3 patients were pain free and 4 had a ≥ 90 % reduction of attack frequency (responders). In all patients compared to controls, several areas of the pain matrix showed hypermetabolism: ipsilateral hypothalamus, midbrain and ipsilateral lower pons. All normalized after ONS, except for the hypothalamus. Switching the stimulator ON or OFF had little influence on brain glucose metabolism. The perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) was hyperactive in ONS responders compared to non-responders. Conclusions Metabolic normalization in the pain <b>neuromatrix</b> and lack of short-term changes induced by the stimulation might support the hypothesis that ONS acts in drCCH through slow neuromodulatory processes. Selective activation in responders of PACC, a pivotal structure in the endogenous opioid system, suggests that ONS could restore balance within dysfunctioning pain control centres. That ONS is nothing but a symptomatic treatment might be illustrated by the persistent hypothalamic hypermetabolism, which could explain why autonomic attacks may persist despite pain relief and why cluster attacks recur shortly after stimulator arrest. PET studies on larger samples are warranted to confirm these first results. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Use {{functional}} brain imaging {{to explore}} activity changes in centres involved in trigeminal pain processing and control {{before and after}} occipital neurostimulation in drug-resistant chronic cluster headache patients. BACKGROUND: Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) provides relief to about 60 % of patients suffering from drug-resistant chronic cluster headache (drCCH). Its mode of action, however, remains elusive, but the long latency to meaningful effect suggests that ONS induces slow neuromodulation. METHODS: Ten drCCH patients underwent an 18 FDG-PET scan after ONS durations varying between 0 and 30 months. All were scanned with ongoing ONS (ON) and with the stimulator switched OFF. RESULTS: After 6 - 30 months of ONS, 3 patients were pain free and 4 had a ≥ 90 % reduction of attack frequency (responders). In patients overall compared to controls, several areas of the pain matrix were hypermetabolic: ipsilateral hypothalamus, midbrain and ipsilateral lower pons. All normalized after ONS, except the hypothalamus. Switching ON or OFF the stimulator had little influence on brain glucose metabolism. The perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) was hyperactive in ONS responders compared to non-responders.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with painful chronic {{pancreatitis}} (CP) {{might have}} abnormal brain function. We assessed cortical thickness in brain areas involved in visceral pain processing. METHODS: We analyzed brain morphologies of 19 patients with painful CP and compared them with 15 healthy individuals (controls) {{by using a}} 3 T magnetic resonance scanner. By using an automated method with surface-based cortical segmentation, we assessed cortical thickness of the primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortex; prefrontal cortex (PFC); frontal cortex (FC); anterior (ACC), mid (MCC), and posterior (PCC) cingulate cortex; and insula. The occipital middle sulcus {{was used as a}} control area. The pain score was determined {{on the basis of the}} average daily amount of pain during 1 week. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with CP had reduced overall cortical thickness (P =. 0012), without effects of modification for diabetes, alcoholic etiologies, or opioid treatment (all P values >. 05). In patients with CP, the cortical thickness was decreased in SII (P =. 002, compared with controls), PFC (P =. 046), FC (P =. 0003), MCC (P =. 001), and insula (P =. 002). There were no differences in cortical thickness between CP patients and controls in the control area (P =. 20), SI (P =. 06), ACC (P =. 95), or PCC (P =. 42). Cortical thickness in the affected areas correlated with pain score (r = 0. 47, P =. 003). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CP, brain areas involved in pain processing have reduced cortical thickness. As a result of long-term, ongoing pain input to the <b>neuromatrix,</b> cortical thickness might serve as a measure for overall pain system dysfunction, as observed in other diseases characterized by chronic pain...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Neuromatrix</b> of Pain is a {{comprehensive}} theory that {{has been designed to}} account for a majority of mediatory processes that influence pain perception, yet one aspect that {{does not appear to have}} been explicitly considered as a predominant factor in the research is that of biological sex, despite several articles and reviews that have highlighted the importance of it. Originating as an examination of anticipatory processes, this thesis evolved to examine how males and females experience pain differently in social contexts, and possible neurometabolic differences that may account for these disparities. From the social approach, we examined the experimenter gender effect, which demonstrates that the experimenter’s sex alters pain perception. Not only were the results concurrent with previous literature, but it was demonstrated that the presence and gender of an additional observer also influences pressure-pain threshold (PPT), predominantly in males; the observer effect could operate as either an extension of the experimenter effect, or a facilitating factor to it. It was also found that, in females, the personality trait Openness correlated significantly with PPT, which may reflect previous findings of females’ coping mechanisms. From the biological approach, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) was used to examine the neurometabolic concentrations in the insula of healthy males and females based on findings in clinical populations. While the results were not replicated, it was found that there was a significant difference between glutamate concentrations between males and females in the anterior insula (A. I.), and also that glutamate in the A. I. also correlated significantly with PPT in males. These findings demonstrate and support evidence for how males and females adopt differential anticipatory mechanisms to predict and limit potential tissue damage. Overall, this thesis provides evidence for gender differences in pain perception that holds implications for both the experimental and clinical fields of study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{non-specific}} {{low back}} pain is a major socioeconomic public health issue worldwide and, despite the volume {{of research in the}} area, it is still a difficult-to-treat condition. The conservative analgesic therapy usually comprises a variety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. The <b>neuromatrix</b> pain model and the new findings on the process of chronicity of pain point to a higher effectiveness of treatments that address central rather than peripheral structures. The transcranial direct current stimulation is a noninvasive technique of neuromodulation that has made recent advances in the treatment of chronic pain. The simultaneous combination of these two electrostimulation techniques (cerebral and peripheral) can provide an analgesic effect superior to isolated interventions. However, all the evidence on the analgesic efficacy of these techniques, alone or combined, is still fragmented. This is a protocol for a randomized clinical trial to investigate whether cerebral electrical stimulation combined with peripheral electrical stimulation is more effective in relieving pain than the isolated application of electrical stimulations in patients with chronic nonspecific {{low back pain}}. Methods/Design Ninety-two patients will be randomized into four groups to receive transcranial direct current stimulation (real/sham) [*]+[*]transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (real/sham) for 12 sessions over a period of four weeks. The primary clinical outcome (pain intensity) and the secondary ones (sensory and affective aspects of pain, physical functioning and global perceived effect) will be recorded before treatment, after four weeks, in Month 3 and in Month 6 after randomization. Confounding factors such as anxiety and depression, the patient’s satisfaction with treatment and adverse effects will also be listed. Data will be collected by an examiner unaware of (blind to) the treatment allocation. Discussion The results of this study may assist in clinical decision-making about the combined use of cerebral and peripheral electrical stimulation for pain relief in patients with chronic low back pain.

40|$|Background and Aim: Altered brain {{processing}} {{plays an important}} role in the development of visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome. fMRI has been used to study central mechanisms in animal models, but is prone to artefacts. In addition, animal manipulation and abdominal electrodes may render acquisitions unreliable. We have therefore utilized H 215 O microPET to evaluate brain activity evoked by visceral pain in response to colorectal distention (CRD) in rats. Methods: During anesthesia with alpha-chloralose, Long Evan rats (n= 7) were scanned in a microPET Focus 220. CRD was performed by inflating a colonic balloon (1, 1. 5, 2 ml). Reconstructed brain activity images were coregistered and spatially normalized to a standard space based on the Paxinos atlas. Significant clusters of altered activity were identified by voxel based statistical parametric mapping (SPM 2, Pheight< 0. 005 uncorrected). The visceromotor response to distention was recorded by superficial neonatal EMG electrodes. EMG signals were analyzed with Spike 2 and normalized to the maximum pain response (2 ml). Conventional statistical analysis was performed using a paired Student’s t-test. Results: CRD resulted in a volume-dependent increase in visceromotor response (1 ml: 10 ± 5 %, 1. 5 ml: 42 ± 11 % and 2 ml: 100 %). A group comparison between distention and baseline conditions revealed a volume-dependent activation in clusters at the sensorimotor cortex (Pheight= 0. 001), periaquaductal gray (Pheight= 0. 001) and bilateral cerebellum (Pheight< 0. 001). In addition, correlation analysis with distention volume yielded a significant negative correlation in the prefrontal cortex (r= 0. 76, Pheight< 0. 001). Maximal colonic distention (2 ml) resulted in 16 % deactivation of the prefrontal cortex compared to baseline. Conclusion: Anesthetized rats showed a volume-dependent increase in visceral pain which corresponds to activation of the visceral pain <b>neuromatrix,</b> as reported in humans. Volume dependent deactivation of the prefrontal cortex is also in line with clinical studies. These results demonstrate that H 215 O microPET is a useful tool to quantify brain (de-) activation in response to visceral pain. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{overarching}} {{purpose of}} the current thesis was to assess the long term effects of a treatment program involving flotation-REST for the experience of pain, {{from the point of view}} of variables connected with Melzack´s <b>neuromatrix</b> theory, and to examine the extent of a potential attention-placebo effect in connection with flotation-REST. The first study (Paper I) aimed to investigate long-term effects of flotation-REST four months after treatment. Seventy patients participated, diagnosed as having stress-related pain. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or a flotation-REST group and participated in a total of twelve flotation REST or control sessions. Results indicated that pain areas, stress, anxiety and depression decreased, while sleep quality, optimism, and prolactin increased. Positive effects generally maintained four months after treatment. The second (Paper II) examined the potential effects of attention-placebo. Thirty-two patients who were diagnosed as having stress-related muscular pain were treated for a period of six weeks. Half of the patients were also given attention for a period of 12 weeks, while the remainder received attention for 6 weeks. Participants in both groups exhibited lowered blood pressure, reduced pain, anxiety, depression, stress, and negative affectivity, as well as increased optimism, energy, and positive affectivity. The third (Paper III) investigated whether or not 33 flotation sessions were more effective for stress related ailments as compared to 12 sessions. Participants were 37 patients with stress related ailments. Analyzes for subjective pain and psychological variables typically indicated that 12 sessions were enough to get considerably improvements and no further improvements were noticed after 33 sessions. Finally, the fourth study (Paper IV) aimed to examine whether and how the combination of therapy and flotation tank could be used to treat patients with severe stress problems. Two women on long-term sick-leave participated in the study, which was carried out over a period of one year. Four overarching themes were generated: the therapeutic work model, transformation of feelings, self-insight and meaning. These together constituted a “therapeutic circle” which after a while transformed in to a “therapeutic spiral” of increased meaning and enhanced wellbeing. It was therefore concluded that flotation tank therapy is an effective method for the treatment of stress-related pain...|$|E
