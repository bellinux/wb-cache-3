50|$|When {{processed}} into finished by-products (see Natural gas processing), these heavier hydrocarbons are collectively {{referred to}} as <b>NGL</b> (<b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids).</b> The extraction of the NGL often involves a turboexpander and a low-temperature distillation column (called a demethanizer) as shown in Figure 2. The inlet gas to the demethanizer is first cooled to about −51 °C in a heat exchanger ({{referred to as}} a cold box) which partially condenses the inlet gas. The resultant gas-liquid mixture is then separated into a gas stream and a liquid stream.|$|E
40|$|This project {{sought and}} {{successfully}} answered two big {{challenges facing the}} creation of low-energy, cost-effective, zeotropic multi-component distillation processes: first, identification of an efficient search space that includes all the useful distillation configurations and no undesired configurations; second, development of an algorithm to search the space efficiently and generate an array of low-energy options for industrial multi-component mixtures. Such mixtures are found in large-scale chemical and petroleum plants. Commercialization of our results was addressed by building a user interface allowing practical application of our methods for industrial problems by anyone with basic knowledge of distillation for a given problem. We also provided our algorithm to a major U. S. Chemical Company {{for use by the}} practitioners. The successful execution of this program has provided methods and algorithms at the disposal of process engineers to readily generate low-energy solutions for a large class of multicomponent distillation problems in a typical chemical and petrochemical plant. In a petrochemical complex, the distillation trains within crude oil processing, hydrotreating units containing alkylation, isomerization, reformer, LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and <b>NGL</b> (<b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquids)</b> processing units can benefit from our results. Effluents from naphtha crackers and ethane-propane crackers typically contain mixtures of methane, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butane and heavier hydrocarbons. We have shown that our systematic search method with a more complete search space, along with the optimization algorithm, has a potential to yield low-energy distillation configurations for all such applications with energy savings up to 50 %...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} means of deferring the {{breakthrough}} of injected N 2 and alleviating the impact of such on production rates and specifications as well as minimizing the required changes to the gas processing facilities. This aimed at assisting the ongoing efforts to transfer the Cantarell experience to Abu Dhabi, where large amounts of N 2 gas will be generated and injected into a large gas condensate reservoir to partially substitute the recycling of lean gas. This will bring forward the opportunity to exploit lean gas by securing base load supplies {{before the start of}} reservoir blowdown, compared to the peak shaving approach currently practiced.  Managing N 2 breakthrough starts by better understanding the pattern at which N 2 injection spreads into the gas accumulation. Based on the findings of initial subsurface and plant simulations carried out in 2008, N 2 breakthrough in Abu Dhabi might be possibly deferred by segmenting the reservoir into a rich N 2 region and lean N 2 region. The approach assumes no thief zones will be faced and no channeling of N 2 injected between the two regions is taking place. N 2 is injected in the north region of the reservoir. The production of that region will be segregated and fed to a gas processing plant of lower <b>NGL</b> (<b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquid)</b> recovery, which essentially takes longer time to start suffering the deterioration of residue gas (gas mixture resulted after separating NGL) quality.  The residue gas use can be limited to re-injection where the effect of below specification LHV (Low Heat Value) would not be an issue. The rest of the reservoir feeds another gas processing plant of higher NGL recovery level from which an amount of residue gas equivalent to that of the injected N 2 will be rerouted to the sales network. This scenario will significantly delay as well as downsize the requirement of a N 2 rejection plant. There is technical and certainly economical advantage of deferring the installation of costly N 2 rejection units. Such a requirement can be entirely eliminated if the sales gas specification can be relaxed considering blending with other gas streams of higher LHV, and in collaboration with gas customers, i. e. assessing their capability to tolerate feedstock of lower specifications. It must be noted that such school of thinking may not necessarily be eventually embraced. The chosen scenario will also depend on the final configuration, i. e., wells grouping and gas gathering, of the ongoing project...|$|R

40|$|The {{market for}} natural gas has been rapidly {{increasing}} and is {{becoming one of the}} most important sources of energy in the world. Natural gas is a "cleaner" burning fuel when compared to other fossil fuels and therefore environmental impacts are minimized. Gas produced (associated gas) with oil is largely methane with heavier fractions referred to as <b>NGL</b> (<b>Natural</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Liquids).</b> NGL is used as feedstock for petrochemical processes or as fuel for industrial and domestic purposes. The recovery of NGL is commonly carried out at onshore oil and gas operations where space and weight are not critical design parameters. The limited space on offshore platforms makes NGL recovery a challenge. Currently, in the Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore, the associated gas is re-injected, used for power on the platforms, and some is flared but not recovered due to the difficulties to storage and transport in this remote location. This associated gas contains high levels of NGL, making attractive its recovery from the economical and environmental points of view. This thesis describes in detail the development of a membrane process to recover NGL. Different processes such as turbo-expander, absorption, adsorption, external refrigeration and membranes are reviewed and compared. As a result of this comparison, membranes are proposed as a feasible option for NGL recovery. Several membrane models are investigated. Membranes are placed in different locations in a three-stage separation train on an offshore platform, and the effect of pressure, inlet temperature process, flow pattern, and location in the process are analysed. The analyses are then extended by incorporating the recycle of the permeate and residue streams of the membranes to separators. Twelve alternative configurations of the original process are investigated with the objective of evaluating the impact of the membranes on the production of crude oil base. As a result, it is demonstrated that some of the configurations considered increase the production of crude oil...|$|E

The International Energy Agency (IEA) datasets published by the Energy Statistics Division (ESD) contain annual and quarterly time series data from 1960 onwards on energy production, trade, stocks, transformation, consumption, prices and taxes {{as well as on}} greenhouse gas emissions for over the 30 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Member countries and over 100 non-OECD countries worldwide. In OECD Member countries the data are collected by official bodies (most often the national statistics office in each country) from firms, government agencies and industry organisations and are then reported to the IEA using questionnaires to ensure international comparability. In non-OECD countries the data are collected directly from government and industry contacts and from national publications. Energy Balances of Non-OECD Countries: This database contains energy balances for over 100 non-OECD countries and 11 regions. Detailed energy balances are provided in thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe). Definitions of products and flows, explanatory notes on the individual country data, indicators (including GDP, population and ratios calculated with the energy data) and net calorific values are also included. In general, data are available from 1971. This database is updated by the IEA at the beginning of September each year. This database was first made available by the UK Data Service in June 2005 and is updated annually. The UK Data Service web site includes further information on its IEA Energy Balances of Non-OECD Countries database, including a dataset user guide and details of latest database updates.
