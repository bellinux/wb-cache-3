40|$|Abstract. In both Oil & Gas (OG) and {{automotive}} industries, welding is {{an essential}} part of fabrication routes and the challenges in welding metallic materials are frequently similar. Processes that are fast, robust, and therefore tolerate variations in process parameters (including operators for manual processes) and materials (i. e. compositions and properties) are important to reproduce high weld quality and facilitate <b>non-destructive</b> <b>examinations</b> (NDE). New grades of high-strength alloys, required to be weldable by common processes and preferably without post-weld heat treatments, are not only needed by both industries, but dissimilar-metal welding is also becoming unavoidable, thereby demanding for novel processes with either low heat inputs or high-energy densities. In this paper, technologies for dissimilar-metal welding are examined in reference with both OG and automotive applications...|$|R

After NDE (<b>non-destructive</b> <b>examinations),</b> samples were annealed in the temperature range 730 – 750 C for 1 and 2 h,microhardness was measured across the joints and FIMEC (flat-top cylinder indenter for mechanical characterization) tests were carried out in the molten zone (MZ),heat affected zone (HAZ) and in the matrix. The FIMEC method allowed determination on a local scale of the yield stress as obtained in standard tensile tests. Mechanical tests were supplemented by optical microscopy observations. The best results were obtained by the treatment at 750 C for 2 h: original characteristics are substantially recovered in the HAZ but not completely in the MZ...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of steel}} in civil constructions has many {{advantages}} of which I {{mention the fact}} that the weight of the construction is more reduced which leads to smaller strains on foundations and gives a better earthquake performance [...] The welded joints used in civil constructions require, at the same time, to take some measures specific to the new technology. The strain of the welded joints can be also on the X direction, but in case of T welds the strain is on the Z direction [...] The methods of <b>non-destructive</b> <b>examinations</b> applied for the inspection of the welded joints are the visual examination, the ultrasonic examination, the magnetic particle examination, the liquid penetrant examination, and to a small extent, the radiographic examination.

40|$|As an {{innovative}} hybrid joining process ultrasound enhanced {{friction stir welding}} (USE-FSW) was successfully applied on Al/Mg-joints and offers a beneficial impact on the resulting microstructure and mechanical properties. Whereas in conventional FSW of Al to Mg continuous band-shaped intermetallic layers of Al 3 Mg 2 and Mg 17 Al 12 are always present, the formation of these layers can be influenced positively by the ultrasound energy that is transferred into the stirred zone in USE-FSW. In this case, the intermetallic phases are spread over the complete nugget zone. Consequently, the tensile strength increases about 25 % and the fatigue strength rises by up to 3. 5 times. Based on this USE-FSW was investigated with regard to possible advantages for Al/steel-hybrid-joints. Preliminary investigations have shown {{significant differences in the}} microstructure of ultrasound enhanced and non-ultrasound enhanced EN AW- 6061 /DC 04 -joints. While conventional FSW led to hooks and larger particles of steel in the aluminum, USE-FSW-joints show remarkably smaller and more homogenous distributed steel particles in the nugget.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{response}} of TS-based (epoxy) and TP-based (PPS or PEEK) laminates under low velocity impacts. In order to assess the development of internal damage caused by the different impact energies, <b>non-destructive</b> <b>examinations</b> were done. Impact tests created pyramidal-shaped damage at the center of the specimen, extensive delamination and fiber breakages inside laminates, as well as inter laminar and intra-ply damage. CAI tests showed that PEEK-based composites display the best performance, and the compressive residual strengths of C/PPS and C/Epoxy are the lowest for every impact energy. It turns out that the three materials display a rather similar behavior at increasing impact energy as delaminated areas are larger in C/Epoxy and C/PEEK, whereas the PPS matrix toughness contributes to a less extended delaminated area. One reason for the disappointing residual strength of TP-based composites may be the constraint on the development of the plastic deformation zone in the resin rich area between the woven-plies and at the fiber bundles crimp, preventing the matrix toughness to give to the laminates a better damage tolerance...|$|R
50|$|<b>Non-destructive</b> <b>examination</b> (NDE) or {{nondestructive}} testing (NDT) {{is a family}} of technologies used during inspection to analyze materials, components and products for either inherent defects (such as fractures or cracks), or service induced defects (damage from use).

In addition, many non-destructive inspections can be performed by a precision scale, or when in motion, a checkweigher. Stereo microscopes are often used for examining small products like circuit boards for product defects.|$|E

50|$|The National Museum of Ireland {{consulted}} with specialists in archaeological conservation and book conservation {{about the best}} way to conserve the psalter, and received partly conflicting advice. Ultimately a multi-phase conservation plan was determined. The first phase involved <b>non-destructive</b> <b>examination</b> of the psalter in the form in which it was discovered - e.g., photography, MRI scanning, and examination of the binding by book-binding specialists. In the second phase, experiments were done on 18th century parchments to determine the best way of drying waterlogged parchment. The most effective method involved soaking the parchment in ethanol to replace the water, placing it between blotting sheets, and vacuum-packing it. In the third phase, this technique was tested on small fragments of the psalter, and found to be effective. Conservators then began applying this method to larger sections of the psalter, and found they could consistently achieve shrinkage of only 2-5%, against 75% on a small fragment that was air-dried.|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{radiography}} has its inimitable role in <b>non-destructive</b> <b>examinations.</b> Industrial radiography devices, {{consisting of}} significantly high {{activity of the}} radioisotopes, are operated manually by remotely held control unit. Malfunctioning of these devices may cause potential exposure to the operator and nearby public, and thus should be practiced under a systematic risk control. To ensure the radiation safety, proactive risk assessment should be implemented. Risk assessment in industrial radiography using the Failure Modes & Effect Analysis (FMEA) for the design and operation of industrial radiography exposure devices {{has been carried out}} in this study. Total 56 component failure modes were identified and Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs) were assigned by the FMEA expert team, based on the field experience and reported failure data of various components. Results shows all the identified failure modes have RPN in the range of 04 to 216 and most of the higher RPN are due to low detectability and high severity levels. Assessment reveals that increasing failure detectability is a practical and feasible approach to reduce the risk in most of the failure modes of industrial radiography devices. Actions for reducing RPN for each failure mode have been suggested. Feasibility of FMEA for risk assessment in industrial radiography has been established by this stud...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the structural integrity analysis of a low pressure (LP) turbine with transverse cracking. Cracks are initiated in the centre ring keyway of the shaft by a fretting mechanism and propagate during barring operation. The cracks arrest during normal operation when they are still relatively shallow. The aim of the calculations is to predict the transition where cracks start propagating by high cycle fatigue during normal operation of the shaft. Most influencing factors, including continuum mechanics, mathematical modelling, material behaviour, service loads and industry experience, {{are studied in detail}} as a precursor to the case study. The calculated results show that the case study is an example where the application of fracture mechanics on the crack-free stress field leads to erroneous results. There is a significant redistribution of stress {{in the presence of the}} crack so that the actual stress ratio, as calculated from three dimensional cracked models, varies significantly compared to the crack-free model. Calculated results, together with carefully researched material properties, confirm the postulated crack growth during barring operation and predict limiting crack sizes where high cycle fatigue would ensue during normal operation. The case study concludes that the shaft has a significant remaining life and that it can be returned to service with periodic <b>non-destructive</b> <b>examinations...</b>|$|R

Today vessels in the USA require BPVC stamping but the BPVC is not just a domestic code, many other countries have adopted the BPVC as their official code. There are, however, other official codes in some countries (some of which rely on portions of and reference the BPVC), Japan, Australia, Canada, Britain, and Europe have their own codes. Regardless of the country nearly all recognize the inherent potential hazards of pressure vessels and the need for standards and codes regulating their design and construction.|$|E

The inspection techniques, including multi-isotope γ-spectrometry, de-fect detection and corrosion examination with eddy-current, dimensional measurements, visual control and gas analysis of the plenum region are performed with modern updated devices. The system has proven over long period to be a powerful tool providing key information on the state and physical con-dition of several hundred irradiated fuel rods. The fuel's burn up level for instance can be estimated through evaluation of the γ-spectra and the shadow corrosion of spent BWR rods is easily detected by means of eddy-current measurements. Fuel swelling, measurable through profilometry or fuel stack elongation is also part of the NDE deliverables. The data collected by NDE are very important for an effective planning of the subsequent rod sectioning and destructive examination.

40|$|Abstract. The {{first wall}} (FW) of ITER blanket {{includes}} beryllium (Be) armor tiles joined to CuCrZr heat sink with stainless steel (SS) cooling tube and backing plate {{in order to}} improve plasma performance and reduce thermal stress. Since these joints must withstand thermal and mechanical loads caused by the plasma and electromagnetic force, it is important to evaluate the strength and thermal fatigue life of the joints. Qualification tests of the FW fabrication technology are performed in order to qualify the joining technologies. The Japan Domestic Agency (JADA) has fabricated the qualification mock-up with a hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) technique and carried out the materials testing and the <b>non-destructive</b> <b>examinations.</b> When the dissimilar materials joints are subjected to external force and thermal load, the stress distribution shows singularity and large stress concentration at the interface edges caused by discontinuity of the elastic properties. The characteristics of stress singularity were analyzed for the Be/CuCrZr and SS/CuCrZr joints. The results of tensile test showed that the Be/CuCrZr joint fractured at the interface because of large stress concentration at the interface edges. For the SS/CuCrZr joint, however, the joint fractured at CuCrZr apart from the interface. There was insignificant stress concentration at the interface edges, because those elastic properties are almost same. Since Charpy impact strength of the SS/CuCrZr joint was inferior to the CuCrZr, elasto-plastic finite element analyses were also carried out to clarify the deformation characteristics and fracture of the tensile and Charpy specimens. Those fracture behavior were caused from the plastic deformation properties of both materials. 1...|$|R

40|$|Modeling and {{simulation}} on {{the basis}} of appropriate computer methods play an ever increasing role in the optimization of welding processes and the quality inspection of welded components. As one part in the quality strategy to ensure integrity for safe operation and technical availability of such pressurized components like e. g. pipelines, periodic <b>non-destructive</b> <b>examinations</b> (in-service inspections, ISI) have to be performed. Ultrasonics constitute a commonly applied non-destructive inspection technique. The reliability of it, however, is suffering from the complexity {{of the structure of the}} components. Shutdowns for maintenance and ISI are extremely costly due to loss of production. In view of these aspects, numerical simulation has evolved as a new important tool providing assisting interpretation analysis of results and optimization of inspection technology, i. e. experimental set-ups. In this contribution, the simulation-based optimization of ultrasonic inspection of welded components and their evaluation in view of the service behavior is addressed. For a longitudinal weld in an austenitic pipe supplied with model defects, a standard inspection procedure using longitudinal waves at 45 °, 60 ° or 70 ° incidence is simulated. The coverage of the desired inspection volume using commercial ultrasonic transducers is first checked using a conventional ray tracing technique, while in a second step a Gaussian beam superposition method is applied to gain quantitative information on the sound field generated within the weld. With optimal set-up parameters thus determined, RF-ultrasonic signals are acquired in a pulse-echo experiment and evaluated considering the probe coordinates, the ultrasonic velocities and times-of-flight using Synthetic Aperture Focusing Techniques.

40|$|International audienceIn {{nuclear power}} plants (PWR), the rod cluster control {{assemblies}} (RCCAs) can be damaged by impact-sliding wear due to flow-induced vibrations which generate contacts with their guidance devices (RCC guide tube) inside the reactor pressure vessel. Two localized impact/sliding wear tests have been performed at conditions close to the PWR primary system on stainless steel claddings (316 L) using wear autoclave simulators operating without water flow. The influence of the excitation frequency and type of motion signal on the wear process and damage has been studied (other experimental conditions have been fixed for the tests). Some extensive <b>non-destructive</b> <b>examinations</b> have been performed on the worn specimens (rod and guide card), using weighing, scanning electron microscopy, EDX and 2 D profilometry. The analyses of the wear scars show that a small frequency associated with a latency time between two-rod movements lead to a wear damage more severe than those generated at higher frequency even if the cumulative sliding distance is 300 times lower. Moreover, the linear weight loss (per slid kilometer) of the slow test specimen (? 5500 ?g/km) {{is much higher than}} the fast test one (? 2 ?g/km). So our observations brought us {{to the conclusion that the}} wear mechanism related to the small frequency damage is a chemical dissolution (corrosion) of the austenitic steel associated with a mechanical depassivation of the oxidized surface layers. This first stage is followed by an oxides compaction or detachment stage due to the impact at the end on each motion. The guide cards are less damaged than the rods but both exhibit a typical cup-shaped pattern with many ellipsoidal-like marks (also called dimples or scallop/hammering marks) aligned in the direction of the tube motion. © 2005 Elsevier B.
