40|$|Background: Complete {{medication}} reconciliation {{is often}} difficult to achieve, particularly in the emergency department (ED). General practitioner (GP) medication lists may be used by some doctors for charting medications. Aim: To determine the discrepancies in the medication history information between GP medication lists and the actual medication usage of older patients admitted via a regional ED. Method: A clinical audit was conducted over a 2 -week period at a small regional hospital. Patients 65 years and over, taking 3 or more medications prior to admission, admitted via the ED and with a national inpatient medication chart (NIMC) prepared by a medical officer were identified. Eligible patients were provided with medication reconciliation by a pharmacist. Discrepancies between the medication history obtained by the pharmacist, the GP medication list and the NIMC were assessed. The clinical significance of the discrepancies were classified using a severity assessment code matrix. Results: 48 patients were eligible and 75 % had 1 or more discrepancy in their GP medication list. Almost half of the discrepancies were related to <b>non-current</b> medications being <b>recorded.</b> Potential clinical significance of the discrepancies in 19 % of patients was 'moderate' or 'major'. Conclusion: While a GP medication list is a useful tool in the medication reconciliation process, it is not a complete representation of the patient's medications prior to admission...|$|R

40|$|The records {{life cycle}} theory propagates for the {{management}} of records throughout their entire life cycle, i. e. from creation, through the stages when they are active, semi-active then non-current when disposition takes place and some records are destroyed and some preserved as archives. At various stages of their life cycle records need appropriate storage: records offi ces for current records; records centres for semi-current records; and archival facility for the <b>non-current</b> <b>records</b> identifi ed during appraisal as worthy of permanent preservation. The provision of records centres ensures that there is no decongestion in the offi ces, safe-guards against haphazard destruction of records and ensures that records which end up as archives are protected from hazards which might damage or destroy them. This paper makes a case for the establishment of records centres for Namibia’s public service semi-current records. The paper reports on fi ndings of a study by the authors in April 2012, of commercial companies providing the public service of Namibia with records storage facilities. The authors make recommendations on how the management of semi-current records in the public service can be enhanced...|$|E
40|$|Information {{technology}} and political motives, e. g. e-governance, {{freedom of information}} legislation, has recent years lead to an increasing emphasis on users and access to records, but little research based knowledge about those issues exist so far. The main focus of the previous research {{is the use of}} <b>non-current</b> <b>records</b> in archival repositories. The aim of this thesis is to make a contribution to the research field, in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the information behaviour of users of records in contemporary organizational settings. The research questions addressed are: § How are records used in contemporary organizations?- In what context and for what purposes are records used?- What user categories can be identified? § How is the search for records mediated?- What intermediaries are used in the search process?- How well do the features of the artefactual intermediaries serve the users' information needs?- What is the role of human intermediaries? An additional purpose of the study is to contribute to theory development, and to provide a conceptual model of the information behaviour of users of records that can form the basis for further research. The thesis is based on explorative case studies undertaken in two contemporary Swedish public organizations, one municipality and one governmental agency. Data was collected through interviews, analysis of documentary sources and complementary observations. The analysis of the findings was guided by a theoretical framework consisting of activity theory informed by concepts from archival theory and models of information behaviour. The results of the cases studies showed that information behaviour of users of records and the search process could be described as a part of an activity system. The search process was a sub-ordinated activity of other activities. The needs for records was generated by a task or accomplishment of anykind with purpose to achieve something. Those needs motivated the purposes of use of records: material, operational, accountability seeking or knowledge enhancing purposes. The subjects, users in collaboration with the registrars and archivists, seeked to obtain records with help of different mediational means, e. g. artifactual intermediaries as the journal and the archives inventory that could be defined as representational systems, in order to reach a certain outcome: fact-finding, re-construction of past actions and events, regaining experience and knowledge, verifying status, or illustrating and exemplifying. A variety of user groups, internal as well as external, could be identified in both organizations. Those could act as direct or indirect users, and indirect use by one part meant direct use by another who acted as a mediator between the records and the end users. The external users could be defined as stakeholders of the organizations or other users. Users showed, with occasional exceptions, a preference for informal means of mediation, particularly personal communication. Certain features of the formal representational systems, journals and inventories, could be identified, which made them less useful as search tool. Those were generated by contradictions and tensions within the organizations: contradictions within the representational systems; contradictions between the tasks of the users and the representational systems; contradictions between user requests and the access points in the representational systems; contradictions between external users and the activities of the organizations; contradictions between exogenous institutional conditions and the the activities of the organizations; and contradictions of a temporal character. These circumstances necessitated an active intervention of human intermediaries. This could be seen as an example of the division of labour in the organizations. Search and retrieval of records were part of the registrars’ and the archivists’ specific professional knowledge, but were not considered as primary tasks of other employees or, especially not, of the external users. The results of the study contributes to to the knowledge about the use of records, and how records are approached. It provides a model of the search process that can form the basis for further research. The practical implications of the findings could be improved search tools and user services, i. e. enhanced access. The thesis can also contribute to theoretical enrichment of the field by combining a more comprehensive social theory with archival theory and concepts from information science.  Utveckling av arkiv- och informationsvetenska...|$|E
40|$|What is {{the nature}} of the archive in the 21 st century? What is the role of the {{archivist}} in a postmodern, electronic environment? To attain any absolute answers would be beyond the ability, or diplomacy, of any individual. Yet there are some questions, and subsequent dividing lines, which can be brought to the fore: •	Is the archive a resting place for <b>non-current</b> <b>records,</b> a repository that provides the connection between inscription and preservation in order to ensure the veracity of the record as an authentic and reliability piece of evidence? •	Should the archivist be distinct from the records manager? •	Is the historical canon, if permitted to even use the term, a construct of the archive? If the answer is in the affirmative then does this legitimise the archivist in imparting overt value to a record/collection? •	Is the archivist a custodian and keeper? •	Should the archivist interact with wider societal needs and concerns? The ideal and idea of the archive and the archivist has become virtually unrecognisable from its early 20 th century construct as questions such as these have been debated in the journals of archival science. The antiquated Jenkinsonian world-view has been dispensed with. The moral and physical defence of the archive is unsubstantial. Ensuring the preservation of the record and making it available to the public does not provide the archivist with a presence. Rather, the authority of archival beginnings has become the dominant, over-arching ideology. Through the advocacy of records continuum theorists and the proponents of postmodernism, we are to “stop rowing, start steering”. In order to be accountable, transparent, open, and representative, the archival profession is to control context and master reality. The archive is to define its own truth criteria. The archivist is an agent of accountability. The archivist is to openly negate his/her independent, neutral, non-political, non-ideological role: (1) There is an archive fever of audit culture. This is in response to the rise of the ‘consumer’ – “There is a risk, we’ll take care of it”. Continual monitoring, evaluation, and targets results in the record being a self-reflexive construct. Audit trails create a sense of truthfulness to the facts and of closeness to past reality. These perspectives have entered the archive. Perceived recordkeeping failures have made the archive unaccountable to wider society. The ‘right’ records are not reaching the archive. Records therefore must be programmed in advance by archivists working as records managers to produce acceptable outcomes. The archivist shapes the creation of the record. Archiving is auditing the recordkeeping systems of a record creating body. Archiving is the “active production of objectively truthful documents”. (2) Postmodernism sanctions a creative reconstruction of the past. The archive is to “fabricate metaphors…[tell] imaginings of history”. The archive overtly interprets the record and creates interfaces that reflect this interpretation and subjectivity, reifying cultural essentialism to appear representative of all elements of society. The archivist becomes a conscious participant in the construction and advancement of meaning. The perception of the user towards the records is moulded. The archive becomes a means of memory rather than memory itself. This thesis takes on what the author perceives as certain often rhetorical excesses of the records continuum theory and those of postmodernism. It engages on their terms, with their arguments, and with the interdisciplinary nature of today’s archival thinking. It shows that ‘traditional’ archival concepts and values are just as necessary and relevant today as in the supposedly homogenous and positivist society in which they arose. This thesis thus upholds the Jenkinsonian ideals for archives. However, it recognises the difficulty of achieving them, and that the proponents of postmodernism examined here do not intend to dispense with rigorous reasoning, balanced analysis, and truth seeking in favour of unrestrained ‘anything goes’ interpretations of records and archival concepts. Indeed, the author himself draws on leading postmodern thinkers such as Foucault and Derrida to develop his own socio-political analysis of audit records produced in the ‘audit culture’ of the past few decades. In so doing, the author hopes to show how postmodern analysis can be done in the spirit of the Jenkinsonian commitment to protection of evidential values through truth seeking. That said, the author believes that the archivist does not create life but holds the materials within its institution in a coma, awaiting the user to awake them from their perpetual slumber. This is a true re-assertion of archival value and responsibility. In caring more for a record’s corroborative power and transformative effect we have got too interested in the way we deliver what we do at the expense of what we deliver – engineering over content. Yet by acting responsibly the archive broadens perspectives and enlightens the individual. This is the responsible archival performance worth pursuing. ...|$|E
40|$|Promjene koje u komunikaciji među ljudima, {{a time i}} u obliku pisanih dokumenata, izazivaju informatičke tehnologije, čini aktualnim pitanje o sadržaju djelatnosti arhivske struke. Osnova te djelatnosti je upravljanje spisima tijekom čitava njihova životnog ciklusa te je stoga nužno jasno razumjeti što je spis, odnosno dokument i što ga razlikuje od drugih oblika informacija. Arhivistička {{literatura}} poznaje dva različita tipa definicije dokumenta: pravni i teorijski. U članku se opisuju dva pristupa definiranju elektroničkih dokumenata u kontekstu istraživačkih projekata u posljednje vrijeme: jedan koji definiciju izvodi iz poslovnih transakcija, i drugi, s uporištem u diplomatici, koji polazi od tradicionalne definicije arhivskog dokumenta, pri čemu se specifičnost elektroničkog dokumenta vidi u fizičkoj odvojenosti teksta i kontekstualnih podataka. Iz definicije i svojstava dokumenta izvode se i funkcionalni zahtjevi sustava za upravljanje spisima i dokumentima. More {{and more}} people communicate by electronic mail, in stead of calling, and by sending and receiving c-mail messages they create potential records. It looks like that again orality is loosing its position in social life. Every peace of recorded information is potentially a record. Today in some countries, {{in the near future}} in other countries, archives will be surrounded by the electronic records, and overwhelmed by a continuously increasing of records production. These forthcoming changes, these challenges, make us put ourselves the eternal question; What business are we in. To give at least one answer: We arc in the business of keeping records. That is our core business, and we might be in some other related business, such as in the information business, but it is all about records. Not about current records, or semi-current records or <b>non-current</b> <b>records</b> - no, just records. Since we {{are in the business of}} keeping records, we need a clear understanding of what a record is, and what distinguishes a record from other pieces of information. In the current archival literature on this subject, we sec two different perspectives for defining electronic records: a legal one, often chosen by archives as a basis for interventions in public administration, and an academic one, chosen by universities, a basis for fundamental archival research. Looking more closely at the academic perspective, we may discover two different approaches. The University of Pittsburgh, for example takes the business transactions of organisations as a starting point. A business transaction creates, and uses records. The records arc the evidence of the transactions that created and used them. Contrary to Pittsburgh the UBC project provides with clear definitions of electronic records, and in a structured, in diplomatics founded way. The starting point for the definition of an electronic record is the definition of a document, than of an archival document. An archival document is not a document with archival value, in the sense that it is worth to be preserved permanently, but a document which has re-cordness, played a role in a business process, and may serve as evidence of that process, An electronic document is a document created and communicated in a digital format and by computer technology. The advantage of the UBC definition is that it links up with traditional thinking, although that might be a risk as well. At least for the short term the use of the concept of the document as a metaphor has advantages for understanding. Whereas Pittsburgh appears to be more dynamic and open for any kind of emerging technology, it boars the risk of being one step too far. Defining a record as a document, and an electronic record as an electronic do¬cument implies that one characteristic of both an electronic and a traditional record is that it must be complete, intelligible in itself. One characteristic is according to the UBC project most essential for any kind of record: its interrelationships. A record can only be fully understood in conjunction with other records, for instance being part of a scries or a case file. Archivists are first of all responsible for keeping records, therefore a major question is how electronic records must be kept. The assumption that electronic records must be kept electronically, contrary to printing them out on paper, find a strong support by many archival thinkers, because of the recognition that a record created, communicated and used electronically, finds its authentic form in its origi¬nal electronic format. For this very reason it is needed for each legal, political and societal system to define functional requirements forrccordkecping. Starting with the identification of the required quality of the records any recordkeeping system must preserve these required quality. It must be able to keep the records complete, reliable, authentic. It must be able to protect the records against change, illegal access, unwanted deletion. It must preserve information about the context in which the records have been created, information about who created the record, when it was communicated, when it was read, and in the course of what business process. These requirements derive from archival theory, from diplomatics, from the legal systems, from political demands, societal behaviour, financial regulations. One other functional requirement about which the opinions seem to agree, is that the recordkeeping system has to be or to become pro-active, not waiting for records eventually to enter into the system, but avoiding any risk of having records be lost, or violated. Recordkeeping systems, unlike information systems, provide time bound, non-manipulable, and highly redundant information. A recordkeeping system is not apiece of software, an application. It is more than that, it is the whole of procedures, rules, knowledge, hardware, software, tools, methodologies, and people, including the records themselves of an organisations, preserving them and making them available for use by providing access for those who have the rights to access them...|$|E
