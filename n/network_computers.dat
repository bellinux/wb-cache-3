5|$|In {{addition}} to Galaxy Game and Computer Space, numerous other games have been directly inspired by Spacewar. These include Orbitwar (1974, PLATO <b>network</b> <b>computers),</b> Space Wars (1977, arcade), and Space War (1978, Atari 2600). Additionally, in Asteroids (1979), designer Ed Logg used elements from Spacewar, namely the hyperspace button {{and the shape}} of the player's ship. Products as late as the 1990 computer game Star Control drew direct inspiration from Spacewar. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games without feeling restricted to using Russell's own code or design.|$|E
25|$|Client/server {{networking}} {{allows a}} program on a computer, called a client, to connect via a network to another computer, called a server. Servers offer (or host) various services to other <b>network</b> <b>computers</b> and users. These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access points beyond the server's IP address. Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program, {{which is responsible for}} handling requests to that port. A daemon, being a user program, can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kernel.|$|E

In the United States for example, under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies. Packet capture is the monitoring of data traffic on a computer <b>network.</b> <b>Computers</b> communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called [...] "packets", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete [...] "message" [...] again. Packet Capture Appliance intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, {{in order to examine}} their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information gathering tool, but not an analysis tool. That is it gathers [...] "messages" [...] but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' broadband Internet and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) traffic.|$|E

It is an ideal way to introduce in the cluster technology in the <b>network</b> for a <b>computer</b> system to solve this problem. In this paper, <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> server cluster {{on the basis of the}} existing <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> system is designed and key issues are studied. <b>Network</b> <b>computer</b> system With the development of computing technology, personal computing provides users with an increasingly rich personalized graphics interface and application, but costs of personal computer installation, deployment, maintenance and management continue to increase, the PC calculation mode put forward a huge challenge for users, especially for business users. <b>Network</b> <b>computer</b> system not only allows the user to use the applications and personalized settings of the server by service agreement, but also allows multiple users to share the application computing and storage resources, thus greatly reduces the installation, deployment, maintenance and management costs. The calculation mode that provides users with remote service <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> through <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> is becoming increasingly popular; its products are increasingly rich. Basic principle The so-called <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> system generally consists of three parts: the application server, the client and the application service agreement. The design of the application service agreement is the core of the <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> system. The application of the service agreement here refers to the mechanism of interaction between the client and server in particular. In <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> systems, multiple clients communicate with the server system through application service agreement thus be able to shared server the application service. Application logic, including window systems are running on the server side, the client only has a simple input and output capacity. Compared with the traditional mode of application, application mode based on <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> system has some typical features...|$|R

40|$|This project {{addresses}} two questions: (1) To {{what extent}} might <b>networked</b> <b>computer</b> technologies affect existing writing center practices? and (2) How can one make informed choices about implementing such technologies? It addresses these two questions {{through a combination}} of theoretical inquiry and qualitative research. Specifically, instrumental and substantive theories of technology are implicated in current discussions of <b>networked</b> <b>computers</b> and writing center practice, and the project argues for the value of critical theory as an alternative theoretical framework that enables those who work in writing centers to critique <b>networked</b> <b>computers</b> while envisioning future uses and designs. Important principles for writing center instruction are defined, principles such as individualized instruction, negotiation and dialogue, and minimal risk. The project argues that those principles should be embodied in the computer technologies that writing centers adopt. In order to ensure that such principles may be embodied in technologies adapted for writing center instruction, a set of strategies for their critique and design are defined, a set of strategies that includes both diachronic (historical) and synchronic (contemporary) critiques. A number of principles for the development and adaptation of <b>networked</b> <b>computers</b> are also defined. Specifically, the project argues that design efforts must include a variety of voices, including those of students, tutors, teachers, and administrators. Many of those strategies and principles are illustrated in a study of Purdue 2 ̆ 7 s Online Writing Lab (OWL). This set of strategies and principles offers a theoretically informed set of guidelines for the implementation of <b>networked</b> <b>computer</b> technologies in writing centers in particular and for writing instruction in general. Therefore, the project should be of particular interest to writing center administrators and tutors who are using, or who are planning to incorporate, <b>networked</b> <b>computers</b> in their writing centers. It also should interest writing instructors and writing program administrators who view <b>networked</b> <b>computers</b> {{as an integral part of}} writing instruction. ...|$|R
