5|$|Like many veterans, Graf {{initially}} had a {{hard time}} finding work, but his connections in the football community helped him. Herberger introduced Graf to Roland Endler, an electronics manufacturer ("Elektro-Schweiss-Industrie GmbH") from Neuss. Endler also became president of the FC Bayern Munich football club between 1958 and 1962. Endler employed Graf as a salesman in his company, and Graf eventually advanced to branch leader in Baden-Württemberg and Sales Manager. The link to Bayern Munich allowed him to enjoy his long love of football, although his injuries <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> play competitively again. He did however, return to flying, joining the Zürich branch of the Swiss Aero Club in 1951. Shunned by many veterans, he did remain friends with of a number of his former comrades from the JG52, in particular Alfred Grislawski.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternate}} version {{states the}} legend of Lilith/Lilitu (and a type of spirit of the same name) originally arose from Sumer, where she was described as an infertile [...] "beautiful maiden" [...] and {{was believed to be}} a harlot and vampire who, after having chosen a lover, would <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> go. Lilitu (or the Lilitu spirits) was considered to be an anthropomorphic bird-footed, wind or night demon and was often described as a sexual predator who subsisted on the blood of babies and their mothers. Other Mesopotamian demons such as the Babylonian goddess Lamashtu, (Sumer's Dimme) [...] and Gallu of the Uttuke group are mentioned as having vampiric natures.|$|E
500|$|After Speaker's death, Cobb said, [...] "Terribly depressed. I <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> {{know how}} much I admired him when we were playing against each other... It was only after we finally became {{teammates}} and then retired that I could tell Tris Speaker of the underlying respect I had for him." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "He {{was one of the}} greatest fellows I ever knew, both as a baseball player and as a gentleman." [...] Former Boston teammate Duffy Lewis said, [...] "He was a team player. As great a hitter as he was, he wasn't looking out for his own average ... Speaker was the bell cow of our outfield. Harry Hooper and I would watch him and know how to play the hitters." ...|$|E

500|$|Peters' {{debut album}} in 1980 (an LP), titled Bernadette Peters {{contained}} 10 songs, including [...] "If You Were The Only Boy", [...] "Gee Whiz", [...] "Heartquake", [...] "Should've <b>Never</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Him</b> Go", [...] "Chico's Girl", [...] "Pearl's a Singer", [...] "Other Lady", [...] "Only Wounded", [...] "I Never Thought I'd Break" [...] and [...] "You'll Never Know". [...] The original cover painting by Alberto Vargas {{was one of}} his last works, created at the age of 84. According to The New York Daily News, Peters [...] "persuaded him to do one last 'Vargas Girls' portrait... She just went to his California retreat, asked him to do one more, he looked at her and said, 'You ARE a Vargas girl!'" [...] She kept the original painting.

500|$|... "Let It Down" [...] was {{released}} on All Things Must Pass in November 1970, sequenced between the two minimalist, Band-influenced tracks [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] and [...] "Run of the Mill". Writing in 1977 of the acclaim afforded the album on release, author Nicholas Schaffner described All Things Must Pass as the [...] "crowning glory" [...] of Harrison and Spector's respective careers, and concluded: [...] "Spector was at last working with a talent comparable with his own. The producer's cosmic sound proved a perfect complement to the artist's cosmic vision." [...] Author Robert Rodriguez groups [...] "Let It Down" [...] with other Beatles-era compositions such as [...] "All Things Must Pass", [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] and [...] "Wah-Wah", as the [...] "essential components" [...] of an album that was [...] "revelatory, helping the public understand that, with a talent this big alongside two acknowledged geniuses , no wonder the group could not remain intact". In his album review for the NME, Alan Smith noted [...] "Let It Down"'s [...] "big fuzzy" [...] introduction against its verses' [...] "quiet acid float" [...] and admired the [...] "romantic delicacy and perception" [...] of Harrison's lyrics. [...] "No matter {{the quality of the}} music," [...] Smith added, [...] "his words <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> down." ...|$|E
500|$|Malory informs Sterling that a {{group of}} Cuban hitmen have {{established}} a warrant against him, which makes Sterling even more irate. Burt then calls Malory and asks her out to a movie premiere that night. Later that day, however, Malory gets a letter from Reynolds, saying that he is leaving her for a younger woman and moving back [...] "to Tinseltown". However, Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler) quickly figures out that the letter was written by Sterling himself (citing how no star actor uses the term [...] "Tinseltown"). She quickly figures out that Sterling visited Burt, knocking him out with knock-out gas, and taking him to his apartment. Lana, along with Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell) and Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), go to try to reason with Sterling. Once there, they encounter the Cuban hit squad, who believe Gillette is the real Sterling based on the recon photo they have (taken during the events of [...] "Honeypot") and a firefight begins. Meanwhile, Sterling holds Burt hostage, promising to <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> date his mother again, but he is interrupted by the firefight between the ISIS agents and the Cubans. As they drive off, Sterling prepares to go after them, but Burt says that Sterling won't be able to catch up to them and that he can. Sterling agrees to a bet: If Burt can't catch up to them, he will leave for Hollywood and never call Malory again, and if he does, he can be allowed to continue dating Malory.|$|E

2500|$|Sam [...] "Mad Sam" [...] DeStefano (September 13, 1909 − April 14, 1973) was an Italian-American gangster {{who became}} one of the Chicago Outfit's most notorious loan sharks and sociopathic killers. Chicago-based Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, such as William F. Roemer, Jr., {{considered}} DeStefano to be the worst torture-murderer {{in the history of the}} United States. The Outfit used the mentally unstable and sadistic DeStefano for the torture-murders of Leo Foreman and Arthur Adler, the murder of DeStefano's younger brother, Michael DeStefano, Outfit [...] and many others. However, due to DeStefano's deranged mental state, the Outfit <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> become a made man. At least one Outfit insider, Charles Crimaldi, claimed DeStefano was a Devil worshipper.|$|E
2500|$|On August 8, 1905, Cobb's mother {{fatally shot}} his father {{with a pistol}} {{that his father had}} {{purchased}} for her. Court records indicate that Mr. Cobb had suspected his wife of infidelity and was sneaking past his own bedroom window to catch her in the act. She saw the silhouette of what she presumed to be an intruder and, acting in self-defense, shot and killed her husband. Mrs. Cobb was charged with murder and then released on a $7,000 recognizance bond. She was acquitted on March 31, 1906. Cobb later attributed his ferocious play to his late father, saying, [...] "I did it for my father. He never got to see me play... but I knew he was watching me, and I <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> down." ...|$|E

De Feria has reason to believe that 'she will never bear children'* ...|$|R
60|$|Ponta {{attempted}} {{one of his}} old-time rushes, but {{was stopped}} on the mouth. Implacable, insistent, ever menacing, <b>never</b> <b>letting</b> <b>him</b> rest, Joe followed him up. The round, the thirteenth, closed with a rush, in Ponta's corner. He attempted a rally, was brought to his knees, took the nine seconds' count, {{and then tried to}} clinch into safety, only to receive four of Joe's terrible stomach punches, so that with the gong he fell back, gasping, into the arms of his seconds.|$|R
2500|$|His {{personal}} {{passion and}} extreme comfort around politicians gave him credibility that others ... would lack. Mr Valenti was a consummate salesman, who like all great salesmen ... worked himself up into believing {{the truth of}} his clients' message. Those privileged to see Mr Valenti offstage – talking openly with his clients about what could or could not be achieved, and what artifice would or would not work – are aware that Mr Valenti's clients frequently disagreed with his advice and directed him to deliver a different message through a different artifice. [...] was a great actor working {{on the stage of}} Washington DC (and sometimes globally) on behalf of an industry that appreciated his craft, but that <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> forget that the message was theirs and not his.|$|E
2500|$|In a later {{report to}} Robertson (24 Dec) Haig {{accepted}} the blame, {{stating that the}} troops had been tired {{as a result of}} the attack on Bourlon Wood which he had ordered. Esher had warned Haig (28 October) that Rawlinson was criticising Charteris (known as [...] "the Principal Boy"), and reported that he had told Rawlinson that Charteris had [...] "no influence" [...] over Haig and his information had <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> down. Derby warned Haig (7 December) to sack Charteris, as the War Cabinet and General Staff were displeased at his exaggerated claims of German weakness. Haig took responsibility and defended Charteris. After the battle, the press baron Lord Northcliffe reduced his support of Haig. He had recently been offended on a visit to GHQ, when Haig had been too busy to pay much attention to him. A Times editorial [...] "A Case for Inquiry" [...] (12 Dec) criticised Charteris for his [...] "fatuous estimates" [...] of German losses and morale and called for the sacking of [...] "every blunderer" [...] at GHQ. Haig assumed Lloyd George had inspired the article.|$|E
2500|$|Kelvin Gastelum did {{not appear}} for the {{official}} weigh-ins, announcing via Twitter {{that he would not}} fight Cerrone [...] "on account that he couldn't make the weight limit". Prior to this announcement, Cerrone had already successfully weighed in at 170.4 lbs, meaning he was unable to subsequently rehydrate as Miller did, to keep within 7 pounds of his over-weight opponent. In an interview after hearing the news, Cerrone stated he would have [...] "blown weight too," [...] had Gastelum informed him prior. As a result, Gastelum was pulled from the card and UFC president Dana White stated he will <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> fight at welterweight in the organization again, and that he believes Gastelum missed weight by 10 pounds. Despite the one-day notice, it was reported a small number of fighters were interested in filling in to fight Cerrone. According to one candidate Alan Jouban, UFC matchmaker Joe Silva was interested in having him fill in, however, according to Jouban, the NYSAC would not consider sanctioning any fighters on such short notice.|$|E

2500|$|Zaghba (born 1995 in Fez, Morocco) was at {{the time}} of the attack living in east London where he worked in a fast food outlet. He also worked at an Islamic {{television}} channel in London. Zaghba was born to a Moroccan Muslim father and an Italian Catholic Christian mother who had converted to Islam to marry. Zaghba had dual Moroccan and Italian nationality. When his parents divorced, he went to Italy with his mother. In 2016, Zaghba was stopped at Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport by Italian officers who found ISIS-related materials on his mobile phone; he was stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. Italian authorities said Zaghba was monitored continuously while in Italy and that the UK was informed about him. Giuseppe Amato, an Italian prosecutor, said [...] "We did our best. We could just monitor and surveil... and send a note to British authorities, that's all we could do and we did it. Since he moved to London, he came back to Italy once in a while for a total of 10 days. And during those 10 days we <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> out of our sight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fred MacMurray was {{accustomed}} to playing [...] "happy-go-lucky good guys" [...] in light comedies, and when Wilder first approached him about the Neff role, MacMurray said, [...] "You're making the mistake of your life!" [...] Playing a serious role required acting, he said, [...] "and I can't do it." [...] But Wilder pestered him about it every single day – at home, in the studio commissary, in his dressing room, on the sidewalk – until he simply wore the actor down. MacMurray felt safe about his acquiescence since Paramount, who had him under contract and had carefully crafted his good guy image, would <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> play a [...] "wrong" [...] role. His trust, however, was misplaced: his contract was up for renewal at the time, and ever since his friend and co-star, Carole Lombard, had shrewdly and successfully {{taught him how to}} play hardball with the studio bosses, he wasn't the pliable pushover of old. Paramount executives decided to let him play the unsavory role to teach him a lesson. A lesson was indeed taught, but not the one Paramount had in mind. MacMurray made a great heel and his performance demonstrated new breadths of his acting talent. [...] "I never dreamed it would be the best picture I ever made," [...] he said.|$|E

25|$|Howard and Harold are {{helicopter}} {{parents to}} Clyde {{and tend to}} be overprotective of him. Howard feels {{the need to protect}} Clyde at all times and <b>never</b> <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> out of sight, unless he is with Lincoln or at school. Howard is also sensitive and overemotional, often needing Harold to calm him down when he gets worked up. Harold's demeanor is the opposite; he is straightforward and even-tempered. Both of the McBrides have a fondness for cats and have adopted two, Cleopawtra and Nepurrtiti (named after Cleopatra and Nefertiti, two Egyptian queens). Their surname is ironic because a bride is a newlywed woman, but they are two married men.|$|R
50|$|Archie {{considers}} Veronica {{to be his}} girlfriend, but as beautiful, stylish, {{and wealthy}} as she is, Veronica can easily manipulate him, and although he sometimes realizes it, he cannot do anything about it. He keeps running back to her, but she is rarely devoted to him. Archie is always fighting for her affection with his rival, Reggie Mantle, and occasionally other boys. Veronica keeps Archie guessing, <b>never</b> <b>letting</b> <b>him</b> take her for granted, which makes him prefer Veronica over Betty. Archie has no problem chasing other girls when Veronica is not around, and despite Veronica's warnings he always dates Betty when Veronica is out of town. Archie is married to Veronica in Archie Marries Veronica: Life With Archie series.|$|R

50|$|The Hermit, Wendelin von Grübben, seeks {{peace of}} mind through prayer. The sound of {{trumpets}} can be heard as war rages in the distance. Wendelin's meditation is interrupted {{by the appearance of}} Melchior, an astrologer, and his Swedish female attendant, Ebba. Melchior declares that astrology <b>never</b> <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> down, and surprises Wendelin by claiming to be a descendant of the Grübben family and consequently entitled to marry one Hildegarde von Vliessen, thereby saving the Grübben fortune. He cannot prove that there are no remaining male descendants of the Grübben family, but he claims that astrologically speaking {{there is no evidence of}} any living descendants. In order to be left in peace, Wendelin hands over to Melchior the farewell letter that he wrote when initially planning to kill himself and Simplicius.|$|R

The two then get into the car. The chapter then {{switches}} to the simultaneous confessional of both Sylvester and Twan. Twan starts off by saying that Sylvester <b>never</b> <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> have fun. Sylvester then informs the viewers that Twan likes to talk a lot but cannot really back it up. He then informs Twan that true thugs move in silence. After a comical dialogue, the chapter ends with their laughing.|$|R
