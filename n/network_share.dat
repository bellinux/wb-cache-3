40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} <b>network</b> <b>sharing</b> on mobile <b>networks</b> and {{examines}} {{the impact on}} profitability and competition. <b>Network</b> <b>sharing</b> refers to that operators collaborates with its competitors on part of the production of mobile services, and it could vary from passive sharing, like sharing of sites or basic facilities, to active sharing, like radio access networks or even entire networks. The paper takes a global scope on examining the extent of <b>network</b> <b>sharing.</b> The emergence of a sector with dedicated infrastructure or tower companies are documented through a mapping of listed companies' which facilities a detailed financial analysis. The rationale for <b>network</b> <b>sharing</b> could be grouped into three factors: 1) lower cost and reduce capital spending {{as well as to}} raise capital, 2) improve coverage and services, and 3) reduce the negative impact on the environment. The increased usage of <b>network</b> <b>sharing</b> throughout the world signals {{that it is going to}} develop and in the longer run move focus from infrastructure based to service based competition. Although operators have been able to lower network operation cost the impact on profitability varies. The dedicated tower and infrastructure companies manage considerable higher debt ratios compared to operators potentially having a transformative impact on the operator business. Despite an extensive usage of <b>network</b> <b>sharing</b> - where competitors are collaborating - competition on the retail market prevails. A potential spillover effect from network collaboration to the downstream market is a risk, but the social benefit with larger coverage and improved capacity has so far given extensive support for <b>network</b> <b>sharing...</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{file system}} can present a file of a {{particular}} type as a volume in its own right, similar to a loop device. The OS refers to this functionality as an image filing system. This allows transparent handling of archives and similar files, which appear as directories with some special properties. Files inside the image file appear in the hierarchy underneath the parent archive. It is not necessary for the archive to contain the data it refers to: some symbolic link and <b>network</b> <b>share</b> filesystems put a reference inside the image file and go elsewhere for the data.|$|E

2500|$|The {{file system}} is volume-oriented: {{the top level}} of the file {{hierarchy}} is a volume (disc, <b>network</b> <b>share)</b> prefixed by the filesystem type. To determine file type, the OS uses metadata instead of file extensions. Colons are used to separate the filesystem {{from the rest of}} the path; the root is represented by a dollar ($) sign and directories are separated by a full stop (.). Extensions from foreign filesystems are shown using a slash (example.txt becomes example/txt). For example, ADFS::HardDisc4.$ is the root of the disc named HardDisc4 using the ADFS filesystem. [...] filetypes can be preserved on other systems by appending the hexadecimal type as ',xxx' to filenames. When using cross-platform software, filetypes can be invoked on other systems by naming appending '/' to the filename under [...]|$|E

While some systems may simply distinguish between [...] "privileged" [...] and [...] "non-privileged", systems commonly have a form of requester identity, such as a user name. To establish identity there may be a process of authentication. Often a username must be quoted, and each username may have a password. Other methods of authentication, such as magnetic cards or biometric data, might be used instead. In some cases, especially connections from the network, resources may be accessed with no authentication at all (such as reading files over a <b>network</b> <b>share).</b> Also covered by the concept of requester identity is authorization; the particular services and resources accessible by the requester once logged into a system are tied to either the requester's user account or to the variously configured groups of users to which the requester belongs.|$|E

TR 23. 851 is now 50 % complete and therefore ready for presentation for information to SA. A number of working assumptions for <b>network</b> <b>sharing</b> have been agreed to. They are as follows:- Cell selection and re-selection concepts are to be kept as they are, {{for as long as}} possible. - LA / RA concepts are to be kept as they are, for as long as possible. - All UEs accessing any of the PLMNs via the shared AN should see the same LA / RA identities and borders to avoid problems with old mobiles, cell planning interactions with LA, and National roaming and regional provision concepts. - <b>Network</b> <b>sharing</b> partners should be able to use different Network Mode of Operation (NMO) within of the shared RAN since this allows the sharing partners to decide upon internal core network architecture individually. - Legacy mobiles must be supported. The TR describes solutions for <b>network</b> <b>sharing</b> based on these assumptions. Changes since last presentation to TSG SA: Not applicable. This is the first presentation. Outstanding Issues: After more details concerning the different proposed techniques and solutions have been specified, an evaluation shall be done and the most appropriate solution for <b>network</b> <b>sharing</b> support shall be chosen...|$|R
