Vrančić’s {{dictionary}} has {{a considerable}} number of adverbial derivatives, while the number of compound adjectives is noticeably smaller. General descriptive adjectives are derived with suffixes -(a) k, -(a) n, -en, -it, and derivatives coincide semantically to todays words. In the category of adjectives with special meaning, the distribution of suffixes and their combinations with stems directly influences the semantics of a derivative. Frequently, it is not only a question of Vrančić’s subjective intervention but of the fact that such phenomena are a characteristic feature of the language of older writers, as well as a few younger ones (Kašić, Mikalja, Vitezović). The number of Vrančić’s hapax legomena and firstly attested words in that group is a consequence of his efforts to find equivalents to Latin headwords. In a number of examples Vrančić’s solution is modelled on a Latin or Italian equivalent, and rarely on a Hungarian or German one.

Pokušavajući je imenovati, filozof se nalazi u paradoksalnoj poziciji: rastumačena, tajna glazbe neopazice mu izmakne, otkrije mu se prikrivajući se u isti mah, i tako ga odvede upravo <b>na</b> onaj <b>put</b> što ga je želio ostaviti za sobom. Članak evocira četiri međusobno povezana prizora ovoga zbivanja. In the {{philosophical}} writings of Ivan Focht (Sarajevo, 1927 — Zagreb, 1992) the phrase "mystery of music" (tajna glazbe) plays a significant role. As {{a starting point}} for the discussion of its meanings in the following article, a detailed reading of Focht’s writings on art, notably of his book Contemporary Aesthetics of Music (Savremena estetika muzike, 1980), is undertaken. In this collection of portraits of contemporary theorists, who significantly contributed to the aesthetics of music, Focht judges their positions according to their implicit stance toward Hegel’s definition of art as the "sensuous shining of the idea", which in his opinion represents the heart of aesthetics as a discipline {{and at the same time}} has devastating consequences for the art itself. Reading of Focht’s earlier writings reveals that his search for the "mystery of music" was marked from the very beginning by a twofold experience: on one side by the figure of the "end of art" imposed on art by aesthetics (Focht’s habilitation theses, published in 1961, was explicitly dedicated to "Hegel’s doctrine on the end of art"), a figure whose echo Focht found in the proclamations of socialist realism in art, actual in the postwar years in socialist Yugoslavia, and on the other by the experience of modern art, including modern music. In order to respond to the figure of the "end of art" and at the same time to the experience of modern music, Focht’s thoughts on the "mystery of music" move rhythmically, switching between his attention to the "unheard tone" in the notions imposed upon music by aesthetics, and his efforts to determine music ontologically through the category of possibility...|$|R

The severe ITER nuclear radiation field is expected to lead to induced currents that could perturb diagnostic measurements. In order to assess this problem and to find mitigation strategies models were developed for the calculation of neutron-and gamma-induced currents in MI cables and in LTCC coils. The models are based on calculations with the MCNPX code, combined with a dedicated model for the drift of electrons stopped in the insulator. The gamma induced currents can be easily calculated with a single coupled photon-electron MCNPX calculation. The prompt neutron induced currents requires only a single coupled neutron-photon-electron MCNPX run. The various delayed neutron contributions require a careful analysis of all possibly relevant neutron-induced reaction paths and a combination {{of different types of}} MCNPX calculations. The models were applied for a specific twin-core copper MI cable, for one quad-core copper cable and for silver conductor LTCC coils (one with silver ground plates {{in order to reduce the}} currents and one without such silver ground plates). Calculations were performed for irradiation conditions (neutron and gamma spectra and fluxes) in relevant positions in ITER and in the Y 3 irradiation channel of the BR 1 reactor at SCK•CEN, in which an irradiation test of these four test devices was carried out afterwards. We will present the basic elements of the models and show the results of all relevant partial currents (gamma and neutron induced, prompt and various delayed currents) in BR 1 -Y 3 conditions. Experimental data will be shown and analysed in terms of the respective contributions. The tests were performed at reactor powers of 350 kW and 1 MW, leading to thermal neutron fluxes of 1 E 11 n/cm 2 s and 3 E 11 n/cm 2 s, respectively. The corresponding total radiation induced currents are ranging from 1 to 7 <b>nA</b> only, <b>putting</b> a challenge on the acquisition system and on the data analysis. The detailed experimental results will be compared with the corresponding values predicted by the model.

Each student has been examined by the social background and status, place of study, choice of subject (Roman law, canon law or utrumque ius), bursary status, whether he completed the studies or not, and his ensuing life and career. The analysis shows that students fall into three major types: patrician canon, non-patrician cleric and patrician layman. Law seemed to have been most popular among the canons (10 students), to whom doctorate would bring prestige and advancement in the church career. Their apparent preference to the study of law instead of theology may be accounted by the former’s reputation. Only a few laymen have been traced among the law students because the Ragusan state refused to consider the forming of a special professional elite performing judicial duties. At least two-thirds of the Dubrovnik students studied at the University of Padua, which flourished at the time.

The {{emigration}} of Boka inhabitants {{across the}} Adriatic to Venice {{make them a}} constituent and, going by numbers, a significant segment {{of the history of}} Croatian migratory movements during the early Modern Age. During the most intensive immigration to the city on the lagoons, the common metropolis of the time for the whole coastal region from Umag to Bar, the emigrants from Kotor made up numerically the majority of the numerous Croatian community in Venice which was recognized both by its activities and its reputation. It was precisely at this time, during the XVIth century, that large numbers of eminent Croatian emigrants, entrepreneurs, merchants, seamen but also artists and intellectuals as well were active in the city on the lagoons who each in his own way made significant contributions to the cultural and economic connections between the two neighboring coasts. Stjepan Tartaro – an emigrant from Boka {{from the beginning of the}} XVIth century – was precisely an example of such an industrious and enterprising, successful and wealthy Croat in Venice. On the basis of original sources from the State Archive in Venice, primarily from last testaments, the article analyzes the life of Stjepan Tartaro and of his wife Helena Boico and describes the basic facets of their activities in Venice. The author describes their economic fortunes and business activities, their ties with Venetian religious communities and clergy and – particularly – their connections to the Croatian emigrant community and their national fraternal association of St George and Tripun. The last testaments of the Tartaro marriage partners, rich in content, bear witness to the significant role they played in the everyday life of the Croatian diaspora in Venice, their ties to emigrants from all parts of the Croatian ethnic space of the time (particularly to the people coming from Boka) but also their total adaptation to the new environment in which they found their second (and permanent) homeland. The life journeys and fates of the Tartaro family are doubtlessly but one fragment from the data-abundant history of the Croatian community in Venice during the XVIth century – a period of the strongest migration movements between the two Adriatic shores and the time of the most numerous presence of Croats in Venice. These bear witness to how seemingly wholly ordinary individuals, perhaps accidental to key historical events, contributed to the ties and the propinquity of two people who are connected by a common sea...|$|R
