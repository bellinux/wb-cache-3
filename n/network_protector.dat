50|$|In March 2014 HP renamed its SDN BYOD {{security}} application from Sentinel to <b>Network</b> <b>Protector.</b> HP <b>Network</b> <b>Protector</b> sits {{on top of}} the HP SDN VAN Controller.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> {{does not}} protect the (secondary) network cable from overload. The <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> is {{installed}} {{to protect the}} stability and reliability of the secondary grid by preventing power flow away from the customers and into the primary feeders.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> {{is a type}} of {{electric}} protective device used in electricity distribution systems. The <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> automatically disconnect its associated power transformer from the secondary network when the power starts flowing in reverse direction. Network protectors are used on both spot networks and grid networks. The secondary grid system improves continuity of service for customers, since multiple sources are available to supply the load; a fault with any one supply is automatically isolated by the <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> and does not interrupt service from the other sources. Secondary grids are often used in downtown areas of cities where there are many customers in a small area.|$|E
50|$|Typically, <b>network</b> <b>protectors</b> are {{contained}} inside a submersible enclosure which is {{bolted to the}} throat of the network transformer and placed in underground vaults. IEEE standard C57.12.44 covers <b>network</b> <b>protectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Network</b> <b>protectors,</b> (reverse current relays), {{are used}} to detect any open {{circuits}} that are letting the electrical current flow back towards its source.|$|R
40|$|A {{cable system}} carries {{one or more}} {{insulated}} conductors completely enclosed within a shield having one end connected to ground. A lightning <b>protector</b> <b>network</b> connects {{the other end of}} the shield to ground. The <b>protector</b> <b>network</b> is normally open circuited and becomes only short circuited in response to a momentary abnormal surge voltage induced in the shield. The <b>protector</b> <b>network's</b> open to short impedance change completes a conductive circuit path between the shield and the two grounded ends for conducting a shield current which has the desired effect of protecting the signal carrying conductors in the cable from the large surge voltage...|$|R
50|$|Typically the <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> is set {{to close}} when the voltage {{difference}} and phase angle are such that the transformer will supply power to the secondary grid, and {{is set to}} open when the secondary grid would back-feed through the transformer and supply power to the primary circuit.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{if there}} is a fault on the {{secondary}} grid, the <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> is not designed to open its contacts up. The secondary fault will continue to be fed from the primary side of the system. In some cases, networks are designed with cable limiters (like fuses) to melt and disconnect the secondary fault under the right conditions. In other cases, the utility lets cable 'burn clear', in which case the fault is allowed to remain fed until the cables fuse, then the fault is isolated.|$|E
5000|$|Terrorist groups use the Web {{as their}} {{infrastructure}} for various purposes. Elovici designed the advanced terrorist detection system (ATDS) which analyzes {{the content of}} information accessed by Web users in order to track down online access to abnormal content, including terrorist-generated sites; ATDS was developed and evaluated using real users and terror-related data. In other research, he hypothesized that {{a new type of}} information security threat may involve a class of malware that does not have the goal of corrupting and taking control of the machines it infects or stealing specific information stored on them. This research focused on malware aimed at stealing social network and behavioral information through data collection and network science inference techniques. Elovici referred to this type of attack as the stealing-reality attack, and he demonstrated how such an attack can propagate in real social networks. Link prediction in social networks {{is one of the key}} tools in Web intelligence, and Elovici developed a very accurate link prediction algorithm to detect fake profiles in social networks which was evaluated on several large social networks. Fake profiles which proliferate on social networks may be used for good as well as malicious purposes, and the link prediction algorithm may allow identifying a connection between terrorists that does not exist in a social graph. Elovici also developed the Social <b>Network</b> <b>Protector,</b> software based on advanced detection mechanisms that can help teenagers identify suspicious members in their social network. The Social <b>Network</b> <b>Protector</b> Facebook app was installed by more than 3000 users.|$|E

5000|$|Before the Dawn of the Æsir, {{the great}} {{machines}} called the [...] "Children of Ymir" [...] stalked Earth, bent on destroying humanity. As the war escalated, man and machine exchanged nuclear and anti-matter weapons, leaving a once-lush world frozen in a thousand-year winter. Humanity now teeters {{on the brink}} of extinction. Earth's population is now only a few million sheltered in the walled enclave of Midgard. The great sentient machines have prospered in the eternal winter. Humanity, however, is not alone. They pray to the Æsir and faithfully worship the great Organically Distributed Intelligence <b>Network.</b> As <b>protectors,</b> it is the Æsir's duty to ensure humanity survives. Their cybernetically-enhanced bodies and minds make them far more powerful than mortals, and they are properly revered as gods.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} {{customers}} fed by a single distribution transformer varies depending on the {{number of customers}} in an area. Several homes may be fed off a single transformer in urban areas; rural distribution may require one transformer per customer. A large commercial or industrial complex will have multiple distribution transformers. Padmount transformers are used in urban areas and neighborhoods where the primary distribution lines run underground. Many large buildings have electric service provided at primary distribution voltage. These buildings have customer-owned transformers in the basement for step-down purposes. In a secondary network system as used in urban areas, many distribution transformers may be connected in parallel, each equipped with its own <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> circuit breaker to isolate it from the secondary network in case of a fault.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there is}} a fault on the primary feeder, the {{substation}} circuit-breaker is meant to open, disconnecting the primary feeder from one side. The problem is that this primary cable is also connected to a network transformer, which is interconnected to other network transformers on its secondary side. The secondary network will energize the primary feeder through the network transformer. This can be very dangerous, because a fault {{will continue to be}} 'fed' from the secondary network side of transformer. Even without a fault, if the electric utility wants to perform maintenance on that primary cable, they must have a way to fully disconnect that primary cable, without worrying about the cable being energized by the secondary network through the network transformer. Thus, the <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> is designed to open its contacts if the relay senses backwards flowing current.|$|E
50|$|Software defined networking: HP {{software-defined}} networking products {{are designed to}} provide an end-to-end solution to automate the network from data center to campus and branch. The SDN Ecosystem includes the HP <b>Network</b> <b>Protector</b> SDN Application and the HP Network Optimizer Application for Microsoft Lync, as well as SDN-related products from third-party developers that integrate with HP SDN products. The HP SDN Dev Center provides resources for developers to produce applications for HP SDN products; it includes the HP SDN App Store and an SDN developer community forum. The SDN App Store {{can be used to}} browse, search, purchase, and download SDN applications onto the HP VAN SDN controller. HP SDN infrastructure technologies, including over 50 OpenFlow-enabled switches such as the HP FlexFabric 5930 Switch Series, support the Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN), an encapsulation protocol for running virtual networks across the network. The HP Virtual Cloud Networking (VCN) SDN Application provides a multitenant network virtualization service for KVM and VMware ESX multi-hypervisor data center applications and acts as a bridge between the HP Helion OpenStack cloud computing platform and the HP VAN SDN controller.|$|E
30|$|A {{particular}} signaling mechanism can {{reserve the}} competing channel for a low priority network[15, 25]. Hou et al.[25] utilized a dual-radio system equipped with both ZigBee and Wi-Fi transceivers. Before transmitting a ZigBee packet, the hybrid device exchanges 802.11 RTS/CTS packets to prevent nearby Wi-Fi networks from sending traffic. The authors in[15] proposed a cooperative busy tone mechanism {{that not only}} transmits ZigBee data packets but also concurrently reserves the channel through the frequency flip. These proposals, however, require to send additional negotiation messages for the channel reservation. These ZigBee messages may also be corrupted by Wi-Fi transmissions, in effect, silencing both <b>networks.</b> Unlike previous <b>protectors,</b> a self-sensing mechanism of NBP correctly determines when to preempt the Wi-Fi transmissions and does not require any specific coordination.|$|R
40|$|The use of tall towers for {{the normal}} {{operation}} of meteorological instrumentation {{is ideal for}} ensuring that representative measurements are obtained relative to the nearby terrain. Tall towers also expose instrumentation to unwanted environmental side-effects such as lightning surges. The proximity of many industrial observation sites for meteorological towers also introduces unwanted problems including radio frequency interference (RFI) from radio, television, or microwave transmitters, explosive environments, and electrical power cabling. Typical meteorological instrumentation systems incorporate protective mechanisms such as grounding <b>networks,</b> surge <b>protectors</b> and electrical shielding to combat electrical problems. Still, even with elaborate protective systems, damages to instrumentation {{and a loss of}} valid data can occur which often results in extended outages. The use of fiber optic technology in meteorological instrumentation holds great promise to eliminate many of the problems associated with monitoring on tall towers. A fiber optic sensor would be impervious to lightning surges and all forms of RFI. The sensor would provide a high signal to noise ratio output since little or no electrical interference would be involved in data transmission. A longer field life for mechanical devices such as a wind vane would be realized since all physical contact points, such as those found in a potentiometer, would be eliminated. Therefore, the precision, resolution, linearity, starting threshold and accuracy could be dramatically improved without the hindrance of moving parts...|$|R
40|$|From 1762 to 1780, Countess Fanny de Beauharnais {{gathered}} around her {{a circle of}} light poets that is still little known. Her first Parisian salon, held {{under the auspices of}} Claude-Joseph Dorat, hosted among numerous personalities many men of letters, such as Colardeau, Pezay, Cubières and others, who used to dedicate their Friday nights to sociability. The whole group constituted a particular literary community, traditionally assembled under the name of “the school of Dorat”. By changing the usual point of view, I intended to reveal that Fanny de Beauharnais, who was an authoress herself, had as much as her lover a catalyst effect in promoting the community they both hosted. As a part of a larger reflection, my presentation showed that the Countess put in good use her knowledge of worldly culture to serve the literary ambitions of her guests. Besides seeking to mobilize <b>networks</b> of influential <b>protectors</b> in their favor, she also made a point of playing a role of cultural mediator and literary mentor that her position as a socialite in the Republic of Letters allowed her to hold. In doing so, Fanny de Beauharnais exceeded the simplistic function of the inspirational muse, to which some historians tended to limit her (see, for instance, Gustave Desnoiresterres Le Chevalier Dorat et les poètes légers du XVIIIe siècle, 1887). info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
5000|$|Network protectors {{typically}} have three settings, [...] "automatic", [...] "open", and [...] "close". The top side {{is fed from}} multiple protectors and is always energized unless all units on a spot network are in the open position. Grid units will always be energized on the top side from the many other units tied into the grid.A spot network is 2 or more transformers dedicated to a single customer. The grid feeds multiple customers.A <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> has a circuit breaker set of contacts and a controlling protection relay. The components are enclosed in a protective housing; some network protectors are installed on transformers below grade and must be in water-resistant enclosures. The mechanism contains electrical and mechanical parts to switch open and close the secondary contacts. The controlling relay monitors voltage and current in the transformer, and opens or closes the contact mechanism through electrical signals. The relay uses a power/time curve so that small, short term reverse power flow (such as from elevator hoists) are ignored. Spot units will be 277/480 and the grid units will be 125/216.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{an application of}} machine learning techniques toward the problem of predicting which <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> switch {{is the cause of}} an Alive on Back-Feed (ABF) event in the New York City power distribution system. When an electrical feeder is shut down, all <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> switches connected to the feeder should open to isolate the feeder. When a switch malfunctions and does not open, electrical current flows into the feeder, which remains energized. This causes the feeder to be “alive ” on back-feed current, and maintenance cannot proceed. Our goal is to provide a ranking of <b>network</b> <b>protector</b> switches according to their susceptibility to such malfunction. Such a ranking can assist prioritization of which switches to repair when an ABF event occurs. We compare three methods for computing a ranking: an SVM classification approach, a maximum entropy density estimation approach and an SVM-ranking approach. ...|$|E
