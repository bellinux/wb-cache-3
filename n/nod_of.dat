5|$|A {{turning point}} of the game came on the first {{possession}} of the second half. The Giants received the second half kickoff, and led a short drive that stalled at their own 47-yard line. On fourth and 1, the Giants lined up in a punt formation before shifting to a traditional set. Second string quarterback Jeff Rutledge then looked over to Parcells for a signal {{as to whether he}} should try to draw the defense offside or run a play. After a <b>nod</b> <b>of</b> approval from Parcells, he ran a quarterback sneak for a first down. The Giants scored on the drive, and built a 39–13 lead before a late touchdown by the Broncos made the final score 39–20. Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro and Phil McConkey to give him three on the game, and Joe Morris and Ottis Anderson each rushed for one touchdown. The Giants' defense limited the Broncos to only two net yards and 10 offensive plays in the third quarter. The 30 second half points set a Super Bowl-record for points in a half, and Simms was named MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record which still stands.|$|E
25|$|El Shehaby {{lost his}} first match to Israel's Or Sasson, {{but refused to}} bow or shake hands with him, {{resulting}} to a loud jeer from the crowd. When Sasson extended his hand to shake after the match, El Shehaby backed away, shaking his head. The referee called El Shehaby back to the mat and obliged him to bow, at which point El Shehaby gave a quick <b>nod</b> <b>of</b> his head. El Shehaby's conduct was widely condemned as unsportsmanlike. It is unclear what potential punishment El Shehaby or Egyptian judo as a whole could face, but his hopes of medaling were dashed regardless due to Sasson's decisive performance in the quarterfinals.|$|E
500|$|The {{rhythm of}} the music pauses for two beats. It resumes at a calmer level as the camera shows Jordan in street clothes, {{watching}} from the sideline. Jordan is shown for just two seconds, smiling and nodding. Waterbury said of this shot, [...] "We {{wanted to make sure}} that, through this commercial, people understood Michael's role as a mentor and a coach. His <b>nod</b> <b>of</b> approval at the end is his way of saying, 'Go.'" [...] The camera cuts back to the young player; the tagline [...] "LET YOUR GAME SPEAK" [...] is shown, and the scene fades to black with the [...] "XXI" [...] logo and then the [...] "Jumpman" [...] logo.|$|E

Lansbury was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1994, and promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to drama, charitable work, and philanthropy. On being made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, Lansbury stated: [...] "I'm joining a marvellous {{group of women}} I greatly admire like Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. It's a lovely thing to be given that <b>nod</b> <b>of</b> approval by your own country and I really cherish it." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a {{successful}} catalogue of songs, which included [...] "What's That For, Eh?", about a little girl who asks her parents the meaning of various everyday household objects. Her biographer and theatre historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope described the song as being [...] "blue" [...] and thought that it spoke volumes about her reputation thanks to her [...] "wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the <b>nod</b> <b>of</b> the head." [...] Similar-styled songs followed; [...] "She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before", told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train. [...] This was followed by [...] "The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance go By"; [...] "We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do"; [...] "Oh You Wink the Other Eye" [...] and [...] "Twiggy Vous"—a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad. After an evening's performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage. [...] Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She took a chance and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself {{as a member of the}} French government. He confirmed to her that [...] "Twiggy Vous" [...] was [...] "most popular in Paris"; she was delighted at the news. [...] At the end of the year, Lloyd returned to London where she appeared in the Christmas pantomime Cinderella in Peckham alongside her sister Alice.|$|E

Carlene Aguilar, {{who represented the}} National Capital Region (NCR), won Miss Philippines 2001 with the theme focused on the environment. She was a 19-year-old advertising and public relations student at the Assumption College when she was crowned.

2500|$|So in {{love with}} praise, both popular and in the highest circles, is Wilberforce, observes Hazlitt, that he was even half {{inclined}} {{to give up his}} favorite cause, abolition of the slave trade, when William Pitt, the Prime Minister, was set to abandon it, and he sided with Pitt in approval of the repressive measures then imposed by the government in Britain and the government's later severe measures during the period of the Napoleonic Wars and afterward. [...] "He has no mercy on those who claim a property in negro-slaves as so much live-stock on their estates ... but not a word has he to say, not a whisper does he breathe against the claim set up by the Despots of the Earth over their Continental subjects, but does every thing in his power to confirm and sanction it! He must give no offence. ... He preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages; and tolerates its worst abuses in civilized states." [...] To [...] "render signal services to mankind" [...] requires greater moral strength than Wilberforce possesses: what is needed is [...] "a severity, a sternness, a self-denial, and a painful sense of duty" [...] that in Wilberforce's case vanish in exchange for a <b>nod</b> <b>of</b> approval from the king or the Prime Minister. Even in Wilberforce's acts of independence from his party's political standpoint, Hazlitt notes a subtle balancing of motives. In the words of Wilberforce biographer William Hague, who quotes Hazlitt's Spirit of the Age criticism, [...] "Hazlitt considered that Wilberforce meant well, but would never risk becoming unpopular with the ruling establishment: 'He ... reaps the credit of independence without the obloquy ... He has all the air of the most perfect independence, and gains a character for impartiality and candour, when he is only striking a balance between the éclat of differing from a Minister on some vantage ground, and the risk or odium that may attend it.|$|E

40|$|Topographically convex regions {{within a}} {{catchment}} basin represent varied degrees of hill-slopes. The nonnetwork space (M), {{the characterization of}} which we address in this letter, is akin to the space that is achieved by subtracting channelized portions contributed due to concave regions from the watershed space (X). This non-network space is similar to non-channelized convex region within a catchment basin. We propose an alternative shape-dependent quantity like fractal dimension to characterize this non-network space. Towards this goal, we decompose the non-network space in two-dimensional discrete space into simple non-overlapping disks (<b>NODs)</b> <b>of</b> various sizes by employing mathematical morphological transformations and certain logical operations. Furthermore, we plot the number <b>of</b> <b>NODs</b> <b>of</b> less than threshold radius against the radius, and compute the shape-dependent fractal dimension of non-network space...|$|R
