5|$|On 9 May 2010, the 27 EU {{member states}} agreed {{to create the}} European Financial Stability Facility, a legal {{instrument}} aiming at preserving financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to eurozone states in difficulty.

5|$|This Extended Range Nike Zeus, or Zeus EX for short, {{would be}} able to provide {{protection}} over a wider area, reducing the number of bases <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> full-country defense.

5|$|Bordagaray {{made his}} {{professional}} baseball debut in {{minor league baseball}} with the Sacramento Senators of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) during the 1931 season. They originally gave him a three-week tryout without pay, {{so that he could}} retain his amateur status; {{at the end of the}} tryout, the Senators offered Bordagaray his first professional contract. At only 20 years of age, Bordagaray's father <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> his consent. Though his father initially refused and threatened to take the Senators to court, he changed his mind after visiting his son. Fresno State's football coach, Stan Borleske, attempted to negotiate Bordagaray's release, but Senators owner Lewis Moreing refused.|$|E
5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system would be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> protection against an unsophisticated attack with {{a limited number of}} warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Ecological {{footprint}} measures {{human consumption}} {{in terms of}} the biologically productive land <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 global hectares per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms). The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. fossil fuels); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by over exploiting forests and fisheries).|$|E

5|$|Kalākaua {{met with}} the Viceroy on March 31 to propose the {{emigration}} of unmarried Chinese women, as well as Chinese family units to Hawaii, to counterbalance the labor population of unmarried Chinese men. The Viceroy responded favorably and agreed to co-sponsor such an emigration with the Hawaiian government. Li arranged several events to provide Kalākaua {{the opportunity to meet}} the city's influential persons. A copy of a draft of a proposed treaty was forwarded to Hawaii's Minister of Foreign Affairs Green. The Hong Kong Daily News held a positive view of Hawaii's treatment of existing Chinese laborers, but stated that the Chinese government <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> financial assistance for family emigration to Hawaii. The royal party returned to Shanghai on April 6. A proposed trip to Beijing was aborted when Empress Dowager Ci'an died on April 8. They sailed out of China the next day.|$|E
5|$|United States forces {{captured}} Guam, Saipan and Tinian in the Mariana Islands between June and August 1944, {{as part of}} the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. These islands were <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> {{bases for}} USAAF Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers to attack the Japanese home islands. Construction of the large air bases needed to support B-29s began on Saipan in June 1944, {{before the end of the}} Battle of Saipan, and work on air fields on Tinian and Guam commenced in July and August respectively. The B-29s of the XXI Bomber Command began to arrive at Saipan starting on October12, and the 73rd Bombardment Wing began flying warm-up missions against Japanese-held islands in the Pacific on October27 in preparation for operations against Japan itself.|$|E
