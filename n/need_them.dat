5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not <b>need</b> <b>them,</b> having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} eight years {{following}} the conclusion of Banjo-Tooie, in which Gruntilda's body was destroyed by Banjo and Kazooie. In the time since, the two have become lazy and out of shape from their lack of adventuring. Gruntilda's detached head returns to their home of Spiral Mountain for revenge, but the three are interrupted by the sudden appearance of the Lord of Games (L.O.G.), the creator of all video games. He decides to settle {{the conflict between the}} two by devising a series of worlds and challenges. He uses his powers to give Gruntilda an artificial body and to restore the duo's physical fitness, but not their moves from previous games, claiming that they will not <b>need</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically <b>need</b> <b>them,</b> and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E

Set in contemporary Manchester, Elidor tells the story of four children who enter into a derelict Victorian church, in which they find a portal to the magical realm of Elidor. Here, they are entrusted by King Malebron to help rescue four treasures which have been stolen by the forces of evil who are attempting {{to take control of the}} kingdom.

25|$|Not all was rosy for Gray however. He {{applied for}} extra gas coupons, {{reasoning}} {{that he would}} <b>need</b> <b>them</b> to drive about the countryside collecting plot material for the strip. But an Office of Price Administration clerk named Flack refused to give Gray the coupons, explaining that cartoons were not vital to the war effort. Gray requested a hearing and the original decision was upheld. Gray was furious and vented in the strip, with especial venom directed at Flack, government price controls, and other concerns. Gray had his supporters, but Flack's neighbors defended him in the local newspaper and tongue-lashed Gray. Flack threatened to sue for libel, and some papers cancelled the strip. Gray showed no remorse, but did discontinue the sequence.|$|E
5000|$|Eisenhower {{appointed}} his friend, {{retired general}} Lucius Clay, {{to lead a}} presidential commission to study highway design proposals. In January 1955 they recommended a 10-year construction program costing $101 billion to build 41,000 miles of divided highways that would link all medium and major cities. Clay talked Eisenhower out of using toll roads. After compromising with Democrats in 1956, the system was financed by a trust fund based on gasoline taxes of four cents a gallon and taxes on tires. The Federal share of the funding was 90%; the states built, owned and maintained the highways. Clay stated: It was evident we needed better highways. We <b>needed</b> <b>them</b> for safety, to accommodate more automobiles. We <b>needed</b> <b>them</b> for defense purposes, if that should ever be necessary. And we <b>needed</b> <b>them</b> for the economy. Not just as a public works measure, but for future growth.|$|R

Solomon claimed in later court papers that at this time, his wife's psychological problems began to manifest themselves, causing him to begin eating outside and sleeping on the floor to comply with her obsession with keeping the condominium clean. The board cited the couple several times for violating noise regulations; at one point they awoke their neighbors with vacuuming after 11 p.m. She, in turn, alleged he became controlling and angry.|$|E
25|$|Almost half of {{the props}} used in October 1 were made by Pat Nebo, the art {{director}} and his team. Props were also brought from United States and the United Kingdom, including television sets and shotguns from the fifties as they were not available in Nigeria. After writing several letters to the Nigerian Police Department to request for antique weapons and costumes, it was realized that the department didn't archive its artefacts, so most historical items have been destroyed. There were no Toyota vehicles in Nigeria in the sixties; this {{made it impossible for}} Toyota Nigeria to provide props for the film. Some of the antique vehicles used in the film were sourced in Nigeria; most were however refurbished for the owners {{so that they can be}} used in the film. The props used in the film are currently kept in Golden Effects Studios and can be rented out to other filmmakers that may <b>need</b> <b>them</b> in future. There was also an exhibition at the premiere of the film displaying the antique items used in October 1.|$|E
25|$|DN3: (Defense against natural disasters). The Army {{should always}} be ready to help the civil {{population}} in case of disaster. This includes preventive measures. For example, between August and November, military forces are sent to Mexican coastal areas to aid {{the public in the}} event of hurricanes or floods. For the Mexican people, the DN3 plan is the most important peacetime operation of the Army. The Army provides food, shelter, medicine, and medical services to the people who <b>need</b> <b>them.</b> This also includes reconstruction of roads and communication services. Because calling the implementation DN3 plan is an acceptance of severe problems, the DN3 plan was not invoked in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that left large areas of Mexico City in ruins, since the authorities did not want to recognize there was an emergency in the capital, while the army was called to the city, it was just a peacekeeping force. This later became a severe questioning on the government. The Mexican Army provided aid to the US following Hurricane Katrina. More recently, the DN3 plan was invoked in 2009 when an epidemic of swine flu threatened the population and in 2010 after the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, Nuevo León, Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guerrero were severely affected by floods caused by a number of hurricanes and tropical storms.|$|E
