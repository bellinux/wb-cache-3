It was shown that the probability of failure and time to fracture for a specimen loaded in direct tension are influenced by corrosion pattern, the stressing assembly stiffness, and the <b>notch</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of the alloy.

Intercritical treatments were performed on samples with composition A by 1) austenitizing at 860 °C for 1 hour cooling in air, then treating at 770 °C for 30 minutes before oil quenching; 2) austenitizing at 860 °C for 1 hour quenching in oil, then treating at 770 °C for 30 minutes before quenching in oil; and 3) austenitizing at 860 °C for 1 hour, super-cooling to 770 °C and then quenching in oil. Samples of composition B were subjected to intercritical treatment at temperatures of 740, 760, and 780 °C for 30 minutes, followed by quenching rapidly in oil.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Although {{adhesive}} bonding of fabricated composite structures {{would be the}} preferred option from a design for manufacture point of view, {{there will always be}} a need to use mechanical fastening for highly loaded regions. Fatigue behaviour and notch sensitivity are two of the main concerns for fabricated composite structures, despite the excellent performance of the material in the former regard. For 3 D woven composites previous research has concentrated on the un-notched fatigue behaviour with less research focused on the notched properties. In the present work, the quasi-static and tension-tension fatigue behaviour of notched orthogonal and angle-interlock 3 D woven carbon/epoxy composites are investigated. Digital image correlation was used to obtain the full-field strain distribution during the quasi-static tensile tests, and thermo-elastic stress analysis was used to characterise the damage progression during the fatigue tests. The DIC results revealed that the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of the 3 D woven composites was not sensitive to notch size, with the <b>notched</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> being less than 17 % lower than the un-notched <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> Limitations of the test machine capacity meant that the fatigue specimens were loaded at 60 % of the ultimate failure stress.

A comprehensive world-wide database compilation, in the past 50 years, has shown that the HEE index is mostly collected at two conveniently high H pressure points of 5 ksi and 10 ksi near room temperature. Since H embrittlement is directly related to pressure, the lack of HEE index at other pressure points has posed a technical problem for the designers to select appropriate materials at a specific H pressure for various applications in aerospace, alternate and renewable energy sectors for an emerging hydrogen economy.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that most aluminum alloys contain high-density micro pores, which make an appreciable contribution to damage evolution during ductile fracture. It is reasonable to assume that the mechanical properties of aluminum alloys are more or less improved by controlling micro pores in aluminum alloys.

Tensile tests are performed using smooth and notched specimens at room and elevated temperatures, together with a fracture toughness test. It has been shown that both strength and ductility increase with decreasing micro pore volume fraction.

Measure-ments of debond energy and sliding stress are made using {{a modified version of the}} established fiber push-in test. Modifica-tions include the following: (i) use of a sphero-conical indenter (not a sharp-tipped one) to produce only elastic deformation of the fibers, and (ii) analysis of the loop width (instead of absolute displacements) to ascertain interface properties. The method obviates the need for indentation tests on reference (non-sliding) fibers. It also mitigates the problems associated with the elastic deformation of the surrounding matrix. The measured debond toughnesses (about 0. 05 J/m 2) are about two orders of magni-tude lower than the fiber toughness. This ensures that debonding will occur when a matrix crack impinges on a fiber. Addition-ally, the sliding stresses are in the same range as those reported for C-coated Nicalon fibers in glass–ceramic matrices (about 5 MPa).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination revealed different morphologies such as dispersed, cocontinuous and phase inverted depending on the composition, indicating that the binary blends are immiscible and forms a two-phase structure. Tensile properties decreased with increase in the ABS content while the impact strength reached an optimum at ca. 70 % ABS. Influence of a triblock copolymer based on styrene and butadiene (SBS) on morphology, mechanical measurements and failure topography was used as criteria of the compatibilization effect. The compatiblizing action of SBS was evidenced by the sharp decrease in domain size of the dispersed phase followed by an increase at higher concentrations. The conformation of the compatibilizer at the interface was further analyzed based on the area occupied by the compatibilizer at the blend interface. The results were in agreement with the theoretical predictions of Noolandi and Hong. The extent of interface adhesion in these blends was analyzed by examination of the fracture-surface morphology.

Four different fiber architectures were considered; braid angle, yarn and braider size, percentage of longitudinal yarns and braider angle varied.

The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> testing was done on Castlegate sandstone, Mancos shale and Mons chalk. For Castlegate sandstone and Mons chalk two different specimen sizes, 1. 5 inches and 2 inches in diameter, were used to study the size effect on the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> results. Both rock types showed a clear size effect, but as the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of Castlegate sandstone decreased for increasing specimen size, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of Mons chalk increased with increasing specimen size. Mancos shale specimens were tested with different inclination angles relative to the bedding plane to study the anisotropy effect. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> for shale varied greatly with the inclination angle and the largest <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> were seen for samples with a 45 ° inclination angle relative to the bedding. Resulting <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> for all rock types was compared to existing <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> calculated from the Brazilian <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> method. The comparison showed that the direct <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> test yields lower, and more correct, values than the Brazilian <b>strength</b> test. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> were also compared to known correlations between the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and fracture toughness. Some of the correlations showed a better match than the others...|$|R

40|$|Blends of nylon- 6 with {{polybutadiene}} {{were prepared}} with comparable morphology and different molecular weights of the matrix. These specimens were tested using the notched Izod impact {{test and the}} <b>notched</b> <b>tensile</b> impact test. An increase in molecular weight resulted in a shift of the brittle-to-tough transition temperature of 40 °C to lower temperatures. In the <b>notched</b> <b>tensile</b> impact tests, especially in the high-speed region, pronounced differences between blends with different molecular weights of the matrix were observed...|$|R
