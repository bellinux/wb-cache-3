Metal contamination on GaN surface can be reduced by the solutions with low pH and high redox potential. The start redox potential of the metal oxidation on GaN surface is larger than that of metal itself. Because <b>metal</b> can <b>receive</b> <b>electrons</b> from GaN surface, and then metal cannot be oxidized to ionization by solutions. The metal contamination on GaN can be reduced by the solutions with the pH less than 4. 2 and the redox potential larger than 0. 8 V are required.

Among the several <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have attracted special attention due to their distinct properties, which include favorable electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and catalytic and antibacterial activity [12]. Silver at the nanoscale also has different properties from bulk silver. Synthesis of AgNPs is an emerging area and is much sought after [16]. The green synthesis of AgNPs has been accomplished using plants, microorganisms, and other biopolymers [12]. Wet chemical synthesis can be robustly scaled for the large-scale synthesis of AgNPs of tunable shape and size through optimization of synthesis conditions. However, wet chemical methods use toxic chemicals, which are hazardous for the environment and usually result in the adsorption of toxic chemicals on to the surface of synthesized AgNPs, making them unsuitable for biomedical applications. In contrast, physical methods are expensive and cumbersome for the large-scale production of nanoparticles. Therefore, the development of environmentally conscious, energy-efficient, facile, and rapid green synthesis methods that avoid toxic and hazardous chemicals has attracted significant interest [17]. In addition, due to their potent antimicrobial activity, AgNPs have also been used in clothing [18], foods [19], sunscreens, and cosmetics [20, 21].|$|R

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility, DWPF, has {{requested}} that the Savannah River National Laboratory, SRNL, investigate the {{factors that contribute to}} hydrogen generation to determine if current conservatism in setting the DWPF processing window can be reduced. A phased program has been undertaken to increase understanding of the factors that influence hydrogen generation in the DWPF Chemical Process Cell, CPC. The hydrogen generation in the CPC is primarily due to <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> catalyzed decomposition of formic acid with a minor contribution from radiolytic processes. <b>Noble</b> <b>metals</b> have historically been added as trim chemicals to process simulations. The present study investigated the potential conservatism that might be present from adding the catalytic species as trim chemicals to the final sludge simulant versus co-precipitating the <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> into the insoluble sludge solids matrix. Two sludge simulants were obtained, one with co-precipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> and one without <b>noble</b> <b>metals.</b> Co-precipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> were expected to better match real waste behavior than using trimmed <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> during CPC simulations. Portions of both sludge simulants were held at 97 C for about eight hours to qualitatively simulate the effects of long term storage on particle morphology and speciation. The two original and two heat-treated sludge simulants were then used as feeds to Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank, SRAT, process simulations. Testing was done at relatively high acid stoichiometries, {approx} 175 %, and without mercury in order to ensure significant hydrogen generation. Hydrogen generation rates were monitored during processing {{to assess the impact of}} the form of <b>noble</b> <b>metals.</b> The following observations were made on the data: (1) Co-precipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> simulant processed similarly to trimmed <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> simulant in most respects, such as nitrite to nitrate conversion, formate destruction, and pH, but differently with respect to hydrogen generation: (A) The peak hydrogen generation rate occurred three to five hours later for the regular and heat-treated co-precipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> slurries than for the slurries with trimmed <b>noble</b> <b>metals.</b> (B) The peak hydrogen generation rate was lower during processing of the co-precipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> simulant relative to the trimmed <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> simulant data. (C) Trimmed <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> appeared to be conservative relative to co-precipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> under the conditions of these tests as long as the peak hydrogen generation rate occurred early in the SRAT boiling period. (2) If the peak hydrogen generation rate with trimmed <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> is near or above the DWPF limit, and if the peak occurs late in the SRAT cycle, then a potential SME cycle hydrogen generation rate issue could be anticipated when using co-precipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metals,</b> since the peak is expected to be delayed relative to trimmed <b>noble</b> <b>metals.</b> (3) The peak hydrogen generation rate increased from about 1. 3 to about 3. 7 lbs H{sub 2 }/hr on the range of 170 - 190 % stoichiometry, or about 0. 1 lbs. H{sub 2 }/hr per % change in the stoichiometric factor at DWPF scale. (4) The peak generation rate was slightly higher during processing of the heat-treated coprecipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> simulant relative to the trimmed <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> heat-treated simulant, but this probably due to somewhat more excess acid being added to the co-precipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> test than intended. (5) The variations in the peak hydrogen generation rate appeared to track the quantity of dissolved rhodium in the SRAT product. (6) A <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> apparently activated and then de-activated during the final hour of formic acid addition. The associated peak generation rate was < 3 % of the maximum rate seen in each test. Palladium may have been responsible based on literature data. (7) Planned comparisons between heat-treated and un-heat-treated simulants were complicated by the significantly altered base equivalents following heat-treatment. This necessitated making small adjustments to the stoichiometric acid factor to attempt to match the excess acid contents of the various cases. The overall conclusion for the work completed to date is that co-precipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> were more difficult to activate, and were probably less active then trimmed <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> under the conditions tested. The use of heat-treatment to simulate aging did not change the ease of activation of the <b>noble</b> <b>metals.</b> The relative ranking of the heat-treated trimmed and co-precipitated <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> simulants was ambiguous with respect to peak hydrogen generation rate...|$|R

There have been many attempts to improve the activity of these metals through creating nanostructures, as well as post-synthesis treatments based on chemical, electrochemical, sonochemical and thermal approaches. In many instances these methods result in a material with active surface states, which can be considered to be adatoms or clusters of atoms on the surface that have a low lattice co-ordination number making them more prone to electrochemical oxidation at a wide range of potentials that are significantly less positive than those of their bulk metal counterparts. This phenomenon has been termed premonolayer oxidation and has been reported to occur on a range of metallic surfaces. In this work we present findings on the presence of active sites on Pd that has been: evaporated as a thin film; electrodeposited as nanostructures; as well as commercially available Pd nanoparticles supported on carbon.

Herein, we report our study on the effects of diffusion rate and reaction kinetics on the morphology of a number of <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> (Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt) nanoparticles. A glass reactor based on electrochemical reduction or photo-reduction has been designed to achieve control of diffusion and chemical reduction of the different <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> precursors. The results show that the <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> nanoparticles with flower-like, core-shell, or wheel-like morphologies could be obtained at a relatively high diffusion rate due to the presence of additional growth of metal precursors on the preformed metal nuclei, while at relatively low diffusion, the as-prepared <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> nanoparticles are small and quasi-spherical due to the relatively fast reduction of metal precursors. The experimental observations are also confirmed qualitatively by kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Since diffusion and reaction kinetics are universal and key factors in the synthesis of nanomaterials, the findings in this work might provide an effective way to manipulate the morphology of nanomaterials for a given application.

40|$|The {{performances}} of two very active catalysts for VOC removal (one metal oxide and one <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> catalyst, namely gamma-MnO 2 and Pt/TiO 2) are compared. The comparison {{takes into account}} not only the activity but also the sensitivity to competition effects between compounds, the influence of water vapor and the stability. The metal oxide catalyst proves to be more active than the supported <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> one. Moreover, its performance is less affected by interferences between VOC's {{than those of the}} <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> catalyst. Conversely, the activity of the <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> appears slightly more stable. Both are affected by water vapor which slightly decreases their efficiency. On the metal oxide catalyst, water shortens the time needed to get a stable catalytic activity. (C) 1998 Academic Press...|$|R

40|$|During the pyroprocessing of spent {{nuclear fuel}} by {{electrochemical}} techniques, fission products are separated as the fuel is oxidized at the anode and refined uranium is deposited at the cathode. Those fission products that are oxidized into the molten salt electrolyte are considered active metals while {{those that do not}} react are considered <b>noble</b> <b>metals.</b> The primary <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> encountered during pyroprocessing are molybdenum, zirconium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and technetium. Pyroprocessing of spent fuel to date has involved two distinctly different electrorefiner designs, in particular the anode to cathode configuration. For one electrorefiner, the anode and cathode collector are horizontally displaced such that uranium is transported across the electrolyte medium. As expected, the <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> removal from the uranium during refining is very high, typically in excess of 99 %. For the other electrorefiner, the anode and cathode collector are vertically collocated to maximize uranium throughput. This arrangement results in significantly less <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> removal from the uranium during refining, typically no better than 20 %. In addition to electrorefiner design, operating parameters can also influence the retention of <b>noble</b> <b>metals,</b> albeit at the cost of uranium recovery. Experiments performed to date have shown that as much as 100 % of the <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> can be retained by the cladding hulls while affecting the uranium recovery by only 6 %. However, it is likely that commercial pyroprocessing of spent fuel will require the uranium recovery to be much closer to 100 %. The above mentioned design and operational issues will likely be driven by the effects of <b>noble</b> <b>metal</b> contamination on fuel fabrication and performance. These effects will be presented in terms of thermal properties (expansion, conductivity, and fusion) and radioactivity considerations. Ultimately, the incorporation of minor amounts of <b>noble</b> <b>metals</b> from pyroprocessing into fast reactor metallic fuel will be shown to be of no consequence to reactor performance...|$|R
