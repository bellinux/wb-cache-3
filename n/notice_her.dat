5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual fantasies of a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not <b>notice</b> <b>her,</b> she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to the rhythm of the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and lingerie walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E

Although she got a kiss from Ringo, whom she called ‘Ritchie’ (for Richard), he did not immediately <b>notice</b> <b>her</b> among his numerous fans. All the Beatles were supposed to be officially unattached, for image purposes, and when Ringo started dating Cox, she was often threatened, and once scratched in the face by a vicious rival. She even had to stop working as a hairdresser because of the threats. In September 1963, with her parents' permission, she travelled to Greece with Starr, McCartney, and Jane Asher.|$|E

Novakovic has said that she would like to see Natasha grow up, become nicer and turn over a new leaf. She expressed her desire to portray Natasha's softer and funnier side during an interview with Digital Spy.|$|E
500|$|During the [...] and [...] seasons, Sidle {{seems to}} be on a {{downward}} spiral as her memories of childhood resurface, with cases becoming more difficult for her emotionally. Also, the fact that Grissom decided to promote Nick Stokes instead of Sidle, did not help. Season Four concludes with Sidle being stopped by a traffic cop. Although she is driving under the influence, she is not charged, but Grissom, as her supervisor, is informed of her arrest. He arrives at the station to bring her home, and finally seems to <b>notice</b> <b>her</b> emotional state. Later, in , she loses her temper with a domestic abuse suspect and then argues with supervisors Catherine Willows and Conrad Ecklie, which results in her suspension. Following this incident, she admits to Grissom that she has a problem with authority, has chosen emotionally unavailable men (like Grissom), and has a self-destructive streak. Sidle then opens up to him and reveals her family story; it is during this season that she apparently starts bonding with Grissom. During the subsequent seasons ( [...] and [...] ), after it is revealed that they are in a relationship, she appears to be happier and on a more even keel.|$|E

Though Clark and Bart Allen do not <b>notice</b> <b>her,</b> she watches them race over the coast of Cameroon. Lana returns in a parallel storyarc Valkyrie, in which she uses the superhero alias [...] "Angel of the Plateau" [...] and battles terrorists in Africa. Lana also saves Lois from one of their attacks. Lana reveals {{that she has been}} using her abilities to help and protect children from people who would exploit them after Lana had settled in Africa. However, Lois tries not to reveal her relationship with Clark to Lana. Elsewhere, the terrorists seek John Corben's aid in defeating Angel of the Plateau. Corben's new kryptonite heart (installed by Winslow Schott) has absorbed the nanites embedded in Lana's skin, rendering her powerless and no longer emitting the kryptonite radiation once more. After Lois helps Lana defeat Corben, Lana reveals that she had seen Lois's engagement ring, thus she already knows about Clark's relationship with Lois. Lana gives her blessing to Lois, and decides to remain in Africa as the Angel.|$|E

500|$|... "Falling Over Me" [...] was co-written by Lovato and Jon McLaughlin and {{produced}} by Fields. The song features a [...] "hypnotic" [...] bassline and lyrics about Lovato praying that her crush will <b>notice</b> <b>her</b> affection: [...] "I'm hoping, I'm waiting, I'm praying {{you are the}} one". According to Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times, Lovato's vocals in the song balance [...] "delicacy and force". On the fifth track, [...] "Quiet", Lovato longs for a [...] "communication breakthrough" [...] in an awkward relationship, complaining that [...] "It's too quiet in here". [...] "Catch Me" [...] is an acoustic ballad with a stripped-down production, written by Lovato herself. The song speaks of an unhealthy love connection, with Lovato going on even though she knows [...] "how badly this will hurt me". The seventh track, [...] "Every Time You Lie", is a song with jazz influences and a [...] "jaunty '70s vibe". Kerri Mason of Billboard commented that the song [...] "swings like Maroon 5's brand of radio soul". The song tells about self-respect and not putting up with lies in a relationship. [...] "Got Dynamite" [...] was written by Gary Clark, E. Kidd Bogart and Victoria Horn {{and produced}} by Clark. The song features [...] "ricocheting" [...] synthesizers and a scattering pop punk riff. The lyrics use [...] "violent metaphors" [...] as invitations for a boy to [...] "blow up" [...] Lovato's defenses, with lines such as [...] "Log {{in and try to}} hack me" [...] and [...] "Kick senseless, my defenses".|$|E
2500|$|Gloria Foster {{began her}} career on Broadway {{as she moved}} to New York in 1963. [...] Her first role was Ruth in the show of A Raisin in the Sun. [...] She started an acting career as her agent, Ernestine McClendon, sent her on an {{audition}} for In White America. [...] The play was {{about the history of}} blacks in the United States and the oppression they had to face. [...] Gloria Foster, [...] "play a 13-year-old Arkansas girl who tries to enter her Little Rock school". This was her first distinction and had to play 27 different characters. [...] This led to her winning an Obie Award or Off-Broadway Theater Award, which is an, [...] "annual award bested by The Village Voice newspaper to theater artists and groups in New York City". She also received a two-page article in Life Magazine, explaining about the wonderful performance and critics said she was up and coming and people should look out for the next pieces she performs in. She performed many other plays in New York and on Broadway and the public started to <b>notice</b> <b>her,</b> as she became a bigger star. [...] Not only did the public start to <b>notice</b> <b>her,</b> but also critics began analyzing her performances. [...] They wrote that she performed her roles as a, [...] "majestic, full-voiced, statuesque and stunning actress". [...] The passion she had for acting was reflected in her performances and an unusual thing happened for her, [...] "an African-American actress around whom producers and directors built production". [...] Instead of Gloria Foster having to audition for roles, people started to make parts for her to be in. [...] It was her spirit, excitement, and stamina for acting that gave her success in such a hard business. [...] She was a breakthrough artist who, [...] "played roles previously inaccessible to Blacks".|$|E
2500|$|In 1861, Suslova {{attended}} the classes taught by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, already a renowned writer, whose lectures were very popular among young people. At that time, Dostoyevsky was 40, {{and she was}} 21. Daughter Lyubov Dostoyevskaya (who was born several years later, well after the affair {{had come to an}} end) opined that Suslova [...] "spun around Dostoevsky and tried to please him in every way, but Dostoevsky did not <b>notice</b> <b>her.</b> Then she wrote him a love letter". Another version is that Suslova brought her writings to Dostoyevsky and asked for advice. Her story was bad, but Dostoyevsky was attracted to a beautiful young girl and promised to teach her writing. Yet another explanation is that Dostoyevsky had read Suslova's story, liked it and wanted to meet the author.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{political}} analysts <b>notice</b> <b>her</b> strong position {{because of the}} absence of a primary in her party (consolidating her leadership), of the news such as the migrants crisis or the terrorist attacks in France (reinforcing her political positions) and of the very right-wing campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy in the Republican primary (enlarging her themes). In a 2016 interview with the BBC, Le Pen stated that Donald Trump's presidential victory would, in fact, help her in the 2016–2017 presidential race. In her opinion, Mr. Trump has [...] "made possible what had previously been presented as impossible". However, she stated she would not officially launch her campaign before February 2017, waiting for the results of the Republican and Socialist primaries, and preferred to remain silent in the media and usher thematic think tanks dedicated to the elaboration of her program. In consequence, her rare media appearances attract consistent audiences (2.3million viewers for Vie politique on TF1 on 11 September 2016 and 4 million for Une ambition intime on M6 on 16 October).|$|E
2500|$|Garner rose to fame in 2001 {{when she}} was cast as {{the star of the}} ABC spy drama Alias. The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: [...] "I always thought she had {{something}} in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that." [...] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role. Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: [...] "You've probably never noticed her. You'll <b>notice</b> <b>her</b> now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross." [...] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought [...] "an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness" [...] to the role. Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end. During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.|$|E
2500|$|Lonestar has charted {{more than}} 20 singles on the Hot Country Songs chart, {{including}} 9 that reached No.1: [...] "No News", [...] "Come Cryin' to Me", [...] "Amazed", [...] "Smile", [...] "What About Now", [...] "Tell Her", [...] "I'm Already There", [...] "My Front Porch Looking In", and [...] "Mr. Mom". [...] "Amazed" [...] also charted at No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100, {{becoming the first}} country song to do so since [...] "Islands in the Stream" [...] in 1983. [...] "Amazed" [...] and [...] "My Front Porch Looking In" [...] were the top country songs of 1999 and 2003, respectively, on Billboard Year-End. The group has recorded seven albums, one EP, and a greatest hits package for the defunct BNA Records, and one album each for three different independent labels. Three of their albums have been certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band's first two albums were defined by honky-tonk and neotraditionalist country influences, but subseuqent albums largely drew from country pop. Along with his work with the band, McDonald has co-written singles for Clay Walker, The Wilkinsons, Billy Dean, and Sara Evans, in addition to singing guest vocals on Mindy McCready's 1996 single [...] "Maybe He'll <b>Notice</b> <b>Her</b> Now" [...] and recording two solo albums during his hiatus from the band.|$|E

2500|$|A framing device {{portrays the}} events of the play as newscasts and {{newspaper}} headlines. The film's action sequences were reminiscent of the films of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo, and its characters wear designer clothes and (in Douglas Brode's words) [...] "a lingerie collection worthy of Madonna". As Peter Travers commented in Rolling Stone, the intention was to [...] "make Romeo and Juliet accessible to the elusive Gen-X audience without leaving the play bowdlerised and broken". Some aspects of the modernisation have been praised as effective (a newscaster speaking the prologue, for example, or the replacement of Friar John with a courier message which gets misdelivered); others have been criticised as ridiculous: including a police chief banishing Romeo for a street killing rather than ordering his arrest. Luhrmann highlighted the religious aspects of the play, surrounding his two central characters with religious icons, and staging his finale in a cathedral. That final scene was regarded by some critics as Luhrmann's masterstroke: adapting a device first used in restoration adaptations of the play, Juliet begins to wake before Romeo takes the poison, but he does not <b>notice</b> <b>her</b> movements until he has done so, then he dies aware that she has survived. The scene uses cuts and extreme close-ups to generate a tension impossible to achieve in the theatre. The mood is undermined a moment later as Juliet blows her brains out with a pistol. The role of the watch is cut completely, permitting Friar Laurence to be with Juliet and to be taken by surprise by her sudden suicide.|$|E
2500|$|Lonestar's first {{release for}} BNA was an {{extended}} play titled Lonestar Live, recorded at the Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville and issued in January 1995. Their debut single, [...] "Tequila Talkin'", was released that August, peaking at No.8 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. It was included on their self-titled debut album, which was released that October. Its producers were Don Cook (best {{known for his}} work with Brooks & Dunn) and songwriter Wally Wilson, with whom Rich wrote the track [...] "I Love the Way You Do That". Other contributing songwriters included former solo artists Bill LaBounty, Rick Vincent, and Larry Boone. The next single, [...] "No News", became the band's first No.1, holding that position for three weeks in April 1996. A physical single release of [...] "Tequila Talkin'" [...] and [...] "No News" [...] as a double A-side also went to No.22 on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. After these two songs, [...] "Runnin' Away with My Heart" [...] also went to No.8 on the country charts. It was followed by [...] "When Cowboys Didn't Dance" [...] (co-written by McDonald), which failed to reach top 40, and [...] "Heartbroke Every Day", the only single to feature Rich on lead vocals, at No.18. Both of these songs had previously appeared on the Lonestar Live EP. Their chart runs both overlapped with then-labelmate Mindy McCready's [...] "Maybe He'll <b>Notice</b> <b>Her</b> Now" [...] (from her debut album Ten Thousand Angels), which featured McDonald as a backing vocalist and peaked at No.18 as well.|$|E
2500|$|Anița Nandriș-Cudla's book, 20 Years in Siberia [...] is the own life's account {{written by}} a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cernăuți) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system {{together}} with her three sons. [...] Together {{with her husband and}} her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet [...] Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior <b>notice.</b> <b>Her</b> mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after {{the fact that she was}} a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities. [...] It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame [...] typhus, scorbutus, malnutrition, extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with 3 years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982. Her manuscript was first published in 1991. Her deportation was shared mainly with Romanians from Bucovina and Basarabia, Finnish and Polish prisoners, as token proof to show that Gulag labour camps had also been used for the shattering/ extermination of the natives in the newly occupied territories of the Soviet Union.|$|E
