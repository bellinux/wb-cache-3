Hopefully, they have managed to reach the plant host by this time. The bacteria then differentiate specialized nitrogen-fixing cells called heterocysts and enter into a working symbiosis with the plant.|$|E

5000|$|Round-leaf cassia can be {{used for}} open grazing, but also for hay and silage using its high dry matter content which {{contains}} the necessary nutrients for livestock (i.e. protein, fibre, energy, vitamins).

A fungus disease has reduced L. arboreus populations by up to. 95 %. Six spaced-plant trials at widely-separated locations {{on the west coast}} of the North Island identified 18 introduced species which are able to grow and fix nitrogen in the sand dune environment. Trials were conducted in the area immediately behind the foredune which is partially stabilised by sand-binding grasses. In this zone plant growth is limited by nitrogen supply. Unless the activity of browsing animals on sand dunes can be controlled, only unpalatable species or those combining high tissue regeneration capacity with absence of weed potential are likely to be effective and acceptable substitutes for L. arboreus.

40|$|Frankia strains are nitrogen-fixing soil actinobacteria {{that can}} form root symbioses with acti-norhizal plants.

40|$|Symbiotic {{association}} of legumes with rhizobia frequently results in higher photosynthesis and soluble carbohydrates {{in comparison with}} nitrate-fed plants, which might improve its potential for biomass conversion into bioethanol. A greenhouse experiment was conducted {{to examine the effects}} of nitrogen source and water availability on stem characteristics and on relationships between carbohydrates, phenolic metabolism activity and cell wall composition in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. cv. Aragón). The experiment included three treatments: (1) plants fed with ammonium nitrate (AN); (2) plants inoculated with rhizobia (R); and (3) plants inoculated with rhizobia and amended with sewage sludge (RS). Two levels of irrigation were imposed: (1) well-watered and (2) drought stress. Under well-watered conditions, <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>plants</b> have increased photosynthesis and stem fermentable carbohydrate concentrations, which result in higher potential for biomass conversion to bioethanol than in AN plants. The latter had higher lignin due to enhanced activities of phenolic metabolism-related enzymes.

Intercropping with alfalfa had a negative effect on wood density and shrinkage, but increasing initial spacing had a positive effect on them.

Wood density and shrinkage in radial axis and at breast height level decreased from pith to bark; by 25 % and 50 % of tree this pattern was inverted for wood density.

Adenitrifying bacterium, Azoarcus sp. strain KH 32 C, was origi-nally isolated from soil of an agricultural field where paddy rice and soybean crops were rotationally cultivated every 2 years (10). KH 32 C can strongly reduce exogenousN 2 O, indicating the potential use of this bacterium to decrease N 2 O emissions from agricultural fields.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on microbial degradation of aromatic and other refractory compounds in anoxic waters and soils {{has revealed that}} nitrate-reducing bacteria belonging to the Betaproteobacteria contribute substantially to this process. Here we present the first complete genome of a metabolically versatile representative, strain EbN 1, which metabolizes various aromatic compounds, including hydrocarbons. A circular chromosome (4. 3 Mb) and two plasmids (0. 21 and 0. 22 Mb) encode 4603 predicted proteins. Ten anaerobic and four aerobic aromatic degradation pathways were recognized, with the encoding genes mostly forming clusters. The presence of paralogous gene clusters (e. g., for anaerobic phenylacetate oxidation), high sequence similarities to orthologs from other strains (e. g., for anaerobic phenol metabolism) and frequent mobile genetic elements (e. g., more than 200 genes for transposases) suggest high genome plasticity and extensive lateral gene transfer during metabolic evolution of strain EbN 1. Metabolic versatility is also reflected {{by the presence of}} multiple respiratory complexes. A large number of regulators, including more than 30 two-component and several FNR-type regulators, indicate a finely tuned regulatory network able to respond to the fluctuating availability of organic substrates and electron acceptors in the environment. The absence of genes required for nitrogen fixation and specific interaction with plants separates strain EbN 1 ecophysiologically from the closely related <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>plant</b> symbionts of the Azoarcus cluster.

Experimental factors included three levels of nitrogen (zero, 30 and 60 kg ha- 1) as main plots and linseed and berseem clover planting methods in 4 levels (pure culture of linseed, berseem clover monoculture, mixed cropping) (50 %: 50 %), intercropping row) 50 %: 50 %)) as sub-plots. Results showed that different levels of nitrogen {{had no effect on}} the main stem, seed weight and harvest index of both plants, but the number of lateral branches, number of capsules per plant (linseed), inflorescences number per plant (berseem clover), number of seeds per capsules (linseed), biological yield and grain yield were affected by nitrogen fertilizer. Among the methods of planting, pure cultures of linseed and berseem clover with 1604 and 830 kg ha- 1 had the highest yield, respectively. Significant difference between treatments was found in the land equivalent ratio, but the highest land equivalent ratio, was archived at 30 kg nitrogen fertilizer application (1. 35) and row intercropping treatment (1. 32), respectively.

40|$|The family Rhizobiaceae {{contains}} plant-associated bacteria with critical {{roles in}} ecology and agriculture. Within this family, many Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium strains are <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>plant</b> mutualists, while many strains designated as Agrobacterium are plant pathogens. These contrasting lifestyles are primarily {{dependent on the}} transmissible plasmids each strain harbors. Members of the Rhizobiaceae also have diverse genome architectures that include single chromosomes, multiple chromosomes, and plasmids of various sizes. Agrobacterium strains have been divided into three biovars, based on physiological and biochemical properties. The genome of a biovar I strain, A. tumefaciens C 58, has been previously sequenced. In this study, the genomes of the biovar II strain A. radiobacter K 84, a commercially available biological control strain that inhibits certain pathogenic agrobacteria, and the biovar III strain A. vitis S 4, a narrow-host-range strain that infects grapes and invokes a hypersensitive response on nonhost plants, were fully sequenced and annotated. Comparison with other sequenced members of the Alphaproteobacteria provides new data {{on the evolution of}} multipartite bacterial genomes. Primary chromosomes show extensive conservation of both gene content and order. In contrast, secondary chromosomes share smaller percentages of genes, and conserved gene order is restricted to short blocks. We propose that secondary chromosomes originated from an ancestral plasmid to which genes have been transferred from a progenitor primary chromosome. Similar patterns are observed in select Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria species.
