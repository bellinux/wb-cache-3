500|$|On May 12, 2012, Molly Rainford, a {{contestant}} of {{the sixth}} season of Britain's Got Talent, sang [...] "Ave Maria" [...] during the show's final. Digital Spy's Daniel Sperling noted that Rainford sang a [...] "pimped-up version" [...] of the song which he called [...] "incredible". A writer of BBC Online described her rendition as [...] "moving". On May 28, 2012, Fatai Veamatahau sang [...] "Ave Maria" [...] on The Voice (Australia). Simon Holt of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that [...] "she has a voice which brought tears to many eyes", including coach and mentor Seal's. Coach Joel Madden said: [...] "I have to be respectful. That was a very spiritual performance. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was like for people at home, but that felt electric in here". A reviewer for Take 40 Australia called it a [...] "rousing version". Veamatahau's version peaked at number 25 on the Australian Singles Chart for the week of June 10, 2012.|$|E
500|$|... 1602, Nick Lowe and Joe Quesada, {{approached}} Gaiman after Quesada became Marvel's Editor in Chief {{with the}} intent for Gaiman {{to work on a}} project for Marvel. Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because [...] "it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the surrender, the Japanese {{would remain}} {{in control of the}} camp until 11 September. During this period, there were no work parties and the prisoners did not suffer any beatings. [...] "It became {{apparent}} during the next few days that the Japanese soldiers knew something had happened but were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was", wrote Pepler. Extra food was provided by the Japanese shortly afterwards; the camp hospital was furnished with bed chairs and mosquito nets for the first time, and substantial amounts of medicine were issued.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think it's correct," [...] {{returned}} Millicent; [...] "but I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it's</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{ought to}} be in other respects. You see, its purpose is to show people what a water-ouzel is like and it's hard to make the creature out. Of course, I could have drawn it against a background that would have forced up every line, but that wouldn't have been right--these wild things were made to fade into their surroundings." [...] She laughed. [...] "Truth is rigid and uncompromising--it's difficult to make it subservient to expediency." ...|$|R
500|$|Ely died at his Oregon {{residence}} on April 28, 2015 {{at the age}} of 71, having long {{suffered from}} an unknown illness. [...] "Because of his religious beliefs, we're <b>not</b> even <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> [...] was," [...] his son Sean Ely said. He was a Christian Scientist and Sean Ely believed his father suffered from skin cancer.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps because speech {{seemed so}} inadequate, Dartrey said nothing. He sat {{looking at her}} with a queer emotion in his soft, studious eyes, {{drumming}} a little on the table with his finger tips, <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant that his heart was beating like a young man's and a queer sensation of happiness was stealing through his whole being.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} I did {{not think}} any such bond existed; indeed, I was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant. I had done my duty by him, neither less nor more, {{and there was nothing}} further to be said.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, John." [...] And then he {{carefully}} explained his discovery that an injured man was occupying the {{cabin in the}} berry patch, {{and seemed to be}} the object of the Hucks' tender care.|$|E
6000|$|... "Andre, my poor lad," [...] he murmured. [...] "I... I was fool {{enough to}} think you had no heart. You deceived me with your infernal pretence, and now I see... I see..." [...] He was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was that he saw, or else he hesitated to express it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Hardy," [...] he ordered, {{as he drew}} on his gloves, [...] "spend as {{much time}} as you like with that fellow and let me know what sort of {{questions}} he asks you. Be careful not {{to mention the fact that}} I am dining with Mr. Hebblethwaite. For the rest, fence with him. I am <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> all means. If by any chance he mentions a man named Selingman, let me know. Good night!" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{why does}} not Tom care {{to look at}} the prospect? Certainly not because he is afraid. He slept as soundly as ever last night; and knows not what fear means. But somehow, the glorious view reminds him of another glorious view, which he saw last summer walking by Grace Harvey's side from Tolchard's farm. And that subject he will sternly put away. He is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> but <b>what</b> <b>it</b> might unman even him.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you once}} {{know how to}} {{pronounce}} it it is the prettiest word that poetry ever produced!" [...] Then Lady Amaldina did pronounce her future name;--but nothing serviceable would be done for the reader if an attempt were made to write the sound which she produced. [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> but <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was the name which first won my heart. I can sign it now quite easily without a mistake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is {{that makes}} me anxious now," [...] replied Jack, [...] "but I know what made me anxious at first. It was your poor brother Daniel. That night he died, when he whispered in my ear, it was to make me promise to save you from drink and {{gambling}} if I could." ...|$|E
60|$|Danny, {{battered}} and heroic, still kept coming up. Kelly and others {{near to the}} ring began to cry out to the police to stop it, though Danny's corner refused to throw in the towel. Rivera saw the fat police captain starting awkwardly to climb through the ropes, and was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant. There were so many ways of cheating in this game of the Gringos. Danny, on his feet, tottered groggily and helplessly before him. The referee and the captain were both reaching for Rivera when he struck the last blow. There {{was no need to}} stop the fight, for Danny did not rise.|$|E
60|$|And {{how shall}} I finish the tale? Would it {{interest}} {{you to learn}} of the picnics in the hot, still woods that overhang the Monongahela, when those idiotic American buggies that can't turn round got stuck among the brambles and all but capsized; of boating in the blazing sun on the river that but a little time before had cast {{at the feet of}} the horrified village the corpses of the Johnstown tragedy? I saw one, only one, remnant of that terrible wreck. He had been a minister. House, church, congregation, wife, and children had been swept away from him in one night of terror. He had no employment; he could have employed himself at nothing; but God had been very good to him. He sat in the sun and smiled a little weakly. It was in his poor blurred mind that something had happened--he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was, but undoubtedly something had occurred. One could only pray that the light would never return.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} not about the real life [...] "Son of Sam", serial killer David Berkowitz. Smith explained, [...] "It's not about the serial killer. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> about because it's just sort of like telling someone a dream you had last night. There are some {{destructive}} figures in it, 'Son of Sam', Shiva... but Shiva's also associated with creativity... I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure...</b> it's just an impressionistic song about destruction and creativity, I guess, if it's about anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Dick went on, [...] "if the sentry {{gives the}} alarm, {{before we can}} secure him, we must give up part of our plan; for, in that case, we should have to bolt. Once over the wall, we should be all right. They may fire away at us as we run, {{but there is no}} fear of their hitting us, half asleep as they will be, and <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is all about. If we get a fair start of them, we need not have much fear of their {{catching}} us." ...|$|R
50|$|In September 1943, the B-29 was {{selected}} as the carrier for the Atomic Bomb. At first, the team responsible for the adaptation of the B-29 to the atomic bomb would only be provided with rough dimensions of the bomb, since even the scientists were <b>not</b> yet <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would look like. The technicians fitted a new H-frame hoist, carrier assembly and release unit to the B-29. The first drop tests using dummy bombs were carried out at Muroc AAF, California on 28 February 1944. These lead to the fitting of an entirely new suspension mechanism to the B-29.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, I am {{not sure}} that I don't like that sort of talk," [...] he declared. [...] "I know all about you, young man. You're in Dowling & Spence's office and you've got to quit. You've got an estate you want financing. Miss Beatrice Franklin was living under your roof--as your sister, I understand--until yesterday, and Mrs. Gardner, for some reason of her own, seems to be doing her best to add you to the list of her admirers. I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> all means but I could make a pretty good guess. Here's my point, though. You're right. I didn't bring you here for your health. I brought you here because you can do me a service and {{yourself}} one at the same time, and you'll be doing no one any harm, nobody you care about, anyway. I have no grudge against Miss Beatrice. I'd just as soon she kept out of the trouble that's coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why this tone of suspicion?" [...] remonstrated Heyst. [...] "I {{suppose the}} sight of this {{particular}} distress was disagreeable to me. What you call fun came afterwards, when {{it dawned on me}} that I was for him a walking, breathing, incarnate proof of the efficacy of prayer. I was a little fascinated by it--and then, could I have argued with him? You don't argue against such evidence, and besides it would have looked as if I had wanted to claim all the merit. Already his gratitude was simply frightful. Funny position, wasn't it? The boredom came later, when we lived together on board his ship. I had, in a moment of inadvertence, created for myself a tie. How to define it precisely I don't know. One gets attached in a way to people one has done something for. But is that friendship? I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. I only know that he who forms a tie is lost. The germ of corruption has entered into his soul." ...|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Tielen" [...] {{no longer}} has a meaning in modern-day Dutch (or Flemish) and it is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means. It could mean [...] "a moist swampy area covered with small plants", [...] "a river lock" [...] or even [...] "a row of houses next to a river" ...|$|E
50|$|Pearl Fulton: Bertha's new 'find'; an {{attractive}} blonde woman who Bertha is immediately drawn to. There is {{an air of}} uncertainty about Pearl, though Bertha is <b>not</b> entirely <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is that they share which unites them. She later realises it is a desire for Harry, and that Pearl is sharing in Bertha's Bliss. Bertha does not know Pearl very well, but {{falls in love with}} her nonetheless (as she always did fall in love with beautiful women who had something strange about them). The language describing social outburst is fitting for a middle-class family that is concerned about image and acceptable behavior.|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the novel, the main character, J. D. Alfred, is a young, immature college freshman, naive both socially and sexually. In the initial chapter, however, he encounters a "mysterious" dark-haired girl, older than himself and very experienced. Near the middle of the novel J. D. begins a quest, <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is he is looking for. As he moves from place to place, he discovers more and more about his family, his friends, the world around him, and the woman with whom he has become entangled, discoveries which he chooses to ignore until too late. He is left with only one choice to make, whether to die a fiery death, or live to deal with problems which he is not yet equipped to handle...|$|R
5000|$|This {{flag was}} {{designed}} by Captain Leonard Helm, who held Fort Sackville until forced to surrender to Lieutenant Governor Henry Hamilton. Although historians are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>it</b> looked like, most US flags {{were based on the}} “stripes of rebellion.” Helm’s design was clear enough that Hamilton recognized two on his approach to Vincennes, one on a boat and one on the fort. [...] One of these may have been Bosseron's flag, although Father Pierre Gibault may have brought a flag with him. [...] Captain Helm had earlier brought a United States flag to Ouiatenon, so it is possible that he also had brought one to Vincennes. When Hamilton took the fort, he allowed Helm to take down [...] "the continental flag" [...] before raising the British flag.|$|R
50|$|Kota is {{a medical}} school student who is doing badly for his examinations. He feels that {{something}} is missing in his life, but he is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is.

5000|$|... “I was on {{vacation}} in the summer, {{off the coast of}} Turkey and the beautiful water inspired Spring 2013,” explained Monique Lhuillier backstage. “ Day is all about these vibrant prints, digital prints that I’ve created from abstract fish… You’re <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, but you can see the scales. It just makes it edgier and more interesting. It’s all about the movement and fluidity of water… For evening, I wanted her to feel like she was mermaid-like, submerged in water, and that’s the whole feeling of the show!” ...|$|E
6000|$|Hazel Strong {{was looking}} from her darkened port across the dark sea. Suddenly a body shot past {{her eyes from}} the deck above. It dropped so quickly into the dark waters below that she could <b>not</b> be <b>sure</b> of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was--it might have been a man, she could not say. She listened for some outcry from above--for the always-fearsome call, [...] "Man overboard!" [...] but it did not come. All was silence on the ship above--all was silence in the sea below.|$|R
40|$|Viewer {{discretion}} is advised. I {{am going}} to offer you a perspective on the constitution which is stranger even than the Trudeau vision which twenty years ago sparked his epic battles with Merv Leitch and Peter Lougheed over the National Energy Policy, the Charter, and repatriation of the Constitution. And worse yet, though I worry about the Constitution, I do not know much about it; I do not often write about it, and as I will demonstrate in a moment, I am <b>not</b> even <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. I did, however, read something recently in a book on modern European history which seemed to capture my own sentiments almost exactly — an observation attributed to a peasant in Salonika, then under Turkish rule, in 1908 : “Constitution is such a wonderful thing,” said this peasant, “that he who does not know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, is a donkey. ” I identify with the donkey, not the peasant...|$|R
2500|$|Birkin said in 2004 that, [...] "It wasn't a rude song at all. I don't {{know what}} all the fuss was about. The English just didn't {{understand}} it. I'm still <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> they know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means." [...] When Gainsbourg went to Jamaica to record with Sly and Robbie, they initially did not get on well. They said [...] "We know just one piece of French music, a song called Je t'aime… Moi Non Plus, which has a girl groaning in it." [...] Gainsbourg said [...] "It's me", and their mood changed immediately.|$|R
5000|$|From 1936 on Wolff {{expressed}} {{himself in}} abstract painting: [...] "Spaces of magic light and vivid color, emptied of fixed points of reference, of self-enclosed objects and locally isolated things, color spaces containing only the heavy black lines of brush strokes that defined their limits; {{this was what}} emerged....with a kind of furious aimlessness. I was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was that was happening, but I knew that what ever {{it was it was}} vividly alive. This was the here and now of my life. I had taken the long, final step out of the shelter of art history and I found that I was quite alone."Wolff became a member of Abstract American Artists in 1937 and exhibited with the group.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{confused}} many {{viewers who}} were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant. [...] "It's obvious what Accident meant," [...] said Stanley Baker, who acted a {{lead role in}} the film. [...] "It meant what was shown on the screen." [...] Baker did concede of Joseph Losey's filmmaking that, [...] "One of Joe's problems is that he tends to wrap things up too much for himself. I think that 75% of the audience didn't realise that Accident was a flashback." [...] In his review upon the film's release, New York Times critic Bosley Crowther was unimpressed, calling the film [...] "a sad little story of a wistful don" [...] that was [...] "neither strong drama nor stinging satire". More recently, the film {{has been called a}} [...] "masterpiece" [...] by Boston Globe critic Peter Keogh.|$|E
50|$|Marina {{returns with}} John to the Himalayas {{when she sees}} what he's done with the cave she finally cries she reaches out to John before thanking him, she kisses him. He's <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means ruminating maybe nothing, maybe something. He shows Marina what he's been working {{for the past year}} it's a massive wooden table with a loralite stone in the middle {{reminiscent}} of the table in the Elder's chamber with the loric symbol of unity burned into the table and the pendants. John plans to use this as a meeting place for friends and allies away from the petty governments where they will gather to solve problems with a space at the table for loric/ garde/ humans/ allies. The only difference being there are no nine seats around the table saying he's done with numbers.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, Launch Radio Networks {{reported}} that Sully Erna has {{started working on}} his solo album. Although he wasn't exactly <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> shape <b>it</b> will take, Erna told Launch Radio Networks that [...] "I've been putting some thought into it," [...] he said. [...] "I actually have some stuff that I'm doing on the side right now. I don't know when I'm gonna kind of unleash something like that, and I don't know really <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> gonna be yet.

5000|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "okay" [...] 6.8 out of 10 and {{wrote in his}} verdict, [...] "I {{personally}} felt like the show {{had been on a}} bit of an upswing over the past few weeks, so I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> happened here. <b>It</b> wasn't all totally disposable, but there was a slight 'crash and burn' feel to it. The dialogue - from Dent, Selina, and Nygma (taking about video games for no reason, not even case related) - really stood out as being bad while Selina's message to Bruce about not being harsh enough for the streets fell flat since we'd just witnessed him beating another kid senseless last week." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 5.2 Magic Realism in The Lariat: It {{seems that}} the power of sorcery that Fray Luis has is an element of magic realism. The {{description}} of the rope on page 93 seems a lot like the magic realism in Garcia Marquezs One Hundred Years of Solitude. The Lariat does have a postcolonial element: the two conflicting cultures are colonizer and colonized. Im <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to call <b>it</b> in this story maybe religious perfection vs. humanness, or, a conflict between goodness and badness in the story. Seems that magical realism meshes the magical and the real at times. Magical Realism could explain the arrows bouncing off the bear in the story and other parts where the bear is in the story.|$|R
