40|$|Multifunctional {{cosmetics}} {{have become}} {{more common in the}} market. They perform more than their basic features. As more features are added to the products, the question is that: Is the more the better? It does not always be. The purpose of this research is to locate the consumer preference on multifunctional cosmetics. It accesses consumers’ evaluation on cosmetics products in two different perspectives, brand value and confidence level. In terms of brand value, consumers prefer cosmetics with more existing features or those have <b>new</b> <b>feature.</b> In terms of confidence level, consumers prefer cosmetics with fewer existing feature with detailed information on the <b>new</b> <b>feature.</b> The research help marketers better understand the preference of consumers on cosmetics and provide the insights for product management and development. When deciding how many features the product should have, people should understand the trade-off between brand value and confidence level, which is identified in the research. When considering whether to launch <b>new</b> <b>feature</b> to the existing products, people should understand that <b>new</b> <b>feature</b> contributes to the brand value but does not directly lead to purchase intention. If it is decided to promote a <b>new</b> product <b>feature,</b> detailed information of the <b>new</b> <b>feature</b> should be provided to increase the confidence level of the consumers...|$|R
