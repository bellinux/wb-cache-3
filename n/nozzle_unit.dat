40|$|Lecturepg. 37 During {{the past}} three decades, there have been notable {{advances}} {{in the design of}} pumps. In a number of projects, the designers of process plants had, during optimization of their layouts, established a requirement for pumps that outwits the standard ranges available from the majority of pump manufacturers. A considerable degree of technical expertise, backed by prototype development, is required if the benefits of high-speed operation are not to be offset by unreliability. The flow within a centrifugal impeller is qualitatively unlike that in all other turbomachinery. The flow is very mixed, with strong influence of the viscous shear at the walls.

40|$|Superior to {{supersonic}} jet experiments where rotational {{temperatures of}} 1 K are easily reached while vibrational temperatures of 10 K may persist, superfluid helium droplets incorporating a molecule cool all {{degrees of freedom}} of the dopant to the same temperature safe in the sub-Kelvin regime at 0. 37 K. Due to the dissipative medium, simplification of electronic spectra is achieved since only very few rotational levels remain occupied. Though, comparison with isolated molecules in supersonic jet expansions revealed significant deviations concerning electronic spectra of certain molecules. Phenomena such as line splitting, phonon wings (PWs) or dramatic line broadening clearly point to a not yet entirely understood involvement of guest-host interactions. In general, mechanisms that may cause line broadening in electronic spectra either depend on damping of nuclear rearrangement or disturbance of the electronic excitation process. Phthalocyanines and porphyrins are known to possess a rather rigid molecular backbone. Therefore, interaction of the molecule with the superfluid helium droplet can be assumed to be mainly mediated via differing substituent groups. Since a considerably large variety of substituted compounds is commercially available and the electronic excitation spectra fit well into the spectral range covered by the continuous wave dye laser {{used for this study}} several porphyrin and phthalocyanine derivatives substituted with different types and numbers of alkyl and aryl groups were chosen as molecular probes. This enables enquiring for a direct or indirect effect of low energy vibrational modes on line widths in electronic spectra of organic molecules doped into superfluid helium droplets. Recording fluorescence excitation and dispersed emission spectra revealed exclusively sharp transitions for all species. Together with an intensity peaking at the electronic origin, the spectra indicate that the molecular structure remains unchanged upon electronic excitation. Although, PWs dominating in their intensities over the zero phonon lines (ZPLs), even below any saturation limit, were observed when probing tetra-methyl-porphyrin (TMP) with a pulsed dye laser. This is an indication for a displacement of the equilibrium configuration of the solvation complex in S 0 and S 1. This means considerable rearrangement of the helium atoms surrounding the molecular dopant. But, considering experiments performed with the continuous wave dye laser, which provides a photon flux that is by about 5 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than for pulsed dye lasers, the ZPL was the dominating spectral feature of the electronic origin for all molecules within this study with the exception of TMP. The fluorescence excitation spectrum of the latter was found to consist of contributions from two species. This spectroscopic finding was also confirmed by an HPLC analysis of our TMP sample. The electronic origin of one compound within the TMP sample not only presented with a spectral shape that was never observed before in electronic spectra of organic molecules in superfluid helium droplets: a series of several sharp lines separated by about 0. 3 cm- 1 from each other was observed with increasing intensity from the first to the fourth and finally merging of the sharp lines into a broad unstructured band. It also exhibited a PW that was at least of comparable intensity to the ZPL even at the low photon flux provided by the continuous wave dye laser. Even though sharp lines have been observed in the electronic spectra for all molecules investigated for this study, a result that is generally expected considering the cold helium droplet environment, several molecules in recent studies exhibited significant line broadening in their electronic spectra when doped into superfluid helium droplets. At this, large amplitude motions were possible via e. g. methyl or phenyl groups for some species and therefore a correlation of line broadening and intramolecular nuclear rearrangement seemed to be a plausible explanation. Taking into account an even larger set of experimental data, a recent attempt to interpret those findings proposes that broadening is a result of intramolecular charge redistribution initiated by the electronic excitation. Precisely, a change of the molecule's electrostatic moments, primarily and most effectively, a change of the molecular dipole moment regarding both magnitude and orientation, was identified as the main contribution for line broadening effects. The ability of a molecule to allow for large amplitude motions is thus not mandatory for line broadening since rigid molecules like e. g. 3 -hydroxyavone or fluorazene exhibit broadened spectra as well. Furthermore, not all molecules with substituents that can undergo torsional motions or the like show line broadening in their electronic spectra, e. g. the molecules investigated for this study. For the latter, the existence of a molecular dipole moment is excluded due to an inversion center of the symmetrically substituted compounds. Therefore, experiments performed for this study support the model that line broadening in electronic spectra of organic molecules in superfluid helium droplets is caused by intramolecular charge redistribution following the electronic excitation. Hence, the solvation shell of helium atoms tightly adapted to the guest molecule needs to change its configuration in order to adapt to the new charge density distribution. This adaption procedure obviously manifests in broadened transitions since the potential energy curves of S 0 and S 1 are considerably shifted against each other. Apart from the sharp lines presented in their fluorescence excitation spectra, the phthalocyanine derivatives investigated for this study, namely chloro-aluminium-phthalocyanine (AlClPc) and tetra-tertbutyl-phthalocyanine (TTBPc), exhibited more than one emission spectrum. Replacing one helium atom of the molecule's solvation shell by another rare gas atom like e. g. argon, i. e. forming AlClPc-Ar 1 van der Waals clusters within the superfluid helium droplet, one aims to gain further insight into the dynamics of solvation structures next to the guest molecule. Recording dispersed emission spectra of those complexes revealed again more than one emission spectrum. Yet, vibronic transitions were not just split into two spectra but multiplets consisting of three and more signals and explained with a multiple level system representing different solvation configurations of the first helium layer around the dopant. Within the course of this study also a replacement of the formerly used flow-through cryostat of the continuous droplet machine by a closed-cycle cryostat unit was performed. This made an adjustment procedure of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>unit</b> to the droplet beam axis defined by the openings of the skimmer and the pick-up cell necessary. It revealed that the helium droplets can be reflected into the detection chamber via collision with the skimmer if the nozzle is not adjusted to the actual droplet beam axis. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} nozzles {{and their}} impact on droplet formation and droplet flight in a continuous ink jet printer. Methods are suggested to characterise droplet formation and droplet flight stability (D. F. S.). A study about the influence of droplet flight stability on the quality of print out is presented. A method to assess the charging process for the continuous ink jet is described. The development and characterisation of silicon nozzles, with single and multiple orifices, for continuous ink jet printers is presented. The continuous ink jet printer based on the Hertzâ principle produces images of photographic quality by electrostatic deflection of undesired droplets from a continuous flow of droplets. The droplets that form the print must all have the same size and equal inter droplet distances to assure high, reproducible print quality. To attain equally sized droplets at constant inter droplet distances the nozzle is mechanically stimulated at a frequency close to its natural droplet formation frequency. An optical measurement setup is suggested to assess information about the droplet flight stability. <b>Nozzle</b> <b>units</b> are characterised concerning how the choice of stimulation frequency and its amplitude influences droplet flight stability. It was found that the nozzles often had an individual behaviour regarding at which stimulation frequencies the nozzle had its highest droplet flight stability. Nozzles were after characterisation used in a printer to study how the measured droplet flight stability influenced the positioning of droplets on paper during print out. It was found that if the droplet flight stability was high (D. F. S. < 15 Â°) no misplaced droplets that would degrade print quality could be detected in the print. During printing is it essential that the stimulation signal and the charging pulses are correctly synchronised to either fully charge droplets or to leave them uncharged. The charging of droplets was measured while the phase angle between stimulation and charging was varied. This variation showed for which phase angles that the droplets are fully charged. A method is presented to assess the electrical properties of droplet formation. The nozzles used in continuous ink jet printers are traditionally made by glass. The assembling of nozzles introduces great variations in droplet flight stability for different stimulation frequencies. For a given stimulation frequency two glass nozzles might produce droplets at quite different droplet flight stabilities. A method to produce pyramid shaped, truncated silicon nozzles without the drawback of varying droplet flight stability is presented. The nozzles were manufactured during four consecutive etchings. The printing of one A 4 page with a continuous ink jet printer is time consuming, since the printer can print approximately 0. 5 pages per minute. To increase printing speed a silicon nozzle array with multiple nozzles per colour is developed and characterised. The nozzles were manufactured during three etchings. The silicon processing technique was improved to eliminate orifice size variation due to wafer thickness variation...|$|R

The platform relies heavily on readily available commercial parts and software to keep costs to an absolute minimum. Driven by a single DC servomotor with a forty percent underdrive belt driven gear reduction {{the goal is to}} achieve 10 Knots on no more than three amps of electricity. The 350 lb. vehicle uses a Jet Ski pump driveshaft and seal to maintain watertight integrity to depths of no more than 12 feet. Steering and control is achieved through a continuous software feedback loop between the <b>nozzle</b> control <b>unit</b> and the TCM- 2 50 digital compass. The vehicle can be remotely controlled via an onboard Windows 2000 network or through simple simulation programming. The submersible has the ability log all pertinent data to include: speed, depth, motor speed, heading, pitch, and roll. While on the surface this data can be viewed in near real-time or can be downloaded and viewed after the submerged run via the onboard network. Speed and distance is measured using Airmarâs CS 4500 ultrasonic speed sensor with accuracy to within 0. 1 knot and extremely low power consumption.

As industry focus is getting shifted towards the liquid immersion lithography to manufacture the commercial immersion tools, study of fluid flow and distribution is getting very crucial. The focus of this experimental work was to capture fluid flow and distribution and meniscus behavior on both bare and photoresist-coated glass wafers as well as silicon wafers and address {{one of the major}} challenges of immersion; presence of bubbles in the liquid between the lens and the wafer. A liquid meniscus is created by supplying water through a nozzle onto bare and photo-resist-coated silicon and glass wafer surfaces.

40|$|Electrohydrodynamic Atomization, {{often called}} electrospraying, {{is a way}} to {{disintegrate}} a liquid into droplets by exposing it to a strong electric field. Although William Gilbert has reported about the deformation of a liquid meniscus under the influence of an electric field already more than four centuries ago, the interest about electrostatic spraying of a liquid increased just a few decades from now. Among other advantages these systems can create droplets much smaller than the nozzle diameter with a narrow size distribution. The droplets are also electrically charged and can be manipulated to collide with specific surfaces (electrostatic coating) or with oppositely charged particles (bipolar coagulation). For a given liquid and setup, different combinations of the electric potential and flow rate can create different spraying modes. The ost studied mode is the cone-jet mode due to its capability to roduce droplets smaller than the nozzle diameter with a narrow size distribution. The characteristics and particularities of the different modes have been extensively studied and {{can be found in the}} literature. In this thesis we have explored another mode, the simple-jet mode. Compared to the cone-jet mode the simple-jet mode is much less explored. A possible reason for that is the fact that the droplet size in the latter is many times bigger than in the former mode for the same nozzle diameter. Nevertheless, because this mode operates at flow rates much higher than the cone-jet mode it is an interesting option for atomization methods which require high throughputs, e. g. water treatment and agricultural processes. We have studied the characteristics of this mode to resent its operational window and how the application of an electric field changes the droplet size and influences the droplets dispersion. Additionally we designed a multinozzle device for electrospraying in the simple-jet mode. We show that the device proposed can operate in this mode and that the characteristics of each individual nozzle are similar regarding flow per nozzle and produced droplet diameter. An insulation layer was applied between the nozzle tip and the counter electrode to allow its operation under high humidity levels without current leakages. The proposed configuration works for the simple-jet mode (the mode which presents the highest flow rate per nozzle in EHDA), therefore it offers very high throughput with a low number of <b>nozzles</b> per <b>unit</b> area. By coupling the device to a single step evaporator we have shown that the application of an electric potential increase the evaporation of the electrosprayed droplets inside a closed chamber by 40 %. Lastly, we showed that positive electrosprays in the intermittent cone-jet mode can produce negatively charged droplets and explained their origin. The presented research evidences the necessity of exploring other electrohydrodynamic atomization modes (besides the cone-jet mode) and shows that the simple-jet mode might be a good option for systems which require a relatively high throughput. It also demonstrates that electrohydrodynamic atomization might be a good atomization method for systems like thermal desalination and other distillation processes.
