40|$|Economics and {{politics}} interact. Political and economic forces influence {{the choices of}} policy instruments, the distribution of economic rent, {{and the distribution of}} political power. Politicians balance the interaction of economic rents and political interests in the policy-making process. Some policies aim to correct market failures, others aim to pursue politicians’ own interests, some are a combination. I discuss two policies in this thesis, the regulation of genetically modified (GM) food crops, and forest conservation policy. The relationship between GM food technology and food supply is a dilemma for policymakers in many countries. Theoretical and empirical studies show that GM food technology helps increase crop yields, reduces pesticide and fertilizer use, and generates economic, environmental, and health benefits. However, many consumers are concerned about the potential risks from using the technology and treat GM and <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> products as different products. The differences in public attitude towards GM food technology influence GM food policy-making. Many scientists believe that the public attitude is not purely based on scientific evidence, but is influenced by different interest groups. The two major interest groups involved in the GM food policy debate can be clustered into the GM food-supporting and non-GM food-supporting groups, depending on their attitude towards the GM food technology. The GM food group points to the high yields, environmental benefits, and potential for sustainable agricultural production. The <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> group, however, emphasizes the unconfirmed potential risks of genetic modification to human health and the environment. There are two major GM food policy regimes: the EU Member States have very strict GM food regulations, whereas the US has relatively lenient GM food policy regulations with respect to cultivation and imports. A stricter GM food policy would generate high welfare costs to countries that face food security issues, and possibly reduce a country&# 39;s food self-sufficiency. Also, different GM food policy regulations give rise to different national standards, differentiate agricultural trade markets, and result in trade disputes. Environmental policy regulates economic activity. To balance economic interests and environmental benefits, conservation policy is often needed for the protection of natural resources. Forests as a renewable resource provide both economic and environmental benefits. Forest conservation policy often requires governments to settle the trade-off between interests of the timber industry and the environmental benefit of maintaining parts of the forests. Political conflicts may exist between a profit-maximizing timber industry lobby and an environmental lobby. An industry-biased conservation policy could cause faster exploitation of this domestic resource, while a stricter protection of the resource could result in profit reduction for the timber industry, but increase environmental benefits. I discuss the relationships between food security and GM food policy regulations in Chapter 2. I develop a standard political economy model of GM food policy regulations and model GM food policy as the outcome of a GM-versus-non-GM food lobbying game. I find that stricter GM food policy has negative effects on three aspects of food security: availability, access, and utilization. Politically determined GM food policy has a negative effect on the food security situation if lobbying is costly. I also discuss the situation in which the policymaker weighs the GM food and <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> lobbies’ contributions differently, depending on whether the food security target has been reached or not. The GM food lobby becomes more efficient in the political game than the <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> group when the country commits itself to improving its food security. If the <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> lobby is large and strong, it will make high lobbying contributions for stricter GM food policy, even when the country is food-insecure. Chapter 3 studies the relationship between politically determined GM food policy and domestic food self-sufficiency. I first develop a theoretical model of a small-open economy and investigate the GM food policy. The government maximizes its own payoff, which is the weighted sum of social welfare and lobbying contributions. I take maize production in South Africa as an example for illustrating the politically influenced self-sufficiency rate. I find that the food self-sufficiency rate will decrease with an increase in GM food policy regulation cost. I also specify the mechanism of policy change in this small open economy case. I include changes in the lobby groups&# 39; sizes in the model, and assess the effect on food self-sufficiency. In the case of a large <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> group, the government payoff does not monotonically decrease when the government weighs social welfare at a low level in the political process. The GM food policy can be strict in this case. In addition, the food self-sufficiency rate can be high when a large <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> group is present and the government places a low weight on social welfare. Most importantly, this case demonstrates that the food self-sufficiency rate is not always a good indicator of food availability. In some cases, the food self-sufficiency rate can increase, while food availability may decrease. In Chapter 4, given the two different GM food policy regimes and in light of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations, I discuss a bilateral negotiation regarding GM food trade policies. Two countries pursue an increase in trade volume for both GM and <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> products. With a high GM food non-tariff barrier (NTB) on the foreign GM food imports and a relatively high <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> NTB in the foreign country, I find that the Nash bargaining solution lies between the two countries’ optimal unilateral stances for a successful negotiation. Simulation results show that the foreign country would not like to reduce much of its <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> NTB in the negotiation. The level of the <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> NTB only influences the absolute payoffs of the domestic and foreign governments, but not the negotiation results. The outcome of the negotiation only depends on the level of GM food NTB reduction in the domestic country. In Chapter 5, I discuss the effects of international trade on forest conservation and welfare in a two-country model with an industry-biased policymaker and Cournot-competing firms. I find that opening to trade increases the harvest taxes compared to the taxes under autarky. The tax increase is large enough to decrease the production levels, which increases the conservation level. In addition, the numerical simulation illustrates that the industry bias parameter monotonically decreases the output and increases the welfare gains from trade. As a result, industry-biased policymaking does not necessarily have to increase the environmental costs when opening to trade. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this thesis. First, strict biotechnology regulations decrease the level of global food security, especially in developing countries. Second, in the GM food trade negotiations, the country that has high trade barriers has to make concessions for a successful trade agreement. Third, second-best conservation policies can still protect the environment in an open economy. This thesis does not provide solutions to either the GM-versus-non-GM or the environmental-versus-trade debates. It does, however, offer some insights into the politically determined GM food and conservation policy-making and the impact of lobbying...|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} require labeling for GM food products. These countries {{often have}} {{different levels of}} genetic modification that they will tolerate before a food product must be labeled as genetically modified. For example, the European Union and Australia allow up to one percent of any ingredient in a food product to be GM before the product must be labeled as genetically modified. Japan allows 5 % of any ingredient to be genetically modified before the product must be labeled as such. The United States currently does not require mandatory labeling of GM labeled foods and has no standards for what percentage of an ingredient in a food product can be genetically modified for the product to still be labeled non-GM. For the official "organic" certification by the United States, a food product must be genetically modified {{and there is no}} tolerance for any genetically modified content. This paper presents empirical evidence on consumers' value for non-GM foods that are certified to have no GM content and non-GM foods that could have ingredients that were up to one or five percent genetically modified. We estimate values using a laboratory auction experiment performed on 44 randomly chosen adult consumers in the Des Moines, IA, area, grouped in 3 experimental units. They participated in a random nth-price auction experiment, in which they bid on three familiar neutral food items that may be genetically modified. Using statistical design and econometric analysis, this paper will estimate the average value of tolerance levels to consumers, measured as the difference in the auction price of a certified <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> and a <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> that had a tolerance of one or five percent. This paper has two findings. We find evidence indicating consumers place value in a certified <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> product, as opposed to a <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> product with a tolerance. We find no evidence, however, that consumers value a product with a tolerance of one percent more than they value a product with a tolerance of five percent. Due to decreased firm costs of complying with a tolerance of five percent, we find evidence that if the United States decides to enact a tolerance standard, a five percent tolerance may be better than a one percent tolerance. This information could be useful to policy makers who are considering whether to write in an acceptable tolerance level for genetically modified material.

This study firstly uses hedonic pricing model to investigate the premiums that purchasers {{are willing to pay for}} the organic label, the non-GM label, and the pouch packaging. Second, I use a Tobit regression to explore the relationships between the organic, <b>non-GM,</b> pouch baby <b>food</b> purchasing shares and household characteristics and purchasers' shopping behavior. The results from the hedonic pricing model show that baby food purchasers paid a premium of 2. 6 cents per ounce for the organic label, and 2. 9 cents per ounce for non-GM label. It is interesting to see that the price premium for the non-GM was higher than organic. And baby food purchasers paid a premium of 13. 8 cents per ounce for the new pouch packaging compared with the plastic tub packaging. The results from the Tobit regression models show that younger purchasers, those with high incomes, those with fewer children, and those with more free time are more likely to purchase organic and <b>non-GM</b> baby <b>food.</b> Higher education would increase consumers' preference for organic baby food, but has no significant effects on consumers' preference for <b>non-GM</b> baby <b>food.</b> In terms of geographic factors, consumers from the Pacific region have strong preference for both organic and <b>non-GM</b> baby <b>food.</b> iii 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|R

Paper II develops a firmer understanding of the economics underlying the relationship between rental rates sensitivity to output price and land quality.

In our empirical findings, we reject the null hypothesis of an inverse relationship between land quality and rental volatility with respect to commodity prices. Paper III highlights the role that uncertain consumer acceptance of genetically modified (GM) crop varieties may play in production decisions. We seek to explain the negative shift in acres sown to GM seed varieties in planting year 2000 {{as a result of a}} reduction in information available to growers at planting. Also, it is conjectured that growers make their acreage allocation decisions based on signals that inform them about the nature of post-harvest demand. We identify the types of signals that growers prefer to receive. Paper IV focuses on information asymmetry, where producers know more about their production practices than consumers, and voluntary labeling decisions. We develop a model of the market differentiation between GM and <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> varieties in a production environment where acreage allocation stage is followed by costly segregation between the two varieties. Having observed high demand for <b>non-GM</b> <b>food</b> variety, some food processors may falsely label their product as non-GM. We find that, contrary to intuition, the amount of fraud may not fall as a result of enhanced monitoring efforts, higher penalties, or a rebate on the cost of the investment in the segregation. In part two of the paper, the uncertainty about consumer acceptance of GM foods, penalty, and segregation costs is introduced...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issues of}} consumer awareness, opinion, acceptance and willingness to pay for GM foods in the Indian market. A random utility approach is used to estimate a logit equation which indicates what factors affect the likelihood of consumption of <b>non-GM</b> and GM <b>foods</b> {{and whether or not}} consumers are willing to pay a premium for non-GM/GM foods. Data was generated through questionnaire survey which was administered to 602 respondents in the city of Ahmedabad and 110 respondents on internet. More than 90 % of the respondents from the city survey did not know about GM foods. However, after informing them about {{the pros and cons of}} GM foods, more than 70 % were willing to consume even if GM and <b>non-GM</b> <b>foods</b> were available for the same price. Ceteris paribus as the price difference between <b>non-GM</b> and GM <b>food</b> rose, people were more likely to consume GM foods. Likelihood of GM food consumption seemed to increase as one moved from very poor and not-so-poor income brackets to higher income brackets. Being a female or a joint family member increased the likelihood of choosing non-GM rice and edible oil. On an average, consumers were willing to pay 19. 5 % and 16. 12 % premiums for golden rice and GM edible oil, respectively. Overall, it appears that GM foods will be acceptable in the Indian market. However, consumer education societies, government ministries, and food companies may have to create awareness about the GM foods among Indian consumers. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the willingness to}} pay (WTP) for non-genetically modified (GM) vegetable oil and tofu in Korea by using contingent valuation (CV) method and compares this WTP with Japan, Norway, Taiwan and the U. S. It also recovers the distribution of WTP by using a bootstrapping approach to provide a better measure of consumer's WTP on <b>non-GM</b> <b>foods.</b> Especially, we {{pay attention to the}} different characteristics of vegetable oil and tofu; vegetable oil made from GM soybeans doesn't have genetically altered protein, but tofu made from GM soybean has genetically altered protein. For this reason, vegetable oil made from GM soybeans is excluded from mandatory GM labeling system in Korea. Therefore, in this paper, the potential differences between WTP for non-GM vegetable oil and non-GM tofu are also investigated in order to evaluate the questions regarding the relevance of the introduction of new labeling system in Korea.

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{consumer}} resistance in the EU to genetically modified (GM) food products, imports of agri-food products arising {{from the use of}} biotechnology will have to be labelled. De facto, this also means that non-GM products will have to be labelled. Providing credible labels, however, will require costly traceability systems and segregation in food supply chains. Such product differentiation runs counter to the long- term food industry trend toward international standardization and will provide a considerable challenge for managers in all segments of agri-food supply chains. This research suggests that the costs of segregation will fall disproportionately on those wishing to supply <b>non-GM</b> <b>foods.</b> Considerable investments may have to be made in identity preservation systems. The current absence of transparency in regulatory regimes and the rapid rates of change in biotechnology make investment decisions exceedingly complex. The paper reviews what is known about the costs associated with supply chain segregation and discusses options and challenges for the future. Address for correspondence...|$|R
