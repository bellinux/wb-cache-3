40|$|Transnational armed {{conflicts}} {{have become}} a reality. The increasing sophistication of terrorist organizations, their increasingly transnational nature, and their development of military strike capabilities, push {{and will continue to}} push States to resort to combat power as a means to defend against this threat. Relying on the factual fiction that the acts of such terrorists must be attributable to the States from which they launch their operations, or on the legal fiction that the use of military combat power to respond to such threats is in reality just extraterritorial law enforcement, fails to acknowledge the essential nature of such operations. Because these operations invoke the authority of the LOAC, they should and must be treated as armed conflicts. LOAC principles must be identified and must be broad enough to provide the authority necessary to bring the transnational enemy to submission while ensuring that that authority does not override fundamental humanitarian protections for victims of war: This Article proposes three essential pillars of this regulatory foundation: military <b>necessity,</b> targeting (object/distinction <b>and</b> <b>proportionality),</b> <b>and</b> humane treatment. These principles provide the balance between authority and obligation that is so essential for the effective and disciplined application of combat power Like the treatment of internal armed conflict, these pillars can form a foundation for a more comprehensive treatment of regulatory analysis, encompassing other issues such as command responsibility, criminal liability, access to judicial review, perfidy and treachery, and medical obligations...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} only {{available}} in Dutch. Many chains process personal data {{although it is}} not always crystal clear this is the case, for example when techniques such as pseudonyzing of number systems are used. Processing personal data is required to fulfill several requirements originating in the privacy law, such as purpose limitation, <b>necessity,</b> <b>proportionality</b> <b>and</b> data protection. An exchange of information which is developed under the theory of Chain Computerization largely fulfills these requirements. The chain analysis, the method of analyse of the theory, addresses multiple requirements. Despite this, it neglects two important elements of privacy, namely legality and self determination of the persons involved. In case these elements are neglected, the risk grows that an exchange of information develops conflicts with the law or is not considered to be acceptable by the organisations or persons involved. It may reduce the effectiveness of the cooperation. To apply to the privacy requirements, the chain analyses may be extended with several questions to determine risks in an early stage, providing the opportunity to mitigate these risks. ...|$|R

5000|$|EDPS: In the Decision, the Council {{agreed to}} the {{conclusion}} of the agreement between the EU and the US {{while at the same time}} inviting the Commission to submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legal and technical framework for the extraction of data on EU territory. Furthermore, in giving its approval to {{the conclusion of the}} agreement on 8 July 2010, the European Parliament explicitly acknowledged the commitment by the Council and the Commission to set up the legal and technical framework allowing for the extraction of data on EU soil. This commitment would in the mid-term ensure the termination of bulk data transfers to the U.S. authorities. The requirement for a prior filtering of data within the EU is supported by the EDPS, as it would prevent the sending of bulk data to a third country. However, the Communication goes beyond the acknowledged purpose of filtering data in the EU, as it clearly indicates that the [...] "system should not be set up just to provide relevant information to US authorities", as the authorities of the Member States [...] "have a real interest in the results of such a system as well". The Communication therefore seems to legitimise the setting up of a whole new TFTS scheme, in an EU specific context, on the basis of the existing TFTP agreement. In other words, the Communication seems to justify the introduction of a new system which invades the privacy of EU citizens for the benefit of the authorities of EU Member States while using as a justification the assessment of utility of a system conceived and implemented to allow the US authorities to pursue their own investigation linked to terrorism. The EDPS has strong doubts about this approach, which does not appear to respect the principles of <b>necessity</b> <b>and</b> <b>proportionality</b> (as developed below).

While <b>necessity</b> <b>and</b> <b>proportionality</b> thus undoubtedly {{play a central role in}} exception clauses, they have been curiously understudied and remain startlingly unclear; international courts have struggled to interpret necessity/proportionality. In addition, despite the wide-spread inclusion of necessity/proportionality in exception clauses across international law, comparative studies across contexts are exceedingly rare. This thesis studies the concepts of <b>necessity</b> <b>and</b> <b>proportionality</b> enshrined in exception clauses across a variety of {{treaties and}} subfields of international law â specifically, the law on state responsibility, the law on self-defence, and the general exception clauses in WTO law -, and in particular how they are applied and reviewed by international courts. The thesis explores the concepts of <b>necessity</b> <b>and</b> <b>proportionality</b> in general, clarifies how they are applied in the context of the surveyed rules, and reveals the degree to which necessity/proportionality overlap across the different contexts, demonstrating the existence of a unified core. It argues further that this unified core can be utilised to facilitate cross-interpretation between different contexts, which offers an original strategy to overcome some hitherto unresolved difficulties with respect to the interpretation of necessity/proportionality in exception clauses. The thesis is divided into two parts. Part I (chapters I-III) analyses and compares the concepts of necessity/proportionality as well as how compliance therewith is reviewed by international courts across the surveyed rules. Part II (chapter IV) explores cross-interpretation of necessity/proportionality across contexts with reference to its unified core content. </p...|$|E
