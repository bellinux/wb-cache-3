The usefulness of additional aptitudinal and educational data was also investigated. The number of significant relationships between certain <b>nonverbal</b> <b>tests</b> and final technical school grade varied as a function of mental category and career field. When all <b>nonverbal</b> <b>tests</b> were used as a composite, significance was found in all courses for the total group and in three of five courses for the lower mental ability groups. On cross-validation the number of significant relationships between the nonverbal composite and final school grade were reduced to four total group courses and one lower ability group course. When added to the selector aptitude index (Al), the <b>nonverbal</b> <b>tests</b> made a significant and unique contribution to the prediction of technical school success over and beyond the selector Al alone. Further investigation indicated that additional aptitudinal and educational data added significantly to the prediction system in some courses.

The appropriate use of such tests with low-SES and minority children is more nuanced. Whenever language-reduced tests are used for talent identification, <b>nonverbal</b> <b>tests</b> that measure more than figural reasoning abilities should be employed. For young children, pic-ture-based reasoning tests can significantly broaden {{the scope of the}} assessment. We report new data showing that ELL, low SES, and minority children in Grades K to 2 typically perform as well or better on such tests than on figural reasoning tests. We also show that for children in Grades 3 to 6, language-reduced quantitative tests are an often overlooked alternative to figural tests. Finally, inferences about ability require comparison of a child’s performance with the performance of other children who have had similar opportunities to develop skills tested. This is often not the case for ELL, poor, and minority children, even on <b>nonverbal</b> <b>tests.</b> In such cases, multiple normative perspectives can greatly assist in the identification of academically talented children...|$|R

CPM and NNAT scores were related to math and reading comprehension tests. The CPM and NNAT concurrent and predictive validity coefficients were moderate, and there were no differences between concurrent and predictive validities with reading scores. The mutual incremental concurrent validity of the NNAT with the math test was significantly higher than the corresponding CPM validity. Finally, via step-down hierarchical regression analysis, the authors found that the predictive validity of both <b>nonverbal</b> <b>tests</b> is independent from the participants’ sociocultural level.

5000|$|Robert Yerkes and a {{committee}} of six representatives developed two intelligence tests; the Army Alpha test and the Army Beta test to help the United States Military screen incoming soldiers for [...] "intellectual deficiencies, psychopathic tendencies, nervous intangibility, and inadequate self-control". [...] The Alpha test was a verbal test for literate recruits and was divided into eight test categories, which included: following oral directions, arithmetical problems, practical judgments, synonyms and antonyms, disarranged sentences, number series completion, analogies and information, whereas the Beta test was a <b>nonverbal</b> <b>test</b> used for testing illiterate or non-English speaking recruits. The Beta test did not require those being tested to use written language, but rather the examinees completed tasks by using visual aids. The Beta Intelligence test was divided into seven subtests, which included: [...] "Test 1- assessed the ability of army recruits to trace {{the path of a}} maze; Test 2- assessed the ability of cube analysis; Test 3-assessed the ability of pattern analysis using an X-O series; Test 4- assessed the ability of coding digits with symbols; Test 5- assessed the ability of number checking; Test 6-assessed the ability of pictorial completion; and Test 7- assessed the ability of geometrical construction".|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: This {{study used}} {{meta-analysis}} {{to investigate the}} difference in nonverbal cognitive performance of children with specific language impairment (SLI) and their typically developing (TD) peers. In addition, variability in effect sizes across studies {{and its relation to}} the <b>nonverbal</b> cognitive <b>test</b> used, the cut-off criterion employed, participants’ age, and their linguistic skills were investigated. Method: We searched computerized databases and reference sections to find studies published between 2005 - 2011 of children with SLI who were age-matched (and not nonverbal cognitive matched) to TD peers, were given a norm-referenced <b>nonverbal</b> cognitive <b>test,</b> and reported sufficient data for an effect size analysis. Results: Across 80 studies, on average children with SLI relative to their TD peers exhibited lower nonverbal cognitive performance consistent with a medium effect size. Results of moderator analyses investigating the <b>nonverbal</b> cognitive <b>test,</b> the cut-off criterion, the children’s age and language skills will be discussed. Discussion: The findings of this investigation have theoretical implications regarding the characterization of SLI and have clinical implications for how <b>nonverbal</b> cognitive <b>tests</b> are used and interpreted for children with this disorder...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to further explore the {{relationship}} between vocational interests and intelligence. There is some evidence in literature on the stable relationships between vocational interests and intelligence (cf. Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997). It should be noted that the majority of the previous studies have only used questionnaires for the assessment of vocational interests. Thus, it is of interest whether the results are also stable when different assessment methods are used. Therefore, a <b>nonverbal</b> <b>test</b> was used in this study together with two questionnaires. Additionally, tests for general intelligence, verbal, numeric, and spatial ability, and memory were used. A sample of N = 138 persons was tested in a computerized setting. Results indicate that there is a positive relation between Realistic and Investigative interests and spatial ability. This result was found for both the questionnaires as well as the <b>nonverbal</b> <b>test.</b> Therefore, it can be assumed that this relation is stable for different assessment methods. The data is discussed with respect to current literature...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the usefulness of different techniques for the assessment of vocational interests. In an empirical study (n = 264) a questionnaire, a <b>nonverbal</b> <b>test,</b> several objective personality tests, and a semi-projective test were applied in one single session in a computerized setting. All tests enable the assessment of vocational interests with regard to the theory of vocational interests by Holland (1997). Results showed that highest correlations to a Holland-type questionnaire were found for the questionnaire and the <b>nonverbal</b> <b>test.</b> In general, the objective personality tests were less homogenous and showed lower correlations to questionnaires. Nevertheless, all different measures showed potential for the assessment of vocational interests. Improvements in the test material and scoring methods of the newly constructed tests are discussed and a model for the combined use of different assessment methods is presented. Future research directions and a discussion on the role of a multimethod assessment strategy in practice are given...|$|E

40|$|Background: Patients with frontotemporal {{dementia}} (FTD) typically have initial deficits in language or changes in personality, while the {{defining characteristic of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) is memory impairment. Neuropsychological findings in the two diseases tend to differ, but can be confounded by verbal impairment in FTD impacting performance on memory tests in these patients. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with FTD and 102 patients with AD underwent a neuropsychological assessment before diagnosis. By utilizing analogous versions of a verbal and <b>nonverbal</b> memory <b>test,</b> we demonstrated differences in these two modalities between AD and FTD. Discussion: Better differentiation between AD and FTD is found in a <b>nonverbal</b> memory <b>test,</b> possibly because it eliminates the confounding variable of language deficits found in patients with FTD.

40|$|A {{recently}} developed memory assessment procedure provides independent estimates of acquisition and retrieval efficiency, measured using a four-trial learning task. The {{purpose of the}} study was to investigate the construct validity of the acquisition measures included within this new procedure. Study participants were left (LT; n = 20) and right (RT; n = 20) temporal lobectomy patients, and control subjects (NC; n = 20), matched for age, education, gender, and intellectual level. Each subject completed verbal and nonverbal memory tests administered and interpreted using the new procedure. In accordance with the material-specific nature of memory disorders, poor acquisition was expected on the verbal test for the LT group, and on the <b>nonverbal</b> <b>test</b> for the RT group. In addition, both patient groups were expected to demonstrate better retrieval than acquisition. In general, the study results supported only the former predictions. Low acquisition estimates for the LT group on the verbal test distinguished them apart from the NC and RT groups. On the <b>nonverbal</b> <b>test,</b> the RT subjects were significantly poorer in acquisition than the NC subjects, but not the LT group. The sensitivity of the acquisition measures in differentiating the LT and RT groups apart from the NC group supports the validity of these parameters. An interesting corollary finding was that the patient groups also evidenced poor acquisition on tests on which they were expected to do well (i. e., the verbal test for the LT group, the <b>nonverbal</b> <b>test</b> for the RT group). These findings are discussed in terms of a generalized memory inefficiency, in addition to a specific, more severe, acquisition deficit for specific types of material. Finally, contrary to expectation, the LT and RT groups failed to demonstrate better retrieval than acquisition, likely due to an insufficient number of test trials to permit adequate estimation of retrieval efficiency. This finding reveals a serious shortcoming of the new procedure that limits its usefulness in evaluating memory performance. Future research should address: (1) replication of the current results; (2) revision of the four-trial version to permit greater opportunity for retrieval estimation; and (3) evaluation of the validity of the retrieval parameters included in the procedure.

40|$|Aim: Longitudinal {{analysis}} of {{verbal and nonverbal}} deficits and skills and their contribution to clinical presentation in children and adults with ESSENCE/Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations. Methods: Forty school children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or both were contrasted with 21 similarly aged children from the community who had screened positive for language disorder (LD) at 30 months. Also, 69 young adult males with ASD (Asperger syndrome) were followed longitudinally - neuropsychologically, psychiatrically and according to self/parent report - {{for an average of}} almost 10 years. Results: Clinic children with ASD and/or ADHD and community children with early LD had very similar verbal/nonverbal test and developmental profiles. Retelling of a story was linked both to verbal and nonverbal factors in the collapsed group with ADHD/ASD/LD. Nonverbal learning problems, persisting from childhood to adult age, in ASD, were associated with reduced tested and perceived executive functioning (EF). Good and superior verbal skills predicted better EF even in the presence of less good nonverbal skills. Conclusion: Young school age children seen in clinics with ASD/ADHD have almost identical verbal and <b>nonverbal</b> <b>test</b> profiles and problems as those screening positive for LD already at 2. 5 years. Narrative skills at young school age were linked both to verbal and <b>nonverbal</b> <b>test</b> results. Boys with ASD (Asperger syndrome) become men with ASD, and their functioning in adulthood is linked to verbal skills and nonverbal deficits in childhood. – These longitudinal studies demonstrate the importance of full neuropsychological and psychiatric assessments in ESSENCE. These conditions are often lifelong. Many of them should be recognisable or at least broadly categorisable as ESSENCE already at 2. 5 years. Follow-up assessment, both in school and in young adult age, is clearly important. Realistic prognosis and individual intervention plans based on such assessments are needed in ESSENCE...|$|E
