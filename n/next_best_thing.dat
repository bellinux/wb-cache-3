5|$|Drowned World Tour was {{the fifth}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna in support of her seventh and eighth studio albums Ray of Light and Music. It was also her first tour in eight years, {{following}} The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. The tour was supposed to start in 1999, but was delayed until 2001 as Madonna {{gave birth to her}} son, got married to Guy Ritchie, was working on Music, and was busy filming The <b>Next</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Thing.</b> When the tour was decided, Madonna appointed Jamie King as choreographer and the tour was planned in a short timespan of three months, including signing up the dancers, musicians and technicians. Designer Jean-Paul Gaultier was the costume designer who designed the costumes in such way that they indicated different phases of Madonna's career. The poster and logo for the tour included references to Kabbalah, which Madonna studied.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{decision}} making {{can be described}} as answering one question: “What is the <b>best</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> for this patient at this time?” In addition to incorporating clinical information, research evidence, and patient preferences, the process requires considering contextual factors that are unique to each patient and relevant to their care. The failure to do so, thereby compromising that care, can be called a “contextual error. ” Although proponents of evidence-based clinical {{decision making}} and many scholars of the medical interview emphasize the importance of individualizing care, no operational definition is provided for the concept, nor is any methodology proposed for the interpretation of clinically relevant patient-specific variables. By conceptualizing the physician–patient encounter as a participant–observer case study with an N of 1, this essay describes how existing approaches to studying social systems can provide clinicians with a systematic approach to individualizing their clinical decision making...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, on a {{suggestion}} from Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) starts {{an employee of}} the month program to increase office morale. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, schemes to get Jim fired. He gives Jim a performance sheet to determine the employee of the month, using complete anonymity to ensure a fair and unbiased assessment. Dwight also collects money from each of the employees as part of a cash prize, even though Jim did not authorize this. At the conclusion of the day, Jim announces the employee of the month, and it is revealed that he apparently picked himself by accident. Everyone starts blaming Jim for using this gimmick as a ploy to take money away from the office. Jim tries to pin part of the failure on Dwight, but since he has taken numerous precautions to protect himself from direct blame, he passively fires back. Jim decides to forgo the award and give it to the <b>next</b> <b>best</b> employee, but <b>things</b> are only made worse when that person is revealed to be his wife Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer). Everyone reaches their breaking point when a cake is delivered to the office with Jim's face on it.|$|R

Harris plays a fictionalized, hyper-womanising, lewd version of himself, {{in many ways a}} polar-opposite to his actual self, in the Harold and Kumar stoner comedy films Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, and A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Kassel, on his 66th birthday, Rundstedt {{received}} a cheque from Hitler for 250,000 Reichsmarks.

Rundstedt {{tried to do the}} <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> by failing to cash the cheque. By February this was attracting adverse comment in Berlin, and Rundstedt then cashed it. Some writers have sought to connect Rundstedt's acceptance of this money with his continuing refusal to support the resistance movement against Hitler's regime within the German Army. In fact Rundstedt refused {{to have anything to do}} with the money, handing it over to his daughter-in-law, and it was still untouched at his death in 1953.|$|E

25|$|The Savoy Theatre {{closed in}} 1903, and was reopened under the {{management}} of John Leigh and Edward Laurillard from February 1904 (beginning with a musical, The Love Birds) to December 1906. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company returned to the Savoy for repertory seasons between 1906 and 1909, in which year C. H. Workman took over {{the management of}} the theatre. He produced, among other works, Gilbert's final opera, with music by German, Fallen Fairies in 1909–10, which ran for only 51 performances. He also produced Two Merry Monarchs and Orpheus and Eurydice in 1910, the latter of which starred Marie Brema and Viola Tree in the title roles. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company did not play in the theatre from 1909 until 1929, instead touring throughout Britain and playing London seasons in other theatres; other works held the stage of the Savoy. George Augustus Richardson managed the theatre from November 1911 to February 1915. The Mikado's record as the Savoy's longest-running production was broken by the comedy Paddy the <b>Next</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Thing,</b> which played for 867 performances from April 1920.|$|E
25|$|FCC proponents {{argue that}} {{menstruation}} became a key problem because it potentially creates {{conflicts between the}} females and conflicts between males. Menstruation has little social impact among chimpanzees or bonobos, since visible oestrus swellings {{are the focus of}} male attention. But once external signs of ovulation had been phased out in the human lineage, according to FCC, menstruation became salient as the one remaining external promise of fertility. Potentially, dominant males might exploit such information, repeatedly targeting newly cycling females at the expense of pregnant or nursing mothers (figure e). Those who might lose male investment needed to take control. According to FCC, older and more experienced females did this by initiating newly cycling females into their kin-based coalitions (figures f, g). Red ochre pigments allowed women to take conscious control over their signals, resisting any dominant male strategy of picking and choosing between them on biological grounds. It is argued that because precise, sustained menstrual synchrony is difficult to achieve, painting up with blood-red pigments was the <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing,</b> enabling the benefits of artificial, ritually constructed synchrony.|$|E
25|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of her album Ray of Light (1998), Madonna intended {{to embark on}} a new concert tour in 1999, but due to the delay of her film The <b>Next</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Thing,</b> it was cancelled. By 2000, Madonna was dating director Guy Ritchie, and was pregnant with their child. Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, Music, instead of embarking on a tour. Buoyed up by the commercial success of her previous album, she was keen on getting back to the studio to record new music. Madonna was well disposed towards William Orbit, producer of Ray of Light, but by 2000, his production and sound had become ubiquitous. Also, the music scene was being dominated by a younger generation of singers like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, prompting Madonna to look for a more distinctive sound. It was then that she was introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï through some common friends. Madonna instantly liked the pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and acid bass in his songs.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Madonna {{signed on}} to play a violin teacher in the film Music of the Heart but left the project, citing [...] "creative differences" [...] with {{director}} Wes Craven. She recorded the single [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] for the 1999 film , which earned her a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Madonna starred in the 2000 film The <b>Next</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Thing,</b> and contributed two songs to the film's soundtrack; [...] "Time Stood Still" [...] and a cover of Don McLean's 1971 song [...] "American Pie".|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of her seventh studio album Ray of Light (1998), Madonna stated in a live {{interview}} with Larry King on January 19, 1999 that [...] "I {{am going to do}} a movie in April; The <b>Next</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Thing,</b> and then I am going to rehearse to go on tour. And then I'll probably play up until the millennium, New Year's Eve." [...] The tour was delayed until 2001, as she had, in her own words, [...] "been distracted by having children and filming movies". She also began a serious relationship with Guy Ritchie in 1999. By 2000, she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie, released her eighth studio album Music that year, and married Ritchie in December 2000.|$|E

Alfred Bax was a barrister of the Middle Temple, but having a private income he did not practise. In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in Hampstead. Bax later wrote that although it would have been good to be raised in the country, the large gardens of the family house were the <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing.</b> He was a musical child: [...] "I cannot remember the long-lost day when I was unable to play the piano – inaccurately".|$|E

[...] Orange Coast praised Nelson's performance of the standards: [...] "Willie Nelson is perhaps the finest male singer in country music [...] his phrasing and sense of understated drama have caused him to {{be compared with the}} best jazz singers. Now he's released an album of old pop standards, Stardust (Columbia), and you can almost hear the stirrings of an outlaw uprising between the grooves [...] although is definitively no step forward in Nelson's career, it's still a pleasurable showcase of his considerable artistry as a vocalist. Plus even though he's dealing with the sophisticated likes of Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Kurt Weill, he remains essentially country".|$|E
500|$|Scouting {{reports on}} Filatov were mixed {{in advance of}} the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. Sergei Nemchinov, head coach of Russia's {{national}} junior team, said of Filatov, [...] "He definitely has an NHL upside because he can score, is a well-rounded player and is responsible in the defensive zone." [...] Independent scouting service Red Line Report at one point declared Filatov [...] "the <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> to Steven Stamkos" [...] (who was eventually selected first overall in the 2008 Draft). McKeen's Hockey scouts described him as a cross between Ilya Kovalchuk and Maxim Afinogenov. His strengths included his skating and vision, as well as the inclination to play at high intensity. The NHL's Director of European Scouting, Goran Stubb, assessed Filatov's NHL readiness as, [...] "Nikita is a leader, has a great attitude, an excellent work ethic and tons of talent." [...] Other scouts were not as impressed with his defensive game, however, preferring to focus on his offensive abilities. Off the ice, Filatov does not train in a traditional gym or weight room, preferring to run outside in sand and lift objects such as trees and boulders.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from her}} work as a vocalist and record artist, Carey was {{becoming}} known as a songwriter, having penned and produced all of her own material throughout her career. During the production of Music Box, she was approached by Epic Records to write and record a song alongside Afanasieff, and release it on the soundtrack to the 1992 film Hero, featuring Dustin Hoffman and Geena Davis. While Carey was interested in the project, Mottola was very adamant over allowing Carey to take part in anything involving film, fearing it would hurt her career. Additionally, Columbia felt uneasy about allowing their highest-selling recording artist to contribute to another label, even a branch of the same parent company, Sony. So they wanted to try the <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing,</b> which was to have us write something." [...] Still interested in working for the film, Carey agreed to pen the feature song for the film, intended for fellow female singer, Gloria Estefan. Carey and Afanasieff sat together in a studio in New York, and over the course of two hours, composed the song's melody, lyric and concept. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Afanasieff discussed the process in which they had completed the rough version of the song: ...|$|E
