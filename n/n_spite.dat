40|$|Abstract. We have {{identified}} an F-actin cytoskeletal network that remains throughout interphase, mitosis, and cytokinesis of higher plant endosperm cells. Fluorescent labeling was obtained using actin monoclonal antibodies and/or rhodamine-phaUoidin. Video-enhanced microscopy and ultrastructural observations of immunogold-labeled preparations illustrated microfilamentmicrotubule co-distribution and interactions. Actin was also identified in cell crude extract with Western blotting. During interphase, microfilament and microtubule arrays formed two distinct networks that intermingled. At {{the onset of}} mitosis, when microtubules rearranged into the mitotic spindle, microfilaments were redistributed to the cell cortex, while few microfilaments remained in the spindle. During mitosis, the cortical actin network remained as an elastic cage around the mitotic apparatus and was stretched parallel to the spindle axis during poleward movement of chromosomes. This suggested the presence of dynamic crosslinks that rearrange when they are submitted to slow and regular mitotic forces. At the poles, the regular network is maintained. After midanaphase, new, short microfilaments invaded the equator when interzonal vesicles were transported along the phragmoplast microtubules. Colchicine did not affect actin distribution, and cytochalasin B or D did not inhibit chromosome transport. Our data on endosperm cells suggested that plant cytoplasmic actin has {{an important role in}} the cell cortex integrity and in the structural dynamics of the poorly understood cytoplasm-mitotic spindle interface.

Racial disparities in the socioeconomic status of VR recipients were identified. Minorities re-ceived different types of VR services than did European Americans.

40|$|Abstract. The {{electrostatic}} {{interactions of}} cytochrome c with its redox partners and membrane lipids, {{as well as}} other protein interactions and biochemical reactions, may be modulated by the ionic strength of the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion. FITC-BSA was used to determine the relative value of the mitochondrial intermembrane ionic strength with respect to bulk medium external to the mitochondrial outer membrane. FITC-BSA exhibited an ionic strength-dependent fluorescence change with an affinity in the mM range as opposed to its pH sensitivity in the #M range. A controlled, low pH-induced membrane fusion procedure was developed to transfer FITC-BSA encapsulated in asolectin liposomes, to the intermembrane space of intact mitochondria. The fusion procedure did not significantly affect mitochondrial ultrastructure, electron transport, or respiratory control ratios. The extent of fusion of liposomes with the mitochondrial outer membrane was monitored by fluorescence dequenching assays using a membrane fluorescent probe (octadecylrhodamine B) and the soluble FITC-BSA fluorescent probe, which report membrane and contents mixing, respectively. Assays were consistent with a rapid, low pH-induced vesicle-outer membrane fusion and delivery of FITC-BSA into the intermembrane space. Similar affinities for the ionic strength-dependent change in fluorescence were found for bulk medium, soluble (9. 8 ± 0. 8 mM) and intermembrane spaceentrapped FITC-BSA (10. 2 + 0. 6 mM). FITC-BSA consistently reported an ionic strength in the intermembrane space of the functionally and structurally intact mitochondria within ± 20 % of the external bulk solution. These findings reveal that the intermembrane ionic strength changes as does the external ionic strength and suggest that cytochrome c interactions, {{as well as other}} protein interactions and biochemical reactions, proceed in the intermembrane space of mitochondria in the intact cell at physiological ionic strength, i. e., 100 - 150 mM.

Computations with and without wind stress show the interaction of the thermo-haline and the wind-driven components of the large scale circulation.

Later explorers found no river where he had placed it on the map, and were apt to conclude that it did not exist. Recent mapping from air photographs (Fig. 1) and geographical studies in the area have now probably vindicated this explorer and show that his maps were not as inaccurate as cartographers had believed. But it remains a mystery why intelligent travellers should conclude from one negative piece of evidence that the river was non-existent, especially {{when the rest of the}} map was found to be fairly accurate. This river, now known as the Hornaday, drains part of the virtually unexplored country between Great Bear Lake and the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Access to the arctic coast was supplied to early explorers by the valleys of the Mackenzie and Coppermine rivers and consequently there was little reason a t first to investigate and map the area between these rivers. The main migration routes of the caribou swing away to the Coppermine and Bathurst Inlet country to the east, and so only a few Eskimo occupy the northern coastal fringe, while the Hare and Yellowknife Indians living along the northern shores of Great Bear Lake seldom venture north of the tree line. No explorer has searched here for gold and copper. No wealth of fur exists in the treeless lands north and south of the ribbon of spruce along the winding Horton River. This region has been almost by-passed in the explor-ation of the north and only in the last three years has it been photographed from the air and the drainage features added to the map. The first white men entered the area from the west and visited only the coasts washed by the arctic waters. In 1826 the eastern detachment o...|$|E
40|$|Chronic Mountain Sickness (CMS) {{patients}} have repeatedly {{been found to}} hypoventilate. Low saturation in CMS is attributed to hypoventilation. Although this observation seems logical, a further understanding of the exact mechanism of hypoxia is mandatory. An exercise study using the Bruce Protocol in CMS (n = 13) compared to normals N (n = 17), measuring ventilation (VE), pulse (P), and saturation by pulse oximetry (SaO 2) was performed. Ventilation at rest while standing, prior to exercise in a treadmill was indeed lower in CMS (8. 37 l/min compared with 9. 54 l/min in N). However, during exercise, stage one through four, ventilation and cardiac frequency both remained higher than in <b>N.</b> In <b>spite</b> of this, SaO 2 gradually decreased. Although CMS subjects increased ventilation and heart rate more than N, saturation was not sustained, suggesting respiratory insufficiency. The degree of veno-arterial shunting of blood is obviously higher in the CMS patients both at rest and during exercise as judged from the SaO 2 values. The higher shunt fraction is due probably to a larger degree of trapped air in the lungs with uneven ventilation of the CMS patients. One can infer that hypoventilation at rest is an energy saving mechanism of the pneumo-dynamic and hemo-dynamic pumps. Increased ventilation would achieve an unnecessary high SaO 2 at rest (low metabolism). This is particularly true during sleep.

40|$|International audienceThe {{food web}} of two {{intertidal}} seagrass (Zostera marina and Zostera noltii) beds {{that may be}} influenced by the seasonal variation in food source abundance was studied in winter and in summer with delta(13) C and delta(13) <b>N</b> analysis. In <b>spite</b> of high relative variation of abundance of main primary producers at the two sites, the food web did not vary between winter and summer. The delta(13) C range of primary producers was wide. Zostera leaves, the most (13) C-enriched source, were not consumed directly by grazers. Deposit and filter feeders have a similar delta(13) C and could use a mix of suspended and sedimented organic particulate matter, largely composed of detritus from macroalgae to seagrass. This trophic pathway allows the local incorporation of the high biomass produced by seagrasses. The wide delta(15) N range of predators was linked either to a large variety from omnivore to carnivore predators or to the also wide ranges of delta(15) N of primary consumers...|$|R
40|$|A {{randomized}} crossover {{trial of}} micro-encapsulated aspirin {Levius) and aloxiprin {Palaprin Forte) {{was carried out}} on thirty-three hospital out patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Both preparations improved the clinical. status of the patients. The difference {{in response to the}} two preparations was not significant, except for effect on functional status where the micro-encap. sidated aspirin was found to be significantly better at the 5 % level. Apart from six complaints of constipation with aloxiprin compared with only one with Levius, the side-effects were similar. The trial has shown that Levius can be conveniently given in divided doses thrice daily without loss of efficacy. I n t r o d u c t i o <b>n</b> In <b>spite</b> of current advances in therapy, aspirin remains the cornerstone of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. It was hoped that the introduction of benorylate would perhaps have eliminated gastro-intestinal bleeding, but this was not entirely borne out in practice (Croft, Cuddigan & Sweetlord 1972). As the expense of benorylate is considerable, it seemed worthwhile testing the efficacy of a micro-encapsulated formulation of aspirin (Levius®, Montedison),which hasbeenshown to maintain higher plasma concentrations after an oral dose than the equivalent dose of standard aspirin and thought likely to give more prolonged analgesia (Saggers, Chas-seaud & Cooper 1972). The preparation of the micro-encapsulated particles of aspirin in Levius is intended to improve gastric tolerance and allow for a rapid release of part of the dose followed by a slower diffusion of the remainder.

40|$|Aims. Our goal is {{to study}} the circumstellar {{environment}} associated with each component of the wide intermediate-mass pre-main sequence binary system PDS 144 using broadband polarimetry. Methods. We present near-infrared (NIR) linear polarimetric observations of PDS 144 gathered with the IAGPOL imaging polarimeter along with the CamIV infrared camera at the Observatorio do Pico dos Dias (OPD). In addition, we re-analyzed OPD archive optical polarization to separate the binary and estimate the interstellar polarization using foreground stars. Results. After discounting the interstellar component, we found that both stars of the binary system are intrinsically polarized. The polarization vectors at optical and NIR bands of both components are aligned with the local magnetic field and the jet axis. These findings indicate an interplay between the interstellar magnetic field {{and the formation of}} the binary system. We also found that the PDS 144 N is less polarized than its southern companion in the optical. However, in the NIR PDS 144 N is more polarized. Our polarization data can only be explained by high inclinations (i greater than or similar to 80 degrees) for the disks of both members. In particular, comparisons of our NIR data with young stellar objects disk models suggest predominantly small grains in the circumstellar environment of PDS 144 <b>N.</b> In <b>spite</b> of the different grain types in each component, the infrared spectral indexes indicate a coeval system. We also found evidence of coplanarity between the disks. CNPq (DTI) [382. 585 / 07 - 03]CNPq (DTI) FAPESPFAPESP [01 / 12589 - 1]CNPqCNPq [308005 / 2009 - 0...|$|R
