40|$|Background: In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in prescription drug abuse, particularly among adolescents and young adults. While substance abuse on college campuses has remained a pervasive public health concern, rates of <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> use surpass commonly abused drugs. The three most commonly abused prescription drugs (central nervous system (CNS) depressants, opioids, and stimulants) were assessed to identify differences among student characteristics, as well as their relationship with abuse. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to conduct a secondary analysis to explore demographic variables (race, gender, academic performance, living arrangement, alcohol and other drug usage, and affiliation with a fraternity/sorority) and their relationship with <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> use. Also, this study aims to identify potential strategies and provide suggestions to address <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse for future interventions. Methods: Data was obtained from the 2009 National College Health Assessment. The study consisted of n = 1, 417 undergraduate students attending Virginia Commonwealth University. Initially, overall prevalence rates for past-year illicit use of prescription CNS depressant, opioids, and stimulant use were examined. Bivariate analyses were conducted to identify differences among users and nonusers for each class of prescription drug using Pearson’s Chi-Square test of significance. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine associations between these demographics and illicit use of each prescription drug. Interactions between individual demographics and drug use were also examined. Results: The past year prevalence use of nonmedical prescription central nervous system depressants, opioids, and stimulants use were 4, 11. 2, and 8. 7 % respectively. According to bivariate analyses, nonmedical use was higher among certain college students, however characteristics varied by type of prescription drug. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that students living off campus (OR = 2. 12, 95 % CI = 1. 03, 4. 35) and reported use of alcohol (OR = 3. 91, 95 % CI = 1. 21, 12. 64) and marijuana (OR = 4. 41, 95 % CI = 2. 28, 8. 54) were more likely to use prescription depressants. Students with a GPA of a C or lower (OR = 1. 50, 95 % CI = 1. 03, 2. 17), and reported use of marijuana (OR = 3. 25, 95 % CI = 2. 22, 4. 78) were more likely to use prescription opioids. Nonmedical prescription stimulant use was highest among White students (OR = 2. 02, 95 % CI = 1. 28, 3. 30) with a GPA of a B or lower (OR = 2. 06, 95 % CI = 1. 28, 3. 30) and reported lifetime use of alcohol (OR = 7. 96, 95 % CI = (2. 50, 25. 41). Conclusions: The results of this study provide insight into the demographic variables and their relationship with <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse. The findings have important implications for identifying potential strategies to address <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse and will assist in the development of targeted and tailored interventions...|$|E

Baseline and follow-up data from the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors were used (N = 5007). A cross-lagged panel model, complemented by probit models as sensitivity analysis, was run to determine the bidirectional relationships between BMI {{and substance}} use. Alcohol was assessed using risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD); tobacco, using daily smoking; and cannabis, using hazardous cannabis use (defined as twice-weekly or more cannabis use). <b>Nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> use (NMPDU) included opioid analgesics, sedatives/sleeping pills, anxiolytics, and stimulants. Different associations were found between BMI {{and substance use}}. Only RSOD (β = -. 053, P =. 005) and NMPDU of anxiolytics (β =. 040, P =. 020) at baseline significantly predicted BMI at follow-up. Baseline RSOD predicted a lower BMI at follow-up, whereas baseline NMPDU of anxiolytics predicted higher BMI at follow-up. Furthermore, BMI at baseline significantly predicted daily smoking (β =. 050, P =. 007) and hazardous cannabis use (β =. 058, P =. 030).

40|$|Background Little {{is known}} {{regarding}} the demographic and behavioral characteristics of <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> users (NMPDUs) entering {{substance abuse treatment}} settings, and information on the HIV-related risk profiles of NMPDUs is especially lacking. Participation in substance abuse treatment provides a critical opportunity for HIV prevention and intervention, but successful initiatives will require services appropriately tailored {{for the needs of}} NMPDUs. Methods This paper compares the HIV risk profiles of NMPDUs in public (n[*]=[*] 246) and private (n[*]=[*] 249) treatment facilities. Participants included in the analysis reported five or more recent episodes of <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> use, a prior HIV negative test result, and current enrollment in a substance abuse treatment facility. A standardized questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers with questions about demographics, HIV risk, and substance use. Results Private treatment clients {{were more likely to be}} non-Hispanic White, younger, and opioid and heroin users. Injection drug use was higher among private treatment clients, whereas public clients reported higher likelihood of trading or selling sex. Public treatment clients reported higher rates of HIV testing and availability at their treatment facilities compared to private clients. Conclusions Findings suggest differing demographics, substance use patterns, profiles of HIV risk and access to HIV testing between the two treatment samples.

A cross-sectional, population-based survey of the U. S. civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 years and older was analyzed for lifetime <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> ADHD stimulants, life-time nonmedical use of another <b>prescription</b> <b>drug,</b> illicit drug use, and drug use initiation patterns. This included 443, 041 respondents from the 2002 – 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Lifetime <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> ADHD stimulants was reported by 3. 4 % of those aged 12 years and older.

40|$|Background: <b>Nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> use (NMPDU) is {{a growing}} problem in many countries. Objectives: The aim {{of the present study}} was to report {{correlates}} of and compare different subtypes of NMPDU in the Swedish general population. Methods: Data were drawn from a Swedish national household survey conducted in 2008 - 2009. A stratified sample of 58, 000 individuals aged 15 to 64 was randomly selected, with a response rate of 38. 3 %. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was used to compare sociodemographic, substance use, and health correlates of nonmedical analgesic use, nonmedical sedative use, and combined nonmedical use of these two types of prescription drugs.

40|$|<b>Nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> use (NMPDU) is an {{increasing}} problem, insufficiently studied among people in opioid maintenance treatment (OMT). This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with NMPDU for drug classes insufficiently described in opioid-dependent populations, including antihistaminergic anxiolytics and central stimulants. Methods. Study participants were recruited at two OMT clinics in Malmo, Sweden, between October 2014 and December 2015 () and interviewed about their use, motivations for use, and acquisition and administration of prescription drugs. Results. The majority of the sample reported lifetime NMPDU: 60 % for benzodiazepine-like hypnotics (z-drugs), 21 % for pregabalin, 19 % for stimulants, and 12 %– 15 % for antihistaminergic anxiolytics. Lower age was associated with nonmedical benzodiazepine use (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0. 89; 95 % Confidence Interval = 0. 82 – 0. 97). Illicit acquisition was reported by 61 % of people using z-drugs, 46 % of people using pregabalin, and 38 % of people using prescription stimulants, but only by 6 – 10 % of people using antihistaminergic anxiolytics. Conclusions. The substantial nonmedical use of pregabalin, z-drugs, and prescription stimulants {{found in this study}} suggests that clinicians should prescribe these drugs with great caution. Nonmedical use of antihistaminergic anxiolytics {{does not seem to be}} a clinical issue among people in OMT in a Swedish setting, but we propose future studies to monitor their use...|$|E

40|$|The <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> (NMUPD) is an {{escalating}} {{problem in}} the United States [1 - 3] and, by population prevalence, appears to have overtaken most illicit substances. NMUPD now exceeds all categories of abused substances, {{with the exception of}} marijuana [4, 5]. Two of the most commonly prescribed classes of prescrip-tion drugs with abuse potential are benzodiazepines, or central nervous system depressants, and opioids [6]. Although benzodiazepines are typically prescribed and opioids are indicated to control acute or chronic pain [6, 7], many people use these medications in non-medical ways or without a valid prescription. Long term or nonmedical use of opioids or benzodiazepines, such as taking larger doses of the medication, can re-sult in tolerance and/or dependence [6, 8]; large doses of opioids, or combined use of opioids and another depressant such as alcohol, can lead to respiratory de-pression or death [6].

40|$|Aim: To {{summarize}} published {{findings in}} peer-reviewed journals {{of the first}} two waves of the Swiss Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF), a longitudinal study assessing risk and protective factors of 5, 987 young men during the phase of emerging adulthood (20 years at baseline, followed-up 15 months later). Methods: Included were 33 studies published until November 2014 focusing on substance use. Results: Substance use in early adulthood is a prevalent and stable behavior. The 12 -month prevalence of <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> (10. 6 %) lies between that of cannabis (36. 4 %) and other illicit drugs such as ecstasy (3. 7 %) and cocaine (3. 2 %). Although peer pressure in the form of misconduct is associated with increased substance use, other aspects such as peer involvement in social activities may have beneficial effects. Regular sport activities are associated with reduced substance use, with the exception of alcohol use. Young men are susceptible to structural conditions such as the price of alcohol beverages or the density of on-premise alcohol outlets. Particularly alcohol use in public settings such as bars, discos or in parks (compared with private settings such as the home) is associated with alcohol-related harm, including injuries or violence. Being a single parent versus nuclear family has no effect on alcohol use, but active parenting does. Besides parenting, religiousness is an important protective factor for both legal and illegal substance use. Merely informing young men about the risks of substance use may not be an effective preventive measure. At-risk users of licit and illicit substances are more health literate, e. g., for example, they seek out more information on the internet than non-at-risk-users or abstainers. Discussion: There are a number of risk and protective substance use factors, but their associations with substance use do not necessarily agree with those found outside Europe. In the United States, for example, heavy alcohol use in this age group commonly takes place in private settings, whereas in Switzerland it more often takes place in public settings. Other behaviors, such as the <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs,</b> appear to be similar to those found overseas, which may show the need for targeted preventive actions.

Participants: Participants {{in this study were}} 502 young adults who had been prescribed a medication in waves 5 through 7 of the College Life Study. The College Life Study is a prospective longitudinal study of a single cohort of young adults that were sampled from a large, public university in 2004. Methods: Diversion behavior was described in detail and differences between diverters and non-diverters were examined. Regression analyses examined the effects of theoretically driven peer and rational choice effects on the likelihood of diversion. Opportunity and perceptions were examined as potential mediators. Results: Individuals with legitimate prescriptions divert a substantial amount of medication. Reasons for refusing to divert, opportunities for diversion, and beliefs about diversion differ between diverters and non-diverters. Regression analyses revealed both peer effects and exposure to information regarding <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> predict diversion. Opportunity mediated the relationship between perceptions of peer diversion and likelihood of diversion.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> use (NMPDU) of six drug classes and health. METHODS: Data on young adults males (mean age, 19. 96  years) from the baseline and follow-up of the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF) were used (n = 4, 958). Two sets of logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations between NMPDU of opioid analgesics, sedatives or sleeping pills, anxiolytics, antidepressants, beta blockers and stimulants, and health status (assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 12 -Item Short Form Survey Instrument [SF- 12 v 2]). We first computed odds ratios between NMPDU at baseline and poor mental and physical health at follow-up, adjusting for poor mental or physical health at baseline. We then computed odds ratios between poor mental and physical health at baseline and NMPDU at follow-up, adjusting for NMPDU at baseline. RESULTS: Three key findings regarding mental health were (1) there was a reciprocal risk between poor mental health and sedatives and anxiolytics; (2) poor mental health increased NMPDU of opioid analgesics and antidepressants but not vice versa; and (3) there were no associations with stimulants. Three key findings regarding physical health were (1) poor physical health increased the risk of NMPDU of anxiolytics; (2) the only reciprocal risk was between physical health and NMPDU of opioid analgesics; and (3) there were no associations with stimulants. CONCLUSION: These results, among the first ever on reciprocal effects between NMPDU and mental and physical health status, give unique information concerning the adverse effects of NMPDU on health and vice versa.

This descriptive, comparative design utilized a convenience sampling and social media to reach students over 18 years of age and enrolled in a Midwestern university. Twenty-nine students, 14 non-nursing and 15 nursing students, participated in this online survey. Substance use attitudes were measured using the Drug Attitude Scale (DAS). Risk factors for substance use were used as demographic questions and current drug use was measured using the Drug Abuse Screening Tool (DAST). Logistic regression (Chi-Square/Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s Exact) analyses were used to observe the association between risk factors for substance abuse and nursing/non-nursing students. Additionally, a Simple Linear Regression (Two-Sample T-tests) was used to assess the relationship between DAS and DAST scores between nursing/non-nursing students.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> opioid use {{has emerged}} as a major public health concern in recent years, {{particularly}} in rural Appalachia. Little is known about the routes of administration (ROA) involved in <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> opioid use among rural and urban drug users. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe rural-urban differences in ROA for <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> opioid use. Methods A purposive sample of 212 <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> users was recruited from a rural Appalachian county (n = 101) and a major metropolitan area (n = 111) in Kentucky. Consenting participants were given an interviewer-administered questionnaire examining sociodemographics, psychiatric disorders, and self-reported nonmedical use and ROA (swallowing, snorting, injecting) for the following prescription drugs: buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, OxyContin ® and other oxycodone. Results Among urban participants, swallowing was the most common ROA, contrasting sharply with substance-specific variation in ROA among rural participants. Among rural participants, snorting was the most frequent ROA for hydrocodone, methadone, OxyContin ®, and oxycodone, while injection was most common for hydromorphone and morphine. In age-, gender-, and race-adjusted analyses, rural participants had significantly higher odds of snorting hydrocodone, OxyContin ®, and oxycodone than urban participants. Urban participants had significantly higher odds of swallowing hydrocodone and oxycodone than did rural participants. Notably, among rural participants, 67 % of hydromorphone users and 63 % of morphine users had injected the drugs. Conclusions Alternative ROA are common among rural drug users. This finding has implications for rural substance abuse treatment and harm reduction, in which interventions should incorporate methods to prevent and reduce route-specific health complications of drug use. </p...|$|R

We examined whether maternal-offspring attachment reported at mean age 21 was associated with <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> opioid use at mean age 26, and investigated whether a history of depressive symptoms and substance use played a role in associations between maternal-offspring attachment and <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> opioid use. MethodsWe used data from the Growing Up Today Study, a longitudinal cohort of United States adolescents followed into young adulthood. Maternal-offspring attachment was reported by young adults and their mothers, and defined as mutual low, mutual medium or high, and dissonant. Analyses were carried out in the full sample using generalized estimating equation models, and in a sibling subsample, using conditional fixed effects models to control for stable aspects of the family environment. ResultsAnalyses with the full sample and the sibling subsample both showed that mutual medium/high maternal-offspring attachment at age 21 was associated with lower odds of <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> opioid use at age 26 (RR= 0. 74; 95 % CI= 0. 57 - 0. 97 in full sample). The association was partly mediated by mean age 23 offspring smoking, heavy episodic drinking, and illicit drug use. ConclusionsPromoting reciprocal attachment in the maternal-offspring dyad should be investigated as a strategy to prevent <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> opioid use by young adulthood. Even in young adulthood, programs that target both parents and offspring may have greater impact on offspring substance use than programs that target offspring alone.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> (NMPD) use {{continues to increase}} among emerging adult populations; however, {{little is known about}} the motivations behind this use. The current study aimed to extend previous research by developing and validating the first known comprehensive NMPD motives measure. As such, the primary focus of the current study was to examine evidence for the reliability and validity of the NMPD Motives Questionnaire by assessing the factor structure, internal consistency, and construct validity of the motives scale. Participants were drawn from a larger study of college student substance use behaviors and attitudes (N = 1, 427; Mage= 19. 8; 65 % female; 48. 5 % White Non-Hispanic) from two public universities in the United States. From the larger sample, 423 individuals (Mage= 19. 9; 62 % female; 53 % White Non-Hispanic) reported lifetime NMPD use and thus were included in the final study sample. Participants completed online self-report questionnaires, including the NMPD Motives Questionnaire. Following data reduction procedures, the final measure included 20 -items in which respondents indicated reasons they use NMPDs on a scale of 1 (Almost Never/Never) to 5 (Almost Always/Always). Exploratory factor analyses revealed a four-factor model of NMPD motives; including: Social/recreation, performance, conformity, and self-medication. Results of the current study suggest the overall scale and each of the four subscales of the NMPD Motives Questionnaire demonstrate good to excellent internal consistency, providing evidence for reliability. Moreover, results also suggest strong convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity of the developed NMPD motives measure. Similar to patterns observed for other types of substance use, Social/recreation, performance, and self-medication motives for NMPD use were found to be significant positive predictors of the frequency of past 6 -month NMPD use, after controlling for relevant covariates. Moreover, findings suggest self-medication NMPD motives significantly predict NMPD-related problems after controlling for use. These findings support incremental validity of the developed measure. Taken together, results of this study support the NMPD Motives Questionnaire as a potentially psychometrically sound instrument for measuring motives for NMPD use...|$|E
40|$|Elizabeth A Evans, Maria A Sullivan Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA Background: Rates of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse {{have reached}} {{epidemic}} proportions. Large-scale epidemiologic surveys of this under-recognized clinical problem have not included antidepressants despite {{their contribution to}} morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this review is to look specifically at the misuse of antidepressants and how this behavior may fit into the growing crisis of <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs.</b> Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search on PubMed, Medline, and PsycINFO using the search terms “antidepressant”, “abuse”, “misuse”, “nonmedical use”, “dependence”, and “addiction”, {{as well as individual}} antidepressant classes (eg, “SSRI”) and individual antidepressants (eg, “fluoxetine”) in various combinations, to identify articles of antidepressant misuse and abuse. Results: A small but growing literature on the misuse and abuse of antidepressants consists largely of case reports. Most cases of antidepressant abuse have occurred in individuals with comorbid substance use and mood disorders. The most commonly reported motivation for abuse is to achieve a psychostimulant-like effect. Antidepressants are abused at high doses and via a variety of routes of administration (eg, intranasal, intravenous). Negative consequences vary based upon antidepressant class and pharmacology, but these have included seizures, confusion, and psychotic-like symptoms. Conclusion: The majority of individuals prescribed antidepressants do not misuse the medication. However, certain classes of antidepressants do carry abuse potential. Vulnerable patient populations include those with a history of substance abuse and those in controlled environments. Warning signs include the presence of aberrant behaviors. Physicians should include antidepressants when screening for risky prescription medication use. When antidepressant misuse is detected, a thoughtful treatment plan, including referral to an addiction specialist, should be developed and implemented.

40|$|The <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> or {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) medications {{implies that}} the user is us-ing them {{for reasons other than}} those indicated in the prescribing literature or on the box label. The abuse of these medications is a national issue. Intentional drug abuse of prescribed and OTC medicines has climbed steadily. Data from the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health demonstrated that 6. 4 million (2. 6 %) people aged 12 or older had used <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> for <b>nonmedical</b> reasons during the past month. Of these, 4. 7 million used pain relievers, 1. 8 million used tranquilizers, and 1. 1 million used stimulants. The <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> in the past month among young adults aged 18 to 25 increased from 5. 4 % in 2002 to 6. 3 % in 2005, primarily because of an increase in the abusive use of pain relievers. Physicians need to watch for prescription and OTC medication abuse. Treatment strategies include (1) inquiring about prescription, OTC, and herbal drug use at the initial examination (even though many individuals are drug-abuse savvy, some are naı̈ve and do not realize that OTC medications can be problematic); (2) inquiring about drug use during office visits; (3) providing disposal containers that patients can use to dispose of their unused or unneeded prescription or OTC medications; (4) treating pain aggressively and appropriately; (5) practicing careful record keeping of prescription refills and controls over prescription blanks; (6) referring patients who are addicted to medications to 12 -step programs such as Alcoholic Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and Pills Anonymous; and (7) consider-ing detoxification.

Pre-scription medications are those pharmaceuticals dispensed by a pharmacist on the presentation of a prescription written by a physician, dentist, or other health care provider who is legally authorized to write prescriptions. OTC medications are phar-maceuticals that do not require a prescription and are sold on the shelves of markets, stores, and pharmacies. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{inappropriate}} {{use and abuse}} of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> isa serious public health problem. The Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention (CDC) has declared that the United States {{is in the midst}} of an epidemic of deaths from <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> overdose (1). The CDC reports that drug overdose, particularly due to the increase in <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> pain-relief <b>drugs,</b> is the second leading cause of deaths from unintentional injuries in the United States, exceeded only by motor vehicle fatalities (2). A re-cent analysis of preliminary CDC data suggests that drug overdose may now be the leading cause of such deaths (3). <b>Prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse is found throughout all as-pects of our population. Physicians and other health pro-fessionals with prescribing privileges are entrusted with the authority to use medications in the treatment of their pa-tients and therefore have an important role to play in help-ing to ensure safe and effective use of this treatment option and the deterrence of its abuse. The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this position paper to provide guidance to prescribers and policymakers regarding mea-sures to effectively address the problem of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse.

40|$|Discussions about {{reducing}} the harms associated with {{drug use and}} antidrug policies are often politicized, infused with questionable data, and unproductive. This paper provides a nonpartisan primer that should {{be of interest to}} those who are new to the field of drug policy, {{as well as those who}} have been working in the trenches. It begins with an overview of problems and policies related to illegal drugs in the United States, including the <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs.</b> It then discusses the efficacy of U. S. drug policies and programs, including long-standing issues that deserve additional attention. Next, the paper lists the major funders of research and analysis in the area and describes their priorities. By highlighting the issues that receive most of the funding, this discussion identifies where gaps remain. Comparing these needs, old and new, to the current funding patterns suggests eight opportunities to improve understanding of drug problems and drug policies in the United States: (1) sponsor young scholars and strengthen the infrastructure of the field, (2) accelerate the diffusion of good ideas and reliable information to decisionmakers, (3) replicate and evaluate cutting-edge programs in an expedited fashion, (4) support nonpartisan research on marijuana policy, (5) investigate ways to reduce drug-related violence in Mexico and Central America, (6) improve understanding of the markets for diverted pharmaceuticals, (7) help build and sustain comprehensive community prevention efforts, and (8) develop more sensible sentencing policies that reduce the excessive levels of incarceration for drug offenses and address the extreme racial disparities.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThere is {{a growing}} need to {{understand}} trends in <b>nonmedical</b> use of <b>prescription</b> pain relievers as a class, as well as specific opioid products. Surveys such as monitoring the future (MTF) and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) are important tools for understanding trends in abuse of <b>prescription</b> and illegal <b>drugs.</b> This report compares discrepancies in prevalence between these surveys for a specific opioid product (oxycodone) relative to other drugs. MethodsTrends in past-year use of marijuana, cocaine, and nonmedical use of oxycodone and any prescription pain reliever were estimated for each survey for a five year period (2005 – 2010) for adolescents in 12 th grade. The proportion of nonmedical pain reliever users who abused oxycodone was estimated for each survey. ResultsPrevalence of past-year oxycodone nonmedical use was steady over time for both surveys, but 2. 5 – 3 times higher in the MTF compared to the NSDUH. Trends in prevalence of marijuana and cocaine use were similar across surveys, although prevalence estimates for each were on average 18 % higher in the MTF. In contrast, prevalence estimates for any <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> pain reliever use were on average 15 % lower in MTF. The proportion of <b>nonmedical</b> <b>prescription</b> pain reliever users who used oxycodone was 42 % in the MTF versus 19 % in the NSDUH.
