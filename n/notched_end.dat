The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with the arm alone. Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior. Commoners used blowguns in war, which also served as their hunting weapon. The bow and arrow is another weapon that was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting. Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period, its use as a weapon of war was not favoured; it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic. The Contact period Maya also used two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.|$|E

In the present study, appropriate matching conditions, in terms of generalized displacements and stress resultants, have been derived and applied at the crack tip by enforcing the displacement continuity at the crack tip in conjunction with the variational equation. Strain energy release rate has been calculated using compliance approach. The compliance and strain energy release rate obtained from present formulations have been compared with the existing experimental, analytical, and finite element results and found that results from third-order shear deformation beam theory are in close agreement with the existing experimental and finite element results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{research}} {{on the effect of}} strip defect in the notched specimen of low alloy hot rolled steel 16 MnR at- 196 ℃ is carried out in this paper. 4 -point positive and negative bending experiments of notched specimen with different preloads are carried out to introduce strip defects of different dimensions in the front of notch. And then the residual stress and work hardening is eliminated through high temperature tempering. Bending fracture experiment is carried out at- 196 ℃. Through microscopic observation and the measurement and analysis of mechanical parameters, it is discovered that: when the preload ratio P 0 /Pgy 0. 861, the Pf /Pgy rapidly decreases as the P 0 /Pgy increases. That’s because the increase of local high stress-strain region caused by the strip defect at the front <b>notch</b> <b>end</b> makes the distribution of crack-shaped nucleus active region of cleavage fracture increase, causes the cleavage initiation and leads to discrete numeric values of material notch toughness Pf and W. 1...|$|R
50|$|A {{much more}} {{accurate}} way of <b>notching</b> the <b>end</b> of tube stock {{is to use}} a specially made milling cutter called an end mill. The stock to be notched is clamped into a vise and can then be fed slowly and accurately into a rotating, hardened metal, end mill. The equipment required for this method is considerably more expensive than the hole saw method and does not lend well to the same portability of the hole saw method as the machine is usually bolted to the floor for stability and safety reasons. This method of <b>end</b> <b>notching</b> is much faster and thus greatly minimizes the chance of damaging the stock either by warping due to heat build up or by squashing as can still happen with a hole saw.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{safe and}} {{efficient}} use of wood members in construction requires rational design criteria. One type of construction member often used is a beam with a sharp cornered <b>end</b> <b>notch</b> at the bearing area. In the United States, this <b>end</b> <b>notch</b> is limited to ten per cent of the beam depth for glue-laminated beams and to twenty five per cent of the beam depth for solid sawn timber beams. The notch length is limited to {{one third of the}} span length [1]. Since the effect of notches was not well understood these requirements are to limit the notch location to lower stress areas. Because of the unknown effect of <b>end</b> <b>notches,</b> the design calculations have been empirically based upon the net shear area[2]. It is recognized this design concept is incorrect as it is not related to the stress concentration and fracture stresses inherent in a notched beam. Our objective is to develop design criteria for notched wood beams based on mixed mode fracture analysis for an...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a finite element {{stability}} analysis performed on a sea-cliff affected by a deep notch. The cliff is about 200 m long with height ranging between 8 and 19 m. The notch at the cliff base is about 1 m above sea level, nearly stretching along the entire cliff toe. Detailed geo-structural and geo-mechanical surveys were performed in situ, and rock samples were tested in laboratory. The relevant physical and mechanical properties were used for determining rock mass strength parameters. A finite element approach was implemented using a two-dimensional elasto-plastic finite-element stress analysis program. The stability analysis shows that the notch causes increasing shear strains spreading from the <b>notch</b> <b>end</b> towards the top cliff. Decreasing strength reduction factors affect the cliff as the notch reaches increased depth into the rock mass, and when its depth is about 2 m the analysis results do not converge. At this stage, an uninterrupted shear plane develops along which a roughly prismatic rock block can slide and then topple...|$|R
