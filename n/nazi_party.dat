5|$|From {{the time}} he had fled to Germany, Meyszner had been engaged in a dispute {{regarding}} his membership in the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party.</b> He had maintained that the Venice Agreement meant that he {{and other members of the}} Styrian Home Guard had been accepted into the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> with prestigious low membership numbers corresponding to the dates of their entry into the Home Guard. However, the treasurer of the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party,</b> Franz Xaver Schwarz did not accept the Agreement and determined that the members of the Styrian Home Guard were not automatically transferred to the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party.</b> This became an issue when Hitler decided to mark the 10th anniversary of his seizure of power and tasked his private secretary and head of the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> Chancellery, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, to determine who should be issued one of a strictly limited number of Golden Party Badges to mark the anniversary. Meyszner, who had been recommended by Himmler, accepted that his party membership was retrospectively determined to be 1 June 1938 and he was allocated a party number of 6,119,650. Thus he effectively joined the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> as late as 1943. Due to these decisions, Meyszner did not qualify as an Alter Kämpfer (Old Fighter) and Himmler had to intervene on behalf of Meyszner to ensure he received the badge. Meyszner was one of only five SS men that Himmler deemed worthy of this particular award.|$|E

5|$|The {{small blue}} {{forget-me-not}} flower {{was first used}} by the Grand Lodge Zur Sonne, in 1926, as a Masonic emblem at the annual convention in Bremen, Germany. In 1938 a forget-me-not badge—made by the same factory as the Masonic badge—was chosen for the annual <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> Winterhilfswerk, the annual charity drive of the National Socialist People's Welfare, the welfare branch of the <b>Nazi</b> <b>party.</b> This coincidence enabled Freemasons to wear the forget-me-not badge as a secret sign of membership.|$|E
5|$|When Hitler was {{released}} from prison on 20 December 1924, Berchtold was District Director of the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> in Carinthia, Austria and was leader of the SA there. After the re-formation of the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> on 20 February 1925, he again joined the party, documented as member #964. In March 1926, Berchtold returned to Munich from Austria. He became chief of the SA in Munich.|$|E
5|$|While in Germany, Victoria {{showed an}} {{interest}} in the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party,</b> which appealed to her because of its anti-Bolshevik stance and her hope that the movement might help restore the Russian monarchy. She and Kirill attended a Nazi rally in Coburg in 1922 and Victoria donated money to the party. She was likely unaware of the most sinister aspects of the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

5|$|Propaganda did {{not develop}} a {{negative}} connotation {{until it was}} used in Nazi propaganda for World War II. Even though Germany's World War I propaganda was considered more advanced than that of other nations, Adolf Hitler said that propaganda had been under-utilized and claimed that superior British propaganda was {{the main reason for}} losing the war. Nazi Germany created the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in March 1933, just after Nazis took power. The <b>Nazi</b> <b>party</b> took editorial control over newspapers, created their own news organizations and established Nazi-controlled news organizations in conquered regions. The <b>Nazi</b> <b>party</b> used posters, films, books and public speakers among other tactics.|$|E

50|$|Although Stauffenberg {{agreed with}} some of the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party's</b> nationalistic aspects and had {{supported}} the German colonization of Poland and made racist remarks regarding Polish Jews, he found many aspects of the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party's</b> ideology repugnant and never became a member. Moreover, Stauffenberg remained a practicing Catholic. Stauffenberg vacillated between a strong personal dislike of Hitler's policies and a respect for what he perceived to be Hitler's military acumen. On top of this, the growing systematic ill-treatment of Jews and suppression of religion had offended Stauffenberg's strong personal sense of Catholic morality and justice.|$|R

5|$|The {{idea of an}} Anschluss (union between Austria and Germany to form a Greater Germany), {{was one of the}} {{principle}} ideas of the Austrian branch of the National Socialist (<b>Nazi)</b> <b>Party.</b> Nazism can be seen as descended from the radical branches of the pan-Germanist movement. In 1933, the Nazis and the Greater German People's Party formed a joint working-group, and eventually merged. During the period while the <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> and its symbols were banned in Austria, from 1933 to 1938, Austrian Nazis resumed the earlier pan-Germanist tradition of wearing a blue cornflower in their buttonhole.|$|E

5|$|Although Jews are an ethnoreligious group, {{they were}} {{defined by the}} Nazis on purely racial grounds. The <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> viewed the Jewish {{religion}} as irrelevant, persecuting Jews in accordance with antisemitic stereotypes of an alleged biologically determined heritage. Defining Jews as the chief enemy, Nazi racial ideology was also used to persecute other minorities.|$|E
5|$|Both Heinrich George and Werner Krauss {{were placed}} under arrest {{because of their}} past {{affiliation}} with the <b>Nazi</b> <b>party.</b> Although Heinrich George {{had been a member}} of the German Communist Party before the Nazi takeover, he was nonetheless interned as a Nazi collaborator at the Soviet special camp in Sachsenhausen where he died in 1946.|$|E

50|$|Nazism in Sweden {{has been}} more or less {{fragmented}} and unable to form a mass movement since its {{beginning in the early}} 1920s. Several hundred parties, groups, and associations existed from the movement's founding through the present. At most, purely <b>Nazi</b> <b>parties</b> in Sweden have collected around 27,000 votes in democratic elections. The high point came in the municipal elections of 1934 when the <b>Nazi</b> <b>parties</b> were victorious in over one hundred electoral contests. As early as January 22, 1932, the Swedish Nazis had their first public meeting with Birger Furugård addressing an audience of 6000 at the Haymarket in Stockholm.|$|R

5|$|On 9 November 1923 the Stoßtrupp, {{along with}} the SA and several other {{paramilitary}} units, took part in what would {{become known as the}} Beer Hall Putsch. The plan was to take control of Munich and then seize total power in Berlin. The coup d'état failed and resulted in the death of 16 Nazi supporters and 4 police officers. In the aftermath of the putsch both Hitler and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison. The <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> and all associated formations, including the Stoßtrupp, were officially disbanded. Berchtold then left Germany and fled to Tirol, Austria. Berchtold was tried in absentia before the special People's Court in Munich in 1924 {{for his role in the}} Beer Hall Putsch and sentenced to a prison term. During his time in Austria, Berchtold continued to be involved with <b>Nazi</b> <b>Party</b> activities, even though it was illegal.|$|E
