Psychic detectives like Carla Baron might claim compassion but are essentially paid agents with book sales, TV shows, lectures and private readings. Why are they needed when they cannot show one single case of evidence proving they have been helpful? ...|$|E
50|$|Known for his {{signature}} hat, entrepreneur Wasfi Tolaymat was world famous in 1995 as 'the {{man with the}} sign' during O.J. Simpson's trial, who purchased all 31 pieces at auction, {{the contents of the}} hotel room O.J. Simpson stayed in at Chicago's O'Hare Plaza Hotel on June 13, 1994 for $4000 from the night he 'supposedly' gashed his hand, including: the carpet, drapes, a holy bible, the ashtray, ice bucket, bed, dresser, the mirrors, chairs, a table, night tables, lamps, the pictures and more. He offered the lot for immediate resale during the trial for $1,000,000. Offers of $300,000 and $700,000 for the complete bric-a-brac collection of O.J. Simpson's Chicago O'Hare Plaza Hotel room items got turned down. O. J. Simpson checked into the O'Hare Plaza Hotel 4:15 A.M. Central Standard Time, checked out of the hotel 5:45 A.M. Central Standard Time, and caught a 7:41 A.M. flight back to Los Angeles. The hotel room where Simpson stayed in Chicago was later secured by the Chicago Police Department, where police discovered a broken glass in the sink. No blood was found on or near the glass, but blood was found on the sheets and towels. Simpson later claimed he reinjured his left middle finger when he broke a glass in the hotel room and gashed himself upon learning what had happened to his wife <b>Nicole</b> <b>Simpson.</b> Famed pathologist Dr. Michael Baden testified the broken hotel room glass at the Plaza caused O.J. Simpson's left hand wounds. Tolaymat 'seized' the moment during public relations hysteria the Simpson trial caused to create a worldwide memorabilia sensation.|$|E
