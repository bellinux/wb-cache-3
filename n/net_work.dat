25|$|The second law of {{thermodynamics}} requires that, in general, {{the total}} entropy of any system can't decrease other than {{by increasing the}} entropy of some other system. Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, {{it is impossible for}} any device operating on a cycle to produce <b>net</b> <b>work</b> from a single temperature reservoir; the production of <b>net</b> <b>work</b> requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing adiabatic cooling, which performs adiabatic work. As a result, there is no possibility of a perpetual motion system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a chemical reaction, means that it is energetically more efficient.|$|E

25|$|Implicitly {{for this}} definition, the second law of {{thermodynamics}} provides information that establishes the virtuous {{character of the}} temperature so defined. It provides that any working substance that complies with the requirement stated in this definition {{will lead to the}} same ratio of thermodynamic temperatures, which in this sense is universal, or absolute. The second law of thermodynamics also provides that the thermodynamic temperature defined in this way is positive, because this definition requires that the heat reservoirs not be in thermal equilibrium with one another, and the cycle can be imagined to operate only in one sense if <b>net</b> <b>work</b> is to be supplied to the work reservoir.|$|E
25|$|As {{the cycle}} {{named after him}} doesn't waste caloric, the {{reversible}} engine has to use this cycle. Imagine now two large bodies, a hot and a cold one. He postulates now {{the existence of a}} heat machine with a greater efficiency. We couple now two idealized machine but of different efficiencies and connect them to the same hot and the same cold body. The first and less efficient one lets a constant amount of entropy ∆S = Q/T flow from hot to cold during each cycle, yielding an amount of work denoted W. If we use now this work to power the other more efficient machine, it would, using the amount of work W gained during each cycle by the first machine, make an amount of entropy ∆S' > ∆S flow from the cold to the hot body. The net effect is a flow of ∆S' − ∆S ≠ 0 of entropy from the cold to the hot body, while no <b>net</b> <b>work</b> is done. Consequently, the cold body is cooled down and the hot body rises in temperature. As the difference of temperature rises now the yielding of work by the first is greater in the successive cycles and due to the second engine difference in temperature of the two bodies stretches by each cycle evan more. In the end this set of machines would be a perpetuum mobile that cannot exist. This proves that the assumption of the existence of a more efficient engine was wrong so that an heat engine that operates the Carnot cycle must be the most efficient one. This means that a frictionless heat engine that lacks of conductive heat flow driven by a difference of temperature shows maximum possible efficiency.|$|E

Owing to viscous effects, working fluid pressure drops in both the evaporator and the condenser.

The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the relationships between these traditionally used estimates of {{mechanical work}} in human walking and to assess whether they can be used as accurate estimates of musculotendon and/or muscle fiber work. A muscle-actuated forward dynamics walking simulation was generated to quantify each of the mechanical work measures. Total joint work (i. e. the time integral of absolute joint power over a full gait cycle) was found to underestimate total musculotendon work due to agonist–antagonist co-contractions, despite the effect of biarticular muscle work and passive joint work, which acted to decrease the underestimation. We did find that when the <b>net</b> passive joint <b>work</b> over the gait cycle is negligible, <b>net</b> joint <b>work</b> (i. e. the time integral of net joint power) was comparable to the <b>net</b> musculotendon <b>work</b> (and <b>net</b> muscle fiber <b>work</b> because <b>net</b> tendon <b>work</b> is zero over a complete gait cycle). Thus, during walking conditions when passive joint <b>work</b> is negligible, <b>net</b> joint <b>work</b> may be used as an estimate of <b>net</b> muscle <b>work.</b> Neither total external nor total internal work (nor their sum) provided a reasonable estimate of total musculotendon work.
