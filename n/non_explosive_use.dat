40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to find {{sufficient}} conditions under which the results of the simple search model are preserved when learning is allowed. It is shown that the properties of the simple search model are preserved with very simple assumptions. Intuitively, we need a <b>non</b> <b>explosive</b> agent. That is, expectations must be smooth. ...|$|R

50|$|Fires {{caused by}} {{ethylene}} oxide are extinguished by traditional media, including foam, carbon dioxide or water. Suppression {{of this activity}} {{can be done by}} blanketing with an inert gas until total pressure reaches <b>non</b> <b>explosive</b> range. Extinguishing of burning ethylene oxide is complicated by that it can continue burning in an inert atmosphere and in water solutions. Fire suppression is reached only upon dilution with water above 22:1.|$|R
40|$|Matter {{accretion}} on a {{white dwarf}} has been proposed to explain the novae and type I supernovae explosions. Accretion followed by a <b>non</b> <b>explosive</b> collapse, and leading {{to the formation of}} a neutron star is possible only if some constraints on the composition or the structure of the white dwarf, on the accretion rate, or on the energy production rate by nuclear reactions are respected. A detailed presentation of these constraints will be given...|$|R

Rambo starts off with just a Bowie knife and grenades (both of which have an unlimited supply, as with all the weapons), and gains points for killing the enemy, and for collecting the following equipment: Rocket Launcher, M16 Rifle, and Bow & Arrows (<b>Explosive</b> & <b>Non</b> <b>Explosive).</b>|$|R
