40|$|Today we have {{a plethora}} of {{telecommunication}} gadgets within our grasp, with many higher education institutions are using them to ‘push’ content to students. Pushing can be describe as transferring real-time content {{in the form of}} a short message to a user. In the past, push-technology was used primarily to indicate a web page had been updated. The subscriber (willing or not) was sent an alert via email or a web pop-up notifying them that web content had just been updated. We have moved on from this, and are now pushing content to a user via their mobile phone. The modern mobile phone is used not only for voice calls but can be used for text, video and image messages, as well as web browsing, applications, and locationawareness. Therefore it is a device in which an array of content can be delivered. But what content do higher education students want pushed to their mobile phones? The study reported here has taken an open approach,in that it investigated what students want pushed to their mobile phones, and whether the content should be sent automatically or only if they requested it (that is via subscription). Additionally, the study compared what university administrators perceive students want pushed to their mobile phones to what students wanted. The study found that administrators’ perceptions of what and when student wanted particular content pushed to their mobile phones often differed to what the students wanted. Findings show that students would like automatically pushed short messages that covered areas such as crisis messages, outages, census dates, and lecture cancellations. This however differed somewhat to what administrators’ perceived students wanted. Furthermore, when you add the option of subscribing to particular services, their <b>notification</b> <b>type</b> (automatic or subscription), students and administrators had differing opinions. Given the option to opt-into services such as parking availability, social activities and notification of the posting of results were important to the students, though numerous services were not mentioned by the administrators or were seen as an automatic service. Although the study is a preliminary investigation, the findings indicate trends and offer insights into the ‘what and when’ content students want pushed to their mobile phones. Knowledge of this can not only improve the university experience for the learner, but it can make more effective use of institutional resources...|$|E

40|$|The CMS Data Acquisition System {{consists}} of O(20000) interdependent services. A system providing exception and application-specific monitoring data {{is essential for}} the operation of such a cluster. Due to the number of involved services the amount of monitoring data is higher than a human operator can handle efficiently. Thus moving the expert-knowledge for error analysis from the operator to a dedicated system is a natural choice. This reduces the number of notifications to the operator for simpler visualization and provides meaningful error cause descriptions and suggestions for possible countermeasures. This paper discusses an architecture of a workflow-based hierarchical error analysis system based on Guardians for the CMS Data Acquisition System. Guardians provide a common interface for error analysis of a specific service or subsystem. To provide effective and complete error analysis, the requirements regarding information sources, monitoring and configuration, are analyzed.

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (notification {{of the name of}} the disease, notification of recurrence, and notification of terminality) as well as the factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for notification of terminality, followed by notification of the name of the disease, and notification of recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three <b>notification</b> <b>types,</b> significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the timeliness of Salmonella serotype and phage <b>type</b> <b>notifications</b> in South Australia. METHOD: We surveyed all notifications of Salmonella to the South Australian Department of Human Services between July 1995 and June 1996 We entered data onto an Epi Info 6. 02 database and calculated the time interval between {{various stages of}} <b>typing</b> <b>notification.</b> RESULTS: The median time taken between collection of a faecal specimen and receipt of serotype notification was 10 days (range, 5 – 38), while phage <b>type</b> <b>notification</b> took a further seven days (range 0 – 40). The time interval between collection of a specimen and notification of a Salmonella final identity was 14 days (range 6 – 49). The internal mail system of the Department of Human Services delayed notification a median of two days. Environmental Health Officers supplied reports for 224 (58 %) of 384 cases, 71 % of which occurred before the final Salmonella isolate was known. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the internal departmental mail system delayed the notification of Salmonella. In South Australia, investigations should focus on clusters of cases of known Salmonella identity, rather than all notified cases. IMPLICATIONS: To improve communicable disease investigations, health agencies should {{evaluate the}} timeliness of surveillance systems and examine the feasibility of transferring laboratory data electronically.

In this framework, this article reports on a study designed to analyze the efficiency, impact, and interference of different notification strategies aiming to identify the best approach to be used when an alert is needed in second-screen scenarios. A prototype able to deliver synchronized information related with TV content, with intervals of 10, 30 and 60 s, followed by individual or combined notifications (e. g., audio, visual, and haptic—on the tablet and visual—on the TV) was developed. A laboratory adapted to replicate a living room was set up and a test that involved watching three segments of a 20 -min clip while using the prototype was carried with 30 participants, under a cognitive walk-through protocol. Quantitative and qualitative results show that receiving notifications while watching TV is effective in alerting users about new information, despite its inherent cognitive disturbance for the TV viewing experience. It was also possible to highlight that in an HCI perspective, the most suitable strategy for integrating <b>notifications</b> (considering <b>type</b> and cadence) should be based on a combination of a visual notification (displayed only on the TV screen) along with a haptic notification (vibration on the tablet); spaced by an interval of at least 30 s...|$|R

The initial notification identified illness at a surprise birthday party held at a restaurant on 14 July 2012. The objective of the investigation was to identify the potential source of infection and institute appropriate intervention strategies to prevent further illness. Methods: A guest list was obtained and a retrospective cohort study undertaken. A combination of paper-based and telephone questionnaires were used to collect exposure and outcome information. An environmental investigation was conducted by Food Policy and Programs Branch at the implicated premises. Results: All 57 guests completed the questionnaire (100 % response rate), and 15 met the case definition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Medical {{boards and}} other {{practitioner}} boards aim {{to protect the}} public from unsafe practice. Previous research has examined disciplinary actions against doctors, but other professions (e. g., nurses and midwives, dentists, psychologists, pharmacists) remain understudied. We sought to describe the outcomes of notifications of concern regarding the health, performance, and conduct of health practitioners from ten professions in Australia and to identify factors associated with the imposition of restrictive actions. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all notifications lodged with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency over 24  months. Notifications were followed for 30 - 54 months. Our main outcome was restrictive actions, defined as decisions that imposed undertakings, conditions, or suspension or cancellation of registration. RESULTS: There were 8307 notifications. The notification rate was highest among doctors (IR[*]=[*] 14. 5 per 1000 practitioners per year) and dentists (IR[*]=[*] 20. 7) and lowest among nurses and midwives (IR[*]=[*] 2. 0). One in ten notifications resulted in restrictive action; fewer than one in 300 notifications resulted in suspension or cancellation of registration. Compared with notifications about clinical care, the odds of restrictive action were higher for notifications relating to health impairments (drug misuse, OR[*]=[*] 7. 0; alcohol misuse, OR[*]=[*] 4. 6; mental illness, OR[*]=[*] 4. 1, physical or cognitive illness, OR[*]=[*] 3. 7), unlawful prescribing or use of medications (OR[*]=[*] 2. 1) and violation of sexual boundaries (OR[*]=[*] 1. 7). The odds were higher where the report was made by another health practitioner (OR[*]=[*] 2. 9) or employer (OR[*]=[*] 6. 9) rather than a patient or relative. Nurses and midwives (OR[*]=[*] 1. 8), psychologists (OR[*]=[*] 4. 5), dentists (OR[*]=[*] 4. 7), and other health practitioners (OR[*]=[*] 5. 3) all had greater odds of being subject to restrictive actions than doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Restrictive actions are the strongest measures health practitioner boards can take {{to protect the public}} from harm and these actions can have profound effects on the livelihood, reputations and well-being of practitioners. In Australia, restrictive actions are rarely imposed and there is variation in their use depending on the source of the <b>notification,</b> the <b>type</b> of issue involved, and the profession of the practitioner.

30|$|The {{human body}} {{communication}} (HBC) is {{a technology that}} enables short range data communication using the human body as a medium, like an electrical wire. Thus it removes {{the need for a}} traditional antenna. HBC may be used as a type of data communication in body area network (BAN), while the devices are being in contact with body. One of important issues in BAN is an emergency alarm because it may be closely related to human life. For emergency data communication, the most critical factor is the time constraint. IEEE 802.15. 6 specifies that the emergency alarm for the BAN must be notified in less than 1 [*]sec and must provide prioritization mechanisms for emergency traffic and <b>notification.</b> As one <b>type</b> of BAN, the HBC must follow this recommendation, too. Existing emergency handling methods in BAN are based on the carrier sensing capability on radio frequencies to detect the status of channels. However, PHY protocol in HBC does not provide the carrier sensing. So the previous methods are not well suitable for HBC directly. Additionally, in the environment that the emergency rate is very low, the allocation of dedicated slot(s) for emergency in each superframe is very wasteful. In this work, we proposed specific emergency handling operation for human body communication's medium access control (HBC-MAC) protocol to meet the emergency requirements for BAN. We also showed the optimal number of emergency slots for the various combinations of beacon intervals and emergency rates.|$|R

Study DesignThis was an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. MethodsWe analyzed 80, 030 surgical procedures performed in 27 Brazilian States during the period from January to December 2003. The data were obtained from the Hospital Information System of the Ministry of Health. The inclusion factor was a surgical procedure in otorhinolaryngology (ORL). All files were processed with the TABWIN software. ResultsIn 2003, 80, 030 ORL-related surgical procedures were performed in Brazil. The Southeast region had the largest number of procedures (53. 08 %), followed by the South and Northeast regions (19. 6 % and 15. 6 %, respectively). Regarding the group of procedures, surgeries of the pharynx represented 45 % of ORL procedures. Procedures of high complexity were more numerous in the ear surgery group. Regarding the distribution of the type of attending institution, the highest concentration of surgical procedures occurred in philanthropic hospitals, followed by state and university public hospitals.

Since the spring of 2013, the Lichtenberger Engineering Library at the University of Iowa has offered a series of 15 - 30 minute drop-in classes {{as part of a}} series called Library Xpress Classes. This series targeted one topic each week and repeated the same class twice each Thursday to reach a broader range of people. Fifty classes have been offered over the two semesters. These sessions were open to faculty, staff, graduate, and undergraduate students. Topics covered include basics on popular databases (Compendex, SciFinder, PubMed, etc.), citation management software (Endnote and Refworks), alerts and <b>notifications,</b> and popular <b>types</b> of resources (patents and standards). The classes are not set up to cover everything completely but just to give an overview and brief introduction to products and services that otherwise might not be seen. The sessions are taught by librarians with different areas of expertise from the range of libraries on campus. Some classes were more successful than others; the citation management software sessions were the most popular. In the spring 2013 semester, the classes averaged a 4. 5 in overall usefulness rating on a scale of 1 - 5 with 5 being most useful. More students attended the 2 : 30 pm afternoon sessions and most of the attendees were graduate students. The classes often have repeat students. In one class on Refworks, a graduate student noted he had never heard of Compendex until it was mentioned in this class. He, then, went on to sign up for 4 more of the sessions offered that semester as soon as he realized how helpful they were. The Xpress Class series has proven to be an overall success. As time goes on the Library will continue to make adjustments to the programs so that it will continue to improve its outreach to students, faculty, and staff...|$|R
