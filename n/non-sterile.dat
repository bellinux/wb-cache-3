25|$|Some {{soft drinks}} contain {{measurable}} amounts of alcohol. In some older preparations, this resulted from natural fermentation {{used to build}} the carbonation. In the United States, soft drinks (as well as other beverages such as non-alcoholic beer) are allowed by law to contain up to 0.5% alcohol by volume.

A small amount of alcohol is introduced in some soft drinks where alcohol is used in the preparation of the flavoring extracts such as vanilla extract.|$|E

2500|$|Refermentation, {{sometimes}} called secondary fermentation, {{is caused by}} yeasts refermenting the residual sugar present within bottled wine. It occurs when sweet wines are bottled in <b>non-sterile</b> conditions, allowing the presence of microorganisms. The most common yeast to referment wine is the standard wine fermentation yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but has also been attributed to Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Zygosaccharomyces bailii. The main issues associated with the fault include turbidity (from yeast biomass production), excess ethanol production (may violate labelling laws), slight carbonation, and some coarse odours. Refermentation can be prevented by bottling wines dry (with residual sugar levels <1.0g/L), sterile filtering wine prior to bottling, or adding preservative chemicals such as dimethyl dicarbonate. The Portuguese wine style known as [...] "vinhos verdes" [...] relies on this ...|$|E
2500|$|Neonatal tetanus {{is a form}} of {{generalized}} tetanus {{that occurs}} in newborns, usually those born to mothers who themselves have not been vaccinated. [...] If the mother has been vaccinated against tetanus, the infants acquire passive immunity and are thus protected. [...] It usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the stump is cut with a <b>non-sterile</b> instrument. [...] As of 1998 neonatal tetanus was common in many developing countries and was responsible for about 14% (215,000) of all neonatal deaths. In 2010 the worldwide death toll was 58,000 newborns. [...] As the result of a public health campaign, the death toll from neonatal tetanus was reduced by 90% between 1990 and 2010, and by 2013 the disease had been largely eliminated from all but 25 countries. [...] Neonatal tetanus is rare in developed countries.|$|E
2500|$|Equilibrium {{thermodynamic}} calculations {{predict that}} As(V) concentrations should {{be greater than}} As(III) concentrations in all but strongly reducing conditions, i.e. where SO42− reduction is occurring. [...] However, abiotic redox reactions of arsenic are slow. Oxidation of As(III) by dissolved O2 is a particularly slow reaction. For example, Johnson and Pilson (1975) gave half-lives for the oxygenation of As(III) in seawater ranging from several months to a year. In other studies, As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable over periods of days or weeks during water sampling when no particular care was taken to prevent oxidation, again suggesting relatively slow oxidation rates. Cherry found from experimental studies that the As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable in anoxic solutions for up to 3 weeks but that gradual changes occurred over longer timescales. Sterile water samples have been observed to be less susceptible to speciation changes than <b>non-sterile</b> samples. Oremland found that the reduction of As(V) to As(III) in Mono Lake was rapidly catalyzed by bacteria with rate constants ranging from 0.02 to 0.3 day−1.|$|E
2500|$|In 1888, Swiss {{psychiatrist}} Gottlieb Burckhardt {{performed the}} first medically sanctioned psychosurgery {{in which the}} cerebral cortex was excised. [...] Although some patients showed improvement of symptoms and became more subdued, one patient died and several developed aphasia or seizure disorders. [...] Burckhardt {{would go on to}} publish his clinical outcomes in a scholarly paper. [...] This procedure was met with criticism from the medical community and his academic and surgical endeavors were largely ignored. In the late 1930s, Egas Moniz conceived the leucotomy (AKA prefrontal lobotomy) in which the fibers connecting the frontal lobes {{to the rest of the}} brain were severed. [...] Moniz’s primary inspiration stemmed from a demonstration by neuroscientists John Fulton and Carlyle’s 1935 experiment in which two chimpanzees were given leucotomies and pre and post surgical behavior was compared. [...] Prior to the leucotomy, the chimps engaged in typical behavior including throwing feces and fighting. [...] After the procedure, both chimps were pacified and less violent. [...] During the Q, Moniz asked if such a procedure could be extended to human subjects, a question that Fulton admitted was quite startling. Moniz would go on to extend the controversial practice to humans suffering from various psychotic disorders, an endeavor for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1949. [...] Between the late 1930s and early 1970s, the leucotomy was a widely accepted practice, often performed in <b>non-sterile</b> environments such as small outpatient clinics and patient homes. [...] Psychosurgery remained standard practice until the discovery of antipsychotic pharmacology in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Inbicon has {{patented}} {{a method}} of <b>non-sterile</b> fermentation of ethanol. During the preteatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass, microbial inhibitors are released which {{have a significant effect}} on fermentation. Also, bacterial contamination, especially by lactic acid bacteria, such as lactobacillus, is difficult to prevent in <b>non-sterile</b> conditions. Inbicon has found a range of concentration at which the fermentation inhibitors only inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria, but have relatively no effect on fermentative yeast. By determining the optimal levels of fermentation inhibitors, yeast fermentation can be conducted under <b>non-sterile</b> conditions. These optimal levels can be achieved by controlling the water/biomass ratio of the lignocellulose biomass during and after pretreatment.|$|E
