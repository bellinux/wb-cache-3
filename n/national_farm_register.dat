40|$|Health {{organizations}} worldwide {{have advocated}} that treatment records {{be required to}} show that antibiotics are used prudently by veterinarians and farmers alike. In 2000, the French government passed legislation making a <b>farm</b> <b>register</b> mandatory for all farms that raise animals for food production. The <b>farm</b> <b>register</b> is a comprehensive record designed to track all animal movements, treatments, and veterinary interventions on the farm. We conducted a survey to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of dairy farmers toward the <b>farm</b> <b>register,</b> with particular emphasis on recording of antibiotic treatments. The 43 farmers interviewed belonged to veterinary health cooperatives. All farmers correctly named an antibiotic or antibiotic preparation, yet only 2 recognized the 5 components of the <b>farm</b> <b>register.</b> Farmer attitudes toward the register were globally positive, even though they named {{a wide variety of}} constraints. Nevertheless, 72 % of farmers interviewed had a permanent health record, and approximately half had recorded either the last treatment (irrespective of drug class) or the last intramammary tube administered. Results were discussed in the light of health behavior change models that are applied in human medicine. We suggest that programs that seek compliance with the <b>farm</b> <b>register</b> should focus on educational interventions and bonus incentives...|$|R

40|$|Fostering is {{a method}} used by shepherds that allows the {{successful}} rearing of abandoned lambs onto other ewes, {{or the ability to}} provide surplus lambs a new mother in the case of triplets. Past research has focused on the success rates of the varying methods available, however, {{more research is needed to}} increase the knowledge about commonly selected fostering methods and the behaviour, welfare and production implications of the different methods used. Questionnaires were distributed at <b>national</b> <b>farming</b> events targeting <b>registered</b> sheep <b>farms</b> around the UK to establish which foster methods were currently in use and to collate the farmers opinions of their usage in modern day sheep farming. An experimental study was carried out to assess the welfare and production implications of the use of these methods. 84 ewes were allocated to one of the three experimental foster methods or the control group (twin lambing). They were also classified according to their lambing experience (multiparous or primiparous). Behavioural observations were conducted post-foster on the ewes and their lambs. The ewes’ salivary cortisol concentration and heart rate frequency were also monitored at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 180 minutes post-foster. To assess the production implications of the different foster methods, lamb weights and body measurements were taken at 0, 7, 30, 90 and 180 days of age to asses growth rates. Lambs were weaned at 3 months of age and remained at pasture until slaughter, at approximately 6 months of age. The lambs’ carcass quality was assessed by means of weights, zoometric measurements and conformation scores and some meat quality parameters (ultimate pH, water holding capacity and colour) were also investigated. 93...|$|R
