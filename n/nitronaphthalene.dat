Spin-unrestricted {{calculations}} and time-dependent DFT were used to characterize structure and reactivity of 1 -methyl- 8 -nitronaphthalene (1) in the triplet state. Four hybrid models (B 3 LYP, PBE 0, MPW 1 K, BHLYP) with significantly different amount of the exact exchange were employed. The triplet potential energy surface of 1 was mapped by using the UB 3 LYP and UMPW 1 K techniques. Both hybrid models provided qualitatively consistent pictures for the potential energy landscape. Thirty-one stationary points, of which 15 were minima, were found at the UB 3 LYP level of theory. Three minima corresponding to the nitro form of 1 were located on the triplet surface; just one was found for the singlet ground state. Two reaction paths leading from 1 either to a nitrite-type intermediate (2) or to the aci-form (3) were characterized. For both paths, reaction products were of diradical nature. The lower activation energy was obtained for the triplet-state tautomerization affording 3. The ground state of triplet multiplicity was predicted for two isomers of the aci-form. The triplet diradical 3 is expected to react through the thermal population of a close-lying singlet excited state.

40|$|The {{triplet state}} of 1 -methoxy- 4 -nitronaphthalene and 1 - and 2 - <b>nitronaphthalene</b> in benzene at room {{temperature}} was studied by time-resolved UV-vis spectroscopy with ns laser pulses at 354 nm. The triplet state reacts with N, N-dimethylaniline and N, N-diethylaniline; the rate constant {{is close to the}} diffusion- controlled limit. A transient with a peak at 340 nm is attributed to the alpha-aminoalkyl radical, PhN(R) (CHR) -C- circle', being formed by H-atom transfer from the dialkylaniline. Decay of this radical takes place within a few mus, as observed by bleaching in the 340 - 410 nm range. Thereby, a <b>nitronaphthalene</b> is eventually converted into stable products, such as nitrosonaphthalene, and dealkylation of the dialkylaniline occurs. Triplet quenching by triethylamine yields the radical anion, ArNO 2 radical anion, as an intermediate in acetonitrile and the conjugate acid, (ArNO 2 H) - N-circle, in benzene. These radicals are suggested to ultimately yield nitrosonaphthalenes by slow termination in the ms time range. Decomposition of the three nitronaphthalenes in benzene takes place {{in the presence of the}} three amines with maximum quantum yields of 0. 1 - 0. 3. The mechanisms of photodemethylation of the dialkylanilines and the photoreduction reactions of the nitronaphthalenes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The sorption/desorption {{behavior}} in soil/water systems of $ sp{ 14 }$C-radiolabeled naphthalene and nine of its nitrogen-substituted derivatives; quinoline, isoquinoline, quinoxaline, 1 -aminonaphthalene, 2 -aminonaphthalene, 1 -amino- 2 -methylnaphthalene, 1 -nitronaphthalene, 2 -nitronaphthalene and 1 -nitro- 2 -methylnaphthalene were investigated {{with respect to}} their physico-chemical properties and the type of interaction they form with soil organic and mineral matter. In turn, an investigation into the effect that sorption/desorption has on the bioavailability of these organic compounds and their mineralization kinetics was conducted. The non-polar naphthalene, the slightly polar quinoxaline and the three <b>nitronaphthalene</b> compounds sorbed through hydrophobic interaction giving rise to linear sorption isotherms that are typical of partitioning processes in which organic matter functions as a partition medium. Amino-naphthalenes, being polar and slightly basic, adsorbed through cation exchange, hydrogen bonding and formed coordination complexes at soil organic and mineral matter surfaces. Quinoline and isoquinoline, due to their relatively high dipole moment, intercalated the interlamellar space of layered-soil minerals. However, quinoline did not exhibit a specific type of interaction in the interlamellar region, while isoquinoline molecules adsorbed specifically, probably through surface protonation or coordinate covalent bonding with metal ions, and produced micelles upon sorption between the basal planes of clay particles. The discrepancy between the sorption behavior of quinoline and that of isoquinoline is attributed, in part, to the stronger hygroscopic nature of the former compound, its lower acidity constant and to the asymmetric shape of its molecules. The desorption behaviors of naphthalene and 1 -nitro- 2 -methylnaphthalene, both yielding concave up desorption isotherms, show a readily reversible component that gradually gives way to an irreversible one. The -CH$ sb 3 $ group, in the case of 1 -nitro- 2 -methylnaphthalene, reduced hysteresis which is attributed to an increase in the hydrophobicity of the molecule and the steric effect that the methyl substitution has on hydrogen bonding. Desorption of quinoline and isoquinoline followed a hysteresis loop (concave down desorption isotherm) such that reversibility increased with decreasing soluble concentrations in the aqueous phase. Amino-naphthalenes adsorbed irreversibly at soil surfaces which is suggestive of strong interaction forces resembling those of a chemical reaction. The mineralization of all studied compounds gave rise to hyperbolic mineralization curves comprising two phases; an initial fast one followed by a second slow phase with gradually declining rates. Quinoline maximum mineralization rates were first order with respect to soluble concentrations and the amounts of quinoline mineralized initially coincided with the soluble fraction. In contrast, the amounts of isoqoinoline mineralized during the fast phase exceeded its corresponding fractions in solution. Mineralization exhibited saturation-type kinetics (Michaelis-Menten type) which probably indicates that the biodegradation of isoquinoline was mediated by its sorption in the micellar form. Finally, naphthalene maximum mineralization rates correlated linearly with total concentrations (soluble and sorbed) and the total amounts mineralized during the fast phase exceeded substantially the soluble fraction.

40|$|The title {{compound}} (3) upon photoexcitation becomes demethylated {{by either}} an external acceptor in benzene or the methoxide ion in methanol. The triplet state of 4 -nitroaniline (1), 4 -nitro-N-methylaniline (2), 3 and the 3 -nitro analogue (4) in solution {{at room temperature}} was characterized by time- resolved UV-vis spectroscopy. The triplet state of 3 in benzene reacts with other nitroarenes, such as nitrobenzene and <b>nitronaphthalenes,</b> by demethylation, yielding eventually 2 and further products. This quenching reaction {{is close to the}} diffusion-controlled limit. The conversion of 3 into 2 is accompanied by a permanent bleaching at 370 - 400 nm within 10 mus and the quantum yield is up to 0. 3, this being in agreement with the quantum yield of intersystem crossing,. An intermediate with peaks at 420 and 700 nm is attributed to a C- centered radical: (H 2 C) -C-. (CH 3) N-C 6 H 4 -NO 2, which is also involved with 3 in methanol in the presence of methoxide. The overall H-atom transfer takes place within a few mus. Another electron transfer reaction, involving the non-absorbing alpha- aminoethyl radical, occurs from triethylamine to the triplet state of 3. The observed transient with a maximum at 330 nm in benzene or acetonitrile is assigned to the conjugate acid of the radical anion of 3 which subsequently disproportionates in the ms range.

40|$|Particulates {{and complex}} organic {{mixtures}} were sampled from the exhaust of a flame retention head residential oil burner combusting No. 2 fuel oil at three firing conditions: continuous at Bacharach Smoke No. 1, and cyclic (5 min on, 10 min off) at Smoke Nos. 1 and 5. The complex mixtures were recovered by successive Soxhlet extraction of filtered particulates and XAD- 2 sorbent resin with methylene chloride (DCM) and then methanol (MeOH). Bacterial mutagenicity [see Paper II (8) ] {{was found in}} the DCM extractables. Samples of DCM extracts from the two cyclic firing conditions and of the raw fuel were separated by gravity column chromatography on alumina. The resulting fractions were further characterized by a range of instrumental methods. Average yields of both unextracted particulates and of DCM extractables, normalized to a basis of per unit weight of fuel fired, were lower for continuous firing than for cyclic firing. For cyclic firing, decreasing the smoke number lowered the particulates emissions but only slightly reduced the average yield of DCM extractables. These and similar observations, here reported for two other oil burners, show that adjusting the burner to a lower smoke number has little effect on, or may actually increase, emissions of organic extractables of potential public health interest. Modifications of the burner firing cycle aimed at approaching continuous operation offer promise for reducing the amount of complex organic emissions. Unburned fuel accounted for roughly half of the DCM extractables from cyclic firing of the flame retention head burner at high and low smoke number. Large (i. e., greater than 3 ring) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were not observed in the DCM extractables from cyclic firing. However, nitroaromatics, typified by alkylated <b>nitronaphthalenes,</b> alkyl-nitrobiphenyls, and alkyl-nitrophenanthrenes were found in a minor subfraction containing {{a significant portion of the}} total mutagenic activity of the cyclic low smoke samples (8). Oxygen-containing PAH, typified by phenalene- 1 -one and its alkyl derivatives, are important mutagens from cyclic firing at high smoke conditions. Thus, oil burner effluents differ markedly from those of several other combustors, including the automotive diesel engine, where multiring PAH, typified by fluoranthene and alkylated phenanthrenes, account for a significant portion of the effluent mutagenicity. Implications for combustion and emissions source identification are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Considerando os diversos efeitos adversos que a matéria particulada (MP) atmosférica e os contaminantes químicos ambientais causam aos ecossistemas e à saúde humana, o presente estudo procurou avaliar, o potencial mutagênico e recombinogênico de (i) extratos orgânicos de MP 10, com diâmetro < 10 Xm e de particulados totais em suspensão (PTS), coletados na região metropolitana de Canoas nos meses de Novembro de 2003 (primavera) e Janeiro de 2004 (verão) — que sofre a influência de diversas indústrias e principalmente do intenso tráfego veicular da BR 116 e (ii) quatro nitro-derivados de hidrocarbonetos aromáticos policíclicos (NHAPs), ambientalmente importantes — 1 -Nitronaftaleno (1 NN), 1, 5 -Dinitronaftaleno (1, 5 DNN), 9 -Nitroantraceno (9 NA) e 2 -Nitrofluoreno (2 NF). Para tanto foi empregado o Teste para Detecção de Mutação e Recombinação Somática (SMART) em Drosophila melanogaster, que permite a detecção simultânea de mutação gênica e cromossômica, assim como de eventos relacionados com recombinação mitótica — possibilitando quantificar a contribuição deste último parâmetro genético para a genotoxicidade total dos contaminantes. No que se refere à MP não foram observados resultados positivos na coleta de verão no cruzamento padrão, embora nas amostras da primavera tenham sido obtidos dois resultados positivos, referentes às amostras cruas (100 %) de MP 10 e de PTS. Entretanto, enquanto as genotoxinas presentes na MP 10 induziram exclusivamente recombinação homóloga, as amostras de PTS apresentaram aproximadamente 62 % de ação recombinacional e 38 % de atividade mutacional, gênica e/ou cromossômica. Esta resposta genotóxica diferencial pode ser relacionada a diferenças na composição dos contaminantes presentes nestas duas frações de partículas aéreas. Adicionalmente no cruzamento aprimorado as amostras coletadas na primavera — MP 10 e PTS — induziram aumentos significativos na freqüência de clones mutantes nas doses de 50 e 100 % — que são induzidos exclusivamente por recombinação mitótica e estão relacionadas à presença de genotoxinas geradas no processo de metabolização via citocromo P 450. Na coleta de verão foi diagnosticado um resultado positivo para o 100 % de MP 10, que não foi detectado no cruzamento padrão para esta mesma estação, indicando que os altos níveis de enzimas de metabolização, característicos deste cruzamento, funcionaram como mecanismo de ativação das genotoxinas presentes na fração orgânica das partículas inaláveis. Os resultados obtidos para os nitrocompostos apontaram para efeitos positivos no genótipo trans-heterozigoto para os quatro NHAPs avaliados, produzindo aumentos estatisticamente significativos na freqüência total de manchas, que representa a genotoxicidade total da amostra. Nos indivíduos heterozigotos para o cromossomo balanceador TM 3, apenas o 1, 5 DNN induziu aumentos significativos no total de manchas — indicando que além da ação recombinacional o 1, 5 DNN também induz mutação. Nos demais compostos — 1 NN, 9 NA e 2 NF — a ausência de diferenças significantes em relação aos controles negativos no genótipo heterozigoto para o cromossomo TM 3 é indicativo de que a ação tóxico-genética destes NHAPs deve-se basicamente à indução de recombinação mitótica entre cromossomos homólogos. O 1 NN foi o composto com a maior potência genotóxica, induzindo cerca de 10 clones / 105 células/ mM — seguido pelo 9 NA. Observa-se também que o 1 NN é cerca de 333 vezes mais genotóxico que os compostos igualmente menos potentes — 1, 5 DNN e 2 NF. Esta diferença em termos de potência genotóxica pode ser correlacionada à presença de um grupo nitro no 1 NN e de dois grupos nitro no seu correspondente 1, 5 DNN — sugerindo que o primeiro é provavelmente mais acessível à transformação metabólica do que o segundo. Todas estas observações validam as investigações voltadas para a caracterização dos extratos orgânicos e dos contaminantes ambientais quanto a sua ação como indutores de recombinação homóloga (RH) in vivo. A RH é um evento associado a diferentes etapas do processo de tumorigênese, e a poluição aérea é responsável por ~ 10, 7 % dos casos de câncer de pulmão e ~ 1 % de outros tipos de câncer — o que torna a avaliação da indução de RH {{fundamental}} para a obtenção de dados referentes ao risco genético imposto por contaminantes ambientais. Considering {{the several}} {{adverse effects of}} atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and of the environment chemical contaminants on the ecosystems and human health, the present study aimed to assess the mutagenic and recombinagenic potential of PM 10 organic extracts measuring less than 10 μm and of total suspended particulates (TSP) collected in the Greater Canoas region, in November 2003 (spring) and January 2004 (summer). The region is {{under the influence of}} diverse industrial activities and most specially of intense motor vehicle traffic from BR 116. This study also investigated four nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs) of environmental relevance: 1 - <b>Nitronaphthalene</b> (1 NN); 1, 5 -Dinitronaphthalene (1, 5 DNN); 9 -Nitroanthracene (9 NA); and 2 -Nitrofluorene (2 NF). The Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster was used. The assay allows the simultaneous detection of gene and chromosome mutations, as well as of events related to mitotic recombination, which affords to quantify the contribution of this last genetic parameter to total genotoxicity of contaminants. As regards PM, no positive results were observed in the standard cross for the summer collection, although the spring samples generated two positive results for the raw (100 %) PM 10 and TSP samples. Nevertheless, while the genotoxins present in PM 10 induced only homologous recombination, the TSP samples presented roughly 62 % of recombinational activity and 38 % of gene and/or chromosome mutation activity. This distinct genotoxic response {{may be related to the}} different composition of contaminants present in these two fractions of airborne particles. Additionally, the spring samples — PM 10 and TSP, at the 50 and 100 % doses — induced significant increases in mutant clone frequency in the high-bioactivation cross. These mutant clones are induced exclusively by mitotic recombination and are related to the presence of genotoxins produced in the cytochrome P 450 metabolization process. For the summer samples, positive results were recorded for 100 % of PM 10, which was not detected in the standard cross for the same season, which suggests that the high levels of metabolization enzymes, typical of this cross, For the summer samples, positive results were recorded for 100 % of PM 10, which was not detected in the standard cross for the same season, which suggests that the high levels of metabolization enzymes, typical of this cross, work as an activation mechanism for genotoxins present in the organic fraction of inhalable particles. The results obtained for the nitrocompounds point to the positive effects on the trans-heterozygous for the four NPAHs assessed, which produced statistically significant increases in total spot frequencies, representing the total genotoxicity of the sample. Concerning the balancer chromosome TM 3, only 1, 5 DNN induced significant increases in total spot frequencies in heterozygous individuals, which also indicated that apart from the recombinational action, 1, 5 DNN also induces mutation. For the other compounds, 1 NN, 9 NA, and 2 NF, the absence of significant differences in comparison to the negative controls in the heterozygote genotype for chromosome TM 3 indicates that the genotoxic action of these NPAHs is essentially due to the mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes. 1 NN was the compound with the highest genotoxic potential, inducing approximately 10 clones / 105 cells/ mM, followed by 9 NA. It was also observed that 1 NN is roughly 333 times more genotoxic than the equally less potent compounds — 1, 5 DNN and 2 NF. This difference, in terms of genotoxic potential, may be related to the presence of one nitro group in 1 NN and to two nitro groups in its counterpart, 1, 5 DNN. This suggests that the former is probably more susceptible to metabolic transformation than the latter. All these observations validate the investigations directed towards the characterization of organic extracts and of the environmental contaminants as regards their action as inducers of in vivo homologous recombination (HR). HR is an event associated to the different stages of tumorigenesis, and airborne pollution is accountable for ~ 10. 7 % of lung cancer cases and ~ 1 % of other types of cancer — which makes the evaluation of HR essential to obtain data of the genetic risk posed by environmental contaminants...|$|E
