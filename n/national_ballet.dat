5|$|Born on 16 November 1945 in Brussels, van Hamel was the {{youngest}} of three siblings of Dutch parents. Her father, Diederik (Dick) Alfred van Hamel, was a diplomat stationed in Copenhagen. Her mother, Manette van Hamel (née Cramer), born in 1913 in Deventer, was a music teacher and violinist who played in a string quartet. Martine van Hamel began ballet lessons at the age of four in Copenhagen where it was common for children to study ballet. As a diplomat, her father was routinely stationed in different countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Indonesia. It was difficult for her to find teachers but she took lessons when possible. While her father was stationed in Caracas, Venezuela, van Hamel, then age ten, took classes with Henry Danton from The Royal Ballet. Danton frequently guest taught at the <b>National</b> <b>Ballet</b> of Venezuela. In 1958, she moved to Canada to study at Canada's <b>National</b> <b>Ballet</b> School with Betty Oliphant.|$|E

5|$|Her {{mother told}} Copeland {{that she would}} have to give up ballet, but Bradley wanted Copeland to {{continue}} and offered to host her. DelaCerna agreed to this, and Copeland moved in with Bradley and her family. Eventually, Copeland and DelaCerna signed a management contract and a life-story contract with Bradley. Copeland spent the weekdays with the Bradleys near the coast and the weekends at home with her mother, a two-hour bus ride away. Copeland would spend most of her next three years with the Bradleys. By the age of fourteen, Copeland was the winner of a <b>national</b> <b>ballet</b> contest and won her first solo role. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to books and videos about ballet. When she saw Paloma Herrera, a principal ballerina with ABT, perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Copeland began to idolize her as much as she did Mariah Carey. The media first noticed her when she drew 2,000 patrons per show as she performed as Clara in The Nutcracker at the San Pedro High School after only eight months of study. A larger role as Kitri in Don Quixote at the San Pedro Dance Center and a featured role in The Chocolate Nutcracker, an African American version of the tale, narrated by Debbie Allen, soon followed. The latter was presented at UCLA's Royce Hall. Copeland's role was modified especially for her, and included ethnic dances.|$|E
