5|$|Many {{types of}} objects in {{abstract}} algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called <b>Noetherian</b> in her honor. By definition, a <b>Noetherian</b> ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a <b>Noetherian</b> group {{is defined as a}} group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A <b>Noetherian</b> module is a module in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A <b>Noetherian</b> space is a topological space in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a <b>Noetherian</b> ring a <b>Noetherian</b> topological space.|$|E
5|$|Noether's work Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern (Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields, 1927) {{characterized}} the rings {{in which the}} ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the Dedekind domains: integral domains that are <b>Noetherian,</b> 0 or 1-dimensional, and integrally closed in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now are called the isomorphism theorems, which describe some fundamental natural isomorphisms, and some other basic results on <b>Noetherian</b> and Artinian modules.|$|E
5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in <b>Noetherian</b> induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of <b>Noetherian</b> induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E
5|$|Noether's paper, Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains, 1921), is the {{foundation}} of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a commutative ring. Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals, every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician Claude Chevalley coined the term, <b>Noetherian</b> ring, to describe this property. A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the Lasker–Noether theorem, which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all <b>Noetherian</b> rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and that this decomposition is unique.|$|E
25|$|Homomorphic {{images and}} subgroups of <b>Noetherian</b> groups are <b>Noetherian,</b> and an {{extension}} of a <b>Noetherian</b> group by a <b>Noetherian</b> group is <b>Noetherian.</b> Analogous results hold for Artinian groups.|$|E
25|$|Theorem. If R is a left (resp. right) <b>Noetherian</b> ring, {{then the}} {{polynomial}} ring R {{is also a}} left (resp. right) <b>Noetherian</b> ring.|$|E
25|$|Any non-noetherian ring R is {{the union}} of its <b>Noetherian</b> subrings. This fact, known as <b>Noetherian</b> approximation, allows to extend certain theorems to non-Noetherian rings.|$|E
25|$|The {{converse}} {{is true for}} {{finitely generated}} modules over <b>Noetherian</b> rings: a finitely generated module over a commutative <b>noetherian</b> ring is locally free {{if and only if}} it is projective.|$|E
25|$|A {{group can}} be <b>Noetherian</b> but not Artinian, {{such as the}} {{infinite}} cyclic group, and unlike for rings, a group can be Artinian but not <b>Noetherian,</b> such as the Prüfer group.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} a <b>Noetherian</b> ring is of {{fundamental}} importance in both commutative and noncommutative ring theory, due to the role it plays in simplifying the ideal structure of a ring. For instance, the ring of integers and the polynomial ring over a field are both <b>Noetherian</b> rings, and consequently, such theorems as the Lasker–Noether theorem, the Krull intersection theorem, and the Hilbert's basis theorem hold for them. Furthermore, if a ring is <b>Noetherian,</b> then it satisfies the descending chain condition on prime ideals. This property suggests a deep theory of dimension for <b>Noetherian</b> rings beginning {{with the notion of}} the Krull dimension.|$|E
25|$|Rings {{are often}} studied with special {{conditions}} set upon their ideals. For example, a ring {{in which there}} is no strictly increasing infinite chain of left ideals is called a left <b>Noetherian</b> ring. A ring {{in which there is}} no strictly decreasing infinite chain of left ideals is called a left Artinian ring. It is a somewhat surprising fact that a left Artinian ring is left <b>Noetherian</b> (the Hopkins–Levitzki theorem). The integers, however, form a <b>Noetherian</b> ring which is not Artinian.|$|E
25|$|More generally, a {{commutative}} ring {{is called}} Cohen–Macaulay {{if it is}} <b>Noetherian</b> {{and all of its}} localizations at prime ideals are Cohen–Macaulay. In geometric terms, a scheme is called Cohen–Macaulay if it is locally <b>Noetherian</b> and its local ring at every point is Cohen–Macaulay.|$|E
25|$|<b>Noetherian</b> {{rings of}} the {{following}} types are Cohen–Macaulay.|$|E
25|$|Every finite {{group is}} clearly <b>Noetherian</b> and Artinian.|$|E
25|$|The Krull {{dimension}} of a module over a possibly non-commutative ring {{is defined as}} the deviation of the poset of submodules ordered by inclusion. For commutative <b>Noetherian</b> rings, this {{is the same as the}} definition using chains of prime ideals. The two definitions can be different for commutative rings which are not <b>Noetherian.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{group that}} {{satisfies}} the ascending chain condition on subgroups {{is called a}} <b>Noetherian</b> group, and a group that satisfies the descending chain condition is called an Artinian group (not {{to be confused with}} Artin group), by analogy with <b>Noetherian</b> rings and Artinian rings. The ACC is equivalent to the maximal condition: every non-empty collection of subgroups has a maximal member, and the DCC is equivalent to the analogous minimal condition.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{decomposition}} generalizes to {{finitely generated}} modules over commutative <b>Noetherian</b> rings, and {{this result is}} called the Lasker–Noether theorem.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} other ways {{that have been}} used to define the {{dimension}} of a ring. Most of them coincide with the Krull dimension for <b>Noetherian</b> rings, but can differ for non-Noetherian rings.|$|E
25|$|Before about 1960 many authors {{required}} that a local ring be (left and right) <b>Noetherian,</b> and (possibly non-Noetherian) local rings were called quasi-local rings. In this article this requirement is not imposed.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it is true}} {{that for}} finitely {{presented}} modules M over a commutative ring R (in particular if M is a finitely generated R-module and R is <b>noetherian),</b> the following are equivalent.|$|E
