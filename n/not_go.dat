The following day, Indiana representative W. McKee Dunn introduced a resolution to expel Burnett from Congress. The resolution passed easily, removing Burnett from the seat he had occupied continuously since 1855.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the public}} performance, L'Estrange {{undertook}} the crossing for a select audience including members of the press. That crossing was a success, and was well reviewed in the papers, no doubt adding to the crowd's anticipation for the Saturday show. Sadly, bad weather postponed the performance, which did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> ahead until 14 April.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{succession}} to the estates did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> undisputed, however. A protracted {{battle over}} {{parts of the}} inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp's first marriage. The dispute centred on land, not on the Warwick title, as Henry's half-sisters {{were excluded from the}} succession.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{across the}} Carpathians {{was stopped by}} {{the invasion of the}} Mongols that lasted from March 31, 1241 to April, 1242.

5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that this bridge was used by George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under construction and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull helping their horses across. The bridge also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State authorities would <b>not</b> <b>go</b> through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could <b>not</b> <b>go</b> to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E

5|$|At times, some ox cart trains did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> {{all the way}} through, {{but were}} {{supplemented}} by river craft. First flatboats and then shallow-draft steamboats ascended the Minnesota River to Traverse des Sioux and upstream points, where they were met by cart brigades travelling the West Plains Trail. In 1851, weekly steamboat service on the Mississippi began between Saint Anthony Falls and Sauk Rapids on the Middle and Woods trails. In 1859, steamboat machinery was carried overland to the Red River where a boat was built, but service was intermittent. The Dakota War of 1862 and the American Civil War delayed further improvements.|$|E
