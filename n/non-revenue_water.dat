5|$|The average {{level of}} <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> (physical and {{economic}} losses) in Colombia in 2006 {{is estimated to}} be 49%. This level is higher than the Latin American average (approximately 40%) and the regulatory goal of 30%. In the past, the national average of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> was estimated 40% in 2001, which is almost the same as in 1990. In the largest cities of the country, levels of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> are below the national average (40% in Bogotá, 35% in Medellín and 39% in Cali).|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-revenue</b> <b>water.</b> The average {{level of}} <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> among the 20 {{regional}} water utilities was 45% {{in fiscal year}} 2006-2007. Data reported by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation in 2009 show that <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> in urban areas varies between 55% in Dar es Salaam and 25% in Tanga. It is estimated that <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> is higher in small and district towns.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimation}} of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> is difficult, since only 25% of consumers were metered in 2007. Nevertheless, GWI tentatively estimates <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> {{at more than}} 70%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> <b>Non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> (NRW) - {{consisting}} mainly leakage {{losses in}} the distribution network - are estimated by the Chinese Waterworks Association to be only 20% on average and less than 10% for the best utilities, which is very low by international standards. The International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities estimated the <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> for a sample of Chinese water utilities at 27% in 2006 and 21% in 2001.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> ("water losses") in Chilean water {{companies}} was {{on average}} 34% in 2006, {{an unusually high}} level for a sector that is so modern in so many other aspects. The level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> is thus still higher than in Germany, France or the United Kingdom. (see e.g. water losses in Germany). Indeed, <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> in Chile increased from 29% in 1999 to the current 34%. The regulator considers a level of 15% efficient.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{the level}} of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> was {{estimated}} to be 32% in Sana'a, 33% in Aden, 22% in Taiz and 35% in Mukalla. This is an improvement compared to previous levels. In 2001 <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> {{was estimated to be}} around 50 percent. According to the joint annual review of the water and sanitation sector for 2007, average <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> was down to 28%. In Sana'a <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> had declined from about 50% in 1999 to an estimated 38% in 2007. In 2007, among the larger utilities the lowest level was achieved in Ibb with 20% and the highest in Hodeidah with 43%. The authors of the report caution that the data quality may be poor.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{national}} urban water benchmarking system {{set up by the}} Viet Nam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA) with the support for the Asian Development Bank, <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> is reported by provincial water companies as having been reduced from 39% in 2000 to around 30% in 2009 on average. However, VWSA itself questions the reliability of these figures. In some cities, <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> is as high as 75%. The government says it wants to reduce <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> to 25% by 2015 and 15% by 2025.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-revenue</b> <b>water.</b> According to {{the results}} of a Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) Program carried out by the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) in 2006 in 28 cities, the average level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> (NRW) was 44 percent. Another study of 20 cities by the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission {{with the support of the}} Asian Development Bank showed an average level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> (NRW) of 32%. However, 5 out of the 20 cities did not provide any data. For those that {{provided}} data there probably is a large margin of error, since only 25% of connections are metered, which makes it very difficult to estimate <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water.</b> Also, three utilities in the sample show NRW levels of less than 20%, two of which have practically no metering, which indicates that the numbers are not reliable and actual values are likely to be higher. In Delhi, which was not included in the ADB study, <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> stood at 53% and there were about 20 employees per 1000 connections. Furthermore, only 70% of revenue billed was actually collected.|$|E
25|$|The {{share of}} <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> in Egypt was {{estimated}} at 32% in 2012/13., slightly lower than the level of 34% in 2005 and {{much lower than the}} level of 40-50% estimated for the 1990s. The good practice benchmark in the region is in Tunisia where the level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> is 18%.|$|E
25|$|Two common {{indicators}} of the efficiency of utilities are <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> and labor productivity.|$|E
25|$|The rate of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> is {{the lowest}} in the region at 21% in 2012.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007 the {{government}} approved a Turnaround Plan for GWI, focusing on reducing <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> and financially consolidating the utility.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2002 {{study by}} the Association of French Departments, <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> was {{actually}} slightly higher and stood at 28%.|$|E
25|$|Another {{indicator}} is {{the share}} of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> (water that is lost or not metered). In an efficiently managed system, this amount is below 25%. In 2005 it {{was estimated to be}} 20% in Senegal, 18% in Burkina Faso, 16% for the Water Utility Corporation in Botswana, 14% in Windhoek in Namibia and 12% in Drakenstein, South Africa. These utilities have achieved levels of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> similar to levels in OECD countries. However, in other African countries the level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> is extremely high: For example, it exceeds 45% in Zambia, is more than 60% in Maputo (Water supply and sanitation in Mozambique|Mozambique), 75% in Lindi (Water supply and sanitation in Tanzania|Tanzania) and 80% in Kaduna (Nigeria). Few data are available for efficiency in the rural space.|$|E
25|$|Concerning <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water,</b> {{the average}} of Latin American {{utilities}} in the sample considered is 40% and thus much higher than estimates of efficient levels, which vary between 15 and 25%. The highest level (73%) is registered by Interagua, the utility serving Guayaquil in Ecuador. The lowest level of any larger utility with a high share of household metering, which is a precondition to accurately measure <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water,</b> is registered in Aguas Cordillera in Chile with 20%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-revenue</b> <b>water.</b> On average, 42% of the {{supplied}} {{water in}} Kenya was not billed in 2013–2014, e.g. due to leakage or water theft. Only one Water Services Providers (Nyeri) met the benchmark {{set by the}} Ministry of Water and Irrigation with levels of NRW of less than 20%. In Nairobi NRW levels were 39%, in Mombasa 48%. Based on the unit cost of production, the nationwide losses due to <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> in 2014 were estimated at 5.2 billion KSh, equivalent to US$52 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{operational}} efficiency {{of water and}} sanitation services is typically measured through the level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> and the ratio of staff per 1,000 connections.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{low level}} of {{metering}} it is difficult to estimate the level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> in Saudi Arabia. Only in the case of Riyadh, where meters exist, a meaningful estimate has been done, resulting in an estimated 34% of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water.</b> It is broken down into 21% physical losses and 13% commercial losses from undermetering, illegal connections and authorized unbilled consumption such as for mosques. In addition, 24% of billed consumption is not being paid. The overall level is high by international standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> was {{estimated}} at about 48% in 2010. It {{was estimated to be}} highest in the South (52%) and lowests in Beirut-Mount Lebanon (40%). This is high by international standards, but similar to the levels in Syria, Jordan and Turkey. Since there is little metering, it is difficult to estimate the level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water.</b> The share of metered connections {{was estimated at}} 16% in the Beirut-Mount Lebanon governorates in 2010, and was lower in other governorates. Most industrial and commercial water users were metered, while few residential users are metered.|$|E
25|$|One {{indicator}} {{to measure}} the technical efficiency of water utilities {{is the level of}} <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water.</b> In a well-managed utility that level should be below about 25%. In Johannesburg, the estimated level declined from 44% in 2003 to 31% in 2006. In Durban it stood at an estimated average of 31% between 2002 and 2006. In Cape Town the estimates fluctuated significantly between 10% and 37%, suggesting that the estimates may not be reliable. The average level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> for South African utilities participating in the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities in the 2002-2006 period was 31%.|$|E
25|$|The UN Special Rapporteur on {{the human}} right to safe {{drinking}} water and sanitation called in a 2014 report on donors to prioritize their cooperation in tackling <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> through small scale, effective interventions.|$|E
25|$|Concerning ONEA, at 18% <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> {{is one of}} {{the lowest}} in Sub-Saharan Africa. Labor {{productivity}} is average with 4.3 employees per 1,000 connections, calculated based on 775 employees and 182,000 connections in 2010.|$|E
25|$|There {{are only}} limited {{data on the}} {{operating}} efficiency of utilities in India, and even fewer data on the efficiency of investments. Two indicators of operating efficiency are <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> and labour productivity.|$|E
25|$|Severn Trent was {{expected}} to reduce the levels of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> to 25% {{by the end of}} 2005, but according to the audit report this target was not achieved and stood at 66.5% at the end of 2005.|$|E
25|$|In Amman, {{the level}} of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> has been reduced from an {{estimated}} 46% in 2005 to an estimated 34% in 2010. However, {{during the same period}} the average hours of service per week declined from 66 to 36.|$|E
25|$|Access {{and service}} quality {{improved}} substantially between 1995 and 2006. Water supply is now continuous, monthly billing has increased 25-fold in nominal terms, water production {{has more than}} doubled and <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> has been reduced from an estimated 40% to 25%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-revenue</b> <b>water,</b> {{which is}} the {{difference}} between produced and invoiced water is also difficult to guess, given low measuring levels in Ecuador. However, at the end of 2001 it was estimated at 65%, one of the highest levels in Latin America.|$|E
25|$|Water losses {{have been}} reduced, but much slower than {{foreseen}} in the concession contracts. In the eastern half, they have increased again between 2003 and 2007. According to Palyja, in its western {{half of the}} concession <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> declined from 57 percent in 1998 to 47 percent in 2007 and 37 percent in 2012. According to data from the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> in the eastern half declined from 58 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 2003, but then increased again to 52 percent. This compares unfavorably with the 2007 target of 34 percent. Water losses include illegal connections, {{some of which are}} used by the poor to serve their basic needs.|$|E
25|$|The study {{states that}} its {{methodology}} allows for an accurate comparison, including water used to flush pipes and for firefighting. This {{is consistent with}} the International Water Association's definition of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water,</b> which includes authorized non-metered consumption such as for flushing and firefighting.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} indicators for utility efficiency. In the case of China, some indicators, such as labor productivity, suggest {{a low level of}} operational efficiency, while other indicators - such as <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> - suggest a high level of operational efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Some common {{indicators}} of the economic efficiency of water and sewerage utilities are billing efficiency, the level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> and labour productivity. On {{the basis of these}} indicators the economic efficiency of urban service provision in the water sector in Tanzania is low.|$|E
25|$|One {{explanation}} for the relatively low level of NRW may be that most Chinese live in dense apartment complexes, which results in compact distribution systems. In some smaller cities, <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> remains relatively high. For example, average non revenue water in small towns in Henan province is 38%.|$|E
25|$|The US {{provides}} a US$66.3 million grant {{to finance the}} expansion of the Lower Ruvu Plant that supplies Dar es Salaam with water from 180,000 to 270,000 cubic meter per day, as well as to reduce <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> and to rehabilitate two treatment plants in Morogoro next to Dar es Salaam.|$|E
25|$|Although {{urban water}} tariffs are high by {{regional}} standards (60 KSh or US$0.60 per m3 on average in 2014), these tariffs only allow {{the recovery of}} operating costs, but not the recovery of capital costs. Full cost recovery is not achieved due to various reasons, including {{a high level of}} <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> (average of 42%). Based on the unit cost of production, the nationwide losses due to <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water</b> in 2014 were estimated at 5.2 billion KSh, equivalent to US$52 million. Another reason is the need to tap distant water sources at a high cost in some locations. For example, Mombasa is supplied from a source located 220km from the city. Although 16% of Kenyans in urban areas have access to sewerage, there is no sewerage levy in Kenya, making this expensive service essentially free of charge.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} performance of Kenyan Water Service Providers is closely monitored by WASREB and made {{available in the}} Impact Report to encourage competition and spread best practices. Important indicators of economic efficiency are: collection rates, the level of <b>non-revenue</b> <b>water,</b> metering ratios and labour productivity. Most Kenyan Water Service Providers {{do not meet the}} benchmarks in these dimensions.|$|E
