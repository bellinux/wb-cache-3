5|$|When the National Party {{was formed}} in 1936 from the merger of Reform and the United Party, {{publicity}} {{was one of the}} major considerations. The party's provisional council established a sub-committee consisting of Henry Livingstone, Frederick Doidge, and Waite.

5|$|Despite the new {{leadership}} in the city, there were still conservative strongholds.
