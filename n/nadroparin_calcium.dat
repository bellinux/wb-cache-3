40|$|Purpose: To date, no {{systemic}} intervention {{has been}} demonstrated to favorably affect {{the natural history of}} retinal vein occlusion (RVO). The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> in the treatment of RVO. Methods: 13 patients with acute RVO (i. d. within a week of onset) were treated with subcutaneous injections of <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> for 2 months. The same dose used for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (200 UI/kg/die) was given. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the affected eye was measured at baseline and after 3 months. In addition, macular thickness was measured by Stratus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, USA) at baseline and after 3 months. Results: Mean visual acuity was 0. 39 ± 0. 33 at baseline and 0. 70 ± 0. 32 after 3 months; differences were statistically significant (P= 0. 024). Macular thickness was measured in 8 patients; mean thickness was 510 ± 239 μm at baseline and 331 ± 190 μm after 3 months; differences were not statistically significant (P= 0. 12). After 3 months, fluorescein angiography disclosed no signs of retinal ischemia in all cases. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggest that subcutaneous <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> may be effective in the treatment of RVO. Larger long-term studies are warranted to confirm this results...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Low-molecular-weight heparins {{may have}} a higher benefit to risk ratio than unfractionated heparin in {{preventing}} perioperative thrombosis. The antithrombotic effects of low-molecular-weight heparins, given as adjunctive therapy to alteplase and aspirin, have not previously been {{compared with those of}} unfractionated heparin in experimental models of coronary artery thrombosis. METHODS: Occlusive coronary thrombosis was induced in 5 groups of 10 dogs by placing a copper coil into the left anterior descending coronary artery. After 1 h of occlusion, intravenous alteplase (0. 1 mg/kg bolus followed by 0. 01 mg/kg/min for 30 min), and aspirin (bolus of 5 mg/kg) were administered in combination with one of the following study treatments given intravenously for 2 h: placebo (group 1); unfractionated heparin (200 IU/kg bolus followed by 100 IU/kg/h, group II); the low-molecular weight heparin, <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium,</b> in three different doses (100 IU/kg bolus followed by 50 IU/kg/h, group III; 200 IU/kg bolus followed by 100 IU/kg/h, group IV; and 300 IU/kg followed by 150 IU/kg/h, group V). Coronary patency was assessed with angiography at 10 min intervals and hemostasis parameters were measured at baseline, after 1 h of occlusion, and 30 and 120 min after commencing drug administration. RESULTS: Optimal reperfusion [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 without reocclusion] was more frequently observed in groups II (6 / 10), IV (8 / 10) and V (9 / 10) than in groups I (1 / 10) and III (3 / 10) (P < 0. 05). Groups II and IV had similar patency rates (P = NS) and were therefore assumed to represent equivalent antithrombotic doses. Both <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> and unfractionated heparin effectively prevented new thrombin generation as shown by repeated measurements of thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels in plasma. At equivalent antithrombotic doses, <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> (group IV) was associated with significantly lower steady state values than standard heparin (group II) for activated partial thromboplastin time (41. 3 +/- 48. 9 versus 134. 7 +/- 61. 6 s), anti-Xa levels (2. 4 +/- 0. 5 vs 3. 4 +/- 0. 9 U/ml) and anti-IIa levels (0. 8 +/- 0. 1 versus 2. 1 +/- 0. 7 U/ml). CONCLUSION: Both <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> and unfractionated heparin significantly enhance alteplase-induced thrombolysis in aspirin-treated dogs. At equivalent antithrombotic doses, <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> was associated with less prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time and lower steady-state anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of danhong {{injection}} combined with <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> on serum CyS-C, CRP, IL- 6, vWF, ET and VEGF in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Methods: A total of 80 patients with acute coronary syndrome in our hospital from July 2014 to July 2017 were enrolled in this study. The subjects were divided into the control group (n= 40) and the treatment group (n= 40) randomly. The control group was treated with xuesaitong injection combined with nadroparin calcium; the treatment group was treated with danhong injection combined with <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium.</b> The two groups were treated for 2 weeks. The serum CyS-C, CRP, IL- 6, vWF, ET and VEGF levels {{of the two groups}} before and after treatment were compared.

40|$|Subcutis calcinosis, {{characterized}} by abnormal calcium deposits in the skin, {{is a rare}} complication of using calcium-containing heparin occurring in patients with advanced renal failure. We report {{the case of an}} 83 -year-old female, a known case of chronic kidney disease (CKD) for four years with recent worsening of renal failure requiring hospitalization and hemodialysis. She developed subcutis calcinosis following injection of calcium-containing heparin. Biochemical tests showed serum parathormone level at 400 pg/dL, hypercalcemia, elevated calcium-phosphate product and monoclonal gammopathy related to multiple myeloma. She developed firm subcu-taneous nodules in the abdomen and the thighs, the injection sites of Calciparin ® (<b>calcium</b> <b>nadroparin)</b> that was given as a preventive measure against deep vein thrombosis. The diagnosis of subcutis calcinosis was confirmed by the histological examination showing calcium deposit in the dermis and hypodermis. These lesions completely disappeared after discontinuing calcium nadro-parin injections. Subcutis calcinosis caused by injections of calcium-containing heparin is rare, and, to the best our knowledge, not more than 12 cases {{have been reported in the}} literature. Pathogenesis is not well established but is attributed to the calcium disorders usually seen in advanced renal failure. Diagnosis is confirmed by histological tests. Outcome is mostly favorable. The main differential diagnosis is calciphylaxis, which has a poor prognosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) enhances {{cytotoxicity}} of paclitaxel (PTX) and cisplatin (CDDP) {{in human}} ovarian cancer cells. Because of potential pitfalls of HGF exogenous administration, we investigated whether HGF serum concentration might be alternatively raised in vivo by administering {{low molecular weight}} heparin (LMWH). Methods The main HGF pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated following acute and chronic LMWH treatment. First, women, operated on for gynaecological tumors, were treated with a single dose of <b>calcium</b> <b>nadroparin</b> and studied for 12 [*]hours. Next, women operated on for benign or malignant gynaecological tumors were treated daily with calcic nadroparin for one month. Subsequently, the biological activity of the measured HGF serum levels was tested in assays of ovarian cancer cell sensitization to drugs. Results In the short-term treated group, median HGF AUC ss, C max and C average were about four-fold that of the control group, whereas C min was three-fold. In the patients treated chronically median HGF serum levels rose about six-fold in the first week, and decreased but remained significantly higher after one month. The pharmacokinetic of nadroparin-dependent HGF increase were similar in the two groups. The HGF concentrations measured after both acute and chronic treatment {{were found to be}} effective in sensitising ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. Conclusions This study raises the possibility of using LMWH to increase HGF serum concentration and to take advantage of its biological activities. In particular, nadroparin might be used as a chemo-potentiating agent in epithelial cell ovarian carcinoma through its action on HGF serum concentration.

40|$|Purpose. Branch retinal artery {{obstruction}} with simultaneous central retinal vein occlusion (BRAO/CRVO) {{is a rare}} condition. We describe 3 {{cases of}} BRAO/CRVO successfully treated with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) and subcutaneous <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium.</b> Methods. The first patient, a 42 -year-old man, developed sudden visual loss (hand-motion) in his left eye one day after tonsillectomy. The second patient, a 60 -year-old man with hypercholesterolemia, complained of sudden visual loss (finger counting) in his left eye upon arising. The third patient, an apparently healthy 39 -year-old bricklayer, noted an acute decrease in his left vision (20 / 70) while working. In all patients, fundus evaluation and fluorescein angiography revealed BRAO/CRVO. Results. All patients were treated with HBO at 2. 5 atmospheres (15 - 20 sessions) and subcutaneous <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> (200 UI/Kg/die) for 6 weeks. Two months later, there was complete resolution of the clinical signs of BRAO/CRVO and left visual acuity was 20 / 25 in patient 1, 20 / 32 in patient 2, and 20 / 20 in patient 3. Patient 2 had an improvement in the left visual field, {{but there was still}} a discrete cecocentral scotoma. Conclusion. In these 3 patients with BRAO/CRVO, vision returned to near normal after prompt treatment with HBO and subcutaneous <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium.</b> We have to acknowledge that the effect of our intervention cannot be determined from 3 cases and no control. Nevertheless, a comparison between our results and those reported in similar cases seem to suggest that this therapy may be beneficial in the management of BRAO/CRVO. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Little {{is known}} about the {{incidence}} and causes of heparin-induced skin lesions. The most commonly reported causes are delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. We describe 3 patients who were referred to our staff between March and October 2009 for suspected heparin allergies. All were scheduled to undergo major surgery (cardiovascular or orthopedic). Materials and methods: All 3 patients reported the development of itchy, erythematous rashes {{a few days after the}} subcutaneous administration of heparin (<b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> in cases 1 and 2, unspecified in case 3). Each of them underwent a diagnostic work-up for heparin allergy, which included prick and intradermal tests with commonly used heparins and patch testing with undiluted heparins and disinfectants. Results: Patch tests with disinfectants were negative in all 3 cases. In case 2, all allergological tests were negative. In cases 1 and 3, delayed positivity emerged for <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> and at least one other heparin tested. Intravenous and/or subcutaneous provocation testing was done with an alternative heparin which produced negative results in skin tests (heparin sodium in case 1, pentasaccharide fondaparinux in case 3). In both cases the alternative drug was tolerated. After our evaluation, all 3 patients underwent surgery with no heparin-related complications. Discussion: The presenting clinical features in these 3 cases provided no information on which reactions were likely to be allergic: all 3 patients presented with similar local delayed reaction.

40|$|Low-molecular-weight heparins are {{routinely}} administered {{once or twice}} daily by subcutaneous injection. With the exception of patients on haemodialysis or presenting with unstable angina or flat Q-wave myocardial infarction, in which short-term intravascular administration is recommended, little information is available regarding the efficacy of continuous intravenous administration of low-molecular-weight heparins. We report {{the case of a}} 50 -year-old patient who underwent an allogenic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukaemia. Prior to transplantation, the patient was on long-term oral anticoagulant (acenocoumarol) following the placement of a mechanical aortic valve.

40|$|The optimal {{regime of}} {{antithrombotic}} prophylaxis for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) {{has not been}} established. Many surgeons employ intermittent pneumatic compression while others use low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) which were primarily developed for total hip arthroplasty. We compared the efficacy and safety of these two techniques in a randomised study with blinded assessment of the endpoint by phlebography. We randomised 130 patients, scheduled for elective TKA, to receive one daily subcutaneous injection of <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> (dosage adapted to body-weight) or continuous intermittent pneumatic compression of the foot {{by means of the}} arteriovenous impulse system. A total of 108 patients (60 in the LMWH group and 48 in the mechanical prophylaxis group) had phlebography eight to 12 days after surgery.

40|$|Aim: To study an {{influence}} of the different variants of thromboprophylaxis on activation of blood coagulation test on the background of surgical aggression. D-dimer concentration in serum is {{in direct proportion to}} fibrinolysis activity and to an amount of lysed fibrin. At the same time fibrinolysis activation is followed with an increase of formation of products of fibrin degradation (PFD) that interact with fibrin-monomers and increase the number of SFMC. Materials and methods : After informed consent 200 patients were prospectively divided into groups depending on preparation and regimen of thromboprophylaxis. 1 group (n= 30) – ungraded heparin (UGH) (5000 ОD) for 2 hours before surgery 2 times during 7 days after it. 2 group(n= 30) nadraparin calcium 9500 anti-Ха МO (0, 3 ml) for 2 hours before surgery 2500 МО 1 time for a day 7 days after surgery; 3 group(n= 48) – endoxaparin sodium(0, 2 ml) for 2 hours before surgery 1 time a day 7 days; 4 group(n= 29) endoxaparin sodium(0, 2 ml) for 8 hours before surgery, 0, 2 ml 1 time a day 7 days; 5 group(n= 34) – bemiparin sodium(0, 2 ml) for 2 hours before surgery 0, 2 ml 1 time a day 7 days; 6 group(n= 29) bemiparin sodium(0, 2 ml) in 6 hours after surgery 1 time a day 7 days. Patients were comparable on sex, concomitant pathology, class АSA (1 - 2) and type of surgical intervention. There were studied the number of thrombocytes, prothrombin time (PT), INR AFTT, fibrinogen, Х-а factor activity, antithrombin, 111 (AT 111), protein C, SFMC, d-dimer before surgery, on 1, 5 and 7 day after it. Results and discussions : On the 1 day of postsurgical period the most influence on D-dimer level had presurgical thromboprophylaxis (TPP) with UGH and <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium.</b> So the D-dimer level exceeded norm respectively by 67 % (р= 0, 017) and 65, 9 % (р< 0, 05). In patients of 3 and 4 groups D-dimer level was the lowest that formed deficiency by 56 % (р< 0, 05) and 52, 7 % (р< 0, 05) from the norm respectively. At the same time an analysis of patients with pre- and postsurgical start of TPP with bemiparin sodium detected the reliable exceed of D-dimer norm by 58 % (< 0, 05) for 5 group, by 24, 3 % (р< 0, 05) – for 6 group. At the same time it was lower than D-dimer level of patients with TPP UGH by 5, 3 % (< 0, 05) for 5 group and by 15 % (р< 0, 05) - for 6 group. The compensatory increase of SFMC level by- turn indicated an activity of thrombin in patients of 5 and 6 groups. SFMC level on 1 day after surgery in patients with TPP UGH exceeded SFMC level in patients of 5 and 6 groups, by 2, 3 % (р< 0, 05) for 5 group, by 9, 6 % (< 0, 05) – for 6 group. On the background of presurgical start of TPP with <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> and 8 -hour start of TPPH with endoxaparin sodium there was detected no reliable differences in SFMC level. At the same time on the background of presurgical 2 -hour start of TPP with endoxaparin sodium SFMC exceeded norm by 9, 2 % (< 0, 05), that was lower than TPP UGH by 12, 8 % (< 0, 05) and exceeded TPP with <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> by 13, 8 % (р< 0, 05). On 5 day D-dimer level in patients of 1 group was the highest and exceeded norm by 142, 9 % (р< 0, 05). In 2 group it reliably exceeded norm by 117, 6 % (р< 0, 05), that hadn’t reliable differences from 5 group (HPP with bemiparin sodium started for 2 hours before surgery). D-dimer indicators in 3 and 4 groups were equal, lower than norm by 42, 9 % (р< 0, 05). SFMC level at TPP with bemiparin sodium exceeded norm by 52 % (р= 0, 013) and 47, 7 % (р< 0, 05) regardless of start without reliable difference between groups. In patients with TPP UGH SFMC indicators were not differ from the previous ones exceeding norm by 25 % (р= 0, 009) and decreasing from indicators of 4 group by 21, 6 % (р< 0, 05). SFMC level in 3 and 4 groups had not reliable difference exceeding norm by 10 % (р= 0, 021). On 7 day of observance at TPH with bemiparin sodium with postsurgical start SFMC indicators were the highest that indicated the conservation of sufficient fibrinolytic activity at the given type of TPH. In patients of 1 group the SFMC level exceeded norm by 24, 4 % (р< 0, 05), 3 and 5 groups by 9, 7 % (р< 0, 05) and 14 % (р< 0, 05). Conclusions: At presurgical start of TPP UGH hemostasiological balance increased risks of development of thromboembolic complications (TEC) and bleeding from the 1 day of postsurgical period. Presurgical TPP UGH doesn’t eliminate the threat of TEC to the 5 day of postsurgical period. TPP with <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> with presurgical start provide the normalization of hemostasiological balance already on the 1 day after surgery that minimizes the risks of thrombosis and bleedings. Presurgical start of TPP with endoxaparin sorium regardless of the beginning of injection of preparation increases risks of development of hemorrhagic complications in postsurgical period. TPP with bemiparin sodium at both pre- and postsurgical starts provide balance between formation and lysis of the clot that minimizes the risk of development of bleedings or TEC to 7 day of postsurgical period</p...|$|E

We compared the efficacy and safety of these two techniques in a randomised study with blinded assessment of the endpoint by phlebography. We randomised 130 patients, scheduled for elective TKA, to receive one daily subcutaneous injection of <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> (dosage adapted to body-weight) or continuous intermittent pneumatic compression of the foot {{by means of the}} arteriovenous impulse system. A total of 108 patients (60 in the LMWH group and 48 in the mechanical prophylaxis group) had phlebography eight to 12 days after surgery.

Aim of research was to study an impact of presurgical start of thromboprophylaxis with nadrapirin calcium on hemodynamics, hemostasis and inflammation at the elective abdominal surgeries. Matherials and methods. After informed consent 60 patients were prospectively separated into groups depending of preparation and regimen of thromboprophylaxis. The 1 group (n = 30) used UFH (5000 OD) for 2 hours before surgery on 5000 OD 2 times during 7 days after it. The 2 group (n = 30) used nadroparin calcium(«Fraxiparin») 9500 aXA IU(0, 3 ml) for 2 hours before surgery on 2500 IU 1 time a day during 7 days after surgery. Patients were united on sex, age, contaminant pathology, class АSA (1 - 2) and type of surgical procedure (laparoscopic, cholecystectomy, hernioplasty). There were studied the number of trombocitises, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastic time (APTT), fibrinogen, Х-а factor activity, antithrombin 111, prothein C, soluble fibrin monomeric complexes (SFMC) D-dimer before surgery and in 1 and 5 days after it. Results and discussion: Administration of <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> for 2 hours before surgery prolongs the time of clot formation from the first to fifth day {{at the expense of}} inhibition of the external way of coagulation. The risk of thrombotic complications decreases at administration of nadraparin calcium for 2 hours because of normalization of the level of protein C. At the same time the lysis of fibrin clots was accelerated on the background of nadraparin calcium. At comparative characteristics we detected that an analysis of hemodynamic state at the standard thromboprophylaxis with UFH with output relatively normodynamic type of blood circulation that was formed by power-consuming, isometric, rhythm-depending mechanism was changed to relatively hyperdynamic type that was formed by homeometric, rhythm-depending and energo-exhausting mechanism at the 1 day of postsurgical period. At the 5 day of postsurgical period it was already of hypodynamic type that was formed by energo-consuming isometric mechanism. At the same time an output hypercoagulation and activation of fibrinolysis at the 1 day of postsurgical period on the background of UFH that was administrated in prophylactic doses was changed to an incomplete inhibition of an external way of blood coagulation, complete inhibition of an internal way of blood coagulation and partial inhibition of the general way of blood coagulation. Together with a stably low level of protein C it increased the risk of the development of thromboembolic complications in spite of hyperfibrinolysis. At the same time the output instability of inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines ratio at the first day of postsurgical period on the background of the standard thromboprophylaxis with UFH detected the prevalence of inflammatory processes over the antiinflammatory ones, this fact was confirmed by spasmodic growth of IL 6. The tendency to decrease of activity of inflammatory processeses on the background of the growth of antiinflammatory ones was formed at the 5 day of postsurgical period. An analysis of hemodynamic state at thromboprophylaxis with nadraparin calcium demonstrated that an output relatively normodynamic type of blood circulation that was formed by the energo-consuming isometric rhythm-depending mechanism at the first day after surgery was changed to normodynamic one with energo-exhausting homeometric mechanism and remained in this state until the 5 day of postsurgical period but with the mixed hetero-homeometric mechanism of compensation. Presurgical hypercoagulation on the background of activation of fibrinolysis system at the 1 day after operation was chaged to an inhibition of vascular platelet link of homeostasis, normalization of external and internal ways of of coagulation, tendency to normalization of the system of endogenic anticoagulants. An increase of fibrinogen level indicates not only an unsufficient blocking of the general way of coagulation but also the growth of inflammatory processes under influence of surgical trauma. At the 5 day after operation on the background of administration of prophylactic doses of <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> the pathologic activation of the vascular platelet link of homeostasis, external and internal ways of blood coagulation, system of endogenic anticoagulants remained absent. At the same time in spite of significant activation of fibrinolysis the content of products of fibrin and fibrinogen degradation in the blood of patients remained high that formed conditions for development of thrombotic complications and an increased fibrinogen level can be explained by its direct correlative connections with an inflammatory IL 10. Conclusions: So <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> before the surgical procedure ensure the reliable prolongation of the time of forming clot and acceleration of the lysis of fibrin clots, illiminates the risk of development of hemorrhagic complications and thrombotic complications until the 5 day that demonstrates an advantage of the use of an optimal regimen of thromboprophylaxis.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—The Fraxiparin in Stroke Study for the {{treatment}} of ischemic stroke (FISS-tris) study showed no superiority of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) over aspirin for the primary end point (Barthel Index) in acute ischemic stroke due to large artery occlusive disease. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of LMWH and aspirin in selected subgroups so as to generate hypotheses for further studies. Methods—The FISS-tris study was a multicenter, randomized trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of LMWH (<b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> 3800 antifactor Xa IU/ 0. 4 mL subcutaneously twice daily) or aspirin (160 mg once daily) for {{the treatment}} of patients with acute ischemic stroke and large artery occlusive disease. The primary outcome was the Barthel Index score dichotomized at 85 6 months poststroke. Exploratory subgroup analysis was performed using different levels of baseline characteristics and the distribution of symptomatic arteries. Results—Compared with aspirin, LMWH improved outcome among older patients 68 years (P 0. 043; OR, 1. 86; 95 % CI, 1. 02 – 3. 41) without ongoing antiplatelet treatment on admission (P 0. 029; OR, 1. 85; 95 % CI, 1. 06 – 3. 21) and with symptomatic posterior circulation arterial disease (P 0. 001; OR, 5. 76; 95 % CI, 2. 00 – 16. 56). Conclusions—Our findings suggest that LMWH may be of benefit in certain subgroups of patients with acute cerebral infarct and large artery occlusive disease. Hence, further investigation of LMWH may be justified in subgroups such as the elderly, nonusers of antiplatelet agents, and patients with posterior circulation stenosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Few {{reports have}} {{addressed}} the value of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin in treating {{the full spectrum of}} patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), including recurrent VTE and pulmonary embolism. Methods: In an open, multicenter clinical trial, 720 consecutive patients with acute symptomatic VTE, including 119 noncritically ill patients (16. 5 %) with pulmonary embolism and 102 (14. 2 %) with recurrent VTE, were randomly assigned to treatment with subcutaneous UFH with dose adjusted by activated partial thromboplastin time by means of a weight-based algorithm (preceded by an intravenous loading dose), or fixed-dose (adjusted only to body weight) subcutaneous <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium.</b> Oral anticoagulant therapy was started concomitantly and continued for at least 3 months. We recorded the incidence of major bleeding during the initial heparin treatment and that of recurrent VTE and death during 3 months of follow-up. Results: Fifteen (4. 2 %) of the 360 patients assigned to UFH had recurrent thromboembolic events, as compared with 14 (3. 9 %) of the 360 patients assigned to nadroparin (absolute difference between rates, 0. 3 %; 95 % confidence interval, - 2. 5 % to 3. 1 %). Four patients assigned to UFH (1. 1 %) and 3 patients assigned to nadroparin (0. 8 %) had episodes of major bleeding (absolute difference between rates, 0. 3 %; 95 % confidence interval, - 1. 2 % to 1. 7 %). Overall mortality was 3. 3 % in each group. Conclusions: Subcutaneous UFH with dose adjusted by activated partial thromboplastin time by means of a weight-based algorithm is as effective and safe as fixed-dose nadroparin for the initial treatment of patients with VTE, including those with pulmonary embolism and recurrent VT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{the general}} population, mild renal {{impairment}} {{is associated with}} increases risk for coronary artery disease and stroke, suggesting that cardiovascular disease begins to develop early in {{the natural history of}} renal dysfunction. Patients with renal failure are known to be at increased risk of death following acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure. In such sense, anticoagulation in addition to antiplatelet inhibitor drugs became the standard of care, particularly, among high risk unstable angina patients associated with a scarce side effects. The <b>Nadroparin</b> <b>calcium</b> Versus Enoxaparin (NaVe) Study will evaluate in a head to head basis the anti Xa activity reached by nadroparine or enoxaparine, both low molecular weight heparins, in patients at high risk for ischemic episodes, and renal insufficiency to eventually be undergone to angiographic diagnosis studies, and in consequence proposing the best anticoagulant strategies for these patients before being invasively treated. Patients will be {{randomly assigned to one of}} the two groups: Group 1 : thirty patients will be given with subcutaneous enoxaparine injections into the abdominal wall in a dose of 0, 85 mg/kg every 12 hours for a maximum of 48 hours. A saline infusion dose will be given in between. Total number of injections: 6. Group 2 :Thirty patients will be receiving subcutaneous injections into the abdominal wall in a doses of 30 % less in relationship with his / her body weight every 8 hours for a maximum of 48 hours. In order to achieve the goal of the study, the antiXa activity will be measure using venous blood samples taken as follows: Group 1 :*Within 3 rd and 4 hour of the second doses of HBPM for enoxaparine. *Within 11 th and 12 th hour next to fourth doses of enoxaparine. Group 2 : *Within 3 rd and 4 th hour next to 3 rd doses of HBPM for the nadroparine. *Within 7 th and 8 th hour next to 4 th doses HBPM for the nadroparine. The primary end point is to analyze during the in-hospital stay phase the stability of the anti Xa activity within the therapeutic ranges which will be estimated between 0. 5 to 1. 0 IU during the first 48 hours. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the hypothesis that low molecular weight heparin may lessen the severity of ischemic events in patients with unstable angina. Background. Unstable angina is a thrombotic process that requires intensive medical treatment Although current treatments can reduce the number of complications, serious bleeding continues to occur. <b>Nadroparin</b> <b>calcium,</b> a low molecular weight heparin, seems to be a safe therapeutic agent that does not require laboratory monitoring. Methods. A total of 219 patients with unstable angina entered the study at a mean time of 6. 17 h after the last episode of rest pain. Patients were randomized to receive aspirin (200 mg/day [group A]), aspirin plus regular heparin (400 IU/kg body weight per day intravenously and titered by activated partial thromboplastin time [group B]) and aspirin plus low molecular weight heparin (214 UIC/kg anti-Xa twice daily subcutaneously [group C]). The major end points determined for the in-hospital period were 1) recurrent angina, 2) myocardial infarction, 3) urgent revascularization, 4) major bleeding, and 5) death. Minor end points were 1) silent myocardial ischemia, and 2) minor bleeding. Event rates were tested by chi-square analysis. Results. Recurrent angina occurred in 37 %, 44 % and 21 % of patients in groups A, B and C, respectively, and was significantly less frequent in group C than in either group A (odds ratio 2. 26, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1 to 5. 18, p = 0. 03) or group B (odds ratio 3. 07, 95 % CI 136 to 7. 00, p = 0. 002). Nonfatal myocardial infarction was present in seven patients in group A, four in group B and none in group C (group B vs. A, p = 0. 5; group C vs. A, p = 0. 01). Urgent revascularization was performed in nine patients in group A, seven in group B and one in group C (C vs. A, p = 0. 01). Two episodes of major bleeding occurred in group B. Silent myocardial ischemia was present in 38 %, 41 % and 25 % of patients in groups A, B and C, respectively, and was significantly less frequent in group C than group B (odds ratio 2. 12, 95 % CI 0. 97 to 4. 69, p = 0. 04). Minor bleeding was detected in 10 patients in group B, 1 patient in group C (B vs. C, p = 0. 01) and no patient in group A (A vs. B, p = 0. 003). Conclusions. In this study, treatment with aspirin plus a high dose of low molecular weight heparin during the acute phase of unstable angina was significantly better than treatment with aspirin alone or aspirin plus regular heparin...|$|E
40|$|Citrate {{compared}} to {{low molecular weight}} heparin anticoagulation in chronic hemodialysis patients. Citrate and <b>nadroparin</b> <b>calcium,</b> a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), were compared in a randomized cross-over trial in 21 chronic hemodialysis patients regarding anticoagulation, calcium and magnesium kinetics, biocompatibility, dialysis efficiency, and aluminum contamination. Citrate was infused into the arterial line at a minimum rate of 0. 68 mmol/min, combined with a calcium and magnesium-free dialysate and intravenous supplementation of calcium and magnesium at rates of 0. 22 and 0. 10 mmol/min, respectively. Seven patients with a dialysis session of six hours, received 2 / 3 of the nadroparin dose predialysis, and 1 / 3 after 2. 5 hours (divided dose (DD) group). A single predialysis bolus injection of nadroparin was administered to eight patients not on coumarins] single dose (SD) group] and to six patients on coumarins] single dose + coumarins (SD + C) group], all with a dialysis session of four hours. Nineteen patients received a nadroparin dose of 200 ICU/kg. Two patients with a single dose, one of them on coumarins, received a dose of 150 ICU/kg because of a hematocrit < 0. 30. With citrate systemic whole blood activated clotting time (ACT) remained unchanged, indicating efficient regional anticoagulation. After two hours of dialysis with nadroparin, systemic ACT increments, that is, the increase {{compared to}} predialysis, of the DD, SD, and SD + C groups were 8. 8 ± 1. 5, 18. 7 ± 4. 7, and 33. 3 ± 6. 1 seconds, respectively (mean ± SEM). Postdialysis ACT increments in these groups were 1. 5 ± 3. 4, 17. 7 ± 6. 8, and 30. 3 ± 8. 0 seconds. Two hour increments of systemic {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) of the DD, SD, and SD+C groups during nadroparin were 5. 0 ± 1. 2, 15. 1 ± 2. 7, and 32. 2 ± 5. 5 seconds, respectively, and the corresponding postdialysis APTT increments were 2. 9 ± 1. 4, 7. 8 ± 2. 4, and 15. 8 ± 2. 6 seconds. Two-hour anti-Xa increments of the DD, SD, and SD + C groups amounted to 0. 34 ± 0. 07, 0. 67 ± 0. 07, and 0. 80 ± 0. 08 IU/ml. The respective postdialysis anti-Xa increments were 0. 21 ± 0. 06, 0. 58 ± 0. 06, and 0. 71 ± 0. 08 IU/ml (All ACT, APTT and anti-Xa increments were significant; P < 0. 05), except for the ACT increments and the postdialysis APTT increment of the DD group). These increments, together with unchanged prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PTF 1 + 2), indicate systemic anticoagulation with nadroparin. The increments of serum calcium and magnesium during citrate were comparable to the increments observed with a dialysate containing 1. 5 mmol/liter calcium and 0. 75 mmol/liter magnesium used in combination with nadroparin. Ionized calcium increments during citrate were significant after the end of dialysis, while the dialysate containing 1. 5 mmol/liter calcium induced significant increments during and postdialysis. No differences were observed between citrate and nadroparin regarding biocompatibility (expressed as dialysis-induced leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), and dialysis efficiency [measured as dialyzer urea and creatinine clearance, normalized weekly whole body urea clearance (Kt/Vurea) and time averaged urea concentration (TACurea) ]. The citrate solution, if sterilized in glass bottles, contained 2 to 3 μg aluminum per mmol citrate, the nadroparin solution 0. 009 μg per 1, 000 ICU. Aluminum contamination of the citrate solution was prevented by sterilizing the solution in polypropylene bottles. In conclusion, citrate anticoagulation is regional and is indicated for hemodialysis patients with an active or recently active bleeding focus. However, the citrate solution should be sterilized in polypropylene containers to prevent aluminum contamination. LMWHs induce systemic anticoagulation during hemodialysis, and this effect is enhanced by concomitant coumarin use and mitigated by a divided LMWH dose regimen. For hemodialysis patients not at risk of bleeding, LMWHs provide a simple anticoagulation regimen...|$|E
