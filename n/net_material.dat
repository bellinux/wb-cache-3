5|$|The bunkerisation {{programme}} was {{a massive}} drain on Albania's weak economy. The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of <b>net</b> <b>material</b> product, and in total the bunkers cost {{more than twice as}} much as the Maginot Line in France, consuming three times as much concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70–100 people a year died constructing the bunkers. In addition, the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Justification and {{calculation}} {{of a new}} methodological approach {{to the construction of}} a standard beach seine (502 / 302 х 3. 75) {{with the use of the}} properties of mirror netting ensuring the saving of the <b>netting</b> <b>material,</b> reduction of weight, price and drag resistance. Methodology. The carp age group selectivity of the constructed seine was assessed within fish fauna monitoring based on the catch analysis of monitoring gill nets with mesh sizes of 30 - 130 mm according to generally accepted methods [9, 10]. Calculation of <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> and ropes was carried out according to generally accepted methods [12 - 14]. Seine resistance was calculated according to N. T. Senin formula for different <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> and the angles of the movement of different seine parts in water [2]. The gear reliability and data processing were carried out according to standard methods [11, 14, 15]. Findings. A variant of the construction of the maximum lightweight beach lake seines made of mirror pattern netting taking into account the properties of the mirror pattern <b>netting</b> <b>material,</b> reduction of weight, price and drag resistance has been proposed. The provided re{{calculation of}} the properties of a serial seine made of rhombic mesh for the mirror netting seine taking into account netting properties allowed: 1) reducing the seine drag resistance value by 1, 4 times; 2) reducing the weight of <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> by 16. 3...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this PhD project {{was to develop a}} method for {{non-linear}} strength analysis of net structures applied in the aquaculture and fishing industries, e. g. net cages and trawls. The work focused on the aquaculture net cage, which was applied in experiments and analyses, and included research to establish knowledge within material properties and failure modes of traditional <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> for aquaculture. It was chosen to focus on tensile properties and to study elastic and plastic behaviour, fracture, creep behaviour and cod bite damage. The project consisted of three main activities: tensile testing of <b>netting</b> <b>materials,</b> studies and testing of cod bite damage and resistance, and structural analysis of aquaculture net cages. Net cages are built as a system of ropes and netting. They are designed to transfer and carry all major forces through the ropes. Loads from current, waves, weights and handling induce forces in the net cage, which must be dimensioned to withstand this. Analyzing an aquaculture net cage is both complex and time consuming due to non-linear effects, detailed geometry and dynamic loads. The behaviour of the net cage is dominated by very large deformations and displacements, and materials with non-linear properties. There is a need for verified analysis methods and specific guidance on how to reduce the complexity of a net cage analysis. In order to perform a strength analysis of a net cage, it is crucial to know the material properties of the <b>netting</b> <b>material.</b> Traditionally, the material property of major interest for the aquaculture industry has been the tensile breaking strength of netting (mesh) and ropes, and comparatively little focus has been on their detailed stiffness properties and general behaviour prior to fracture. A new test method was established to determine the uniaxial tensile properties of knotless <b>netting</b> <b>materials.</b> It was applied on a variety of <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> and stress-strain relations were developed. Data on temporary creep properties, recovery of strain post creep and post creep tensile properties of a selection of Raschel knitted <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> was presented. Post creep tensile testing showed that the length and force at break were not significantly affected by the creep load history. Cod farmers have reported that cod interact with the cage netting through biting and thereby create wear and tear. The nature of the cod bite attack on traditional, multifilament <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> was described based on studies of cod interaction with traditional knotless netting and resulting fracture damage on netting fibres. Field experiments were performed, subjecting panels of netting to cod bite in commercial cod cages. In addition, a test method was developed to simulate damage on traditional netting from cod bite, and a prototype bite-jig was designed and assembled. It was concluded that <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> for cod aquaculture must be resistant to cod bite or be repellent or uninteresting for cod. A method for numerical analysis of net cages in constant uniform current was developed and verified for limited solidity, deformations and current velocities. Various new designs for aquaculture net cages were presented and compared to a traditional net cage with regard to stresses in the <b>netting</b> <b>material</b> and deformation of the net cage.

40|$|On two horse {{farms in}} Brandenburg/Germany {{insecticide}} treated mosquito fences {{were attached to}} pasture poles (protecting 10 - 15 % of pasture) measuring their potential in reducing biting and nuisance insects for horses. For this purpose the attack incidence (mean number of insects counted on five anatomical regions/horse) was assessed on three horses of the intervention group (protected pasture) and control group (unprotected pasture). A reduction of the attack incidence of more than 33 % in nuisance flies and of more than 50 % in tabanids was recorded. The insect densities outside of the pasture were monitored and compared using three different types of traps (Malaise traps, Vavoua traps and Gelbschale traps). The <b>netting</b> <b>material</b> {{was found to have}} a clear potential for reducing the number of target insects (tabanids and other nuisance insects) but also the number of non target insects (Syrphidae, Asilidae, Conopidae, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Odonata, Saltatoria, Neuroptera, Mecoptera and remaining insects). Outside, {{in the vicinity of the}} protected pasture about 33 % fewer target insects and about 50 % fewer non target insects were caught. To monitor the persistence of the insecticide treated <b>netting</b> <b>material</b> it was tested at monthly intervals in the laboratory before and after installation using house flies (Musca domestica). The rates of paralysis five and ten minutes after exposure decreased markedly during the five months trial. However, the rates of paralysis 15 minutes, six hours and 24 hours after exposure remained at comparable levels (80 - 100 %) throughout the trial. In the last test (five months after installation) a delay of paralysis was observed which might have been caused by weathering. To evaluate the washing out effects of the active ingredient during rains, the net was rinsed at monthly intervals with demineralised water which was then tested with larvae of Aedes aegypti. All larvae transferred into rinsing water of the insecticide treated netting died within 24 hours after their transfer. The efficacy to reduce the attack incidence and to increase the protection of horses on pasture with insecticide treated <b>netting</b> <b>material</b> has been confirmed in this study. Future studies should test whether further improvements can be achieved by using alternative methods of installation or improvements of <b>netting</b> <b>material.</b> Due consideration should be given to keep negative impacts on non target insects as low as possible.

40|$|One of {{the steps}} {{called for in the}} fight against malaria is the removal of tariffs and taxes on insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), <b>netting</b> <b>materials,</b> and insecticides, with a view to {{reducing}} the retail prices of ITNs and thus increasing utilization. In this paper we develop an approach for analysing the extent to which reform of tariff and tax policy can be expected to increase ITN purchases. We consider the following questions: (1) How much does the retail price of ITNs change if tariffs and taxes are reduced or eliminated? (2) How responsive is consumer demand to changes in the retail price of ITNs? Data on the price elasticity of demand for ITNs are very limited. Nevertheless, they suggest that ITN demand is not highly responsive to lower prices if household preferences are held constant. The reduction in retail prices associated with the removal of tariffs and taxes depends on the structure of the market in individual countries. In Nigeria, reducing the tariff on insecticides from 42 % to zero and the tariff on <b>netting</b> <b>materials</b> from 40 % to 5 % is expected to increase ITN purchases by 9 - 27 %, depending on the elasticity used.
