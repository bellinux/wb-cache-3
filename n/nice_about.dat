The train leaves Paris from the Gare d'Austerlitz in mid evening and arrives in <b>Nice</b> <b>about</b> 8 in the morning, providing both first-class rooms and couchette accommodations. The train's principal popularity is with older travelers; it has not won {{the same degree of}} popularity with younger travelers. Recently, the upper class coaches (wagons lits) have been sold to foreign railroad companies, so that only couchette cars (1st and 2nd class) as well as seating coaches remain. The Train Bleu is part of the French night service network called Intercités de Nuit.|$|E
500|$|The prize {{has been}} criticized: British {{biologist}} Richard Dawkins {{said in his}} book The God Delusion that the prize was given [...] "usually to a scientist who is prepared to say something <b>nice</b> <b>about</b> religion". [...] Sean M. Carroll, a research associate in the Department of Physics at the California Institute of Technology, criticized his colleagues for taking Templeton research grants when they did not support Templeton's beliefs. [...] Martinus J. G. Veltman, the 1999 Nobel laureate in physics, suggested the prize [...] "bridg the gap between sense and nonsense".|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the first}} episode in which Kit Harington and Iwan Rheon filmed scenes {{together}} and met on-screen. Rheon {{said that he had}} always wanted to film scenes with Jon Snow: [...] "Anyone who has asked me, 'Who would you like Ramsay to meet?' My answer has always been, 'Jon Snow.' He's the antithesis of Ramsay. They're almost a yin and a yang. They both come from such a similar place yet they're so different. And even though they're enemies, they've both risen so far as bastards, which is almost incomprehensible, and now they're both here facing each other. They couldn't be any more different, yet more similar." [...] In an interview, Harington talked about the fight scene with Rheon: [...] "I actually did punch Iwan in the face twice by accident, which he took really well. He was really <b>nice</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] According to Rheon, [...] "The way I see it, if you don't get hit a couple of times doing that, you're not doing it properly." ...|$|E

500|$|In an April 2014 interview, Joe Russo {{described}} {{the project as}} {{a continuation of the}} story from Captain America: The Winter Soldier: [...] "What’s <b>nice</b> <b>about</b> the film is that ... it's a two-parter. There's a journey that the Winter Soldier goes on that isn't complete yet." [...] That month, Marvel announced a release date of May 6, 2016, and Trent Opaloch, who was the cinematographer on The Winter Soldier, said he would return for the sequel. In July, Markus and McFeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015. The following month, they stated that they were looking to make the tone of the film [...] "an amalgam" [...] of The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier, with the Russos likening it to a psychological thriller, citing Seven, Fargo, and The Godfather as influences, along with westerns and Brian De Palma's films. The Russos also stated that [...] "a good portion of [...] actually funnier than Winter Soldier" [...] with a more comedic tone and lighter moments throughout.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 4 October 2008 that Sam would depart from Holby City in [...] "a blaze of glory {{in a big}} Christmas storyline". A show insider revealed that [...] "Tom’s departure will leave his fans in tears, but Holby bosses are keeping tight-lipped {{about whether or not}} Sam will be killed off." [...] Chambers explained of his decision to leave: [...] "I was worried about telling the bosses, but I wrote a long letter to the producers explaining my decision and they were incredibly <b>nice</b> <b>about</b> it. Sam Strachan has gone through so much in the past year with his cancer – it seemed like the perfect time to make the break." [...] Several episodes before the character's departure, his estranged son Kieron played by Misha Crosby, was introduced to Holby City. Father and son both developed romantic feelings for nurse Maria Kendall, leading to Sam asking her to accompany them both to New York, where Kieron was a famous violinist. After being shown her future should she accept, Maria declined Sam's offer, and he and Keiron departed together.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{received}} fairly positive {{reviews and}} currently has a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: [...] "What's <b>nicest</b> <b>about</b> {{the film is}} the way it treasures the good feelings people can have for one another." [...] In the Washington Post, Desson Howe praised Natalie Portman's performance: [...] "As a self-described 'old soul' who connects spiritually with Hutton (they're both existential searchers), she's the movie's most poignant and witty presence." ...|$|R

[...] When finally dismissed {{he left the}} ground by the wrong gate, and found himself climbing up towards the Royal enclosure where Queen Elizabeth II was watching the day's play.

2500|$|In February 1996, Westbrook's axing was {{reported}} in the press. According to press reports, producers had tired of her off-screen antics and were angered that she had appeared on the Channel 4 chat show, The Girlie Show, and had given away the outcome of a storyline she was involved with, a love-triangle between Sam, Ricky and his new girlfriend Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). The character departed for Spain on 26 March 1996 after falling for a Spanish tourist. Westbrook has since commented, [...] "The producers were very <b>nice</b> <b>about</b> it all. Rather than killing [...] off they sent her to Spain, once again leaving the door open for her to return [...] There was no official line as to why I was leaving, and when the announcement was made [...] they were kind enough to let me say in interviews that I was going because I wanted 'a change of direction'. 'Hopefully, one day I'll return to the show', I told journalists".|$|E

2500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews, with The Hindu's Malathi Rangarajan {{giving the}} film an average review concluding that [...] "the dialogue sparkles in many a place, the direction is neat and song sequences have been inserted intelligently — {{but even with}} such a youthful team what the film lacks is pep and verve." [...] Another critic noted that the film [...] "has predictable, cliched situations, stereotyped characters, and lack-lustre treatment. Half-way through the film, you realise which way the script is being steered." [...] Rediff.com noted that [...] " [...] the film lacks the freshness and grandeur of other films", while Sify called it [...] "a highly melodramatic and over-the-top movie with no logic". The critic however noted [...] "If there is something <b>nice</b> <b>about</b> Priyamana Thozhi, it is Sridevi as Julie {{who looks like a}} dream, with her controlled and understated performance and steals the show." [...] The actress was also nominated for the Filmfare Best Tamil Supporting Actress Award in 2004 for her performance as Julie.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tension between}} {{traditional}} models of masculinity and the experiences within the war runs throughout the novel. Critic Greg Harris identifies Regeneration, {{along with the}} other two novels in the trilogy, as profiling the non-fictional experience of Sassoon and other soldiers who must deal with ideas of masculnity. These characters feel conflicted by a model of masculinity common to Britain during this time: [...] honour, bravery, mental strength, and confidence were privileged [...] "manly" [...] characteristics. Yet they explore, internally and through conversation, what that model means for them and how the war changes how they should experience it. In an interview with Barker in Contemporary Literature, Rob Nixon distinguishes between these ideas of [...] "manliness" [...] and the concept of masculinity as providing a larger definition for identity. Barker agrees with his assessment, saying, [...] "and what's so <b>nice</b> <b>about</b> them is that they use it so unself-consciously: they must have been the last generation of men who could talk about manliness without going [...] "ugh" [...] inside." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 14 April, in the Commons, Powell claimed [...] "it is {{difficult}} to fault the military and especially the naval measures which the Government have taken". He added: [...] "We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and {{the wishes of the}} inhabitants of the Falkland Islands... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, acceptable conditions and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands.... I do not think that we need be too <b>nice</b> <b>about</b> saying that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that. Indeed, it is impossible in the last resort to distinguish between the defence of territory and the defence of people".|$|E

2500|$|In early 2006, Corgan {{moved in}} with Courtney Love and her daughter, Frances Bean Cobain. According to Love, {{he had his own}} wing in her new Hollywood Hills mansion. Two years later, Love criticized Corgan {{publicly}} over the latter's alleged refusal to attend Frances' sweet 16 birthday party. In March 2010, Corgan stated in an interview in reference about Love [...] "I have no interest in supporting her in any way, shape or form. You can't throw enough things down the abyss with a person like that" [...] and said he parted ways with her. Shortly after, when Hole's Nobody's Daughter was released, Corgan unleashed on Twitter a set of anger-filled words against her in reference to including two songs he wrote, [...] "Samantha" [...] and [...] "How Dirty Girls Get Clean", that ended up on the new album without his permission. Love then wrote an apology to him on her Facebook, but things heated up. Corgan took to Twitter again in six parts, attacking her again. Love responded to Corgan on Twitter, saying [...] "All i am is <b>nice</b> <b>about</b> you so if you wanna be mean be mean i dont feel anything. i have too much to feel dear." ...|$|E
