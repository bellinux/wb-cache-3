For gentamicin, no significant difference in percentage GAG loss was found between the control and three of the five treatment groups (P = 0. 667). The percentage GAG loss in the sodium heparin treated AC explants was greater than for any of the gentamicin-treated AC explants.

40|$|Abstract The role of chondrocytes in the {{development}} of <b>infectious</b> <b>arthritis</b> is not well understood. Several examples of mycoplasma-induced arthritis in animals indicate that chondrocytes come into direct contact with bacteria. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the interaction of an arthrogenic Mycoplasma synoviae strain WVU 1853 with chicken chondrocytes. We found that M. synoviae significantly reduces chondrocyte respiration. This was accompanied by alterations in chondrocyte morphology, namely cell shrinkage and cytoplasm condensation, as well as nuclear condensation and formation of plasma membrane invaginations containing nuclear material, which appeared to cleave off the cell surface. In concordance with these apoptosis-like events in chondrocytes, transcription was increased in several pro-apoptotic genes. Twenty-four hours after infection, strong upregulation was assayed in NOS 2, Mapk 11, CASP 8 and Casp 3 genes. Twenty-four and 72 h incubation of chondrocytes with M. synoviae induced upregulation of AIFM 1, NFκB 1, htrA 3 and BCL 2. Casp 3 and NOS 2 remained upregulated, but upregulation ceased for Mapk 11 and CASP 8 genes. Increased production of nitric oxide was also confirmed in cell supernates. The data suggests that chicken chondrocytes infected with M. synoviae die by apoptosis involving production of nitric oxide, caspase 3 activation and mitochondrial inactivation. The results of this study show for the first time that mycoplasmas could cause chondrocyte apoptosis. This could contribute to tissue destruction and influence {{the development}} of arthritic conditions. Hence, the study gives new insights into the role of mycoplasma infection on chondrocyte biology and development of <b>infectious</b> <b>arthritis</b> in chickens and potentially in humans. </p...|$|R
