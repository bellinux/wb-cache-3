500|$|On his {{official}} website, Williams {{wrote that he}} was working with producer Trevor Horn on his new album; he described himself as [...] "buzzing" [...] and went on to call the album's sound [...] "Very, very big". Williams revealed that the new album would be titled Reality Killed the Video Star, a reference to the song [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star" [...] by Horn's former band The Buggles. The album was originally planned to be named Il Protagonista (Italian for The Protagonist) until Williams' management told him to change the title as it was [...] "too pretentious". In July 2009 Williams wrote on {{his official}} blog about the album: [...] "My album's a killer: old Robbie, new Robbie and a Robbie that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have met...". The A.V. Club has also reported that during 2007, Williams had recorded an unreleased experimental album that, he later said, would have amounted to [...] "career suicide".|$|E
500|$|He starred as {{psychiatrist}} Craig [...] "Huff" [...] Huffstodt in the Showtime {{drama series}} Huff, which ran for two seasons between 2004 and 2006, airing 24 episodes. Azaria {{served as an}} executive producer {{on the show and}} directed an episode of its second season. After reading the pilot script, he sent it to Platt, who took the role of Huff's friend Russell Tupper. Azaria enjoyed working on the show, but struggled with the bleak subject matter and was often in dispute with its creator Bob Lowry, noting that it [...] "was tough to marry our visions all the time, [...] we both cared so much about it that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were willing to let go." [...] Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly called Azaria [...] "impressively subtle" [...] in the role, while John Leonard of New York magazine said he was a [...] "shrewd bit of casting." [...] The show garnered seven Emmy nominations in 2005, including a nomination for Azaria for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Despite the awards, the show continually received low ratings, and Showtime chose not to commission it for a third season.|$|E

500|$|Broderick and Hughes {{stayed in}} touch for a while after production. [...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{became a}} close friend of Washington Irving. With Irving, Paulding {{proposed}} a literary project. As he described, [...] "one day in a frolicsome mood, we broached the idea of a little periodical merely for our own amusement, and that of the town, for <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> anticipated any further circulation." [...] The result was Salmagundi; a short-lived satirical periodical, from which the word 'Gotham' was first ascribed as a name for New York City.|$|E

He tells the court of being unafraid of death, because his true concern is in acting ethically. That people who fear death are showing their ignorance, because death {{might be a good}} thing, but that most people fear death as an evil thing, when they cannot possibly know death to be either good or evil. Socrates says that his wisdom is in being aware that he is ignorant: “I am wiser than this man; it is likely that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something, when he does not.” Apology, 21d.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the game, {{many of the}} Green Bay {{players were}} unable to start their cars in the {{freezing}} weather, forcing them to make alternate travel arrangements {{to make it to}} the stadium on time. [...] Linebacker Dave Robinson had to flag down a random passing motorist for a ride. [...] The referees for the game found they did not have sufficient clothing for the cold, and had to make an early trip to a sporting goods store for earmuffs, heavy gloves, and thermal underwear. Packers quarterback Bart Starr attended an early church service with his father, who had visited for the game, and as Starr later said, [...] "It was so cold that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> talked about it.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with series creator Reki Kawahara, when asked whether Kirito's personality and character were based off his own, the author responded {{that he does not}} usually put aspects of himself into his characters, and jokingly remarked that [...] "but if I had to say there was a point of similarity between Kirito and myself, it is the fact that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are good at forming parties. We [...] tend to play solo in these games a lot." [...] He also added that he wrote the series to change popular opinion of online gaming; viewing it not a social ill or just an escape from real life, and thus decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels. When fans asked him about Kirito using a sword in a gun-based game, Kawahara responded that the energy sword in Halo can be the most powerful weapon if used properly.|$|E

As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye.

We [...] had no food or water, and only a flashlight. We were confident we could stay alive for forty-eight hours. The high pressure and foul air gave us severe headaches. We did very little moving or talking; it excited our hearts too much. We heard scraping on the hull for hours. A couple of times we felt the O-5 being lifted, and then we got tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed our hopes [...] for rescue tremendously. Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly. We felt we would escape this time, but it seemed like forever. The last 20 minutes were unbearable. We heard our comrades walking on deck. Breault opened the hatch and we could see daylight. [...] We were saved!!! ...|$|E

Lady Avon has since described this observation as [...] "silly, really idiotic", though it remains probably the most quoted utterance of the whole crisis. One example of its durability was a journalist's observation some 54 years later, with reference to the Iraq War of 2003, that [...] "if, as Clarissa Eden remarked, the Suez Canal ran through her drawing room, Iraq and the decisions that flowed from it still haunt [...] Labour [...] and stir up antipathies and discomforts". Another instance was in 2013 when options for airport expansion around London were being debated. Journalist Rachel Johnson, sister of London's mayor Boris Johnson, recalled Lady Avon's remark and added, [...] "But for those of us in West London, any further expansion to Heathrow and the airport really will be in our back yards". More directly, The Times newspaper cited Lady Avon's words in 2011 in connection with a call by the outgoing Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus (later Lord) O'Donnell for Prime Ministerial spouses to receive greater support from public funds: [...] "In a constitutional monarchy, the consort of the prime minister is not an official role ... Yet, as the Countess of Avon so vividly pointed out, it can be impossible to keep public scrutiny at bay altogether". In Lady Avon's view, both she and her husband [...] "were quite naive about how the press works. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> should have been, but we were." ...|$|E

Regardless of the consequences, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished your mission, why do you still need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together."
