40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{patterns}} {{of international trade and}} growth have rekindled interest in the relationships among trade, growth, and the international distribution of income. Three alternative models can serve as a theoretical foundation for an empirical analysis of these relationships. The first is the standard Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson (Ho) trade model with equalnumbers of factors and goods and incomplete specialization. The second model allows complete specialization and more goods than factors. The third model posits short run capital immobility. Each of these models has quite different implications for the determination of wage levels and growth rates. The conclusions that we draw from this research are rather mixed. Each of the models perform well on certain criteria and poorly on others. While the standard HO model clearly fails to satisfy certain cross-equation constraints, <b>national</b> <b>endowments</b> are remarkably good predictors of the locus of international production. There are, however, significant nonlinearities in the relationship between factor allocations and <b>national</b> <b>endowments.</b> Such nonlinearities are predicted by the uneven version of the HO model. At odds with both of these models is our finding that lagged values of inputs providean important explanation of current factor demands. Such correlations are suggested by the adjustment cost model. ...|$|R
5|$|Rocco Landesman, {{chairperson}} of the <b>National</b> <b>Endowment</b> for the Arts, has used Citygarden {{as an example of}} a successful foundation-funded art venture. Landesman—a former resident of St. Louis—said that such projects can help urban areas economically, but they cannot be funded solely by the federal government, thus requiring assistance from both the private sector and foundations. Michael Van Valkenburgh, principal of a Brooklyn landscape architecture firm, said he was drawn to St. Louis partly because of Citygarden's design and success. Van Valkenburgh was selected in 2010 to renovate the grounds of the Gateway Arch.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of off-shoring on {{specialisation}} via its effect on <b>national</b> <b>endowments</b> and productivity. We use different definition of off-shoring to properly capture international fragmentation of production, while controlling for countries? stocks of R&D and ICT capital. Using industry data for the US, Japan and Europe we show that while offshoring of materials can benefit {{a wide range of}} industries, service and intra-industry offshoring can decrease specialisation in high-tech industry, both within manufacturing and services. This effect can be compensated with increasing R&D investments. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{debate on}} {{industrial}} policy is often counterposed between two truisms. On the one hand, market-based resource allocation is clearly important - 'it is not nations which compete, but individual firms'. On the other hand, firms {{operate in the}} context of 'created endowments' such as physical infrastructure and the education and training of their labour forces, so it is no so much that enterprises compete, but rather that they do so {{in the context of}} <b>national</b> <b>endowments</b> which are open to augmentation by government action (Reich, 1991) ...|$|R

Dr Henry calls for a new, more honest reform narrative that recognises our economic, social and environmental outcomes are a result of what we do with our <b>national</b> <b>endowments.</b>  ...|$|R
5|$|The AFL–CIO's {{autonomous}} {{support of}} Solidarity {{was so successful}} that by 1984 both Democrats and Republicans agreed that it deserved public support. The AFL–CIO's example of open support was deemed to be appropriate for a democracy, and much more suitable than the clandestine funding through the CIA that had occurred before 1970. Both parties and President Ronald Reagan supported a non-governmental organization, <b>National</b> <b>Endowment</b> for Democracy (NED), through which Congress would openly fund Solidarity through an allocation in the State Department's budget, beginning in 1984. The NED was designed with four core institutions, associated with {{the two major parties}} and with the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (representing business). The NED's first president was Carl Gershman, a former Director of Social Democrats, USA and former U.S. Representative to the United Nations committee on human rights. From 1984 until 1990, the NED and the AFL–CIO channeled equipment and support worth $4million to Solidarity.|$|E
