However, real wages suffer the disadvantage of not being well defined, since the amount of inflation (which can be calculated based on different combinations <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>services)</b> is itself not well defined. Hence real wage defined as the total amount <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> that can be bought with a wage, is also not defined.
