25|$|During Teen Titans, Superboy {{developed}} Kryptonian powers including heat vision, x-ray vision, and super-hearing. He {{also developed}} Kryptonian invulnerability. He also has developed Kryptonian level super strength, as shown when he battled the hugely powerful Superboy-Prime and {{even managed to}} damage him {{with some of his}} blows, when some characters such as Black Adam could <b>not.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> Titans encountered their future selves, he found his future self had greater telekinetic abilities (no longer limited to tactile telekinesis), was stronger, more durable, and faster. Superboy later states that he has developed telescopic vision and eventually figures out how to use his freeze breath. It has also been shown in Teen Titans that he is much faster, traveling from San Francisco to the Arctic {{in less than an hour}} whilst carrying Nightwing. Superboy, like Superman, derives his Kryptonian powers from the absorption of solar energy from the Earth's yellow sun, and he is as vulnerable to Kryptonite and magic as is the Man of Steel.|$|E
25|$|Some {{laboratory}} research demonstrate correlations between psychopathy and atypical responses to aversive stimuli, including weak conditioning to painful stimuli and poor learning of avoiding responses that cause punishment, {{as well as}} low reactivity in the autonomic nervous system as measured with skin conductance while waiting for a painful stimulus but <b>not</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> stimulus occurs. While {{it has been argued}} that the reward system functions normally, some studies have also found reduced reactivity to pleasurable stimuli. According to the response modulation hypothesis, psychopathic individuals have also had difficulty switching from an ongoing action despite environmental cues signaling a need to do so. This may explain the difficulty responding to punishment, although it is unclear if it can explain findings such as deficient conditioning. There may be methodological issues regarding the research. While establishing a range of idiosyncrasies on average in linguistic and affective processing under certain conditions, this research program has not confirmed a common pathology of psychopathy.|$|E
25|$|Subsidence {{occurs when}} {{too much water}} is pumped out from underground, deflating the space below the above-surface, and thus causing the ground to collapse. The result can look like craters on plots of land. This occurs because, in its natural {{equilibrium}} state, the hydraulic pressure of groundwater in the pore spaces of the aquifer and the aquitard supports some {{of the weight of}} the overlying sediments. When groundwater is removed from aquifers by excessive pumping, pore pressures in the aquifer drop and compression of the aquifer may occur. This compression may be partially recoverable if pressures rebound, but much of it is <b>not.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> aquifer gets compressed, it may cause land subsidence, a drop in the ground surface. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana is actually below sea level today, and its subsidence is partly caused by removal of groundwater from the various aquifer/aquitard systems beneath it. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the San Joaquin Valley experienced significant subsidence, in some places up to 8.5 metres (28 feet) due to groundwater removal. Cities on river deltas, including Venice in Italy, and Bangkok in Thailand, have experienced surface subsidence; Mexico City, built on a former lake bed, has experienced rates of subsidence of up to 40cm (1'3") per year.|$|E

500|$|Due to its non-gregarious nature, {{the gray}} mouse lemur, like other nocturnal lemurs, {{primarily}} defends itself from predators using avoidance strategies, although group defense {{through the use}} of alarm calls and predator mobbing has been observed in this species. [...] Studies involving the placement of predator and non-predator fecal odor with captive populations have demonstrated a genetic predisposition for predator recognition through the detection of metabolites from meat digestion. [...] The mouse lemurs were shown to avoid locations where they typically received rewards, as well as exhibit increased activity and anti-predator behavior, when the odor of predator feces were present in that vicinity, but <b>not</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> fecal odor of Malagasy non-predators was present.|$|E
500|$|The first {{lawsuit was}} {{heard in the}} UK in October 1987 by Justice Vinelott. The litigants, the Church of Scientology of California, failed to obtain an {{injunction}} against {{the publication of the}} book. In his decision of 9 October 1987, the judge said that it was [...] "clear that the public interest far outweighed any duty of confidence that could conceivably be owed to Mr. Hubbard or his church." [...] The unpublished materials were held to be [...] "essential" [...] if Hubbard's early career was to be [...] "properly evaluated", and legal decisions against Armstrong in California could not bind an English court. The judge held that the Church had acted improperly in bringing its suit so late in the day. It had become aware in May of the plans to publish Bare-faced Messiah, but had not brought suit until 29 September, less than a month before publication. The application for an injunction, he said, [...] "was made at a time, whether calculated or <b>not,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> greatest possible damage and inconvenience would be caused to Penguin Books". No satisfactory explanation had been made for the delay and, in the judge's view, the application [...] "was oppressive, and was not brought to protect any legitimate interest." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, a {{follow-up}} entitled [...] {{was released in}} Japan. Designed exclusively for the Super Famicom's Satellaview peripheral, the game would make notable use of a voice broadcast system called SoundLink to provide voice-acting for {{several of the characters}} from A Link to the Past. The game takes place six years after the events in A Link to the Past and it is set in Hyrule's Light World. The game notably lacks a Link character, and instead the player character is known as the Hero of Light. The available player-characters are actually the male and female BS-X avatars that also featured in BS Zelda no Densetsu. The game was divided into four weekly episodes. These episodes were played live, and a voice-acted soundtrack simultaneously ran on the satellite network, sometimes containing suggestions, clues, and plot development for the game currently being broadcast. Each week, the player could only access certain portions of the overworld. Areas shrouded in clouds were unreachable. Two dungeons were accessible per week, however the episode ended only when time expired and <b>not</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> player had completed all the objectives for that week. The [...] game could only be played during the set hours because the SoundLink content was central to gameplay (and not stored on the base unit or flash-RAM cartridge in any way), and the timer was based on a real-time clock set by the satellite itself.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{nuisance}} claims; in Nichols v Marsland, for example, [...] "Act of God" [...] {{was accepted as}} a defence. One defence is that of [...] "20 years prescription", which is valid for private nuisance but not public. If a private nuisance continues for 20 years, it becomes legal by prescription, assuming the defendant can show {{that it has been}} continuous and the claimant has been aware of it. A limitation is that the 20 years is from when the activity became a nuisance, not from when the activity started. In Sturges v Bridgman, the claimant, a doctor, lived next to a [...] "confectionery business". Vibrations and noises coming from this business continued for over 20 years without causing the doctor nuisance, and the doctor only complained after building a consulting room in his garden. It was held that the actual nuisance only started when the consulting room was built and the activity began to affect the doctor, <b>not</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> activity started. A second defence is statutory authority, when an activity is authorised by a piece of legislation; this applies to both public and private nuisance. This applies even when the activity is carried out not directly in line with the statute, but intra vires. In Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd, the defendant was authorised to build an oil refinery by an Act of Parliament. The Act gave no express authority to operate it, and after it came into operation the claimant argued that it caused a nuisance through the smell and noise. The House of Lords held that it had statutory authority to operate the refinery, saying [...] "Parliament can hardly be supposed to have intended the refinery to be nothing more than a visual adornment to the landscape in an area of natural beauty". The statutory authority defence has recently been subject to legislative consideration in the Planning Act 2008, which expands the defence to over 14 types of infrastructure development.|$|E
