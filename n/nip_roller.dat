40|$|A {{pultrusion}} machine {{employing a}} corrugated impregnator vessel to immerse multiple, continuous strand, fiber tow in an impregnating material, and an adjustable metered exit orifice for the impregnator vessel {{to control the}} quantity of impregnating material retained by the impregnated fibers, is provided. An adjustable height insert retains transverse rod elements within each depression of the corrugated vessel to maintain the individual fiber tows spread and {{in contact with the}} vessel bottom. A series of elongated heating dies, transversely disposed on the pultrusion machine and having flat heating surfaces with radiused edges, ensure adequate temperature exposed dwell time and exert adequate pressure on the impregnated fiber tows, to provide the desired thickness and fiber/resin ratio in the prepreg formed. The prepreg passing through the pulling mechanism is wound on a suitable take-up spool for subsequent use.

40|$|The main {{objective}} for the thesis {{project is to}} find a suitable mathematical model of the velocity dependent friction force that arises between the <b>nip</b> <b>roller</b> and the carton material in the laminator at slip, in order to enable realistic simulations of the nip in the laminator. Theoretically, the LuGre model is found to contain the necessary physical properties for the actual situation. Experiments are conducted measuring friction between a rubber sample and carton samples in order to find an expansion and validation of the model. The model is found to produce a satisfac-tory low-magnitude residual in relation to the experiments for the range that varies with velocity. During the low velocities high-amplitude friction induced oscillations appear making the measurements highly inaccurate. It is known, however, that the slip will never reach these low velocities so this source of error is disregarded. Also, the measurement instrument is found not to be entirely ideal for this project. An instrument that can continuously change the velocity would be better. This model is good for most of the nip cases. However, further investigations are needed for the boundary effects that arise due to the cylindrical shape of the rollers and also a way to identify the dynamical parameters and thus expand from a steady-state model to a dynamical model...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} particle-level {{simulation method}} is developed to simulate fiber dynamics {{in the ring}} spinning triangle. The fiber is modeled as a chain of beads connected through massless rods, and its flexibility {{is defined by the}} stretching, bending and twisting displacements. As the application of the proposed approach, the effects of the chitosan (CS) /cotton (CT) fiber initial position and length on fiber motion and yarn properties are discussed. The deflections of CS fibers along the roller axis are larger compared with those of CT fibers, which will lead to CS migrating outwards in CS/CT blended yarn. The short CS fibers (22 mm) will move toward the top roller surface and shift quickly out of the <b>roller</b> <b>nip,</b> and thus yarn strength is lower. The tailing end of the longest CS fiber (46 mm) will drift off the <b>roller</b> <b>nip,</b> which makes little or no contribution to the yarn strength. For 38 mm length CS fiber, it moves toward the bottom roller surface and is bound into the <b>roller</b> <b>nip,</b> and thus can produce the highest tenacity CS/CT blended yarns. The simulation results agree with the spinning experimental data reported by other researchers.

40|$|AbstractA {{modified}} {{ring spinning}} system was proposed to make various diagonal yarn paths and offsets by equipping a traverse guide between delivery <b>roller</b> <b>nip</b> and lappet guide while the yarn leaving the front <b>roller</b> <b>nip</b> threaded through the traverse guide {{and went to}} bobbin below. Test properties of yarn counts 20 s, 40 s, 60 s (100 % cotton), spun on the modified yarn path system under various right & left diagonal offset d = 0, 6, 12, 18 mm. with a high speed camera, photographs of spinning triangle in different diagonal paths were captured and studied. The results suggested this modification system could improve yarn hairiness without changing tensile and unevenness properties greatly in right diagonal path. The maximum reduction of 3 - 9 mm long hairiness from Ne 20, Ne 40 to Ne 60 was 42. 6 %, 28. 5 % and 21. 3 %. The coarser yarns received more significant improvement on hairiness. It is observed that diagonal path {{is the most important}} factor to decide yarn hairiness over all counts of yarns...|$|R

Then, based on the force balance of the twisting point, the quasistatic model for the symmetrical ring spinning triangle was present.

50|$|The roller {{spinning}} process {{starts with a}} thick 'string' of loose fibers called a roving, which is passed between three pairs of rollers, each pair rotating slightly faster than the previous one. In this way it is reduced in thickness and increased in length before a strengthening twist is added by a bobbin-and-flyer mechanism. The spacing of the rollers has to be slightly greater than the fiber length to prevent breakage. The <b>nip</b> of the <b>roller</b> pairs prevents the twist from backing up to the roving.|$|R
25|$|This is a later {{development}} of the ring spinning frame. The passage of the yarn from the front rollers to the paper tube - used {{in place of a}} bobbin - is different from other types of spinning frames. When the yarn leaves the rollers it passes direct to the top of an elongated spindle and coils round it two or three times before forming a balloon to the ring traveller. This enables the twist to be imparted between the spindle top and <b>roller</b> <b>nip,</b> thus helping to produce a smoother yarn.|$|R
40|$|The {{spinning}} triangle is {{a critical}} region in the spinning process of yarn. Its geometry influences the fiber tension distribution and thus affects the properties of spun yarns. In conventional ring spinning, on the one hand, the spinning triangles are often asymmetric due to the frictional contacts of fibers with the bottom roller, which interferes with the twist propagation into the spinning triangle zone, and thus leads to the migration of the axis fiber at the front <b>roller</b> <b>nip.</b> On the other hand, the yarn spinning tension has an obvious angle with the vertical axis perpendicular to the nip line. Therefore, in this paper, a theoretical model of the fiber tension distributions in the general spinning triangle has been proposed by considering both the inclination angle of the spinning tension and the migration of the axis fiber at the front <b>roller</b> <b>nip</b> according {{to the principle of}} minimum potential energy. Two shape parameters were introduced to describe the skew level of the geometry of the spinning triangle in the analysis. The effects of shapes of the spinning triangle on the fiber tension distributions were investigated. The results show that the fiber tension distribution at the spinning triangle tends to more non-uniformity with increasing the asymmetry of the spinning triangle. The effects of both shape par-ameters on the fiber tension distributions are similar under the assumption that the spinning triangle height H is constant. In addition, a more long-narrow shape of the spinning triangle shows more uniform fiber distributions. Keyword...|$|R

40|$|Siro-spinning (two-strand yarn spinning) is a {{new kind}} of {{modified}} ring spinning method, which is achieved by feeding two rovings into the apron zone at a predetermined separation simultaneously. There are three spinning triangles, including two primary spinning triangles and one final spinning triangle, in Siro-spinning. Therefore, in this paper, the quantitative relationships between the mechanical performance of a Siro-spinning triangle and the spinning parameters are investi-gated by using the Finite Element Method. The finite element model of the Siro-spinning triangle is constructed under the assumption in which the constituent fibers are considered as three-dimensional elastic beam elements with tensile, compressive, torsion, and bending capabilities. Three different cases where the ends of all fibers, the initial strain of all fibers, and the angle between any two adjacent fibers gripped in the front <b>roller</b> <b>nip</b> distribute evenly are discussed. Meanwhile, in each case, three different cases where the initial strains of the shortest boundary fiber, the central fiber, and the virtual fiber on the direction of yarn spinning tension are set as zero are discussed respectively. Then, taking the spinning triangle in Ne 40 (14. 6 tex) cotton Sirospun yarn as an example, the fiber tension distribution and fiber torsion distribution in the corresponding Siro-spinning triangle with and without fiber buckling are numerical simulated. It is shown that the fiber tension distributions are influenced by the setting of the fiber initial strain, while the magnitudes of fiber tension are not affected. Finally, Ne 40 cotton ring yarns were spun on an EJM 128 K ring spinning machine, and the properties of spun yarns were evaluated and analyzed according to the simulation results...|$|R
