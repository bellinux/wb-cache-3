However, {{it is unclear whether}} "low dose" metformin improves glycemic control better than acarbose in <b>non-obese</b> type 2 <b>diabetic</b> patients, which has been shown to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes with obesity. METHODS: We randomly divided 22 <b>non-obese</b> type 2 <b>diabetic</b> patients (mean BMI approximately 25) into two groups (A = 11, B = 11). Group A was treated with "low dose" metformin (500 - 750 mg/day) for 3 months, and switched to acarbose (150 - 300 mg/day) for another 3 months.

While the etiology of insulin resistance is multifactorial, reduced insulin action is associated with impaired activity of the glucose transporter GLUT 4 in insulin-sensitive tissues. Yet, the role of adipose tissue GLUT 4 deregulation in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes is still unclear. In this study, we assessed the relative GLUT 4 level in human subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese, diabetic, and diabetic obese versus control subjects, using a real-time PCR method. GLUT 4 mRNA levels were considerably decreased among type 2 diabetic patients compared with those of the controls (P < 0. 01), whereas no such difference was found between obese and normal-weight controls. Multiple linear regressions analysis in both <b>diabetic</b> <b>non-obese</b> and <b>diabetic</b> obese groups showed a negative correlation between GLUT 4 mRNA expression and both markers of obesity or insulin resistance (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Due to the {{progressive}} nature of type 2 diabetes, its complexity and drug treatment perpetuity, {{there is currently}} a search for surgical procedures that can promote euglycemia also in <b>non-obese</b> patients. <b>Diabetic</b> patients glycemic control {{can be achieved by}} increasing the blood concentration of GLP- 1, a hormone produced by L cells that are more densely concentrated in the terminal ileum.

The interposition of this ileal segment to a more anterior region (proximal jejunum) can promote a greater stimulation of the L cells by poorly digested food, increasing the production of GLP- 1 and reflecting on glycemic control. However, in order to consolidate the ileal interposition as a surgical treatment of diabetes it is necessary that the interposed ileum keep the same differentiation rate into L cells for a long period to justify the intervention. |$|R

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Monocyte {{chemoattractant}} protein- 1 (MCP- 1) attracts monocytes and T lymphocytes, {{and could}} thus contribute to mononuclear cell infiltration in Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Cytokines induce MCP- 1 mRNA expression in pancreatic rat beta cells. To investigate this issue, we analysed the signal transduction for IL- 1 beta-induced MCP- 1 expression in rat beta cells and in vitro MCP- 1 mRNA expression and protein release by human islets {{as well as}} in vivo islet MCP- 1 mRNA expression in prediabetic <b>non-obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> mice. METHODS: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting-purified rat beta cells were cultured for 6 h with IL- 1 beta (30 U/ml) or MAPK inhibitors or both. Human islets were cultured for 6 - 72 h with the cytokines IL- 1 beta, IFN-gamma or the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor NG-methyl-L-arginine or both. We measured MCP- 1 mRNA by RT-PCR and protein by ELISA. The MCP- 1 mRNA expression in islets from male and female <b>non-obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> mice (2 - 12 weeks of age) was measured by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Interleukin- 1 beta induced MCP- 1 mRNA expression in rat beta cells, with a maximum induction after 6 h. A combination of p 38 and ERK 1 / 2 inhibitors decreased MCP- 1 expression by 70 %. IL- 1 beta induced both MCP- 1 mRNA expression and a threefold increase in medium MCP- 1 protein accumulation in human islet cells. This effect was not prevented by iNOS blockers. In vivo there was an age-related increase in MCP- 1 mRNA expression in islets from male and female <b>non-obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> mice, reaching a peak at 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In rat and human islet cells MCP- 1 mRNA is induced by IL- 1 beta. Both ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 MAPK, but not nitric oxide, contribute to MCP- 1 expression. In <b>non-obese</b> <b>diabetic</b> mice MCP- 1 mRNA expression increases with age, peaking at the early phases of insulitis.

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) as gene delivery vehicles to simultaneously express human hepa-tocyte growth factor (HGF) and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) to improve the outcome of islet transplantation. Methods Morphology and islet-binding affinity of hBMSCs were checked by microscope. The expression of target genes and endogenous genes was determined by ELISA. Protection of islets by hBMSCs was evaluated in vitro by Calcein-AM/Propidium Iodide staining and in vivo by alloge-neic islet transplantation study. Function and revascularization of islets was evaluated by immune fluorescence study. Results Non-donor-specific hBMSCs showed strong binding affinity to human islets and protected viability and function. Transduction of hBMSCs with adenovirus encoding human HGF and human IL- 1 Ra (Adv-hHGF-hIL- 1 Ra) prior to co-culturing with islets further protected from apoptotic cell death, helped maintain 3 D structures and morphology, and enhanced insulin secretion. Transplantation of human islets reconstituted with Adv-hHGF-hIL- 1 Ra transduced hBMSCs under the kidney capsule of streptozotocin-induced <b>diabetic</b> <b>non-obese</b> diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice reversed diabetes by reducing blood glucose levels to ≤ 200 mg/dL for up to 15 weeks and {{reduced the number of}} islets required to achieving normoglycemia. Blood glucose levels of mice transplanted with islets alone reversed to ≥ 500 mg/dL 4 weeks post-transplantation. Conclusions Results indentified hBMSCs as effective gene delivery vehicles to improve the outcome of islet transplantation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAimsWe {{have shown}} that {{diabetes}} causes cerebrovascular remodeling {{in part by the}} activation of the endothelin (ET- 1) system in a glucose-dependent manner. We also reported increased yet dysfunctional cerebral angiogenesis in diabetes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that dual ET- 1 receptor antagonism or glycemic control can reverse already established diabetes-induced vascular remodeling and neovascularization. Main methods 18 -week <b>non-obese</b> type- 2 <b>diabetic</b> Goto-Kakizaki (GK) were treated with vehicle, metformin (300 mg/kg/day) or bosentan (100 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks by oral gavage and compared to 10 and 18 -weeks GK rats. Isolated middle cerebral artery (MCA) lumen diameter (LD), media thickness (MT), media:lumen (M:L) ratio, and cross-sectional area (CSA) were measured using pressurized arteriograph. Assessment of remodeling and angiogenesis in the brain parenchyma was achieved by three-dimensional reconstruction of fluorescently labeled images of the vasculature acquired by confocal microscopy, and measurement of neovascularization indices including vascular volume and surface area, branch density and tortuosity. Key findingsMCA remodeling (increased M:L ratio and CSA, but decreased LD) occurred by 18 weeks and did not progress by 22 weeks in diabetic GK rats. Metformin and bosentan partially corrected large artery remodeling. Both treatments significantly reduced all indices of neovascularization compared to untreated diabetic rats. SignificanceGlycemic control or ET- 1 antagonism can partially reverse diabetes-induced cerebrovascular remodeling and neovascularization. These results strongly suggest that either approach offers a therapeutic benefit and combination treatments need to be tested...|$|R
40|$|Medial {{thickening}} and vascular hypertrophy {{of resistance}} arteries {{can lead to}} cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes. While previous studies have established a role of Type 1 diabetes in vascular remodeling, we recently extended these observations to Type 2 diabetes and reported increased collagen deposition due to alterations in matrix metalloproteinase expression and activity in mesenteric resistance arteries. These studies also showed that remodeling response was mediated by endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) via activation of ETA receptors, whereas blockade of ETB receptors exacerbated the remodeling. However, the effectiveness of glycemic control strategies in preventing these vascular changes, including activation of the ET system still remained unclear. Also, very {{little is known about}} whether and to what extent reorganization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) affects vascular compliance and vasomotor tone. Accordingly, this study assessed structural remodeling of mesenteric microvessels, vascular compliance, and myogenic tone, as well as the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in mediating these processes. Spontaneously <b>diabetic,</b> <b>non-obese</b> Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a model for Type 2 diabetes, and normoglycemic Wistar rats were used for the studies. A subset of GK rats were administered metformin to achieve euglycemia. Glycemic control normalized the increased media-to-lumen ratios (M/L) and myogenic tone seen in diabetes, as well as normalizing plasma ET- 1 levels and mesenteric ETA receptor expression. There was increased collagen synthesis in diabetes paralleled by decreased collagenase MMP- 13 activity, while glycemic control attenuated the process. These findings and our previous study taken together suggest that hyperglycemia-mediated activation of ET- 1 and ETA receptors alter vascular structure and mechanics in Type 2 diabetes...|$|R
