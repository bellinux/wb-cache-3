In this sense, the article examines the resolutions, motions and declarations which have been adopted by the Plenary and the committees of the Catalan Parliament since its re-establishment in 1980, on four fundamental topics: first, the enlargement and improvement {{of the quality of}} the competences, as well as the establishment of a fair financial regime for Catalonia; second, the right to self-determination and the “right to decide”; third, the defence of the recognition of Catalonia as a nation and fourth, the defence of the Catalan language as the own language of Catalonia (“national language”). Regarding the first topic, the article showsthat self-government demands and complaints about the recentralizationtrends exhibited by central government are both old claims which started by claiming reinterpretations of the Spanish Constitution (right in the 1980 s) and followed by proposals of constitutional amendments, reform of theCatalan Statute, and by the proposal of new financial regime for Catalonia (the “Fiscal Pact Proposal”). On the second topic, that about the claim for self-determination, the article shows that it has been a persistent issue of parliamentary debates: it was included in 11 resolutions during the period 1989 - 1991. While the earlier resolutions were just expressing the existence of such right, the most recent ones are the expression of a political will andestablish the course of action for its actual implementation. On the third topic, that referred to the “national recognition of Catalonia”, the article analyses the failed attempts to obtain the recognition of Catalonia as a nation from the Spanish Government. Regarding the defence of the Catalan language as the “national” language, the article shows how the Parliament has extensively devoted a large part of its <b>non-legislative</b> <b>activity</b> to it, although its effects have been weak given the fact that the Constitutional Court of Spain ruled against it...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on Western European parliaments has long pointed {{to an increase}} in <b>non-legislative</b> <b>activities,</b> including questions to the minister and interpellations; however, it has struggled to explain this develop-ment. This paper argues that the explanation ought to be sought in the increased importance of issue competition among political parties in Western Europe. Political parties are increasingly competing over which issues should dominate politics. In issue competition, <b>non-legislative</b> <b>activities</b> are attractive for opposition parties, because governments must respond to the issues the opposition wants to focus on. The paper thus argues that the key to understanding the development of activities in Western European parliaments is to bring parties and theories of party competition into the study of these activities. The argument is tested and supported by showing that the growth in <b>non-legislative</b> <b>activities</b> in Western Europe is universal as well as by demonstrating how the content of questions to the minister in Denmark reveals a clear issu...|$|R

A number of <b>non-legislative</b> proposals and <b>activities</b> to this end are reviewed, including DOE's own proposals for "alignment and downsizing" of the Department and its laboratories...|$|R
