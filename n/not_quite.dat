5|$|Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl, Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal, Dwayne Taylor / Night Thrasher, Robbie Baldwin / Speedball, Zach Smith / Microbe, and Deborah Fields / Debrii, are superpowered {{young people}} with {{abilities}} {{very different from the}} Avengers, who want to make a positive impact in the world even if they are <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> ready to be heroes.|$|E

5|$|I am <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> {{certain that}} the present {{regulations}} governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction, {{and it would be}} worth considering whether they could not be arranged so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where their opponents hail from.|$|E
5|$|In this way, {{the bucket}} orchid passes its pollen from flower to flower. This {{mechanism}} is almost but <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> species specific, {{as it is}} possible for a few closely related bees to pollinate any given species of orchid, as long as the bees are similar in size and are attracted by the same compounds.|$|E
5|$|Most modern breweries use a {{continuous}} sparge, collecting the original wort and the sparge water together. However, {{it is possible}} to collect a second or even third wash with the <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.|$|E

5|$|<b>Not</b> <b>Quite</b> Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation! is a 2008 Australian {{documentary}} {{film about the}} Australian New Wave of 1970s and '80s low-budget cinema. The film was {{written and directed by}} Mark Hartley, who interviewed over eighty Australian, American and British actors, directors, screenwriters and producers, including Quentin Tarantino, Brian Trenchard-Smith, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dennis Hopper, George Lazenby, George Miller, Barry Humphries, Stacy Keach and John Seale.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus's {{position}} was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> that of successor; he had requested marriage in AD25 to Tiberius's niece, Livilla, though under pressure quickly withdrew the request. While Sejanus's Praetorians controlled the imperial post, {{and therefore the}} information that Tiberius received from Rome and the information Rome received from Tiberius, the presence of Livia seems to have checked his overt power for a time. Her death in AD29 changed all that.|$|E
5|$|A direct {{relativistic}} effect {{is that as}} atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus {{as a result of}} the increase of the electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though this is <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% in size and stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{official}} papers on the line's construction, when the line first opened for trains between Sydney and Sutherland construction was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> complete, so excursion services initially ran on weekends only until the entire line was handed over. The first official train ran within the modern-day suburban area on 9 December 1885, although the line was closed once again between December 1885 and January 1886 to permit testing on the new bridge over the Georges River.|$|E
5|$|Asch {{found that}} some 1/4 of all {{subjects}} successfully withstands this form of social pressure, 1//20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> equal to the standard line. Asch {{also found that the}} effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. He also found that when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.|$|E
5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good {{morning to}} you, Wallingford," [...] cried the old man, in a cheerful way; [...] "you are {{just in time}} {{to take a look at}} yonder Frenchman in his glory. Two hours hence I hope he'll <b>not</b> appear <b>quite</b> as much of a beau as he is a' this moment. She's a noble craft, is she <b>not,</b> and <b>quite</b> of our own force." ...|$|R
5|$|Burnell built {{extensively}} at Acton Burnell Castle, {{and large}} parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, which had the private quarters {{at the back of}} a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were well away from the building's main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> a castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the Bishop's Palace in Wells.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} Test, Bradman {{returned}} to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe bodyline was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> the threat that had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
5|$|Greatest five-by-fives (most of each stat): Hakeem Olajuwon, on March 10, 1987, {{became the}} first in NBA history to record a five-by-six (at least 6 each of all five statistics: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals). It took nearly twenty years for the second {{official}} occurrence in NBA history. Andrei Kirilenko, on January 3, 2006, recorded a five-by-six against the Lakers. Though his numbers were <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> as impressive as Olajuwon's, Kirilenko performed the feat in regulation.|$|E
5|$|Liukin {{decided that}} she was not done with {{gymnastics}} and made her first post-Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic, where she competed only on balance beam. She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong. Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships, but decided to once again just perform on beam. She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team. Liukin was added to the national team and included in the World Championships selection camp. However, she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because she felt that she was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> up to World Championships standards.|$|E

[...] Then, as she raised it to her lips, [...] "It does <b>not</b> smell <b>quite</b> right. But, woe's me! how can I expect anybody but myself to make this {{precious}} drink as it should be?" ...|$|R
