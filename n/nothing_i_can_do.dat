5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E
500|$|The song created {{controversy}} over the writing credits. Steve Wallace, an Indiana songwriter, claimed he wrote [...] "Sometimes" [...] in 1990, but didn't copyright it until 2003, four years after Spears registered the song's copyright. Wallace claimed Spears confessed he wrote the song, by showing to the court a possible e-mail from the singer, which said, [...] "I now {{know for a fact}} that you wrote [...] But there's <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it. That's all I can say about it." [...] The e-mail was considered fake and the lawsuit was dismissed on October 31, 2005, when Judge John D. Tinder claimed the singer didn't steal the song.|$|E
500|$|On April 1, 2005, the {{official}} Tool website announced, as an April Fools' Day prank, that [...] "Maynard has found Jesus" [...] {{and would be}} abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently. Kurt Loder of MTV contacted Keenan via email {{to ask for a}} confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation. When Loder asked again, Keenan's response was simply [...] "heh heh". On April 7, {{the official}} site revealed that it was a hoax. During an interview Keenan later stated, [...] "It was April Fools'. If you fall for that on April Fools' Day, there's <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you." [...] He has been part of other April Fools' pranks related to Tool, including one in which he was said to be in critical condition after a tour bus accident.|$|E

500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E

[...] "That took a lot of courage. I always tell my mom there is <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> (hard as it is to be in politics, to be in public life, that I think is) harder than what she did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Saqib Ali {{was born}} on 21 January 1975 in Chicago, Illinois. He is Muslim and credits his parents, who are of Indian and Pakistani descent, as the reason he became {{involved}} in politics. [...] " [...] from a family where they were always having political debates around the house, but then I found out that among all these family members who had all these grand ideas, none of them ever voted. There was a sense that, 'I don't like the way things are, but there's <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it.' I thought: I'm going to show these people." ...|$|E
6000|$|This sent Miss Vane off again. [...] "Poor boy!" [...] she sighed, {{when she}} had come to herself. [...] "No, there's <b>nothing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for him, except to order some {{firewood}} from his benefactors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so," [...] Tom replied. [...] "If I am to go, {{it seems}} to me the sooner I go the better; there is <b>nothing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> here, and we shall all be restless and {{unsettled}} until I am off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The lady's name is Miss Van Hoyt," [...] he said slowly. [...] "I {{believe that}} she is of a very {{well-known}} American family. She came here with excellent recommendations; but, beyond her name, I really {{know very little about}} her. <b>Nothing</b> more <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you, Mr. Courage?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Initially, when Yang Yi {{was serving}} as a Master of Writing (尚書), Jiang Wan ranked lower than him, but {{both of them were}} later {{appointed}} as Chief Clerks under Zhuge Liang. Yang Yi viewed himself highly and saw himself as superior to Jiang Wan because he had been serving in Shu longer than Jiang. He openly expressed his dissatisfaction by grumbling and complaining. The others ignored him due to his poor choice of words in conveying his frustration, except for Fei Yi, who comforted him. Yang Yi once told Fei Yi, [...] "When the Chancellor (Zhuge Liang) died, I should have brought along my men and defected to Wei if I knew I'd end up in this situation today! I deeply regret but there's <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> now." [...] Fei Yi secretly reported Yang Yi's speech to the Shu imperial court. In 235, Yang Yi was stripped off his appointment, demoted to the status of a commoner, and exiled to Hanjia Commandery (漢嘉郡; around present-day Lushan County, Sichuan). While he was in Hanjia, Yang Yi wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court and used emotionally charged language to express his anger and lash out at the court. The court deemed Yang Yi's memorial defamatory so it ordered his arrest. Yang Yi committed suicide. His family returned to Chengdu after his death.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, Clarkson {{announced}} that the album would be released in Fall 2010. In January 2011, Clarkson stated that the album would be released in March 2011. In March 2011, Clarkson {{announced that}} the album had been pushed back to September 2011, explaining [...] "I realize that is a long time, but that’s {{the best time to}} release it apparently so I’m sorry for the wait, but I promise you it sounds great!" [...] Producer Darkchild told The Hollywood Reporter that it was a [...] "smart decision", while Claude Kelly remarked that the move could work in her favor, citing [...] "I will say that I'd be willing to bet that the reason it was pushed back was not for anything as horrible or earth-shattering as people think — it's probably (sic) a better setup". It was also reported that the delay was caused by the internal restructuring at Sony Music with the former Universal Music Group chairman Doug Morris entering as its new CEO. On July 11, 2011, several demo songs that Clarkson recorded, ranging from 50 to 70, were leaked into the internet, some of which were recorded in 2002 while Clarkson was still recording Thankful, and for Stronger. RCA immediately issued warnings to infringing websites, and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. Clarkson, who came home after spending a vacation in Tahiti, released a statement, saying [...] "I get back in the States from a vacation and somehow 50 of my songs are leaked on the Internet?! There's no point in getting angry because there's <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> I can't wait for everybody to hear my actual finished fifth album." [...] In an exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly, Clarkson responded to the situation: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wish it were," [...] I replied. [...] "Anyhow, Mrs. Bundercombe, {{you must}} really excuse me, {{but there is}} <b>nothing</b> more <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> The gentleman whom I {{addressed}} insisted upon it that his name was Mr. Joseph H. Parker. No doubt he was right. These likenesses are sometimes very deceptive," [...] I added feebly.|$|R

6000|$|... "You <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that, miss, safely enough. There is <b>nothing</b> {{now that}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for my master; {{but as for}} Master Walter, I would walk to China if I {{thought that there was}} a chance of finding him there." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I have <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> for him; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> for him. <b>I</b> {{felt that}} when {{we were trying to}} get him into parliament. If he could marry, and be independent, and powerful, and rich, it would be better, perhaps, for all of us." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Good-bye, my dear Colonel,' said he. 'I {{am afraid}} {{that you will have}} rather a lame account to give of your mission, when you find your way back to Massena, though, from all I hear, he will {{probably}} be too busy to think of you. I am free to confess that you have extricated yourself from your difficulties with greater ability than I had given you credit for.

6000|$|The girl nodded. “We haven’t any use {{for that}} word in our country. In fact, we have rather a liking for a presumptuous man {{so long as}} he is sensible,” she said. “Then there is <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you there?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope they}} won't do that," [...] said Lady Glencora. [...] "The play {{is too good}} {{to come to an}} end so soon. If we hear that Lord George is engaged to Lady Eustace, <b>nothing,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, <b>can</b> be <b>done</b> to stop the marriage." ...|$|R
