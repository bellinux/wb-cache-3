They asked the villagers the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> animals and the villagers answered, [...] "Labi-labi, tuan," [...] ("River terrapins, sir"). Because they didn't know the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> animals, the British officers referred to them as labis in the plural form. Therefore, the British officers decided to name the settlement Labis.|$|R

Although his statement is not admissible in court due to coercion, Tilman's information proves valuable to the investigators.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{had arisen}} before the Giro {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that many of 's sponsors in Kazakhstan had not paid their full obligations to the team, and that the riders had therefore not been paid their full salaries to that point in the season.

A 2nd-century curse tablet from Autun (Augustodunum) lists the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> to be cursed in Latin, two magic words in Greek, and a series of voces magicae. A defixio (binding spell) from Amélie-les-Bains seems composed in Celtic with bits of Latin. A lamella from Roman Britain has been interpreted as Hebrew written in Greek characters.|$|E

5|$|The inscriptions, {{particularly}} the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> killed, suffered {{from exposure to}} the elements.

Erosion continued in the years following and in lieu of re-carving them and causing further damage to the memorial, the names were recorded in a book which is held by the National Railway Museum.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{memorial}} archway at Macdonald College, two additional floors {{added to the}} existing Sir Arthur Currie gymnasium, a hockey rink and funding for an annual Memorial Assembly. A Book of Remembrance on a marble table contains the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> lost in both World Wars. On 11 November 2012 the McGill Remembers web site launched; the University War Records Office collected documents between 1940-1946 related to McGill students, staff and faculty in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The Memorial {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} some families of officers {{killed in the}} line of duty, regarding the high cost, and that the roll of honour lists only those officers killed during arrests or as a result of criminal acts, rather than all officers killed {{in the line of}} duty; also that, with the book being behind glass, friends and relatives of the deceased are not able to view the relevant page. Before construction, objections were also raised to the Memorial's construction by the London Historical Parks Group and the local residents' association. Concern was also raised by some Irish republicans that the Memorial includes the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> RUC officers killed in The Troubles.|$|E

5|$|Wesley {{attacks the}} base using {{explosive}} rats (a tactic {{he learned from}} the Exterminator), killing surviving Fraternity assassins,including The Repairman and the Butcher (who he kills in a knife fight) in a massive shootout. Entering Sloan's office, he is surrounded by Fox, Gunsmith and the remaining assassins. Wesley discloses Sloan's deception, to which Sloan reveals that the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> present had legitimately {{come up in the}} Loom, and that he had acted to protect them. He gives the members a choice: kill themselves, per the code, or kill Wesley and use their skills to control the world. As the others choose the latter, Fox curves a bullet around the room, choosing to follow the code and kill everyone, including herself, but not before throwing her gun to Wesley. Sloan escapes in the mayhem.|$|E
5|$|Milnrow War Memorial {{is located}} in Memorial Park at Newhey, and is a Grade II listed structure. The war {{memorial}} was originally sited in central Milnrow, set back from the road near Milnrow Bridge, and was unveiled on 3 August 1924 by Major General A. Solly-Flood, a former commander of 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. The memorial is constructed of sandstone surmounted by a bronze statue of a First World War infantryman with rifle and fixed bayonet symbolic of the young manhood of the district {{in the early days}} of the First World War. In selecting the design the Milnrow War Memorial Committee was influenced by the statue unveiled at Waterhead in Oldham; the work of George Thomas. Thomas sculpted Milnrow's memorial in 1923. The plinth holds bronze and slate panels recording the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who died in the two World Wars.|$|E
5|$|Suspension bridge using iron chains: Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that many early cultures employed the use of suspension bridges with cabled ropes, the first written evidence of iron chain suspension bridges comes from a local history and topography of Yunnan written in the 15th century, which describes the repair of an iron chain bridge during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424); although it is questionable if Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) Chinese claims that iron chain suspension bridges existed since the Han Dynasty, their existence in the 15th century predates that of anywhere else. K.S. Tom mentions this same repaired Ming suspension bridge described by Needham, but adds that recent research has revealed a document which lists the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who allegedly built an iron chain suspension bridge in Yunnan around the year 600 AD.|$|E

5|$|The {{clock and}} {{carillon}} (bell tower) of 23 bells was erected in 1922, {{the same year}} as Lutyens' memorial, on the corn exchange in the town centre. Three of the bells were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> involved in the commemorations. The corn exchange was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with the clock and carillon re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house the clock and carillon after the bells were cleaned. On Armistice Day (11 November) 1998, the Western Front Association unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance of the clock tower.|$|E
5|$|The main {{memorial}} to the brigade is the Teen Murti (three soldiers) memorial in New Delhi, a stone and bronze sculpture inscribed with the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> members of the brigade killed in action (see image in the info box). The three statues represent soldiers from the Indian States of Hyderabad, Mysore and Jodhpur. A memorial {{on the site of}} the fighting at Haritan is inscribed with the date of the battle, the units involved and details of the casualties. The Port Tewfik Memorial was erected at the Suez Canal to commemorate the 4,000 Indian officers and soldiers killed during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign who have no known grave. The brigade's capture of Haifa on 23 September is remembered by the present Indian Army as Haifa Day, and the Mysore and Jodhpur Lancers part in its capture was recognised by the British government, which awarded them the battle honour Megiddo.|$|E
5|$|Allward chose a {{relatively}} new construction method for the monument: limestone bonded to a cast concrete frame. A foundation bed of 11,000 tonnes of concrete, reinforced with hundreds of tonnes of steel, served as the support bed for the memorial. The memorial base and twin pylons contained almost 6,000 tonnes of Seget limestone. Sculptors carved the 20 approximately double life-sized human figures on site from large blocks of stone. The carvers used half-size plaster models produced by Allward in his studio, now {{on display at the}} Canadian War Museum, and an instrument called a pantograph to reproduce the figures at the proper scale. The carvers conducted their work year-round inside temporary studios built around each figure. The inclusion of the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> killed in France with no known grave {{was not part of the}} original design, and Allward was unhappy when the government asked him to include them. Allward argued that the inclusion of names was not part of the original commissioning. Through a letter to Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission in October 1927, Allward indicated his intention to relegate the names of the missing to pavement stones around the monument. The collective dismay and uproar of the commission forced Allward to relent and incorporate the names of the missing on the memorial walls. The task of inscribing the names did not begin until the early 1930s and employed a typeface that Allward designed for the monument.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{settlement}} of Springfield in the mid-18th century, the river has been at its heart.
