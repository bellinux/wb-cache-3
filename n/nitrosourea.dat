25|$|MDS {{most often}} {{develops}} without an identifiable cause. Risk factors include exposure to an agent {{known to cause}} DNA damage, like radiation, benzene, and certain chemotherapies; other risk factors have been inconsistently reported. It {{can be difficult to}} prove a connection between a suspected exposure and the development of MDS, but the presence of genetic abnormalities may provide some supportive information. Secondary MDS can occur as a late toxicity of cancer therapy (therapy associated MDS, t-MDS). MDS after exposure to radiation or Alkylating agents such as busulfan, <b>nitrosourea,</b> or procarbazine, typically occurs 3-7 years after exposure and frequently demonstrates loss of chromosome 5 or 7. MDS after exposure to DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors occurs after a shorter latency of only 1-3 years and can have a 11q23 translocation. Other pre-existing bone marrow disorders like acquired aplastic anemia following immunosuppressive treatment and Fanconi's anemia can evolve into MDS.|$|E

40|$|Normal (IMR- 90) and {{simian virus}} 40 -transformed (VA- 13) human embryo cells {{were treated with}} {{antitumor}} <b>nitrosoureas,</b> and the effects on cell viability and cell DNA were compared. All six <b>nitrosoureas</b> tested were more toxic to VA- 13 cells than to IMR- 90 cells as measured by decrease in cell proliferation or in colony formation. The <b>nitrosoureas</b> capable of generating alkylisocyanates produced a smaller difference between the cell types than did derivatives lacking this capacity. DNA damage was measured by alkaline elution in cells treated with four chloroethylnitrosoureas. Whereas VA- 13 cells exhibited dose-dependent interstrand crosslinking, little or none was detected in IMR- 90 cells. The IMR- 90 cells, however, exhibited {{at least as much}} DNA-protein crosslinking as did VA- 13 cells.

25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, <b>nitrosoureas,</b> tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. <b>Nitrosoureas</b> include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

50|$|Arabinopyranosyl-N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, {{also known}} as Aranose (Араноза) is a {{cytostatic}} anticancer chemotherapeutic drug of an alkylating type. Chemically it is a <b>nitrosourea</b> derivative. It {{was developed in the}} Soviet Union in the 1970s. It was claimed by its developers that its advantages over other nitrosoureas are a relatively low hematological toxicity (compared to other nitrosoureas available at that time) and a wider therapeutic index, which allows for its outpatient administration.|$|E
50|$|Unlike carmustine, {{lomustine}} {{is administered}} orally. It is a monofunctional alkylating agent, alkylates both DNA and RNA, {{has the ability}} to cross-link DNA. As with other <b>nitrosoureas,</b> it may also inhibit several key enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins. Lomustine is cell-cycle nonspecific.|$|R

50|$|Lomustine (INN), {{abbreviated}} CCNU (original {{brand name}} (formerly available) is CeeNU, now marketed as Gleostine), is an alkylating <b>nitrosourea</b> compound used in chemotherapy. It {{is closely related}} to semustine and is in the same family as streptozotocin. It is a highly lipid-soluble drug and thus crosses the blood-brain barrier. This property makes it ideal for treating brain tumors, which is its primary use. Lomustine has a long time to nadir (the time when white blood cells reach their lowest number).|$|E
50|$|MDS may {{be caused}} by {{environmental}} exposures such as radiation and benzene; other risk factors have been inconsistently reported. However, definitive proof of specific causes cannot be determined. Secondary MDS occurs as a late toxicity of cancer treatment, usually with a combination of radiation and the radiomimetic alkylating agents such as busulfan, <b>nitrosourea,</b> or procarbazine (with a latent period of 5 to 7 years) or the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors (latency 2 years). Both acquired aplastic anemia following immunosuppressive treatment and Fanconi's anemia can evolve into MDS.|$|E
40|$|O'-AIkylguanine, a DNA adduci {{formed by}} <b>nitrosoureas,</b> becomes {{the site of}} a point {{mutation}} during DNA synthesis by preferentially base mispairing with thymine rather than correctly base pairing with cytosine. To repair this adduct, cells contain a limited amount of 06 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (alkyltransferase), a protein which removes the alkyl group in a stoichiometric reaction. To prevent mutations, repair must occur before DNA replication takes place. Consequently, formation of point mutations is related inversely to the number of alkyltransferase molecules and directly to the rate of DNA synthesis. Bone marrow hematopoietic precursors, the target for nitrosourea-induced leukemia, are deficient in alkyltransferase activity. We questioned whether regen erating bone marrow is more susceptible to <b>nitrosoureas</b> than other organs due to persistently low levels of alkyltransferase activity during periods of increased cell proliferation and DNA synthesis.

50|$|The alkylating agents used in {{immunotherapy}} are nitrogen mustards (cyclophosphamide), <b>nitrosoureas,</b> platinum compounds, and others.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} {{heterogeneous effects of}} methylating agents on induction of DNA damage inducible genes in Escherichia coli. These studies employed E. coli mutants that have fusions of the lac operon to genes induced by treatment with sublethal levels of alkylating agents.

The current report extends these findings by analyzing gene expression caused by mechlorethamine, chloroethylnitrosoureas and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cis-DDP). The results demonstrate heterogeneous effects by these agents on gene expression. While 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -cyclohexyl- 1 -nitrosourea induces alkA, other <b>nitrosoureas,</b> mechlorethamine, and cis-DDP do not cause expression of this gene.

5000|$|Streptozotocin is a glucosamine-nitrosourea compound. As {{with other}} alkylating {{agents in the}} <b>nitrosourea</b> class, it is toxic to cells by causing damage to the DNA, though other {{mechanisms}} may also contribute.

[...] Streptozotocin is similar enough to glucose to be transported into the cell by the glucose transport protein GLUT2, but is not recognized by the other glucose transporters. This explains its relative toxicity to beta cells, since these cells have relatively high levels of GLUT2.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} chemotherapy, with <b>nitrosoureas</b> or dimethyl-triazeno-imidazole-carboxamide (DTIC), or {{immunotherapy}} with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), on cell-mediated immunity (CMI), and serum blocking factor (BF) to melanoma cells were studied in 23 patients. Studies were performed with autologous or allogenic melanoma target cells obtained from recent biopsy, in 16 mm diameter plastic wells. Assays for lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity and BF were performed at weekly intervals {{over the course}} of 3 - 4 mo, with some studies extending beyond 3 yr. The specificity of cytotoxicity was good with these methods. Nine patients given <b>nitrosoureas,</b> predominantly methyl-chloroethyl-cyclohexyl-nitrosourea, showed a transient decline in CMI from 42. 2 to 14 % 3 wk after administration of a single dose of the agent, with a rapid recovery within 1 week. 10 patients given 5 -day courses of DTIC at 3 -wk intervals showed no decline in CMI after two courses, and 7 of the 10 had no decline even after three courses. Three of the four patients who achieved a remission lost BF previously present: BF reappeared in both patients studied during a subsequent relapse. BCG intradermally or intralesionally elevated CMI within 2 mo after initiation of therapy, but despite continuation of the injections CMI returned to base line in all but two of the nine patients studied. These results indicate that chemotherapy for melanoma with <b>nitrosoureas</b> or DTIC at these schedules is not profoundly immunosuppressive towards tumor-specific immunity, as measured by our procedures. Putative immunotherapy with BCG at these schedules was likewise only transiently stimulatory...|$|R
40|$|The DNA repair enzyme, O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase), {{is thought}} to be the {{principal}} mechanism controlling resistance to <b>nitrosoureas</b> and related alkylating agents. We compared the sensitivities of five human testis and five bladder tumour cell lines to two <b>nitrosoureas</b> (N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU) and mitozolomide) with cellular levels of ATase. Enzyme levels ranged from 3 to 206 fmol mg- 1 protein (0. 1 x 10 (4) to 5. 1 x 10 (4) molecules/cell) in the testis lines and from 11 to 603 fmol mg- 1 (0. 4 x 10 (4) to 9. 1 x 10 (4) molecules/cell) in the bladder lines. Based on IC 50 s in an MTT assay, the testis tumour cell lines were, on average, four times more sensitive to MNU and six times more sensitive to mitozolomide than the bladder cell lines. The cytotoxicities of MNU and mitozolomide were closely related (R = 0. 9). In the testis cell lines ATase activity (molecules/cell) was related to IC 50 s for mitozolomide (R = 0. 97) but not MNU (R = 0. 78). In the bladder cell lines and overall, ATase activity correlated with cellular sensitivity to neither agent. Relatively high levels of resistance occurred in cells expressing low levels of ATase, and amongst cell lines expressing high levels of ATase, large differences in IC 50 s were observed. These results support the suggestion that resistance to <b>nitrosoureas</b> can be mediated by mechanisms other than ATase and that at relatively high levels of expression, ATase does not confer resistance in proportion to its activity...|$|R
40|$|Newly {{diagnosed}} glioblastoma is now commonly {{treated with}} surgery, if feasible, or biopsy, followed by radiation plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. The treatment of recurrent glioblastoma {{continues to be}} a moving target as new therapeutic principles enrich the standards of care for newly diagnosed disease.

40|$|<b>Nitrosourea</b> {{represents}} one of the most active classes of chemotherapeutic alkylating agents for metastatic melanoma. Treatment with nitrosoureas caused severe systemic side effects which hamper its clinical use. Here, we provide pharmacological evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction and IKKβ inhibition cooperatively enhance nitrosourea-induced cytotoxicity in melanoma cells. We identified SC- 514 as a ROS-inducing IKKβ inhibitor which enhanced the function of nitrosoureas. Elevated ROS level results in increased DNA crosslink efficiency triggered by nitrosoureas and IKKβ inhibition enhances DNA damage signals and sensitizes nitrosourea-induced cell death. Using xenograft mouse model, we confirm that ROS-inducing IKKβ inhibitor cooperates with <b>nitrosourea</b> to reduce tumor size and malignancy in vivo.

40|$|<b>Nitrosoureas</b> are {{the drugs}} most {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} patients with intracerebral malignant glioma. Their limiting toxicity is delayed myelosuppression. A prospective, randomised crossover study of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) was performed in patients receiving BCNU for relapsed glioblastoma, to investigate whether the resulting haematological toxicity profile could be modified by rhGM-CSF. Adequate data for analysis were obtained in 13 patients. Following BCNU, the nadir neutrophil count was higher in 12 out of 13 patients during the rhGM-CSF-protected cycles compared with the unprotected cycles. The median nadir was also significantly higher (1. 79, CI 0. 76 - 3. 52, P < 0. 005). Five episodes of neutropenia (< 2 x 10 (9) l- 1) occurred during the unprotected cycles compared with none in the rhGM-CSF-protected cycles (P = 0. 076).
