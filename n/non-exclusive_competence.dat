40|$|Abstract: The {{introduction}} of a competence catalogue in the TFEU by the Treaty of Lisbon eliminated the overlap between the preclusion of national lawmaking powers attributable to the exclusive character of EU competences and that stemming from the enactment of EU legislation, thus opening the doors to scholarly investigation of Union Preemption as a general theory {{of the effects of}} EU legislation in <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>competence</b> areas. The first aim of this work is to describe what Union Preemption is (“ Sein ”) {{in the context of the}} EU single market, thus allowing, given an item of EU legislation, to determine its preemptive scope by reference to certain “markers”, such as its legal form and the harmonization model it embodies. Against the background of the existing application uncertainties, this work further seeks to suggest what Union Preemption ought to be (“ Sollen ”) to meet the current needs of European integration, taking into account the diversity of situations where preemption issues arise and the changes in the legal, political, and economic context that have occurred in the single market since 1957. competences; harmonisation; subsidiarity; supremacy...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} the question how foreign policy fits within the constitutional {{structure of the}} European Union. It does so by analysing, in the particular field of foreign policy, certain key constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques that are fundamental to the legal organisation of the Union. The study {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part examines {{the way in which the}} principles of conferral and primacy, as well as the Community method operate within Community external relations, as compared to their operation with respect to internal Community policies (for instance, exclusivity as the typical expression of the primacy principle in the field of external relations). The second part draws a further contrast between these concepts, principles, and legal techniques as they apply in relation to the common foreign and security policy and their operation under Community external relations. The subject of the third part are constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques, which, in practice, have been found to have a more significant part to play in Union foreign policy than in its internal policies, in particular the principle of consistency, or which have developed specifically in the field of external relations, in particular the technique of mixity. Essentially, therefore, this is a study of the extent to which foreign policy is legally sui generis within the sui generis constitutional order of the European Union, and of how the common foreign and security policy is in turn sui generis within the foreign policy structure of the Union. It is not of course suggested that the constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques that are here analysed are the only significant ones in the constitutional organisation of the Union, just that they are particularly suited to illustrate the sui generis character of the legal arrangements that govern the conduct of EU foreign policy. The present study provides both an analysis of the constitutional reality of EU foreign policy and theoretical reflections at a critical distance, which suggest possibilities for reform.
