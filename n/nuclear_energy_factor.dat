The development and enhancement of students’ metacognition is strongly emphasized worldwide, including in Thailand. This study aim to explored the students’ metacognition on <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> topic of 219 secondary school students in the Northeast of Thailand with the Questionnaire of Metacognition on <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Energy</b> issues (QMNE) as five issues are nuclear reaction, transformation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy,</b> <b>nuclear</b> power plant, the radioactive, and <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> atom for life, and 20 students’ interview were employed for data collection. The analysis of the interview data suggested that the participants could not describe about <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> concept, goal, their purpose, only some student could describe how they think, and how they know about how they learn <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy.</b> The <b>factors</b> potentially impeded their development of awareness about learning process and metacognitive strategies were characteristics of content and students, learning processes, and student habit.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} causal relationship between <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption and economic growth using the data from six countries among 20 countries that have used <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> for more than 20 years until 2005. To this end, time-series techniques including the tests for unit roots, co-integration, and Granger-causality are employed to Argentina, France, Germany, Korea, Pakistan, and Switzerland. The main conclusion is that the causal relationship between <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption and economic growth is not uniform across countries. In the case of Switzerland, there exists bi-directional causality between <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption and economic growth. This means that an increase in <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption directly affects economic growth and that economic growth also stimulates further <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption. The uni-directional causality runs from economic growth to <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption without any feedback effects in France and Pakistan, and from <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> to economic growth in Korea. However, any causality between <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption and economic growth in Argentina and Germany is not detected. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption Economic growth Causality...|$|R

Using {{a modified version of}} the Granger causality test developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995), we found a unidirectional causality running from <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption to economic growth in Japan, Netherlands and Switzerland; the opposite uni-directional causality running from economic growth to <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption in Canada and Sweden; and a bi-directional causality running between economic growth and <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. In Spain, the United Kingdom and the USA, increases in <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption caused increases in economic growth implying that conservation measures taken that reduce <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption may negatively affect economic growth.

Currently, 79 percent of France’s electricity is derived from <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy.</b> 1 France has 58 active nuclear plants that produced 450 billion nuclear kilowatt-hours in 2006. The country is the world’s largest net exporter of electricity, as it generates an excessive amount at a very low cost. We {{will look at the}} political, social, economic, and environmental considerations that placed France ahead of most of the developed world in the arena of <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy.</b> Despite the fact that France is a <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> leader, the serious issue of completely safe disposal of nuclear waste has not been resolved. While France is considered a country with lower CO 2 emissions, and may emit less carbon than the countries dependent on fossil fuels, <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> is not free of greenhouse gasses (GHG), as many <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> proponents portray. Yet compared with the size of its economy and GDP, France is a nominal CO 2 emitter.

Second, the long-run income elasticity of <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> is larger than one, indicating that <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> is a luxury good. Third, the results of the Granger causality test find evidence of unidirectional causality running from real income to <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption in Japan. A bidirectional relationship appears in Canada, Germany and the U. K., while no causality exists in France and the U. S. We also find evidence of causality running from real oil price to <b>nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> consumption, except for the U.

To structure and quantify basic values for the evaluation, we elicited important attributes, then refined and structured them into a hierarchy. A multi-attribute index is constructed as a multi-attribute utility function, based on value judgments provided by a group of technical researchers, policy analysts, faculties, and government officers. The implications of the results are also discussed.
