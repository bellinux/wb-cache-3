5|$|Europa orbits Jupiter in {{just over}} {{three and a half}} days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900km. With an {{eccentricity}} of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter's equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Like its fellow Galilean satellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa's prime meridian is the line intersecting this point. Research suggests that the tidal locking may not be full, as a <b>non-synchronous</b> rotation has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>non-synchronous</b> {{transmission}} {{is a form}} of transmission based on gears that do not use synchronizing mechanisms. They are found primarily in various types of agricultural and commercial vehicles. Because the gear boxes are engineered without [...] "cone and collar" [...] synchronizing technology, the <b>non-synchronous</b> transmission type requires an understanding of gear range, torque, engine power, range selector, multi-functional clutch, and shifter functions. Engineered to pull tremendous loads, often equal to or exceeding 40 tons, some vehicles may also use a combination of transmissions for different mechanisms. An example would be a power take-off.|$|E

5000|$|The {{deterministic}} rendezvous {{problem is}} {{a variant of the}} rendezvous problem where the players, or robots, must find each other by following a deterministic sequence of instructions.

Typically, the robots act synchronously, though <b>non-synchronous</b> versions of the deterministic rendezvous problem exist.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Non-synchronous</b> {{transmissions}} are engineered {{with the}} understanding that a trained operator will be shifting gears in a known coordination of timing. Commercial vehicle operators use a double-clutching technique that is taught in driver's trade schools. The most skillful drivers can shift these transmissions without using the clutch by bringing the engine to exactly the right rpm in neutral before attempting to complete a shift, a technique called [...] "float-shifting." [...] With payloads of cargo ranging in commercial freight of 80,000 lbs (40 tons (short) or 36.3 tonnes) or more, some heavy haulers have over 24 ″gears″ (i.e., combinations of gear ratios) that an operator will shift through before reaching a top cruising speed of 70 mph (113 km/h). Many low-low (creeper) gears are used in farm equipment to plow, till, or harvest. Also see Engineering vehicle. An inexperienced operator could suddenly find a piece of heavy equipment stuck in the wrong gear under full power, or even worse unable to shift a runaway vehicle from neutral into a gear for braking effect when headed down a steep slope, unless he or she possessed the synchronizing skill and understood torque issues in <b>non-synchronous</b> transmissions. Many mountain roads require heavy equipment operators to remain in gear and not shift while operating down a steep grade. For more details about steep grade operation see either jake brake, or engine brake. Many other circumstances face operators of <b>non-synchronous</b> transmissions. Safety and operator skills need to be learned before operating any of these types of vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{any other}} type of transmission, <b>non-synchronous</b> {{transmissions}} often have a mechanism for slowing down, or stopping an idle gear. In commercial motor vehicles, this mechanism is called the clutch brake, and is used by depressing the clutch {{all the way to the}} floor, or pressing a button on the top of the gear lever. This is useful in 18-wheelers that have just started their diesel engines, and are releasing parking locks, and engaging the transmission from a stop. The clutch brake not only slows or stops the idle gear axis, but can also prevent shifting into gear until the clutch pedal is released a few inches off the floor. In order to shift into gear, the clutch must be half way off the floor, otherwise the clutch brake will prevent the transmission from being shifted into or out of gear. Mechanics must often repair or replace the clutch brake in a <b>non-synchronous</b> transmission when an inexperienced operator wears it out, it becomes inoperable, or has lost its function.|$|E
5000|$|The British grid is not {{synchronized}} {{with the}} Continental Europe frequency, {{but it is}} inter-connected via the HVDC Cross-Channel link and BritNed to an electricity interconnection level of 6%. [...] Similarly, the Nordic regional group of ENTSO-E (former NORDEL), composed of Norway, Sweden, Finland and {{the eastern part of}} the Danish networks, is not synchronized with the Continental Europe, but has a number of <b>non-synchronous</b> DC connections with the Continental Europe grid.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} interrogates {{the ground}} transponder {{with a series}} of pulse-pairs (interrogations) and, after a precise time delay (typically 50 microseconds), the ground station replies with an identical sequence of pulse-pairs. The DME receiver in the aircraft searches for reply pulse-pairs (X-mode= 12 microsecond spacing) with the correct interval and reply pattern to its original interrogation pattern. (Pulse-pairs that are not coincident with the individual aircraft's interrogation pattern e.g. not synchronous, are referred to as filler pulse-pairs, or squitter. Also, replies to other aircraft that are therefore <b>non-synchronous</b> also appear as squitter).|$|E
50|$|Some {{commercial}} applications use non-synchronized manual transmissions {{that require}} a skilled operator. Depending on the country, many local, regional, and national laws govern operation {{of these types of}} vehicles (see Commercial Driver's License). This class may include commercial, military, agricultural, or engineering vehicles. Some of these may use combinations of types for multi-purpose functions. An example is a power take-off (PTO) gear. The <b>non-synchronous</b> transmission type requires an understanding of gear range, torque, engine power, and multi-functional clutch and shifter functions. Also see Double-clutching, and Clutch-brake sections of the main article. Float shifting is the process of shifting gears without using the clutch.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{concepts}} {{related to}} this modern baseline are not usually termed a [...] "Space Elevator", but are similar in some way and are sometimes termed [...] "Space Elevator" [...] by their proponents. For example, Hans Moravec published an article in 1977 called [...] "A <b>Non-Synchronous</b> Orbital Skyhook" [...] describing a concept using a rotating cable. The rotation speed would exactly match the orbital speed {{in such a way}} that the tip velocity at the lowest point was zero compared to the object to be [...] "elevated". It would dynamically grapple and then [...] "elevate" [...] high flying objects to orbit or low orbiting objects to higher orbit.|$|E
