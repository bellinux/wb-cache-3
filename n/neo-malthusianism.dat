5000|$|<b>Neo-Malthusianism</b> is the {{advocacy}} of population control programs, to ensure resources for {{current and future}} populations. In Britain the term Malthusian can also refer more specifically to arguments made in favour of preventive birth control, hence {{organizations such as the}} Malthusian League. Neo-Malthusians differ from Malthus's theories mainly in their enthusiasm for contraception. Malthus, a devout Christian, believed that [...] "self-control" [...] (abstinence) was preferable to artificial birth control. In some editions of his essay, Malthus did allow that abstinence was unlikely to be effective on a wide scale, thus advocating the use of artificial means of birth control as a solution to population [...] "pressure". Modern [...] "neo-Malthusians" [...] are generally more concerned than Malthus was, with environmental degradation and catastrophic famine than with poverty.|$|E

One presents the revolution {{as a result of a}} conspiracy by the opposition and a result of the incompetence of the government of Nicholas II, which was not able to properly react to the situation at hand. The other interpretation proposes to evaluate the revolution in terms of <b>Neo-Malthusianism,</b> according to which the crisis was caused by long-term economic processes that did not depend on the will of the people...|$|E

This then lends to a discussion of the value of conserving natural resources {{in order to meet the}} moral obligations of present generations to future generations. Anthropogenic views of the value of conserving natural resources (for example, derived from utilitarian ethics) are contrasted with views stressing mankind’s obligations to nature (ecocentric views).

40|$|The {{signatory}} {{countries of}} the Convention on Biological Diversity set the objective of halting the decline of biodiversity by 2010, but as the target date arrived and passed, the status of biodiversity on the planet remained dismal. With {{the dawn of the}} UN Decade for Biodiversity at the Rio+ 20 Earth Summit in June 2012 and as the UN Biodiversity Strategic Plan moves forward, this article contextualizes biodiversity prospects in sub-Saharan Africa by examining the history of interactions between African communities and the environment, from the pre-colonial period to today. It provides a critical analysis of the current biodiversity conservation planning methodologies and pinpoints several inherent obstacles, including the <b>neo-Malthusianism</b> that dominates the thinking of certain wildlife experts. Setting out an argument with far-reaching implications for the success of future conservation efforts all over the world, the author examines the basis of emerging conservation approaches in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on the need to forge a more inclusive conservation practice and open up to the perceptions, representations and cultural universe of the Other. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} barriers to the acceptance of Neo-Malthusian discourse among anarchists and sympathizers {{in the first years}} of the 20 th century in Barcelona. Neo-Malthusian anarchists advocated the use and promotion of contraceptives and birth control as a way to achieve liberation while subscribing to a Malthusian perspective of nature. The revolutionary discourse was disseminated in Barcelona primarily by the journal Salud y Fuerza and its editor Lluis Bulffi from 1904 - 1914, at the same time sharing ideological goals with traditional anarchism while clashing with the conception of a beneficent and abundant nature which underpinned traditional anarchist thought. Given the cultural, social and political importance of anarchism to the history of Barcelona in particular and Europe in general, further investigation into <b>Neo-Malthusianism</b> and the response to the discourse is needed in order to understand better the generally accepted world-view among anarchists and how they responded to challenges to this vision. This is a topic not fully addressed by current historiography on Neo-Malthusian anarchism. This article is derived from my Master’s thesis in Contemporary History at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona entitled “Neomathusianismo, anarquismo y resistencias: Los límites de su aceptación en Cataluña”, which contains a further exposition of the ideas included herein, as well as a broader perspective on the topic...|$|E
40|$|In Polish {{social and}} {{economic}} discussion {{of the problems of}} population there were more opponents than advocates of the Malthus’s law. By criticizing the theory the opponents found the point of reference for their own principles. The publicists and scholars representing various circles and philosophies of life emphasized the need to standardize the level of fertility. They did not agree with the idea that the process of reproduction of population {{does not need to be}} connected with limitation of birth-rate. L. Krzywicki and Z. Daszyńska-Golińska who sympathized with socialistic tendencies did not agree with Malthus’s recommendation of sexual restraint. They thought that only social reforms and the improvement of conditions of living of the working class can influence their procreation activity. The publicists connected with Catholic church claimed that the creation of the law of population of <b>neo-malthusianism</b> is one of the consequences of theory of the English economist which, in their view, discredited its value. The economists who distanced from socialistic ideas frequently agreed with numerous theses of the law of population. One of them was the advocate of economic liberalism A. Krzyżanowski. The polemics on theory of population by Malthus in Polish, as well as in European commentary expanded the discussion and the exchange of opinions on {{social and economic}} relations. It also drew attention to the necessity of formulation of population politics. Many scholars who in their journals on the turn of XIXth century paid attention to the themes of population and who analysed the idea through the prism of Malhus’s theory used the experiences in the second Reich and included the demographic ideas to political programs of social and economic reconstruction of Poland...|$|E
40|$|A população brasileira vivenciou, no final do século passado, rapidíssimo declínio da fecundidade. Sua taxa de fecundidade, em três décadas, passou de 5, 8 para apenas 2, 3 ! O artigo analisa as atitudes e posições dos estudiosos da população diante de tal fenômeno. Para entendêlas, há de se levar em conta o contexto internacional polarizado pelos blocos socialista e capitalista. Entre os cientistas sociais brasileiros predominava, em oposição aos neomalthusianos e à política americana, posição clara contra a presença do Estado no campo da reprodução. Tinham duas fortes convicções: 1) não havia, em geral, demanda por anticoncepção e 2) o ritmo do crescimento populacional e seu tamanho eram neutros, do ponto de vista do bem-estar social. O grande embate ideológico está ultrapassado. A transição da fecundidade no Brasil já avançou muito. No entanto, há segmentos de mulheres, as mais pobres, que ainda carecem de informação e de acesso aos meios para regular sua prole. Por outro lado, a sociedade não está tirando partido de algumas oportunidades geradas pelo declínio da fecundidade, nem se preparando para enfrentar os novos desafios, que são conseqüência desse mesmo declínio. Ainda predominam silêncios, entre demógrafos e estudiosos da população, sobre esses aspectos. Since {{the late}} 1960 s the Brazilian {{population}} {{has gone through}} a very rapid decline in fertility. In just three decades the overall annual fertility fell from 5. 8 to only 2. 3. The present article analyzes the positions of the experts in the field of population studies regarding this phenomenon. To understand their positions and attitudes, the international context during the 1960 s and 1970 s must be taken into account, polarized as it was by the tension between the socialist and the capitalist blocks. The majority of Brazilian social scientists, opponents of <b>neo-Malthusianism,</b> were against any type of presence of the State in the field of human reproduction. They held two strong convictions: 1) there was no demand for contraception in Brazilian society and 2) the pace of the Brazilian population growth, as well as the size of the country's population, were "neutral," {{from the standpoint of the}} welfare of individuals. This ideological debate has since become outdated. The changes in fertility in Brazil are quite advanced. However, some women, especially the poorest, still receive no information about or access to the means needed to plan the number of children they wish to have. On the other hand, Brazilian society is also failing to take advantage of opportunities created by the fall in fertility, and is not preparing itself to face the new challenges resulting from this very fall. Many demographers and population researchers are still "silent" as to these aspects...|$|E
