5|$|The sand whiting's {{distinctive}} {{body shape}} and mouth placement is an adaptation to bottom feeding, {{which is the}} predominant method of feeding for all whiting species. All larger whiting feed by using their protrusile jaws and tube-like mouths to suck up various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean substrate, as well as using their <b>nose</b> <b>as</b> a 'plough' to dig through the substrate.|$|E
5|$|In regular service, the Pioneer Zephyr had {{its share}} of accidents. In 1939 it was {{involved}} in a head-on collision with a freight train that completely destroyed the cab. The train was rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident strengthened the desire of locomotive designers to move the cab back {{from the front of the}} locomotive to above a large <b>nose,</b> <b>as</b> on EMD F-unit and EMD E-unit locomotives.|$|E
5|$|The King Charles Spaniel and {{the other}} types of toy spaniels were {{crossbred}} with the Pug in the early 19th century {{to reduce the size}} of the <b>nose,</b> <b>as</b> was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face.|$|E

5|$|The feud between Mr. Perfect and Brutus Beefcake {{began at}} the 1990 Royal Rumble. Beefcake, whose gimmick {{included}} cutting his opponents' hair, was wrestling The Genius, Perfect's manager. When he began giving The Genius a haircut when Perfect interfered and caused a double disqualification. Perfect and Beefcake wrestled each other at WrestleMania VI, and Beefcake won the match. Perfect won the Intercontinental Championship on April 23, 1990 in a tournament final. He had caused Beefcake to be eliminated from the tournament by interfering in his match. Beefcake and Perfect {{had a series of}} matches at house shows leading up to their planned SummerSlam match. Shortly before SummerSlam, Beefcake was injured while he was standing on a beach and a female friend's knees hit him in the face while she was parasailing. Several bones in his face were legitimately broken, including his jaw and <b>nose.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the Texas Tornado replaced Beefcake in the SummerSlam match.|$|E

25|$|A nasobuccal {{membrane}} {{separates the}} mouth from the nose; respectively, the inferior oral cavity (the mouth) and the superior nasal cavity (the <b>nose).</b> <b>As</b> the olfactory pits deepen, said development forms the choanae, the two openings that connect {{the nasal cavity}} and the nasopharynx (upper part of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages). Initially, primitive-form choanae develop, which then further develop into the secondary, permanent choanae.|$|E
25|$|For the 2011 season, the car's {{splitter}} {{and nose}} configuration were redesigned: the splitter's braces were removed, and the splitter was made nonadjustable.

In the past, all cars were required to run the same exact grille arrangement, allowing for very little, if any, real differentiation between them.|$|E
25|$|A wound {{greater than}} 15mm in {{diameter}} can be corrected with a paramedian forehead flap, which will reconstruct either the entire nasal dorsum or the lateral {{wall of the}} <b>nose,</b> <b>as</b> required. The surgical management of such wounds (< 15nbsp&mm dia.) usually requires enlarging the wound as necessary, {{in order for the}} skin graft to comprehend the entire aesthetic subunit being corrected. Moreover, if the wound comprehends the dorsum and the lateral wall of the nose, then a cheek-advancement skin flap is the applicable correction for replacing the lateral nasal skin up to its junction with the dorsum; afterwards, a paramedian forehead flap is applied to resurface the nasal dorsum.|$|E

As Ireland tried to help Hall, his head rose above the table; Klebold shot him a second time, hitting him twice in the head and once in the foot. Ireland was knocked unconscious, but survived.|$|E
25|$|As the Red Wings {{opened the}} 2008–09 {{pre-season}} against the Montreal Canadiens, Lidström suffered a broken <b>nose</b> <b>as</b> a shot from Canadiens forward Christopher Higgins ricocheted {{and hit him}} in the face.

However, in the midst of dealing with tendinitis that had been bothering him all season, Lidström chose to sit out All-Star weekend, along with teammate Pavel Datsyuk. Consequently, Lidström and Datsyuk were both suspended one game by the NHL due to League policy for missing the All-Star Game without significant injury.|$|E

25|$|Often an {{incomplete}} cleft lip requires the same surgery as complete cleft. This {{is done for}} two reasons. Firstly the group of muscles required to purse the lips run through the upper lip. In order to restore the complete group a full incision must be made. Secondly, to create a less obvious scar the surgeon tries to line up the scar with the natural lines in the upper lip (such as {{the edges of the}} philtrum) and tuck away stitches as far up the <b>nose</b> <b>as</b> possible. Incomplete cleft gives the surgeon more tissue to work with, creating a more supple and natural-looking upper lip.|$|E
25|$|The Tornado F2 was {{the initial}} {{version of the}} Tornado ADV in Royal Air Force service, with 18 being built. It first flew on 5March1984 and was powered by the same RB.199 Mk 103 engines used by the IDS Tornado, capable of four wing sweep settings, and fitted to carry only two underwing Sidewinder missiles. Serious {{problems}} were discovered with the Foxhunter radar, which meant that the aircraft were delivered with concrete and lead ballast installed in the <b>nose</b> <b>as</b> an interim measure until they could be fitted with the radar sets. The ballast was nicknamed Blue Circle, which was a play on the Rainbow Codes nomenclature, and a British brand of cement called Blue Circle.|$|E
25|$|A {{secondary}} {{benefit of}} the mid-engine arrangement was that it created a smooth and streamlined nose profile.

Entry to the cockpit was through side doors (mounted {{on both sides of the}} cockpit) rather than a sliding canopy. Its unusual engine location and the long drive shaft caused some concern to pilots at first, but experience showed this was no more of a hazard in a crash landing than with an engine located forward of the cockpit. There were no problems with propeller shaft failure.|$|E
