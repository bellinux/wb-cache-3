Ethan decides to hide the damage until he is able to purchase glue by setting the dish's pieces <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> the cupboard.|$|E
25|$|The All-New Super Friends Hour {{departed}} somewhat {{from the}} previous series' formula by featuring villains using more elaborate methods to further their goals; as a rule {{they could not be}} reasoned with, requiring the heroes to use direct force to stop them. Beginning with Challenge of the Super Friends, several of the heroes' arch-villains from the comic books (such as Lex Luthor and The Riddler) began to feature prominently in comic-style stories. Throughout the series, plots often wrapped themselves up <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> the final minutes of an episode in the fashion of the typical comic books and deus ex machina.|$|E
25|$|Fair Copy (Reinschrift der Partitur) – a {{clean copy}} in ink {{of the full}} score. Wagner only drafted fair copies for Das Rheingold, Die Walküre and the first two acts of Siegfried. In {{the case of the}} Das Rheingold (Scenes 1-4), there was no full score as such, so the fair copy was the only copy of the full score. In the case of Siegfried (Act III) and the whole of Götterdämmerung the full scores were written <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> ink, so Wagner did not deem it {{necessary}} to draft a separate fair copy. The fair copy of Das Rheingold was, incidentally, the first fair copy Wagner ever made of one of his operas.|$|E

25|$|There {{are other}} ants with trap-jaws {{such as the}} extant Strumigenys, Mystrium, Myrmoteras and Anochetus along with the extinct Cretaceous age tribe Haidomyrmecini. One {{commonly}} accepted theory suggests that the trap-jaw actually evolved independently at least four different times in ants’ history. This is because {{with the use of}} DNA sequencing, the phylogenetic tree which found that those ants with trap-jaws were not nested <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> one portion of the tree. Instead they were found scattered around the tree. Therefore, it did not evolve once leading to the hypothesis of a common ancestor. Instead it evolved multiple times and each time it evolved it used a different feature of the ant’s mouth to produce the trap jaw. For instance, O. bauri’s trap jaw is built from the mandible joint; however, Strumigenys trigger is built from it upper lip. This type of evolution would be deemed as convergent evolution and the trap jaw would be considered an analogy. This is because they are all similar features but involved independently rather than a common ancestor.|$|E
500|$|The suburb is {{bisected}} principally by the A184. Built in 1959, {{the road}} is {{commonly referred to as}} the Felling bypass though it [...] "is really nothing of the kind" [...] as the road splits residential areas of Felling almost <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> half. Journey time by car or bus to Gateshead town centre from the western fringe is approximately seven minutes and twelve minutes into the centre of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, while the journey time from the eastern parts of Felling is approximately ten minutes longer. Until the building of the bypass, the principal road in the settlement was B1426 Sunderland Road; a former turnpike road and tram route where civic and commercial buildings still stand as a testament to the road's past importance. While diminished in stature today, Sunderland Road remains an integral local distributor.|$|E
500|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} the park constitutes [...] of land and can be accessed either by external entrances at the north-eastern corner {{of the park and}} West Park Road or internally from the central section through the dene or from Pets Corner. The north-eastern entrance consists of a pair of imposing gateposts and the view from this access point sweeps across the entire northern {{section of the}} park. The eastern perimeter of this section is a terraced walkway known as the Broadwalk with adjacent, banked bedded planting. A central path from the Broadwalk splits a large grassed area almost <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> half and leads to a lake and two child's play areas. A path circles the perimeter of the lake and seating is placed at the fringe of the lake at various points. To the south of the lake are three bowling greens and to the north are tennis courts. These cannot be seen from the lake due to a screen of plants. The plants within the screen are typical of those bedded throughout the park, which include French marigolds, roses, tulips, phlomis, sedum and silver dust.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his essay}} [...] "Preposterous Pleasures: Queer Theories and A Midsummer Night's Dream," [...] Douglas E. Green explores {{possible}} interpretations of alternative sexuality that he finds {{within the text}} of the play, in juxtaposition to the proscribed social mores of the culture at the time the play was written. He writes that his essay [...] "does not (seek to) rewrite A Midsummer Night's Dream as a gay play but rather explores some of its 'homoerotic significations'... moments of 'queer' disruption and eruption in this Shakespearean comedy." [...] Green states that he does not consider Shakespeare to have been a [...] "sexual radical," [...] but that the play represented a [...] "topsy-turvy world" [...] or [...] "temporary holiday" [...] that mediates or negotiates the [...] "discontents of civilisation," [...] which while resolved <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> the story's conclusion, do not resolve so <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> real life. Green writes that the [...] "sodomitical elements," [...] "homoeroticism," [...] "lesbianism," [...] and even [...] "compulsory heterosexuality" [...] in the story must be considered {{in the context of the}} [...] "culture of early modern England" [...] as a commentary on the [...] "aesthetic rigidities of comic form and political ideologies of the prevailing order." [...] Aspects of ambiguous sexuality and gender conflict in the story are also addressed in essays by Shirley Garner and William W.E. Slights albeit all the characters are played by males.|$|E
2500|$|Cancelled-to-order. [...] Cancelled-to-order stamps, {{also known}} as CTOs, are stamps that have been {{cancelled}} by a postal authority, but were never used to transmit mail. CTOs are created by postal authorities to sell the stamps cheaply to stamp collectors. [...] Many Eastern European countries and others sold great numbers of CTOs to collectors in the 1950s - 1990s strictly for revenue. [...] CTOs often may be identified as the stamps still retain their original gum. [...] Some authorities use the same canceller for all CTOs, and apply it very <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> the corner of four stamps at one time. In some instances, the [...] "cancellations" [...] are actually printed {{as part of the}} stamp itself.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, rumors {{circulated}} that Balakirev had suffered a nervous breakdown. Friends who visited him found no trace of his former self; in place of his former vivacity, energy and drive, they found him silent, withdrawn and lethargic. Borodin wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov that he wondered whether Balakirev's condition was little better than insanity. He was especially concerned about Balakirev's coolness toward musical matters, and hoped he would not {{follow the example of}} author Nikolai Gogol and destroy his manuscripts. He took a five-year break from music, and withdrew from his musical friends, but did not destroy his manuscripts; instead he stacked them <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> one corner of his house. In his mental state, he neglected to give up his post as director of the Free Music School, and the directors of the school were at a loss as to what to do. He finally resigned in 1874 and was replaced by Rimsky-Korsakov. [...] Nikolai Rubinstein offered him a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory but he refused, stating that his musical knowledge was basically empirical and {{that he did not have}} enough knowledge of music theory to take on such a position. Financial distress forced Balakirev to become a railway clerk on the Warsaw railroad line in July 1872.|$|E

2500|$|Restoration {{work began}} in April 2013 as a station rewire which quickly {{grew into a}} {{heritage}} inspired project. The view taken was to restore the station to a 1949 state with British rail branding and reminisces of the GER and LNER railways. As to use one era would prove too costly and the budget was only for a rewire. The paint scheme was chosen by the Fen line users and was based upon a GER steam unit which had blue red and gold, gardenia is a heritage colour used and was also chosen. GER cast iron benches were made locally by East Coast Castings in Wotton and BR style totems were hand-made alongside LNER station clocks and coat hangers. Ticket machine were relocated to more sensible positions and re-branded to match the aesthetics intent. Platforms were resurfaced and LED lighting installed [...] throughout public areas along with new CCTV. Station posters and advertising boards were replaced with colour matched ones and located <b>neatly</b> <b>in</b> line. Station posters were also produced in a BR style header format to make {{the look and feel}} more memorable. A Norfolk county flagpole was installed to replace the old one and canopies and roof restored and or replaced. All in it cost under £1.1million. The project was jointly funded by First Capital Connect and Network Rail. The project's completion was marked with Michael Portillo unveiling a plaque in the booking hall area on 22 July 2014.|$|E
