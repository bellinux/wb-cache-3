Several fuels are {{shown to have}} shorter ignition-delay intervals and less variation in delay intervals at moderate and sub-zero temperatures than crude <b>N-ethylaniline</b> (monoethylaniline),a rocket fuel in current use...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of 2 -(arylaminomethyl) phenylboronic acid via an amination–reduction reaction {{has been investigated}} within a model system comprising 2 -formylphenylboronic acid and <b>N-ethylaniline.</b> Adoption of the appropriate reaction conditions influences the reactivity of 2 -formylphenylboronic acid, enabling efficient {{synthesis of}} so-far unobtainable 2 -(arylaminomethyl) phenylboronic compounds.

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study {{was done to}} determine if a wipedfilm evaporator could be successfully used to reduce the volume of five nitro-organic still bottoms streams. The 3. 8 million pounds per year of waste are currently incinerated. The wiped-film evaporator was successfully employed in the recovery of n-ethylmetatoluidine, metaphenylenediamine, n,n-diethylmetatoluidine, aniline, n,n-diethylanilhe, and <b>n-ethylaniline.</b> A production WFE would reduce the amount of material currently wasted by 41 % to 2. 2 million pounds a year. The recovered products represent an annual net increase of 1. 6 million dollars. A byproduct discovered in the waste, o-aminophenol, represents an additional $ 617, 000 annual increase in revenue...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{comparison}} of two carbamic pesticides, chlorpropham and phenisopham, {{was carried out in}} terms of both photodegradability and ecotoxicity. The photochemical behaviour of the two pesticides was investigated under environmental-like conditions (aqueous media, UVB or solar irradiation). The photochemical kinetic parameters were calculated by irradiating 5 105 M solutions (H 2 O–CH 3 CN, 9 : 1 v/v) using UVB lamps. For chlorpropham and phenisopham similar half-life times (39. 0 and 55. 0 min) were determined. Irradiation by sunlight leads to longer degradation half-life times (about 3 months), while it is possible to observe the formation of the same photoproducts. The well-known dechlorination reaction to a hydroxyphenylcarbamate was observed for chlorpropham. Phenisopham undergoes photo-Fries reaction to give rearranged products (hydroxybenzamides) and fragmentation products (hydroxyphenylcarbamate and <b>N-ethylaniline).</b> Acute and chronic toxicity tests of pesticides and their photoproducts were performed on organisms from two levels of the freshwater aquatic chain, the anostraca crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. The acute results showed that chlorpropham had median lethal concentrations for the crustacean T. platyurus and the rotifer B. calyciflorus of 10. 16 and 35. 19 mg L 1, respectively, and phenisopham did not show any acute toxicity as the derivatives up to 10 mg L 1. The only exception was <b>N-ethylaniline</b> which exhibited an acute LC 50 value of 0. 46 mg L 1. Phenisopham was the most toxic in the long term exposure while its five derivatives showed lower chronic potential for rotifers and algae. The same trend was observed for chlorpropham except for rotifers...|$|E
40|$|Industrialization and {{modernization}} in now a days {{has made a}} strong demand of steel and their maintenance for a strong infrastructure for {{every country in the}} race of survival, stabilization, growth and competition. Atmospheric corrosion can aggressively accelerate the rate of degradation of steel during their manufacturing, processing, storage and transportation. In these cases, traditional methods to prevent corrosion are not suitable which provide scope of Vapour Phase Corrosion Inhibitors (VPCI) in industries, defense and daily life. Cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB) was tested for mild steel in different aggressive atmospheric conditions by Weight loss test, Eschke test, Salt spray test, Sulphur dioxide (SO 2) test at 50 oC and results of these tests were supported by Metallurgical research microscopy and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Synergistic effect of CTAB were performed with Ethylamine (EA), N,N,N,N-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and <b>N-Ethylaniline</b> (NEA) to enhance the percentage corrosion inhibition efficiency (PCIE) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{two important}} {{features of the}} diffusion of liquids into a molten polymer matrix: the dependence of the mutual diffusion coefficient on the liquid miscibility and molar mass of polymers. In addition, a theological approach is chosen for its capacity to support modeling, and the mutual diffusion coefficient expressed with the free-volume theory, is estimated by an inverse method. For that purpose, the diffusion process of 2, 3 -epoxypropyl-phenylether (EPPE) and the <b>N-ethylaniline</b> (NEA) in three molten poly(ethylene-co-vinyle acetate) elastomers (EVA) having different molar masses is examined. The NEA is fully miscible with EVA and its diffusion process is not dependent on the molar mass of the polymer. On the other hand, the diffusion process of EPPE, that is partially miscible with EVA, is strongly influenced by the molar mass of the EVA. Furthermore, {{the evolution of the}} concentration gradient during the diffusion process of EPPE is driven by the necessity for the mixture to form a two-phase system with an EVA-rich phase and an EPPE-rich phase. In this case, the concentration gradient through the sample is not continuous at a macroscopic scale. Consequently, the calculation procedure is only applied during {{the early stages of the}} diffusion. For EPPE, the variation of the mutual diffusion coefficient with the molar mass of EVA is taken into account through the variation of the interaction parameter. Actually, despite the imperfections of the model, our experimental observations and theological inverse calculation of the diffusion process are in agreement with the findings of the free volume theory of the diffusion...|$|E
