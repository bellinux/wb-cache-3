5|$|In Ukraine, a {{study of}} the origins of the {{political}} abuse of psychiatry was conducted for five years {{on the basis of the}} State archives. A total of 60 people were again examined. All were citizens of Ukraine, convicted of political crimes and hospitalized on the territory of Ukraine. <b>Not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> it turned out, was in need of any psychiatric treatment.|$|E

They squared {{off in the}} Sultan's palace over a billiard table. Armstrong was advised by Abu Bakar that while the {{inhabitants}} of Singapore and the Malay peninsula were good at varied professions, agricultural labor was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Abu Bakar told Armstrong that the Malay states were importing plantation labor from China and India.|$|E
5|$|Belize {{received}} a universality invitation from the Tripartite Commission {{to send a}} judoka competing in the men's middleweight category (90kg) to the Olympics. This was Renick James's Olympic debut. He participated in the men's 90 kilograms event. Only six judokas participated in the round of 64, and James was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> He lost 100-000 in the round of 32 against Ovini Uera of Nauru. Uera went on to lose his next bout against Varlam Liparteliani of Georgia. Liparteliani also {{went on to win}} a silver medal.|$|E

5|$|Since then, Jackson {{has further}} {{clarified}} {{the origins and}} the nature of the bad blood between the two. According to Jackson, the rivalry exists because he was one of the few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid to eat or be in an elevator with Silva, but he was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> He added that the bad blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him on the internet to account for the bad blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E

25|$|GSN {{offered a}} version called Match Game: Interactive {{on their own}} website that allowed users to play along with the show while watching.

25|$|Some {{critical}} data on HCBS waivers comes from research {{done by the}} AARP Public Policy Institute, which has collected 38 studies regarding HCBS programs.

25|$|Some {{businesses}} {{maximize their}} profit margins through vertical integration; book publishing is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Although {{newspaper and magazine}} companies still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do.

25|$|Development of {{the game}} stopped when Vivendi merged with Activision to form Activision Blizzard. On July 28, 2008 Activision Blizzard (the {{publisher}} of Vivendi's and Sierra's titles) announced that only five franchises would be released through Activision. Ghostbusters was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and was put in developmental limbo following the announcement. The Sierra PR team later confirmed that the game was not {{and would not be}} cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only did}} Seurat decline to make {{absolutely}} clear the social {{status of the}} major figures in Bathers, but neither did he show them performing a public role of any kind. Their faces {{are for the most}} part shown in profile, and <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> faces {{in the direction of the}} viewer. The anonymity and ambiguity with which these figures are painted was never again to feature so prominently in any major painting from Seurat.|$|E

He acknowledges that sometimes the senses can deceive, but only with respect to objects that are very small or far away, and that our sensory knowledge on the whole is quite sturdy. The Meditator acknowledges that insane people might be more deceived, but that he is clearly <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and needn't worry himself about that.|$|E

25|$|In 1957 four Big Ten {{teams were}} picked in {{pre-season}} polls {{to finish in}} the Top 10, but Ohio State was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and in their opener, the Buckeyes lost to TCU, their third defeat in a row. For {{the only time in}} its history, however, the team won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, win the Rose Bowl over Oregon, and share a national championship title with Auburn. Hayes was also named Coach of the Year.|$|E
25|$|Sedgwick's four {{brothers}} were educated for the law: they naturally followed the profession {{in which their}} father, Judge Sedgwick, had been eminent, yet <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> followed him in the political career {{in which he had}} been equally distinguished. The eldest, Theodore, practiced law in Albany; Harry and Robert, in New York; Charles, the youngest, in his home town. Her talents seem to have been from the first justly appreciated by her brothers, Henry and Theodore, whose judicious encouragement was acknowledged in the preface to a new edition of her works in 1849.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern Europe the General Jewish Labour Bund {{called for}} Jewish {{autonomy}} within Eastern Europe and promoted Yiddish as the Jewish national language. Like Zionism, the Bund {{was founded in}} 1897 {{and it was one}} of the largest socialist movements in Europe, however it did not grow as fast as Zionism. The Bund campaigned for Jewish autonomy and recognition of Jewish (non-territorial) national rights within a post-socialist Russia. Initially the Bund included Zionist Socialist parties but over time the leadership came to oppose Zionism and Orthodox Judaism. The socialist movement recognized various national groups, but the Jews were <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The socialist movement was generally unwilling to combat worker anti-Semitism and often failed to publicly condemn pogroms.|$|E

25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E
25|$|To {{make the}} {{comparison}} more obvious, the opera {{is set in}} a pseudo-Wild West America, with Mahagonny itself placed somewhere far from the rest of civilization. America was the land of unbridled capitalism, the frontier just as much so. The only difference is that bourgeois civility and civilization has yet to occupy the frontier, and thus there is no hiding the nature of capitalism beneath the facade of gentlemanly conduct. In Mahagonny, the characters are prostitutes, lumberjacks, criminals, and the like. <b>Not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> comes from the moneyed class, and yet the same system of exploitation was set up, but in a more naked manner. Instead of seducing a woman's love with power and influence, the residents of Mahagonny pay for a prostitute. But in Mahagonny, poverty is not just a condition the poor bring upon themselves, but a crime to be punished. Thus, Brecht and Weill tried to display capitalism as the meatgrinder they believed it to be.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1861, the Russian {{corvette}} Posadnik (Посадник, 1856), captained by Nicolai Birilev, {{arrived in}} Tsushima {{island in the}} inlet of Ozaki, the captain demanding landing rights. This event triggered fear in the Japanese Shogunate, as the Russians had already attempted to breach Japan's isolation policy in the northern island of Hokkaido with the events involving Adam Laxman in 1792, the burning of villages there in 1806, and the events leading {{to the arrest of}} Vasilii Golovnin in 1811. At that time, only a few Japanese ports were open to foreign ships (Hakodate, Nagasaki, Yokohama), and Tsushima was clearly <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> thus suggesting unfriendly intentions {{on the part of the}} Russians. If taken over by the Russians, Tsushima could have become an effective base for further aggression. Japan received British help to support its policy. As tension rose, a second Russian ship arrived, and requests were made by the Russians to build a landing base and to receive supplies.|$|E
