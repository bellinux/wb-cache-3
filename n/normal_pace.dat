40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of three electronic apex locators (EAL), electric pulp tester (EPT) and diathermy on pacemaker function in vitro. Materials and Methods: Three EALs: Root ZX (J. Morita Co., Tustin, CA, U. S. A.), Propex (Dentsply), Mini Apex locator (SybronEndo, Anaheim, CA, USA), EPT (Parkell pulp vitality tester Farmingdale, NY, USA) and Diathermy (Neomed 250 B) were tested for any interference with one pacemaker (A medtronic kappa KVDD 901 -serial number: PLE 734632 S). Directly connecting the pacemaker lead with the EAL/EPT/diathermy operating on a flat bench top, the telemetry wand was held directly over the pacemaker to monitor the pacing pattern for a period of 30 s. Pacemaker activity was continuously recorded on the telemetric programmer and electro gram (EGM) readings examined for pacer inhibition, noise reversion or inappropriate pacemaker pulses. Results: All the three apex locators showed no pacing interference or background noise during its function or at rest. The EGM readings of EPT showed varying levels of background noise in between pacing however, this did not affect the <b>normal</b> <b>pacing</b> pattern and the pacing interval remained constant. EGM readings of diathermy showed an increase in the pacing interval (irregular pacing pattern) followed by complete inhibition of the pacing system. Conclusion: The tested EALs do not interfere with cardiac pacemaker function. The tested EPT showed varying levels of background noise but does not interfere with cardiac pacemaker function. Use of Diathermy interfered with the <b>normal</b> <b>pacing,</b> leading to complete inhibition of the pacing system...|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} season O'Neill was Australia's leading batsman {{during the}} 1959–60 tour to Pakistan and India, {{where he was}} a part of the last Australian team to win a Test on Pakistani soil for 39 years. After a quiet match in the First Test eight-wicket win in Dacca in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), in which he scored two and 26 not out, O'Neill played a key role in the victory in the Second Test in Lahore that was to Australia's last in Pakistan until 1998. O'Neill made his maiden Test century of 134 in the first innings to give Australia a 245-run lead. He then took his maiden Test wicket in Pakistan's second innings, that of Shujauddin. This left Australia chasing a target of 122 in the last two hours on the final day. The chase was on schedule with O'Neill partnering Neil Harvey when the Pakistanis began wasting time to prevent an Australian victory. This was implemented by swapping fielders very slowly when the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single, and overs began taking seven minutes instead of three. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away when a ball was aimed at the stumps and threw away his wicket by letting himself be bowled for 37. This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give no opportunity to waste time by switching the field. Benaud then threatened Pakistani captain Imtiaz Ahmed with a formal complaint over the time-wasting, and proceesings returned to their <b>normal</b> <b>pace.</b> Australia made the target with a few minutes to spare, with O'Neill on 43. O'Neill failed to make double figures in the final Test, which was drawn, but ended the series with 218 runs at 72.66. In another tour match, against the President's XI, O'Neill scored an unbeaten 52 in a low-scoring match as Australia stumbled to their target of 116 with only three wickets in hand.|$|E

Starting from 3 weeks after ovariectomy, female rats were orally treated with ferutinin at the doses of 0. 2 and 0. 5 mg/kg, daily for 4 weeks. Ferutinin's effect was compared with that of estradiol benzoate, subcutaneously injected at the dose of 1. 5 mug/rat twice a week. Animals were tested for sexual motivation, receptivity and proceptivity after 1, 2 and 3 weeks of treatment and for paced mating behavior after 4 weeks of treatment. Before each experimental test, they received progesterone injection (500 mug/rat). Both dosages of ferutinin significantly increased the receptive behavior in a time-dependent manner, as well as estradiol benzoate did. Also proceptive behaviors increased in ferutinin-treated animals in comparison with control ones. During the partner preference test ferutinin was able to induce a significant preference for a sexually active male over a sexually receptive female. Moreover, ferutinin restored a <b>normal</b> <b>paced</b> mating behavior, which had been suppressed by ovariectomy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of a short burst in power output midway through a 10 km cycle time trial and its relationship to RPE growth. We hypothesized that a break-away effort in non-normal pacing will cause a disruption in <b>normal</b> <b>pacing</b> strategy. However, a return to the cyclists pre-determined template would occur prior to completion of the time trial. Ten subjects performed a maximal incremental cycling test followed by a total of four 10 km cycling time trials. The first two trials were to habituate the subjects and to establish a baseline performance. The final two trials were randomized and consisted of a spontaneously paced 10 km cycling time trial and a 10 km cycling time trial during which subjects were required to increase velocity (maximum effort) for 1 km. The results of the study indicate that a burst in power output during a 10 km time trial does have an effect on overall power output and RPE growth.

50|$|Gata5 is a {{transcription}} factor. Gata5 {{regulates the}} proper {{development of the}} heart. Early in embryo development, Gata5 helps {{in making sure that}} there are enough heart muscle precursor cells produced to differentiate into the final myocardial cells. It also regulates other genes that are crucial to successful heart development. As pregnancy progresses, Gata 5 is involved in the specification of the heart tissue that becomes the ventricles. Problems can arise when Gata5 is overexpressed. This overexpression can lead to ectopic foci. Ectopic foci are also known as ectopic pacemakers. They are bundles of cells that can cause cardiac pacing that are located in places in the heart where they’re not supposed to be. These cells can become excited before the heart is supposed to be excited. This causes the heart to beat and thus contract before it should. Oftentimes, this is not a big deal and the heart naturally reverts to its <b>normal</b> <b>pacing.</b> However, if it’s caused by problems with development in the heart - if Gata5 did not express properly in the embryo- then this can lead to constant ectopic foci problems. These problems include tachycardia (the heart beating too fast), bradycardia (the heart beating too slow), or ventricular fibrillation which is a serious condition where the ventricles of the heart aren’t pumping consistently and can’t get blood out to the body.|$|R

5000|$|Sinoatrial arrest (also {{known as}} sinus arrest or sinus pause) {{is a medical}} {{condition}} wherein the sinoatrial node of the heart transiently ceases to generate the electrical impulses that normally stimulate the myocardial tissues to contract and thus the heart to beat. It is defined as lasting from 2.0 seconds to several minutes. Since the heart contains multiple pacemakers, this interruption of the cardiac cycle generally lasts {{only a few seconds}} before another part of the heart, such as the atrio-ventricular junction or the ventricles, begins pacing and restores the heart action. This condition can be detected on an electrocardiogram (ECG) as a brief period of irregular length with no electrical activity before either the sinoatrial node resumes <b>normal</b> <b>pacing,</b> or another pacemaker begins pacing. If a pacemaker other than the sinoatrial node is pacing the heart, this condition is known as an escape rhythm. If no other pacemaker begins pacing during an episode of sinus arrest it becomes a cardiac arrest. This condition is sometimes confused with sinoatrial block, a condition in which the pacing impulse is generated, but fails to conduct through the myocardium. Differential diagnosis of the two conditions is possible by examining the exact length of the interruption of cardiac activity.If the next available pacemaker takes over, it is in the following order: ...|$|R

Patients with previous coronary artery disease and hypertension have an increased risk of developing heart failure. Therefore, we studied the effect of sunitinib on the contractility of isolated human atrial trabeculae and the effect on recovery after ischemic stimulation. After informed consent, the atrial appendage of patients undergoing cardiac surgery was harvested and isolated trabeculae were placed in an organ bath with a force transducer. During electrical stimulation, contractile force was measured during <b>normal</b> <b>pacing</b> or after simulated ischemia. Of each patient, one trabecula was perfused with control and one with sunitinib. Contractile force (expressed as percentage of baseline force) declined over time to 57 +/- 8 and 73 +/- 20 % after 150 min of stimulation for solvent- and sunitinib-treated trabeculae, respectively (mean +/- SE; n = 8; p > 0. 1).

Sunitinib at low, but clinically relevant, concentrations does not have a direct effect on function of human atrial cardiomyocytes nor does it attenuate the recovery in contractile force of atrial cardiomyocytes after a period of ischemia.
