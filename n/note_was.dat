5|$|Born in Oldham, Lancashire, {{the son of}} a musician, Walton was a chorister {{and then}} an {{undergraduate}} at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of <b>note</b> <b>was</b> a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score.|$|E
5000|$|The redbacks {{and change}} <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> {{redeemed}} and cut-cancelled. The <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> cut-cancelled {{to keep them}} from going out the back door and coming back in the front door to be redeemed again. These <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> highly sought after by collectors. A few <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> never redeemed or cut-cancelled; those <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> valued more highly.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} in denominations of 50 fenings/pfenigs, 1 mark, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 marks. 200-mark <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> added in 2002, whilst the 50-fening/pfenig, 1- and 5-mark <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> later withdrawn from circulation. All current <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> valid throughout the country.|$|R
50|$|In 1877, Norges Bank {{introduced}} {{notes for}} 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 kroner. In 1917, 1-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued, and 2-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued between 1918 and 1922. Because of metal shortages, 1- and 2-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> again issued between 1940 and 1950. In 1963, 5-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> replaced by coins, {{with the same}} happening to the 10-krone notes in 1984. 200-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced in 1994.|$|R
5|$|Much {{of eastern}} Cuba, already under storm alert, was placed under a State of Emergency {{due to the}} threat of Georges. President Castro {{emphasized}} the severity of the hurricane during a two-hour address to the nation on September23. He explained, in great detail, civil preparation maps and impacts from past hurricanes. His last <b>note</b> <b>was</b> that he would refuse any aid from the United States as they (Cuba) would not accept aid from a country that has an embargo on them.|$|E
5|$|After Parliament was {{dissolved}} in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election that cost the candidates £35,000. With {{the death of}} William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which {{took the form of}} the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government apparently offered Coke a peerage, which he refused, and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery, which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806. Fox's death made Parliament lose some of its appeal to Coke, as they had been close friends. His attendance {{in the next two years}} was very limited, and the next occasion of <b>note</b> <b>was</b> his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{the number of}} men that joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, a large number of such personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of <b>note</b> <b>was</b> the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E
50|$|In 1908, {{banknotes}} {{were introduced}} {{by the government of}} Zanzibar in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 100 rupees. 50- and 500-rupee <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> added in 1916, and 1-rupee <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued in 1920. All Zanzibari <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> withdrawn in 1936. All of these <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> very rare and valuable.|$|R

50|$|<b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> {{issued in}} {{denominations}} of 1 rupee by the Indian government and 5, 10 and 100 rupees by the Reserve Bank of India. The <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> in designs {{very similar to}} the standard Indian <b>notes</b> but <b>were</b> printed in different colours. While the 1 rupee and 10 rupee <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> printed in red, the 5 rupee <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> printed in orange and the 100 rupee <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> printed in green. The serial numbers of the banknotes issued in all denominations were prefixed by a Z.|$|R
5|$|Further {{denominations}} {{ranging from}} $5000 to $500 million were issued {{in the period}} between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded. In {{the second quarter of}} 2008, special Agro cheques (Agricultural Cheques) were issued in denominations ranging from $5 billion to $100 billion as the currency exchange rate was floated. Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried time limits and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 cheque was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite having its expiry date extended twice. The $100000000 Bearer Cheque would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200000 <b>note</b> <b>was</b> legal tender.|$|E
5|$|In September 1915, {{after the}} Italian {{declaration}} of war on the Central Powers, {{the transfer of the}} B-class boats to the Adriatic was suggested by the Admiralty. Originally they were to be based at Brindisi, but this was changed to Venice as there were already 14 British and French submarines based at Brindisi. B4, B7, and B9 were the first to arrive, but B4 collided en route with the Italian tug escorting them and required immediate docking upon her arrival. B9 made the first patrol on 18 October and a total of 81 patrols were made by the B-class submarines before they ceased in October 1916. Nothing of <b>note</b> <b>was</b> directly accomplished by the submarines, but they fulfilled the ultimate goal of keeping the Austro-Hungarians from attacking the Italian coast.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{appointed}} Army General Maxwell D. Taylor as his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Taylor, {{like most}} Army brass, {{was a major}} supporter of the Zeus program. Kennedy and Taylor initially agreed to build a huge Zeus deployment with seventy batteries and 7,000 missiles. McNamara was also initially {{in favor of the}} system, but suggested a much smaller deployment of twelve batteries with 1,200 missiles. A contrary <b>note</b> <b>was</b> put forth by Jerome Wiesner, recently appointed as Kennedy's scientific advisor, and chair of the 1959 PSAC report. He began to educate Kennedy on the technical problems inherent to the system. He also had lengthy discussions with David Bell, the budget director, who came to realize the enormous cost of any sort of reasonable Zeus system.|$|E
50|$|Used bank <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> less {{desired by}} {{collectors}} {{in comparison to}} uncirculated bank notes. However, many old, rare bank <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> valuable to collectors when uncirculated <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> not available at an affordable price.|$|R
50|$|In September 1942, non-serialised {{currency}} <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> {{issued in}} denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 cents {{as a response}} to a shortage of old coins. The cent <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> of a simpler design, lacking plantation crops on the obverse; the 50 cent <b>note</b> <b>is</b> an exception. The cent <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> noticeably smaller than dollar notes.|$|R
50|$|On 8 December 1999, to {{celebrate}} the coming 2000 millennium, 3 million $2 millennium <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> circulated.

These millennium <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> printed on paper as polymer <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> not introduced yet then.|$|R
5|$|One {{member of}} the Commission, the chief {{accountant}} of the Ministry of Finance, A. van Gijn, objected to the report's conclusions. He provided a note to Queen Wilhelmina, which argued that advocates of building large warships had forced {{their views on the}} other members of the commission. Moreover, he believed that the proposed fleet would be inadequate given the rapid naval expansion being undertaken by the major powers, and that if it was adopted there would be a requirement to buy further dreadnoughts in order to keep pace. This <b>note</b> <b>was</b> included as an appendix to the Commission's report.|$|E
5|$|State Shinto {{was heavily}} {{emphasised}} in the 1930s {{as a means}} to promote Japanese nationalism and acculturalisation of Palauans to Japanese norms. A few shrines were built around Palau during the 1930s. Of particular <b>note</b> <b>was</b> the completion of the Taisha Nanyo Jinja (transliterally the Great Southern Shrine) in November 1940 at Koror, which subsequently served as the central shrine in Micronesia. Civilian participation of Shinto rituals was heavily emphasised, which focused on Japanese cultural ideals and worship of the Japanese emperor. Shinto, Zen Buddhist and Tenrikyo missions were also encouraged to establish religious missions, and the first Buddhist temple in Palau was erected in 1926, mainly to cater to the spiritual needs of the Japanese settlers. Early Japanese settlers reportedly built small Shinto shrines in agricultural colonies before the civilian government actively encouraged religious missionary activities in Palau.|$|E
5|$|The Hudson Bay territories (known to the English as Prince Rupert's Land) {{were not}} {{significantly}} fought over in this war. They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay. The only incident of <b>note</b> <b>was</b> a French attack on the outpost of Fort Albany in 1709. The Hudson's Bay Company was unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories, and it successfully lobbied {{for the return of}} its territories in the negotiations that ended this war.|$|E
2500|$|The Bank {{has issued}} {{banknotes}} since 1694. <b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> originally hand-written; {{although they were}} partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. <b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> [...] "White Notes", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White <b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> issued in £1 and £2 denominations.

5|$|The {{casualties}} {{of the battle}} were unusually high, even {{by the standards of}} the time, and are estimated at 28 percent of the total number of troops engaged. The smallest numbers given for the Imperial dead in contemporary accounts are between 5,000 and 6,000, although some French sources give figures as high as 12,000. A large number of officers were killed, particularly among the landsknechts; many of those who survived were taken prisoner, including Ramón de Cardona, Carlo Gonzaga, and Eriprando Madruzzo. The French casualties were smaller, but numbered at least 1,500 to 2,000 killed. These included many of the officers of the Gascon and Gruyères infantry contingents, as well as a large portion of the gendarmerie that had followed Enghien. The only French prisoner of <b>note</b> <b>was</b> Des Thermes, who had been carried along with Sanseverino's retreating Italians.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) asks to {{be a part}} of the {{investigation}} looking for a little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre, who disappeared from her home in Sacramento, California. Mulder's superior, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), initially denies his request, noting that {{the investigation}} is not an X-file, but simply a missing persons case. Mulder, however, convinces Skinner to allow him to investigate. The parents of Amber, Billie and Bud, tell Mulder that they found a note in the girl's bedroom, but the teaser for the episode revealed that the <b>note</b> <b>was</b> written by Billie herself. The note contains a mention of Santa Claus, which everyone finds out of place. Although the family is held for questioning, Mulder does not believe they did it. Looking through previous cases, Mulder finds a similar note, with a reference to Santa Claus, from a missing person case in Idaho from 1987. In the case, the mother was convicted and sentenced to twelve years. The file notes that she had a vision of her son dead before he disappeared, as did Bud on the night his daughter disappeared.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 1941, in {{a speech}} {{designed}} to inflame Croats against the Serbs living in the NDH, Lorković lied that Serbs had beaten, mutilated and massacred {{tens of thousands of}} Croatian peasants during the inter-war period. In August, he strongly opposed an Italian request to implement civil administration in the demilitarized zone of the NDH. The Italians countered the following spring by accusing Lorković of being a communist to discredit him for his pro-German views. Lorković was cleared of all charges after a police investigation. However, a German police attaché in Zagreb did claim that Lorković had been in contact with some communists in the early 1930s and had helped some Croatian communists in 1941 and 1942. In May 1942, Lorković was appointed honorary member of the German Institute for Border and Foreign Studies. Lorković, along with Vladimir Košak and Stijepo Perić, strongly opposed Italian influence over the Independent State of Croatia and towards the end of 1942, wrote a note ("Spomenica") in which he described the cooperative efforts of Italy's 2nd Army with the Chetniks. This <b>note</b> <b>was</b> officially submitted on 26 January 1943 to the Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano. In response, the Italian diplomat Raffaele Casertano tried to have Lorković removed from office.|$|E
25|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Treasury <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} in denominations of 5, 10 and 50 afghanis. In 1936, 2, 20 and 100 afghani <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> added. The Bank of Afghanistan took over paper money production in 1939, issuing notes for 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 afghanis.
