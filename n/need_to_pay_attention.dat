2500|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn, Cathy Davidson {{suggests}} that breakthroughs in cognitive science should recalibrate {{our sense of}} what it means to learn. According to Davidson, those of us in higher education are paradoxically obsessed with the implications of living in the [...] "digital age," [...] even though we have “yet to rethink how we need to be organizing our institutions—our schools, our offices—to maximize the opportunities of our digital era” (12). We tend to uphold models of teaching and assessments that no longer serve a generation of students who face a myriad of new challenges, as they attempt to learn to think critically in an era of information overload. Technology in all its forms is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of students. Colleges and universities, therefore, <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> to the impact that the appropriate uses of digital tools can have on extending, enhancing, and enriching the student learning experience, both on and off campus. Moreover, and more importantly, Davidson argues that sustained exposure to such a range of digital media demands a different kind of attention than we previously required.|$|E
