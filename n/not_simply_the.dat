5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: {{the gravitational}} influence of two masses is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>the</b> sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, {{as had been}} the case in Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated in the discussion of how the back-reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, pointing out that the standard quadrupole formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{argued that}} there is a crucial {{distinction}} between a person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or omission of Jim's. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>the</b> medium of an effect Jim is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the FOXP2 gene are <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>the</b> result of a fundamental deficit in motor control. For examples, the impairments include difficulties in comprehension. Brain imaging of affected individuals indicates functional abnormalities in language-related cortical and basal/ganglia regions, demonstrating that the problems extend beyond the motor system.|$|E

Of course, the time derivative of an integral with time dependent limits is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>the</b> time derivative of the integrand alone, a point often forgotten; see Leibniz integral rule and Lorentz force.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the differing style of the alliterative {{version of the story}} is the {{treatment}} of Mordred. He is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>the</b> villain of the piece as he is in other poems but is a complex character with a varying personality. One mark of the prevalence of Christian morality in the poem is that even Mordred cries and seems to be repentant around line 3886.|$|E
25|$|A {{scientific}} revolution occurs, {{according to}} Kuhn, when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot {{be explained by}} the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>the</b> current theory, but the entire worldview in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it. This is based on features of landscape of knowledge that scientists can identify around them.|$|E

25|$|It is not {{possible}} to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of the greenhouse effect. This is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others, so that the total greenhouse effect is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>the</b> sum of the influence of each gas. The higher ends of the ranges quoted are for each gas alone; the lower ends account for overlaps with the other gases. In addition, some gases such as methane are known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified.|$|E

Plants should be treated as living beings, harvested at the proper hours etc. He stated that the Elementals of all plants are aspects of The Divine Mother in the form of Mother Nature. In 'Occult Medicine and Practical Magic' he spoke about the healing methods of the Kogi Mamas, who diagnose sicknesses by means of clairvoyance.|$|E
25|$|A written {{document}} that addresses a student's specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created {{for students with}} disabilities, who are {{required by law to}} have an IEP when appropriate. Most states are not required to have IEPs for students who are only identified as gifted. Some students may be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating boredom or frustration, or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning disability that is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>the</b> result of being unchallenged in a typical classroom. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.|$|E
25|$|The Roman {{authorities}} {{undertook a}} massive and organized colonization of Dacia. New mines were opened and ore extraction intensified, while agriculture, stock breeding, and commerce {{flourished in the}} province. Dacia began to supply grain {{not only to the}} military personnel stationed in the province but also {{to the rest of the}} Balkan area. It became an urban province, with about 10 cities known, 8 of which held the highest rank of colonia, though the number of cities was fewer than in the region's other provinces. All the cities developed from old military camps. Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, the seat of the imperial procurator (finance officer) for all the three subdivisions, was the financial, religious, and legislative center of the province. Apulum, where the military governor of the three subdivisions had his headquarters, was <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>the</b> greatest city within the province, but one of the biggest across the whole Danubian frontier.|$|E

25|$|Rivers further {{asserted}} that all painful or un-useful instincts are naturally {{kept out of}} conscious awareness (i.e. in the unconscious) by suppression. Suppression—in this view—is a natural and “unwitting” (unintentional) method for removing painful instincts from consciousness and confining them in the unconscious. Neuroses, therefore, develop when something in the natural process of suppression is disrupted so that a suppressed instinct and its associated emotion are released from the unconscious. Rivers cites two possible reasons for the “escape” of such instincts from the unconscious: either the instinct became too strong to contain, or the normal reserves which typically suppress it were weakened. It is important to note, however, that the etiology of war neuroses is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>the</b> escape of instincts from the unconscious and the ensuing conflict. More often than not, Rivers believed that {{the way in which}} such conflict is resolved (or is attempted to be resolved) also greatly influences the manifestation of the neuroses.|$|E
