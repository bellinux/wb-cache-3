5|$|During dispersal, females tend {{to settle}} in home ranges that overlap with their mothers. However, they do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have any special social bonds with them. Males {{disperse}} much farther from their mothers and enter into a transient phase. This phase lasts until a male can challenge and displace a dominant, resident male from his home range. Adult males dominate sub-adult males.|$|E
5|$|Female orangutans have eight-year {{intervals}} between births, {{the longest}} interbirth intervals among the great apes. Unlike many other primates, male orangutans do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> practice infanticide. This {{may be because}} they cannot ensure they will sire a female's next offspring because she does not immediately begin ovulating again after her infant dies.|$|E

5|$|Root {{extensions}} are additions {{of one or}} two sounds, often plosives, {{to the end of a}} root. These extensions do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{change the}} meaning of a root, and often lead to variant root forms across different descendants. The source and function of these extensions is not known.|$|E
5|$|Segregation by sex {{and size}} does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> occur. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their {{instinct is to}} follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible {{for much of the}} damage to floating carcasses.|$|E

There were no hesitation wounds, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be investigating the case further.|$|E

These researchers found no correlation between the width of supratemporal fenestrae {{and the size of the}} squamosal.|$|E

A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been driven by competition for resources but instead {{by the fact that}} each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E

A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan.

This method of attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force {{trying to keep the}} pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort. These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E

Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E

5|$|During John's {{persecution}} of William de Braose in 1209, William Marshal gave de Braose shelter on his Irish lands. De Gray demanded that Marshal surrender de Braose {{to him as}} a traitor, but Marshal refused, claiming that since he held some lands from de Braose, it would be an act of treason to surrender his lord to an outside authority. Marshal's refusal does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have embittered de Gray however, as three years later the bishop was praising him in a letter to John.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Robert Kett led an {{uprising}} in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east {{side of the}} river, overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made across the river into the Hospital meadows, {{in an attempt to}} take Bishop Bridge, which would have given them access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which he turned on the Cow Tower, damaging the latter's parapets. The rebellion failed, and the tower does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have required extensive repairs.|$|E
