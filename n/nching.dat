40|$|In {{preliminary}} screens, several functions, most notably, genes {{involved in}} the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS), were identified as {{playing a role in}} the process of growth rate compensation of branch density. The maintenance of branch density under growth at various temperatures was examined in a selection of mutants in genes known to be important in the control of ROS. In all ROS control mutants tested, growth was shown to branch tighter when grown at higher temperatures (which result in faster growth rates) and looser when grown at lower temperatures (which results in slower growth rates). This can be contrasted with wild-type Neurospora which branches at the same density under both conditions. We also tested the impact of environmental agents which lower the concentration of ROS on branching. In tests, various water soluble anti-oxidants (ie reducing agents); Ascorbic Acid (aka Vitamin C) and Glutathione produced unusual bra <b>nching</b> patterns in wild-type Neurospora strains exposed...|$|E
40|$|The title {{compounds}} (1 and 2, above) were synthesized by Sonogashira {{coupling reactions}} of appropriate Ru(1 I) complexes with the electron a cceptors. Characterization {{was conducted in}} solution and in frozen ma trices. Finally, the title compounds were evaluated as dopants of sol-gel materials. It {{was found that the}} intramolecular quenching efficie ncy of 4 -benzoyl-Nmethylpyridinium cation in solution depends on the solvent: photoluminescence is quenched completely in CH,CN, but not i n methanol or ethanol. On the other hand, intramolecular emission que <b>nching</b> by 4 -benzyl-N-methyl viologen is complete in all solvents. The difference between the two quenchers is traced electrochemically to t he solvation of the 4 -benzoyl-Nmethylpyridiniums by alcohol. In froze n matrices or adsorbed on the surfaces of silica aerogel, both Ru(I 1) complex/electron acceptor dyads of this study are photoluminescent, and the absence of quenching has been traced to the environmental rigi dity. When doped aerogels are cooled at 77 K, the emission intensity increases by approximately 4 x, and the spectra shift to the blue, analogous to what is observed with Ru(I 1) complexes in solutions undergoi ng fluid-to-rigid transition. However, in contrast to frozen solution s, the luminescent moieties in the bulk of aerogels kept at low tempe ratures are still accessible to gas-phase quenchers diffusing through the mesopores, leading to more sensitive platforms for sensors than o ther room-temperature configurations. Thus the photoluminescence of o ur Ru(I 1) complex dyads adsorbed on aerogel is quenchable by O 2 both at room temperature and at 77 K. Furthermore, it was also found that O 2 modulates the photoluminescence of aerogels doped with 4 -benzoyl -N -methylpyridinium-based dyads over a wider dynamic range compared wi th aerogels doped with either our vislogen-based dyads or with Ru(I 1) tris(1,lO-phenanthroline) itself...|$|E
