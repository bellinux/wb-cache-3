40|$|The role of {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) {{synthesis}} in the Escherichia coli conjugation {{system has been}} studied using nalidixic acid (<b>NAL)</b> to specifically inhibit DNA synthesis in matings between reciprocal combinations of male (Hfr) and female (F−) mutants resistant and sensitive to NAL; the physiological action of <b>NAL</b> on the strains utilized was also studied. Matings between combinations of mutants resistant (Nalr) and sensitive (<b>Nals)</b> to <b>NAL</b> allow various parental functions to be established: pair formation {{studies show that the}} female cells are responsible for the slight decrease in pair formation when <b>NAL</b> is present in Hfr(Nals) × F− (<b>Nals)</b> matings. Preformed mating pairs are stable in the presence of <b>NAL.</b> In matings between Hfr(Nals) and F−(Nalr), the transfer gradient constant increases linearly with low <b>NAL</b> concentration (0. 1 to 0. 6 μg of <b>NAL</b> per ml). Higher concentrations of <b>NAL</b> (5 μg/ml) act on <b>Nals</b> males to rapidly stop chromosome transfer; under these conditions, however, DNA degradation is unmeasurable as determined from single-strand nicking in the male cells. This result is consistent with a model for chromosome transfer which requires DNA synthesis in the male cell. Inhibition of DNA synthesis (by 85 %) in the female has no effect on conjugal chromosome transfer. High concentrations of <b>NAL</b> (> 20 μg/ml) produce slight inhibition in chromosome transfer for the Hfr(Nalr) × F−(Nalr) mating tested; this effect is probably caused by action of <b>NAL</b> on the male. The inhibition of chromosomal transfer by <b>NAL</b> appears to be irreversible in the normal sense. A pulse of <b>NAL,</b> applied during transfer, immediately stops the transfer which is in progress. On removal of the <b>NAL</b> block, the temporal appearance of recombinants is consistent with the idea that a new round of transfer has commenced from the sex factor location on the male chromosome...|$|R

40|$|Leaf {{morphology}} {{is closely}} associated with cell division. In rice, mutations in Narrow leaf 1 (<b>NAL</b> 1) show narrow leaf phenotypes. Previous {{studies have shown that}} <b>NAL</b> 1 plays a role in regulating vein patterning and increasing grain yield in indica cultivars, but its role in leaf growth and development remains unknown. In this report, we characterized two allelic mutants of NARROW LEAF 1 (<b>NAL</b> 1), <b>nal</b> 1 - 2 and <b>nal</b> 1 - 3, both of which showed a 50 % reduction in leaf width and length, as well as a dwarf culm. Longitudinal and transverse histological analyses of leaves and internodes revealed that cell division was suppressed in the anticlinal orientation but enhanced in the periclinal orientation in the mutants, while cell size remained unaltered. In addition to defects in cell proliferation, the mutants showed abnormal midrib in leaves. Map-based cloning revealed that <b>nal</b> 1 - 2 is a null allelic mutant of <b>NAL</b> 1 since both the whole promoter and a 404 -bp fragment in the first exon of <b>NAL</b> 1 were deleted, and that a 6 -bp fragment was deleted in the mutant <b>nal</b> 1 - 3. We demonstrated that <b>NAL</b> 1 functions in the regulation of cell division as early as during leaf primordia initiation. The altered transcript level of G 1 - and S-phase-specific genes suggested that <b>NAL</b> 1 affects cell cycle regulation. Heterogeneous expression of <b>NAL</b> 1 in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) further supported that <b>NAL</b> 1 affects cell division. These results suggest that <b>NAL</b> 1 controls leaf width and plant height through its effects on cell division...|$|R
