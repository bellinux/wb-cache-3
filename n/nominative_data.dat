40|$|In {{the paper}} we develop methods for proving {{properties}} of programs on hierarchical <b>nominative</b> <b>data</b> {{on the basis}} of the composition-nominative approach. In accordance with this approach, the semantics of a program is a function on <b>nominative</b> <b>data</b> constructed from basic operations using compositions (operations on functions) which represent programming language constructs. <b>Nominative</b> <b>data</b> can be considered as a class of abstract data models which is able to represent many concrete types of structured and semistructured data that appear in programming. Thus, proofs of properties of programs depend on proofs of properties of compositions and basic operations on <b>nominative</b> <b>data.</b> To simplify the parts of such proofs that deal with program compositions we propose to represent compositions of programs on <b>nominative</b> <b>data</b> using effective definitional schemes of H. Friedman. This permits us to consider proofs in data algebras (which are simpler to derive, automate, etc.) instead of proofs in program algebras. In particular, we demonstrate that the properties of programs related to structural transformations of data can be reduced to the data level. The obtained results can be used in software development and verification. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the notion of}} <b>nominative</b> <b>data</b> that {{can be considered as}} a general mathematical model of data used in computing systems. The main attention is paid to flat <b>nominative</b> <b>data</b> called nominative sets. The structure of the partially-ordered set of nominative sets is investigated in terms of set theory, lattice theory, and algebraic systems theory. To achieve this aim the correct transferring of basic set-theoretic operations to nominative sets is proposed. We investigate a lower semilattice of nominative sets in terms of lower and upper cones, closed and maximal closed intervals of nominative sets. The obtained results can be used in formal software development...|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007 the number of legal foreigners in Italy is about 3 million, corresponding to 5 % of total population. A large amount of them holds a valid permit of stay: they are more than 2. 4 millions, as accompanied minors are not included. The administrative database of valid permits is therefore a mine of information on personal characteristics of immigrants. In particular, {{it is interesting to}} analyze the changes in the type of permit (by reason and duration of stay) and territorial mobility between two subsequent authorizations. These changes of status cannot be observed with annual stock data, which do not report the previous situation, but only the present one. Therefore, a linkage between databases of subsequent years is needed. Ministry of interiors provides Istat with individual but not <b>nominative</b> <b>data,</b> identified by an unique code generated by a ad hoc procedure. As it was changed several times over the years, following various reorganizations of administrative procedures and database design, it is possible to use it only for some specific years. The record linkage can be successfully carried out for the years 2002 - 2003 and 2006 - 2007. These years are selected also because 2002 is the year just before the last regularization (which allowed about 650, 000 foreigners to obtain a valid residence permit) and 2006 - 2007 is the most recent period. Result of the record-linkage allow an in-depth analysis of transitions in and out the labour market and of other migratory paths, including territorial mobility of the foreigners legally living in Italy...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{methodology}} of parish reconstitution (Amorim, 1991), we have organized a demographical/genealogical database from the <b>nominative</b> <b>data</b> of baptism, marriage, and burial records for the central parish {{of the city of}} Guimarães, Oliveira, from the late 16 th century to the early 20 th century. We include information about social status obtained both from testaments and parish classification. We also have hospital records for the city of Guimarães during that time and status animarum for the parish of Oliveira from 1734 onwards. A systematic comparison of this information allows us to position each adult individually in terms of family and social life and follow his or her life path within a given adult community over a long-term period. The mortality record of individuals under the age of seven is not systematized before 1860, according to the dispositions of the Diocese of Braga, to which Guimarães belongs. By extending the research to 1910, we aim to systematically follow the adult population born between the late 18 th century and the early 19 th century while they are at risk of dying. We also aim to evaluate infant-juvenile mortality from 1860 onwards, according to social status at birth. Research conducted within the Project “Espaços urbanos: dinâmicas demográficas e sociais (séculos XVII-XX) ”, with the reference FCT PTDC/HIS-HIS/ 099228 / 2008, co-funded by the budget of the COMPETE – Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade in its ERDF component and the budget of the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia in its State Budget component...|$|E
40|$|Background: Variation in tooth size is {{influenced}} by genetic and environmental factors. Several studies have reported tooth size variation between and within different racial groups. In order {{to improve the quality}} of dental care available, there is a great need for data on the mesiodistal crown dimensions of the individual teeth of Bangladeshi population. Objectives: To find <b>nominative</b> <b>data</b> on the mesiodistal crown dimensions of permanent teeth in Bangladeshi population and to compare the findings with those reported in other populations. Methods: This observational study was done from January, 2008 to June, 2010 in the Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. A total of 244 Bangladeshi subjects (77 males and 167 females), aged 7 – 36 years (mean 18. 3 years) with no age limit who attended at the above mentioned place for treatment were included in the study. Main outcome measure was mesiodistal crown dimension of each tooth class of permanent dentition. Mesiodistal crown dimensions were measured from dental casts of the permanent teeth. Results: Males had significantly larger teeth than females for maxillary central incisors (p < 0. 05) and for the mandibular second premolars (p < 0. 001). In both sexes, the maxillary lateral incisors showed the greatest variability [coefficient of variation (CV) 10. 7 %] and the maxillary canines the least (CV 6. 9 %) in mesiodistal crown dimension. Mandibular canines displayed greater sexual dimorphism in mesiodistal crown size than in any other tooth classes. Comparisons of the mesiodistal crown dimensions between population groups showed that Bangladeshis have tooth sizes close to those of North Indians, Icelanders and Jordanians but larger than those of North American Whites. Conclusions: From this study, a standard for the mesiodistal crown dimensions of permanent dentition of Bangladeshi males and females are obtained. Key Words: Crown dimension; Mesio-Distal width; Permanent dentition. DOI: [URL] BSMMU J 2011; 4 (2) : 81 - 87 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{objective is to}} study students’ abilities to predict and build own (individual) professional future, i. e. setting professional problems, defining the ways of their realisation, adequate estimating their own possibilities; an interrelation establishment between the designated abilities and educational success at vocational training stage.   Methods. Theoretical methods include review {{and analysis of the}} approaches to studying the issues of life perspectives of personality in foreign and Russian science. Practical research methods involve the empirical analysis of products, results and quality of students’ activity (the content-analysis of the essay content based on the set theme, monitoring of educational achievements and revealing of abilities to combine educational and professional experience). Research has an ascertaining character. Processing of the received data was conducted by means of the computer program «Package SPSS- 17 »; the parametrical method of comparison and the criterion Student-t were used for independent samples; the criterion Pearson’s chi-squared test (x 2) and contingency tables were applied while analyzing the <b>nominative</b> <b>data.</b>   Results and scientific novelty. The research data have proved that the pupils with the ability and readiness for designing of the individual professional future during vocational training have the following skills: they can accurately formulate their professional purposes; they can determine the ways of its achievement correctly and efficiently; these students realize the importance of own activity in the course of professional evolvement; and they demonstrate higher educational and professional achievements becoming more qualified experts.   Practical significance. Implementation of the research outcomes specifies urgency for modern young men and their abilities to plan own professional development path. It is necessary to work out specific educational program or curricula on knowledge and skills designing formation of the students’ professional future since the requirement for such abilities is intensified under the conditions of uncertainty and rapidly changing environment. Training to individual or independent planning of advancement in professional occupation will allow improving the education quality of higher education institutions and colleges. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{historical}} prospective study of three Mamre decadal birth cohorts (1837 - 1846, 1870 - 1879, and 1900 - 1909) constructed retrospectively through existing parish {{records of the}} Moravian Mission at Mamre in the Western Cape region of South Africa. <b>Nominative</b> <b>data</b> collection techniques were used to gather information needed to determine the infant mortality rates, quinquennial mortality rates and life expectancies of the three cohorts. Issues related {{to the quality of}} data – non-registration and follow-up - were investigated. Birth registration was best for the 1837 - 46 cohort for males and females, with the 1900 - 1909 registration being next best. Overall, male registration coverage was substantially better than that for females. Infant death registration was best for males in these 2 cohorts, but were poor for females. Based on these data, the infant mortality rates for the cohorts born in 1837 - 1846, 1870 - 1879 and 1900 - 1909 - 196, 182 and 128 per 1000 respectively for males and 160, 172 and 97 per 1000 respectively for females - appeared to be underestimates. There is some evidence of a downward trend for the infant mortality rates with time for males, but this was not statistically significant. Quinquennial mortality rates for the 3 cohorts did not differ statistically, and are similar to the 1935 - 37 national 'coloured' figures. The life expectancies also did not differ significantly between cohorts. The life expectancies at birth (range 34 - 40 years for males and 32 - 45 years for females) were probably overestimates due to biased IMR's. The life expectancies at age 1 (range 41 - 44 for males and 37 - 49 for females) were more representative figures. Life expectancies at age 20 were fairly stable over time (37 - 45 years) except for females in the 1900 - 1909 cohort whose life expectancies were substantially higher than earlier figures. All mortality indices investigated in this study consistently showed a lighter burden of mortality in historical Mamre compared to 'coloureds' in the Cape Colony {{at the turn of the}} century. This is probably associated with the better housing, environmental, social, economic and educational conditions at the Mamre mission relative to the rest of the Colony in the century after the emancipation of slaves...|$|E
