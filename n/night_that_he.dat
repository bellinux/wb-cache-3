Having fully recovered from his injuries, Michael recalls the <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{and his family}} were involved in a serious car accident. He reveals that every time he goes to sleep, he is conflicted between two realities; In one reality, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survived the accident, but his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) is pronounced dead at the scene, while in the second reality, Hannah died in the accident instead of Rex.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{had also}} arisen in Buczynski's {{relationship}} with Slater. Living and working {{together at the}} same premises, they had begun to argue regularly, and had both been taking part in sexual activity with other men, particularly in the gay bathhouses which could then be found in New York. By the summer of 1974 they had broken up, and although they briefly remained roommates, Buczynski soon collected together his belongings and moved back in {{with his mother and}} step-father in Ozone Park, where he converted the basement into a bedroom for himself. No longer working at The Warlock Shop, he found himself broke and isolated from the city's occult community, ultimately ceasing active coven work by September 1974. Eventually, he obtained a part-time job at the BookMasters bookstore at 1482 Broadway in Times Square, and it was while commuting home on the subway one <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> met Bennie Geraci (1950–), a native of New Orleans who had moved to the city. Buczynski and Geraci soon entered into a relationship, with the former moving into the latter's small rented flat in Rego Park, Queens, which was shared with four other men. In January 1975, he lost his job due to the economic recession, but was able to secure a job as an office boy at J. Aron and Company, a commodities trading corporation based in Wall Street.|$|E

According to Kildall, the IBM representatives took the same flight to Florida that <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and Dorothy took for their vacation, and they negotiated further on the flight, reaching a handshake agreement. IBM lead negotiator Jack Sams insisted that he never met Gary, and one IBM colleague has confirmed that Sams said so at the time. He accepted that someone else in his group {{might have been}} on the same flight, but noted that he flew back to Seattle to talk with Microsoft again.|$|E

However, incumbent Dennis Stewart did not make an issue of Omar’s religion in public and in fact referred to the <b>nights</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> as a Richardson police officer spent outside the mosque in the southeast Richardson after September 11, 2001, {{to ensure that there}} was no backlash against Muslims in Richardson because of the terror attacks.|$|R
25|$|McDonald {{was born}} in 1902 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to David and Mary (Kelly) McDonald, Welsh immigrants. David McDonald, Sr. was a long-time union activist who had been run out of Springfield, Illinois, because of his union activity. After failing as a saloonkeeper, McDonald, Sr. {{got a job as}} a guide setter at a Jones and Laughlin Steel Company rolling mill and joined the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. Mary McDonald's father had been an officer in the Sons of Vulcan, an early ironworkers' union, and both uncles on his mother's side were unionists. The <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born, his father was walking a picket line.|$|E
25|$|Both Rice and Poindexter had alibis for {{the night}} of the bombing, who testified for the defense. Poindexter went to a movie with a girl named Linda Walker, who was the {{daughter}} of a New York City police officer. They were together when they heard the blast. Rice was at a party from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. at Rae Ann Schmitz's house. She testified as a first year law student and eventually became a member of his legal defense team. Cousins of Duane Peak, Frank and Will Peak, testified that Duane Peak's story of what he did the week before the bombing was a lie. Will Peak provided Poindexter with an alibi for the <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was accused of building the bomb in David Rice's kitchen. The jury ignored it all. Norma Aufrecht, who allegedly drove Duane Peak from NCCF headquarters to David Rice's house, did not testify. She was charged with conspiracy to commit first degree murder and accessory after the fact. She would have testified that she did not drive Duane Peak on Sunday, August 16, but she was never deposed by the defense. She fled Omaha in fear and did not return to live there for 10 years after the trial.|$|E

500|$|On an October 6, 2008 broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American {{electorate}} {{was past}} the Bradley effect. She stated that her husband's {{achievement of the}} nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was. The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show where she deflected criticism {{of her husband and}} his campaign. On Fox News' [...] America's Pulse, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas on the <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> clinched the Democratic presidential nomination as a [...] "terrorist fist jab"; Hill was taken off air and the show itself was cancelled.|$|E
500|$|Marr {{wrote the}} music to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] {{especially}} for the Peel session on the same <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wrote [...] "Still Ill" [...] and [...] "Pretty Girls Make Graves". Based on the Peel performance, Rough Trade label head Geoff Travis suggested that the band release the song as a single instead of the slated release [...] "Reel Around the Fountain", which had gathered notoriety in the press due to what were seen as lyrical references to pedophilia. The Smiths entered Matrix Studios in London on September 1983 to record a second studio version of the song for release as a single. However, the result—known as the 'London version'—was unsatisfactory and soon after, the band travelled to Strawberry Studios in Stockport to try again. Here, they recorded the more widely heard A-side.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} Constable West spoke to Bamber {{again on the}} telephone; Bamber {{apparently}} complained {{about the time the}} police were taking, saying: [...] "When my father rang he sounded terrified." [...] He was told to go to the farm and wait for the police. Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not thought it would make a difference to how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. He acknowledged that he could have called one of the farm workers, but had not considered it. In his early witness statements, Bamber said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father's call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. He said he was confused about the sequence of events.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginning}} of the novel presents a Kaname whose aesthetic tastes lean more toward the so-called West. His romanticized version of it is manifested in the western wing of his house (in particular, the veranda under which he likes to sit), his fascination with American movie stars, and very potently in an English translation of the Arabian <b>Nights</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is wont to skim through {{in order to find}} the more lewd passages for which it is famous.|$|R

2500|$|Motivational {{therapy in}} nocturnal {{enuresis}} mainly involves {{parent and child}} education. Guilt should be allayed by providing facts. Fluids should be restricted 2 hours prior to bed. [...] The child {{should be encouraged to}} empty the bladder completely prior to going to bed. Positive reinforcement can be initiated by setting up a diary or chart to monitor progress and establishing a system to reward the child for each <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or she is dry. The child should participate in morning cleanup as a natural, nonpunitive consequence of wetting. This method is particularly helpful in younger children (<8 years) and will achieve dryness in 15-20% of the patients.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{campaign}} began {{to pick up}} steam, and the Quebec Liberals struggled in the legislative debate, Trudeau and Lévesque became heavily involved, with Lévesque mocking Trudeau's English middle name and aristocratic upbringing. Trudeau dramatically intervened in the best-received speech of his career {{a week before the}} referendum, extolling the virtues of federalism, mocking the unclear nature of the referendum, and dramatically pointing out that his name was neither French nor English, but a Canadian name. Trudeau noted that English Canada would have to listen to the various issues prompted by the referendum, and he promised a new constitutional agreement should it decide to stay in Canada. The [...] "No" [...] side (that is, [...] "No" [...] to sovereignty) ended up receiving nearly 60% of the vote. Trudeau stated that <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "had never been so proud to be a Quebecer and a Canadian".|$|E

In the Mishnah this is called the [...] "Passover of Egypt" [...] (Pesaḥ Miẓrayim in M.Pesach ix. 5). It was ordained, furthermore (Exodus 12:24-27), that this observance should be repeated annually for all time once the Israelites entered into their promised land. Exodus 12:25 [...] "It will come to pass when you come to the land which the Lord will give you, just as He promised, that you shall keep this service (NKJV). This so-called [...] "Pesaḥ Dorot," [...] the Passover of succeeding generations (Mishnah Pesach l.c.), differs in many respects from the Passover of Egypt (Pesaḥ Miẓrayim).

Liggett was Vedder's mentor in high school. Vedder wrote the song [...] "Long Road" [...] (from Merkin Ball) upon hearing of Liggett's death in 1995.

2500|$|After the trawl {{had been}} {{dragging}} {{for some time}} on the ocean bottom in 65 fathoms, it was raised and the crew stood by to receive the catch. Those with experience of mine sweeping during the war were startled when the mine tumbled out on deck. It stood about four feet high with a diameter of two feet and weighed about five cwt. Long immersion and rolling about {{on the ocean floor}} had made the mine harmless. The cap and firing mechanism were gone, and there was no cable. A quantity of explosive still remained. This was taken out and the mine brought back to Sydney where the trawler berthed yesterday morning. Any marks of identification are hidden by a heavy marine growth. Captain J. Farquhar, master of the Koraaga, who gained a knowledge of mines while fishing In the North Sea, said last <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed the mine had been cut adrift from a minefield during sweeping, and after going to the bottom was carried south by the current. It was possible, he said, that the Koraaga was responsible for rendering the mine harmless, since she swept the Gabo field with the Brolga and Gunundaal. The Gabo minefield was first discovered by one of the State trawlers, and that before the danger area was properly swept the Cumberland was blown up. [...] "The laying of the mines by the Wolf was very cleverly done," [...] he said. [...] "They were put down at night in an area that was {{in full view of the}} Gabo lighthouse during daylight." [...] The mine will be retained by Mr. Cam among the many curiosities that have been brought back to Sydney by his trawlers.|$|E
