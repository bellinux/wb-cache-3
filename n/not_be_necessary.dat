5|$|MacArthur gave {{immunity}} to Shiro Ishii {{and other members}} of the bacteriological research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. He also exempted the Emperor and all members of the imperial family implicated in war crimes, including Princes Chichibu, Asaka, Takeda, Higashikuni and Fushimi, from criminal prosecutions. MacArthur confirmed that the emperor's abdication would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b> In doing so, he ignored the advice of many members of the imperial family and Japanese intellectuals who publicly called for the abdication of the Emperor and the implementation of a regency.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, a {{pap test}} itself costs $20 to $30, but the costs for pap test visits can cost over $1,000, largely because {{additional}} tests are added {{that may or}} may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because ganglioneuromas are benign, {{treatment}} may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary,</b> {{as it would}} expose patients to more risk than leaving it alone. If there are symptoms or major physical deformity, treatment usually consists of surgery to remove the tumor.|$|E

50|$|Since 1992, it has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to obtain}} an {{industrial}} license for tractor manufacture in India. By 1997 annual production exceeded 255,000 units and the national tractor population had passed the two million mark.

25|$|Finally, the Government {{disagreed}} with the President that it had changed the way it treated NII. Furthermore, it had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to ask him to}} sanction the use of past reserves for its financial packages and the budget deficit as it had enough budget surpluses built up within its current term of office.|$|R

25|$|Sheridan {{replied to}} Babcock {{that he hoped}} that would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b> Grant had issued the order in part because a staff officer mistakenly {{reported}} to him at about 10:00a.m. that Warren's corps still was held up at Gravelly Run. Warren did not hear about Grant's message but some word leaked out to V Corps generals including Griffin and Chamberlain.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{of these}} points {{invalidate}} the dance theory, but simply suggest that odor might be involved, which is indeed conceded by all proponents of dance theory. Critics of the odor plume theory counter that most natural nectar sources are relatively large—orchards or entire fields— so, precision may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> or even desirable. They have also challenged the reproducibility of the odorless source experiment.|$|E

500|$|Lord Parmoor in the De Keyser's Royal Hotel case of 1920, {{but some}} {{difficulty}} with it was expressed by [...] Lord Reid in the Burmah Oil case of 1965.

25|$|The {{experience}} and outcomes of psychological trauma {{can be assessed}} {{in a number of}} ways. Within the context of a clinical interview, the risk for imminent danger to the self or others is important to address but is not the focus of assessment. In most cases, it will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to involve contacting emergency services (e.g., medical, psychiatric, law enforcement) to ensure the individuals safety; members of the individual's social support network are much more critical.|$|E
25|$|HPV {{vaccines}} {{have been}} shown to prevent cervical dysplasia from the high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 and some protection against a few closely related high-risk HPV types. However, there are other high-risk HPV types that are not affected by the vaccines. The protection against HPV 16 and 18 has lasted at least 8 years after vaccination for Gardasil and more than 9 years for Cervarix. It is thought that booster vaccines will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} turning, the Buddha taught similar teachings {{to the second}} turning, but for {{everyone}} in the three vehicles, including all the śravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. These were meant to be completely explicit teachings in their entire detail, for which interpretations would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary,</b> and controversy would not occur. These teachings were established by the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra as early as the 1st or 2nd century CE. In the Indian philosophical schools, the third turning is exemplified by the Yogācāra school of Asaṅga and Vasubandhu.|$|E

60|$|As {{soon as it}} was dusk a sentry {{was placed}} {{on the top of the}} tower, with orders to report the {{slightest}} sound or stir.

25|$|Some {{database}} developers compromise {{by creating}} an underlying snowflake schema with views built {{on top of it}} that perform many of the necessary joins to simulate a star schema. This provides the storage benefits achieved through the normalization of dimensions with the ease of querying that the star schema provides. The tradeoff is that requiring the server to perform the underlying joins automatically can result in a performance hit when querying as well as extra joins to tables that may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to fulfill certain queries.|$|E
25|$|The American Dietetic Association said in 2009 that {{a variety}} of plant foods {{consumed}} {{over the course of a}} day can provide all the essential amino acids for healthy adults, which means that protein combining in the same meal may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b> Mangels et al. write that there is little reason to advise vegans to increase their protein intake, but erring on the side of caution, they recommend a 25 percent increase over the RDA for adults, to 1.0gram of protein per kilogram of body weight.|$|E
25|$|Sealants are an {{alternative}} to solder where additional strength is not required. In most cases, sealants should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> with a properly designed copper installation. They are at best a relatively short-term solution requiring frequent maintenance. Regardless, sealant-filled joints have been used successfully as a secondary waterproofing measure for standing seam and batten seam roofing applications where low-sloped roofs are less than three inches per foot. Sealants {{can also be used}} in joints that are primarily designed to accommodate thermal movement of the copper.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To make a {{personal}} {{report of a}} hemianopia due to an occipital infarct, sustained by a professor of neurology.  METHODS—Verbatim observation of neurological phenomena recorded during the acute illness.  RESULTS—Hemianopia, visual hallucinations, and non-occipital deficits without extraoccipital lesions on MRI, are described and discussed.  CONCLUSIONS—Hemianopia, due to an occipital infarct, without alexia, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a disability which precludes a normal professional career. Neurorehabilitation has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>necessary.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Unlike most thermoplastics, {{polycarbonate}} can undergo large plastic deformations without cracking or breaking. As a result, it can {{be processed}} and formed at room temperature using sheet metal techniques, such as bending on a brake. Even for sharp angle bends with a tight radius, heating may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary.</b> This makes it valuable in prototyping applications where transparent or electrically non-conductive parts are needed, which cannot be made from sheet metal. PMMA/Acrylic, which is similar in appearance to polycarbonate, is brittle and cannot be bent at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1671, Talon {{suggested}} that it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to sponsor the passage of girls for the next year, and the king accepted his advice. The migration briefly resumed in 1673, when the king sent 60 more girls {{at the request of}} Buade de Frontenac, the new governor, but that was the last of the Crown's sponsorship. Of the approximately 835 marriages of immigrants in the colony during this period, 774 included a fille du roi. By 1672, the population of New France had risen to 6,700, from 3,200 in 1663.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was given}} by the scholar Jevgenij Paščenko; he considered that the Croats were an heterogeneous group of people belonging to the Chernyakhov culture, a poly-ethnic cultural mélange of mostly Slavs and Sarmatians, but also Goths, Getae and Dacians. There was happening an interrelation between Slavic and Iranian language and culture, seen for example in the toponymy. As such, under the ethnonym Hrvati should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> seen a specific or even homogeneous tribe, yet archaic religion and mythology of a heterogeneous group of people of Iranian origin or influence who worshiped the solar deity Hors, from which possibly originates the Croatian ethnonym.|$|E
