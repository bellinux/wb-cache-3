Using the conventional saturated groundwater flow equation, the leak identification problem is modelled as a Cauchy problem for the heat equation and {{the aim is to}} find the regions on the boundary of the solution domain where the solution vanishes, since leak zones correspond to <b>null</b> <b>pressure</b> values. This problem is ill-posed and to reconstruct the solution in a stable way, we therefore modify and employ an iterative regularizing method proposed in [1] and [2]. In this method, mixed well-posed problems obtained by changing the boundary conditions are solved for the heat operator as well as for its adjoint, to get a sequence of approximations to the original Cauchy problem. The mixed problems are solved using a Finite element method (FEM), and the numerical results indicate that the leak zones can be identified with the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Force {{generation}} in avian and aquatic species is of considerable interest for possible engineering applications. The {{aim of this}} work is to highlight the theoretical and physical foundations of a new formulation of the unsteady Kutta condition, which postulates a finite pressure difference at {{the trailing edge of}} the foil. The condition, necessary to obtain a unique solution and derived from the unsteady Bernoulli equation, implies that the energy supplied for the wing motion generates trailing-edge vortices and their overall effect, which depends on the motion initial parameters, is a jet of fluid that propels the wing. The postulated pressure difference (the value of which should be experimentally obtained) models the trailing-edge velocity difference that generates the thrust-producing jet. Although the average thrust values computed by the proposed method are comparable to those calculated by assuming <b>null</b> <b>pressure</b> difference at the trailing edge, the latter (commonly used) approach is less physically meaningful than the present one, as there is a singularity at the foil trailing edge.

40|$|Relation of distal tubular NaCl {{delivery}} and glomerular hydrostatic pressure. We have tested {{certain aspects of}} the hypothesis that the rate of distal tubular sodium delivery determines the rate of filtration in that nephron. Schnermann, Wright et al have suggested that a reduction in distal sodium delivery causes the local release of angiotensin which acts to elevate the glomerular hydrostatic pressure (PG) of that nephron by constricting the efferent arteriole, thereby increasing the nephron filtration rate. We have, therefore, examined the influence of distal sodium delivery upon glomerular hydrostatic pressure utilizing a servo <b>null</b> <b>pressure</b> device in Wistar rats with surface glomeruli on normal NaCl diet (Group I), low NaCl diet (Group II) and during saline diuresis (Group III). Glomerular pressure was quite similar in all three groups. In single nephron studies, in these same three groups, an acute reduction in distal sodium delivery did not alter nephron glomerular hydrostatic pressure. We conclude: 1) mechanisms exist whereby PG is autoregulated despite acute tubular obstruction and wide variations in distal sodium delivery; 2) if nephron filtration rate rises with reduction in distal sodium delivery, this must be mediated by increased plasma flow to that nephron, since glomerular hydrostatic pressure is unchanged...|$|R

40|$|Global {{active control}} of sound can be {{achieved}} inside enclosures under low modal acoustic fields. However, {{the performance of the}} system depends largely on the localization of the elements of the control system. For a purely acoustic active control system in which secondary acoustic sources (loudspeakers) and pressure transducers (microphones) as error sensors are used, several optimization strategies have been proposed. These strategies usually rely on partial approximation to the problem, focusing on the study of number and localization of secondary sources without considering error transducers, or selecting the best positions of secondary sources and error transducers of an initial set of candidate locations for these elements. The strategy presented here for tonal global active noise control of steady states comprises two steps; the first is rather common for this sort of problem and its goal is to find the best locations for secondary sources and their strengths by minimizing the potential energy of the enclosure. The second step is the localization of the error transducer, which ensures the results of the first step. It is analytically demonstrated that for a single input single output system, the optimum location of error transducers is at a <b>null</b> <b>pressure</b> point of the optimally attenuated acoustic field.

METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial included 43 patients with heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0. 50 who were in functional classes I-III according to the New York Heart Association criteria. Twenty-three patients were assigned to continuous positive airway pressure therapy (10 cmH 2 O), while 20 patients received placebo with <b>null</b> <b>pressure</b> for 30 minutes. All patients underwent a 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT) and Doppler echocardiography before and immediately after intervention. Clinicaltrials. gov: NCT 01088854.

Variation in the diastolic function index (e&# 8242;) after intervention was associated with differences in the distance walked in both groups. However, in the continuous positive airway pressure group, this difference was greater (continuous positive airway pressure group: &# 916; 6 MWT&# 8202;=&# 8202; 9. 44 + 16. 05 &# 215;&# 916;e&# 8242;, p&# 8202;=&# 8202; 0. 002; sham group: &# 916; 6 MWT&# 8202;=&# 8202; 7. 49 + 5. 38 &# 215;&# 916;e&# 8242;; p&# 8202;=&# 8202; 0. 015).

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of {{pressure}} on the evolution of perturbations of an Einstein-de Sitter Universe in the matter dominated epoch assuming an ideal gas equation of state. For the sake of simplicity the temperature is considered uniform. The goal of the paper is to examine the validity of the linear approximation. With this purpose the evolution equations are developed including quadratic terms in the derivatives of the metric perturbations and using coordinate conditions that, in the linear case, reduce to the longitudinal gauge. We obtain the general solution, in the coordinate space, of the evolution equation for the scalar mode, and, in the case of spherical symmetry, we express this solution in terms of unidimensional integrals of the initial conditions: the initial values of the Newtonian potential and its first time derivative. We find that the contribution of the initial first time derivative, which has been systematically forgotten, allows to form inhomogeneities similar to a cluster of galaxies starting with very small density contrast. Finally, we obtain the first non linear correction to the linearized solution due to the quadratic terms in the evolution equations. Here we find that a non <b>null</b> <b>pressure</b> plays a crucial role in constraining the non linear corrections. It is shown, by means of examples, that reasonable thermal velocities at the present epoch (non bigger than $ 10 ^{- 6 }$) make the ratio between the first non linear correction and the linear solution of the order of $ 10 ^{- 2 }$ for a galaxy cluster inhomogeneity.

The result is not, as currently thought, a <b>null</b> <b>pressure</b> Friedman model, but one that reproduces quite well the dark phenomena. We assume that there exist three consecutive ages with this property, formed by free atoms, stars and galaxies, respectively. Certainly, we are using a highly idealized view of the very complicated process going from uncoupled atoms to galaxies, but {{it allows us to}} obtain that the energy density at each epoch is of the form ρ(a) = 3 H_ 0 ^ 2 / 8 π G(Ω_ba(1 +α) /a^ 3 + f(a)), where α is a constant, that we identify with the dark matter, and f(a) a function of the scale factor, which is zero at galaxy formation and practically constant at the present epoch, constant that we identify with the cosmological constant. The parameters of our model are the baryonic density Ω_ba and the redshifts z"_i, z'_i, z_i, corresponding to the effective decoupling of atoms and radiation, the formation of stars and galaxies respectively. The model sets a relation between the galaxy formation epoch and the amount of dark matter and dark energy, e. g., galaxy formation at z_i ≈ 11 produces Ω_Λ= 0. 683; and the function f(a) predicts the begining of the acceleration recently at redshift z≈ 0. 6, just as the Λ CDM model.

40|$|The {{environmental}} factors that drive {{the evolution of}} parasite life histories are mostly unknown. Given that hosts provide the principal environmental features parasites have to deal with, and given that these features (such as resource availability and immune responses) are well characterized by the life history of the host, we may expect natural selection to result in covariation between parasite and host life histories. Moreover, some parasites show {{a high degree of}} host specificity, and cladistic analyses have shown that host and parasite phylogenies can be highly congruent. These considerations suggest that parasite and host life histories may covary. The central argument in the theory of life history evolution concerns the existence of trade-offs between traits. For parasitic nematodes {{it has been shown that}} larger body sizes induce higher fecundity, but this is achieved at the expense of delayed maturity. As high adult mortality would select for reduced age at maturity, the selective benefit of increased fecundity is expressed only if adult mortality is low. Parasite adult mortality may depend on a number of factors, including host longevity. Here we tested the hypothesis concerning the positive covariation between parasite body size (which reflects parasite longevity) and host longevity. To achieve this goal, we used the association between the pinworms (Oxyuridae, Nematoda) and their primate hosts. Oxyurids are highly host specific and are supposed to be involved in a coevolutionary process with their hosts. We found that female parasite body length was positively correlated with host longevity after correcting for phylogeny and host body mass. Conversely, male parasite body length and host longevity were not correlated. These results confirm that host longevity may represent a constraint on the evolution of body size in oxyurids, at least in females. The discrepancy between female and male oxyurids is likely to depend on the particular mode of reproduction of this taxon (haplodiploidy), which should result in weak (or even <b>null)</b> selection <b>pressures</b> to an increase of body size in males...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} method for {{the solution of}} the Stokes equations that handles interfacial discontinuities due to both singular forces and discontinuous fluid properties such as viscosity and density. The discretization couples a Lagrangian representation of the material interface with an Eulerian representation of the fluid velocity and pressure. The method is efficient, easy to implement and yields discretely divergence-free velocities that are second order accurate. No knowledge of the jumps on the fluid variables and their derivatives is required along the interface. We discretize the equations using an embedded approach on a uniform MAC grid employing virtual nodes and duplicated cells at the interfaces. These additional degrees of freedom allow for accurate resolution of discontinuities in the fluid stress at the material interface but require a Lagrange multiplier term to enforce continuity of the fluid velocity. We provide a novel discretization of this term that accurately resolves the constant <b>pressure</b> <b>null</b> modes. We show that the accurate resolution of these modes accelerates the overall speed of our simulations. Interfaces are represented with a hybrid Lagrangian/level set method. The discrete coupled equations for the velocity, pressure and Lagrange multipliers are {{in the form of a}} symmetric KKT system. Numerical results indicate second order accuracy for the velocities and first order accuracy for the pressure (in L ∞) ...|$|R

The discretization couples a Lagrangian representation of the material interface with Eulerian representations of the fluid velocity and pressure. The methods are efficient, easy to implement and yield discretely divergence-free velocities that are second order accurate in L ∞. For the special case of continuous fluid viscosity, we present a method that decouples the Stokes equations into three Poisson interface problems which we use the techniques in [1] to solve. We also solve a fourth Poisson equation to enforce a discrete divergence free condition in this case. We discretize all equations using an embedded approach on a uniform MAC grid employing virtual nodes and duplicated cells at the interfaces.

In the case of discontinuous viscosity, we require a Lagrange multiplier term to enforce continuity of the fluid velocity.
