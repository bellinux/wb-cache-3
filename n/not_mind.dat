5|$|Chapman {{played the}} lead role in two Python films, Holy Grail and Life of Brian. He was chosen to play the lead in Holy Grail because of the group's respect towards his {{straight}} acting skills, and because the other members wanted to play lesser, funnier characters. Chapman did <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> being filmed fully nude {{in front of a}} crowd in Life of Brian, but the scene, filmed in Tunisia, caused problems with the female Muslim extras.|$|E

5|$|The creators likened {{themes of}} the episode to the Star Wars trilogy, {{referring}} to the revelations about Fox Mulder's father, and Sophie's Choice, referring to how the Mulders were forced to choose Fox or Samantha to be taken. Carter included the motif of the white buffalo after reading a news story about {{the birth of a}} white buffalo calf, feeling that the image was so potent he did <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> that it did not entirely fit with the Navajo beliefs used elsewhere in the episode.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the first}} Miss World contest (originally the Festival Bikini Contest), was {{organized}} by Eric Morley. When the winner, Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. Håkansson remains {{the first and last}} Miss World to be crowned in her bikini, a crowning that was condemned by Pope Pius XII who declared the swimsuit to be sinful. Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe Shopp on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the bikini for American girls, though she did <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> French girls wearing them. Actresses in movies like My Favorite Brunette (1947) and the model on a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the bikini.|$|E

5|$|Rhys tries {{unsuccessfully to}} get Robbie O'Brien (Shaun Goss) {{to quit the}} {{surgical}} program. He then turns his attention to Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and plots to take her spot on the program instead. He pursues Erin romantically and tries to distract her away from her work, so she will be kicked off the program and he can take her place. Barber said the scheme sees Rhys at his manipulative best, he realises Erin is vulnerable and he strikes. Jansen told a writer for TV Week that Erin is a bit reluctant to accept when Rhys asks her out. She thinks that someone like Rhys would not normally be interested in her, but she is flattered by the attention. Jansen added Erin is unaware it is all an act. Kate realises what Rhys is doing and interferes with his plan. Barber explained that Kate's feelings about the matter means nothing to Rhys as his sole objective is {{to get into the}} program. He does <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> that Kate is appalled at Erin becoming a casualty of his scheme.|$|E

5|$|The next day's {{stage was}} preceded by a minute's silence, and ridden as a {{procession}} in Weylandt's memory. In keeping with convention, there was no competitive racing. Each of the 23 teams took {{to the front of}} the peloton for about 15 minutes, and the remaining Leopard Trek squad, along with Farrar, were allowed to finish first with their arms around each other. Millar led the rest of the field across the line a few seconds later. No results for the stage were recorded, and it did not count towards the general classification or any of the points competitions. After the stage, instead of any podium presentations, the four jersey classification leaders (Millar, Alessandro Petacchi, Gianluca Brambilla, and Jan Bakelants) appeared on stage with the Leopard Trek team to lead another moment of silence. Subsequently, Farrar and the remaining Leopard Trek squad all decided to leave the race. Feillu did not want to leave the Giro, feeling that continuing to race would have been the best way to honor Weylandt, but he did <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> acquiescing to his teammates' will. For most of them, the decision was based on a desire to attend Weylandt's funeral, which took place nine days after his death. Members of the Giro squad served as pallbearers. Other teammates, as well as Farrar, members of Weylandt's former team , and Giro director Angelo Zomegnan were all in attendance, along with hundreds of cycling fans assembled outside the chapel.|$|E

25|$|The next evening, Zack is {{preparing}} to film a scene between Stacey and another actor, Lester, {{that was supposed to}} have been with Lester and Miri. Zack is dismayed when Miri shows up and insists on shooting the scene as originally planned. In the back room, an incredulous Zack asks if she is doing this as a form of retaliation, pointing out that Stacey told him that Miri did <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> her sleeping with Zack. Miri corrects him, clarifying that she did <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> that Stacey merely made the offer to sleep with him. Perceiving this to have been some type of test, Zack admits that during the sex scene they filmed together, they were actually making love and that there was an emotional connection between them, and that he loves Miri. When Miri does not reciprocate, Zack storms out of the coffee shop, quitting the film and his job, and moves out of the apartment.|$|E

Whilst he did <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> {{creating}} himself and his friend Brandt feudal counts, Struensee was an enemy of the hereditary aristocracy, which he sought to replace with a merit-based system of government. A part of his reforms Struensee abolished noble privileges and decided that state employments should be based on a person's qualifications only.|$|E
25|$|Many street {{children}} spend 300 rupees {{a month on}} movies, though older children also use their money to buy cigarettes, chewing tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Street children often spend very little on clothing because their employers often provide clothes for work or their families occasionally give them clothes if they {{know where they are}} living. Also, the boys among them do <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> wandering fully or partially naked in public because it adds to the people's sympathy for them.|$|E

25|$|There was anxiety {{at first}} that the viewing public would not accept a new soap set {{in the south of}} England, though {{research}} commissioned by lead figures in the BBC revealed that southerners would accept a northern soap, northerners would accept a southern soap and those from the Midlands, as Julia Smith herself pointed out, did <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> where it was set {{as long as it was}} somewhere else. This was the beginning of a close and continuing association between EastEnders and audience research, which, though commonplace today, was something of a revolution in practice.|$|E

Upon further prompting, Sachs describes Walther's failure at the guild meeting. This causes Eva to storm off angrily, confirming Sachs's suspicion that she has fallen in love with Walther. Eva is intercepted by Magdalena, who informs her that Beckmesser is coming to serenade her. Eva, determined to search for Walther, tells Magdalena to pose as her (Eva) at the bedroom window.|$|E
