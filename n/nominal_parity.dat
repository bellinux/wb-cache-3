40|$|In his seminal {{contribution}} on {{exchange rate}} crises, Krugman models speculative attacks as optimal market reactions to policy rules that are {{inconsistent with the}} indeâ€¦nite survival of a â€¦xed <b>nominal</b> <b>parity.</b> Later contributions have shifted {{the focus of the}} analysis, modelling exchange rate crises as rational decisions by optimizing policy makers to abandon the peg. This paper analyzes the logical core of the two modelling strategies in terms of arbitrage. We use a generalized version of the â€arbitrage ruleâ€ â€¦rst discussed by Flood and Garber, that expresses the conditions for a crisis to occur in the metric of the shadow exchange rate. Our arbitrage-based methodology of analysis can be applied to virtually all models of exchange rate crises.

The paper ends with a unique trade-off between the degree and the speed of money market integration in Europe. ...|$|R

40|$|Since 2003 Argentina {{has again}} boasted strong {{industrialization}} and high growth. Although insufficient, since {{the pressures on}} the installed production capacities remain strong, the investment rate has increased. Social and welfare expenditures have grown without affecting major macro-economic balances, with the notable exception of the price boom. income dis-tribution has become less unequal. Poverty has fallen considerably. According to ecLAc, {{there has been a}} reduction in both poverty depth and inequality among the poor: ultimately, a good economic and social assessment, in global terms, despite significant inflationary risks and governance problems. The extremely vigorous economic recovery is explained, first, by the aban-donment of the real exchange rate policy. The exchange rate appreciation of the 1990 s was followed by a sharp devaluation of the peso in late 2001 and the en-suing abandonment of the convertibility plan that established a <b>nominal</b> <b>parity</b> between the peso and the U. S. dollar, causing Argentina to plunge into a very serious crisis. But since 2003 the industrial sector, protected by the exchange rate, had experienced strong growth. The reawakening of the economy led to an increase in jobs and wages, despite the reduction in real wages produced b...|$|E
40|$|Although <b>nominal</b> <b>parities</b> {{have been}} {{completely}} fixed within the euro area since {{the launch of the}} single currency, real effective exchange rates have continued to vary under the effect of inflation disparities, exhibiting a strong appreciation in the peripheral countries. In this paper, we assess real exchange rate misalignments for euro area countries by using a Behavioral Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER) approach on the period 1980 - 2010. The results show that the peripheral member countries have been suffering from increasingly overvalued exchange rates since the mid- 2000 s, as their real appreciation has not stemmed from improving fundamentals in terms of productivity or external position. In addition, currency misalignments have been increased on average for all euro area countries since monetary union, while becoming more persistent. More worryingly, our findings highlight different patterns across members, as misalignments have been larger and more persistent in peripheral countries than in core countries...|$|R
40|$|Three {{years after}} the euro's introduction, we discuss its role in foreign {{exchange}} and international debt securities markets {{on the basis of}} a comprehensive set of data sources. In spot foreign exchange markets the euro's role resembles that of the deutschemark, with a dominant position in the Nordic and several Central European countries. Transaction costs in the important dollar-euro market are larger than they used to be for dollar-mark, but the same does not hold for any other major spot market. We discuss how this phenomenon may be explained by persistence of bid-ask quoting conventions in this market in the face of changed <b>nominal</b> <b>parities.</b> We show a notable reduction in euro swap trading and explain it, inter alia, with the elimination of dollar swaps meant to hedge exchange rate risk between currencies now subsumed in the euro. We observe strong growth of euro-denominated debt securities, while international euro bond investments are stable at the level of the 'synthetic euro' aggregate of legacy currencies.

Anything issued by anybody can be a monetary instrument and any type of material {{can be used to}} make a monetary instrument, as these are unimportant determinants of what a monetary instrument is. What matters is the existence of specific financial characteristics. These characteristics lead to a stable <b>nominal</b> value (<b>parity)</b> in the proper financial environment. This framework of analysis leads the researcher to study how the fair value of a monetary instrument changes and how that change differs from changes in the value of the unit of account.

40|$|The Meese-Rogoff puzzle, {{one of the}} {{well-known}} puzzles in international economics, concerns the weak relationship between nominal exchange rates and market fundamentals. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show that market fundamentals do in fact matter in forecasting nominal exchange rates. In particular, we emphasize the importance of the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson effect in modeling deviations from purchasing power parity. Based on the post-Bretton Woods period, we provide solid out-of-sample evidence that rejects the random walk forecast model at medium-term and long-term forecast horizons. We also find mild evidence for out-of-sample predictability of nominal exchange rates over the short term.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} and compare several alternative exchange rate models that have received wide attention, but little comparison, during the 1970 s. In order to compare purchasing power <b>parity</b> (PPP), <b>nominal</b> interest rate <b>parity,</b> {{real interest rate}} parity, and portfolio balance models, we first strip each down to its essential core and undertake comparable single-equation tests of both 'hard' and 'easy' (more and less constrained) versions of each model. We then embed each of the 'hard' versions in a new macroeconomic model of Canada, and assess their implications for the impacts of monetary and fiscal shocks. Using annual Canadian data from the 1950 s and 1970 s, all of the models have single-equation errors of about 3 %, except for the 'hard' versions of PPP and real interest parity, which are heavily rejected by the data. In a macroeconomic context, the models have modestly different implications {{for the effects of}} fiscal shocks, and diverge more widely under monetary shocks. ...|$|R
40|$|Large {{fluctuations}} in both <b>nominal</b> and real <b>parities</b> between G 7 countries {{raise the issue}} of their determinants. This paper offers a formal description of a model of the real exchange rate, defined as the relative price of nontradables in terms of tradables, explicitly based on microeconomic optimization. Our approach relies on a version of the general equilibrium model first presented by Obsfeld-Rogoff (1996). But we enrich the model by introducing monopolistic competition in the nontradables sector. This allows for demand factors to influence the real exchange rate in the long run. Our results on French data do not corroborate the Obsfeld-Rogoff supply-side model. However, they provide some support for the extended version of the model: a cointegration relationship can be found between the real exchange rate, sectoral productivities and the « world » real interest rate, once public expenditure is also taken into account.

40|$|The paper {{tests for}} the {{relative}} importance of international capital market integration in determining interest rates in a broad sample of both industrial and developing countries. The recent turbulence in industrial country financial markets has underscored these concerns. One view holds that it is possible for countries to conduct an independent domestic interest rate policy. The other suggests that there is very little room for managing interest rates in open economies without destabilizing effects on exchange rates - given the massive volumes of capital market transactions that force interest rate parity across countries. Interest rate formation in developing countries has attracted much less attention. But it is an increasingly important issue as a growing number of them undertake financial liberalization. The central question for policy-makers is again the degree to which domestic interest rates are influenced by world interest rates. A separate concern is high domestic interest rates, relative to world interest rates, in some developing countries. A model of real interest rate parity is proposed as the main test for capital market integration - that is, that nominal interest rate differences across countries are largely explained by inflation differentials (rather than uncovered or covered <b>nominal</b> interest <b>parity).</b> The evidence suggests strongly that although domestic monetary policies play a significant role, real interest parity is a dominant factor, in both industrial and developing countries. However, expectations of exchange rate changes also significantly influence interest rates. A third key factor is the apparent presence of significant"country risk", unexplained by macroeconomic imbalances, for some developing countries (for example, Chile, Indonesia, Mexico, and the Philippines) pushing real domestic interest rates higher than what would be otherwise predicted. The concluding section discusses the possible reasons for such"country-risk"in the case of Indonesia.

In this paper we propose and test one such law pertaining to international economics, the triple-parity law. It integrates three well-known equilibrium conditions, which are shown to prevail in the long run, on average and ex post: (i) uncovered <b>nominal</b> interest rate <b>parity</b> (UIP); (ii) relative purchasing power parity (PPP); (iii) real interest rate parity (RIP). Using a cross-section of annual mean values or trend growth rates for 18 OECD countries in the post-Bretton-Woods/pre-EMU floating rate period (1976 - 1998) and employing a variety of single-equation and system estimation methods, we present robust evidence that the triple-parity law ultimately holds for large and diversified economies. For a few, mostly small and specialized countries, its working is however affected by some significant financial or real comparative (dis) advantages, for which estimates are provided. The law says nothing about short-term dynamics, but it can provide useful benchmarks in this context too, insofar as measures {{of the speed of}} convergence to long-run equilibrium are estimated.
