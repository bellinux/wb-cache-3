The alumina base ceramics performed better than the silicon nitride base ceramics. Severe abrasion wear was observed on both rake and flank faces of the cutting tools while cutting forces increased with increasing cutting speed when machining with the silicon nitride base nano-ceramic tools.

40|$|AbstractAs {{one of the}} chipless {{machining}} processes, burnishing has been performed on manufactured components as the final operation to improve the surface integrity, including reduced surface roughness and increased surface and subsurface hardness. Refined surface layers with ultra-fine grains or <b>nano-grains</b> could be generated during the burnishing process due to imposed severe plastic deformation and the associated dynamic recrystallization (DRX). These harder layers with compressive residual stresses induced by the burnishing process also provide added benefits by enhancing wear/corrosion resistance and increasing the fatigue life of the components. The research findings {{presented in this paper}} show the effects of cryogenic burnishing with roller burnishing tool on Al 7050 -T 7451 alloy, using liquid nitrogen as the coolant. Burnishing forces and temperatures are measured to compare the differences between dry and cryogenic burnishing. Higher tangential forces and lower temperatures are observed from cryogenic burnishing due to the work-hardening and the rapid cooling effects introduced by cryogenic burnishing. Also, refined layers with <b>nano-grains</b> (grain size of approximately 40 nm) are formed in the cryogenicallyburnished surface, in which an average hardness increase of 9. 5 %, 17. 5 % and 24. 8 % within the 200 μm depth are achieved in comparison with the hardness values obtained from dry burnishing, at the corresponding burnishing speeds of 25, 50 and 100 m/min.

40|$|Butterflies are {{microscopic}} damage features forming at subsurface material imperfections induced during {{rolling contact}} fatigue (RCF) in rolling element bearings. Butterflies {{can lead to}} degradation of the load bearing capacity of the material by their associated cracks causing premature spalling failures. Recently, butterfly formation has been cited {{to be related to}} a premature failure mode in wind turbine gearbox bearings; white structure flaking (WSF). Butterflies consist of cracks with surrounding microstructural change called ‘white etching area’ (WEA) forming wings that revolve around their initiators. The formation mechanisms of butterflies in bearing steels have been studied over the last 50 years, but are still not fully understood. This paper presents a detailed microstructural analysis of a butterfly that has initiated from a void in standard 100 Cr 6 bearing steel under rolling contact fatigue on a laboratory two-roller test rig under transient operating conditions. Analysis was conducted using focused ion beam (FIB) tomography, 3 D reconstruction and transmission electron microscopy (STEM/ TEM) methods. FIB tomography revealed an extensive presence of voids/cavities immediately adjacent to the main crack on the non-WEA side and at the crack tip. This provides evidence for a void/cavity coalescence mechanism for the butterfly cracks formation.
