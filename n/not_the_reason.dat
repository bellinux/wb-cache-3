5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E

5|$|Though it was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> {{they were}} built, castles could often {{be used as}} prisons. One such {{instance}} from the 14thcentury illustrates this aspect of Château de Chinon's history. Founded in the Holy Land as a crusading military order in the early 12thcentury, the Knights Templar had, by {{the close of the}} 13thcentury, gained swathes of lands in Europe, particularly France. King PhilipIV of France had the members of the order in his kingdom arrested, accusing them of heretical practices. The leaders of the order, including the Grand Master Jacques de Molay, were imprisoned at Château de Chinon, in the Tour du Coudray built by PhilipII one century earlier. Graffiti carved by the imprisoned knights can be seen {{on the walls of the}} tower. In August 1308, Pope Clement V sent three cardinals to hear the leaders' confessions. The outcome was that in 1312 the pope issued a bull, the Vox in excelso, suppressing the order and its property was given to the Knights Hospitaller. The leaders were sentenced to life imprisonment, apart from Jacques de Molay and Geoffrey de Charney who were burnt at the stake.|$|E

Bill Lord, a director at NBC affiliate KNBC, also stated that race was not a factor in why the media covered the Kuhen case.

25|$|For example, {{one such}} {{consequence}} of the halting problem's undecidability is that there cannot be a general algorithm that decides whether a given statement about natural numbers is true or <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> {{for this is that}} the proposition stating that a certain program will halt given a certain input can be converted into an equivalent statement about natural numbers. If we had an algorithm that could find the truth value of every statement about natural numbers, it could certainly find the truth value of this one; but that would determine whether the original program halts, which is impossible, since the halting problem is undecidable.|$|E

25|$|Before his death, Arana {{had planned}} {{to run in the}} {{upcoming}} 1950 presidential elections. His death left Árbenz without any serious contenders in the elections (leading some, including the CIA and U.S. military intelligence, to speculate that Árbenz personally had him eliminated for this reason). Árbenz got more than 3 times as many votes as the runner-up, Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes. Fuentes claimed that electoral fraud benefited Árbenz; however scholars have pointed out that while fraud may possibly have given Árbenz some of his votes, it was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that he won the election. In 1950s Guatemala, only literate men were able to vote by secret ballot; illiterate men and literate women voted by open ballot. Illiterate women were not enfranchised at all.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{two species}} Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica have {{extremely}} similar biological features, and {{are known to be}} almost indistinguishable, they in fact have several differences regarding their nest characteristics. Vespula germanica nests generally survive the winter, while those of Vespula vulgaris do <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> for this difference mostly comes from the variation in prey each species feeds on. Vespula vulgaris food sources are greatly affected by the temperature while that of Vespula germanica are not, providing them with a much higher chance of survival even during the winter. Because many Vespula germanica are able to overwinter and most Vespula vulgaris do not, except for the queen, this affects the nest size of {{the two species}}. Vespula germanica generally have slightly bigger nest size (3500–9000 larvae in one colony cycle) than Vespula vulgaris (3000–8000 larvae in one colony cycle).|$|E

25|$|C. acutus is {{the most}} {{widespread}} of the four extant species of crocodiles from the Americas. It inhabits waters such as mangrove swamps, river mouths, fresh waters, and salt lakes, and can even be found at sea, hence its wide distribution throughout the Caribbean islands, southern Florida, the Greater Antilles, southern Mexico, Central America, and the South American countries of Colombia and Ecuador. The American crocodile is especially plentiful in Costa Rica. One of its largest documented populations is in Lago Enriquillo, a hypersaline lake in the Dominican Republic. The species has also been recorded from Jamaica. American crocodiles have recently been sighted in Grand Cayman, leading experts to believe the species may be swimming from Cuba (which {{is home to a}} massive American crocodile population) and slowly repopulating Grand Cayman. In addition, an American crocodile/Cuban crocodile hybrid was recently discovered in the Cancun area. The crocodile likely originated in the Zapata Swamp of Cuba (the only place where these wild hybrids exist) and swam to the Yucatán Peninsula. Their saline tolerance also allowed the American crocodile to colonize limited portions of the United States (extreme southern Florida). Contrary to popular misinformation, the presence of the American alligator is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> the American crocodile was unable to populate brackish waters north of Florida, but rather the climate.|$|E
25|$|Although the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute did get bad publicity, it was {{suggested}} that this is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why they stopped using baboons. The University of Michigan's mission was to create safer cars for human use. In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable. The cruelty and the moral dilemmas of animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects. They reasoned that biomechanics data is needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars. Years later animal testing ceased and instead an instrumental dummy was created for replacement. In 1978, animals were their only source of subject that would be a reliable substitution to the human being. The disadvantage though to using an instrumental dummy or a human cadaver, is that the tissue is not alive and will not elicit the same response as, for an example, a live animal. Today, it is not common to see animals being tested upon for automobile accidents because of the advance in computers and technology. It is, although, difficult to use cadavers instead of animals because of human rights, {{and it is difficult to}} obtain permission from the families, especially with children. Consent for a research and testing can occur only if the person responsible for giving consent is a competent person and one who also comprehends the research and testing procedures fully.|$|E
500|$|A theory {{known as}} The Great Stirrup Controversy {{argues that the}} {{advantages}} in warfare that stemmed from use of the stirrup led {{to the birth of}} feudalism itself. Other scholars, however, dispute this assertion, suggesting that stirrups provided little advantage in shock warfare, being useful primarily for allowing a rider to lean farther to the left and right on the saddle while fighting, and simply reduce the risk of falling off. [...] Therefore, it is argued, they are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the switch from infantry to cavalry in Medieval militaries, nor the reason for the emergence of Feudalism.|$|E

500|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{applies to}} {{two types of}} situations: subsequent failures and initial failures. Subsequent failures are where money has already been applied to a charitable purpose, and that purpose has failed. It does not allow the next of kin of the original donor to recover any money, as said in Re Wright: [...] "Once money has been effectually dedicated to charity, whether in pursuance of a general or a particular charitable intent, the testator's next of kin or residuary legatees are forever excluded". The courts instead simply determine whether or <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for failure falls within Section 13, based on the basic intention underlying the original gift.|$|E
