40|$|The {{problem of}} {{parameter}} estimation of permanent-magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. To obtain accurate machine parameters, {{it is necessary}} to develop easily applicable but efficient optimization algorithms to solve the parameter estimation models. This paper proposes a novel dynamic differential evolution with adaptive mutation operator (AMDDE) algorithm for the multi-parameter simultaneous estimation of a <b>non-salient</b> <b>pole</b> PMSM. The dynamic updating of population enables AMDDE to responds to any improved changes of the population immediately and thus generates better optimization solutions compared with the static mechanism used in original differential evolution. Two mutation strategies, namely DE/rand/ 1 and DE/best/ 1, are adaptively employed to balance the global exploration and local exploitation. The effectiveness of the proposed AMDDE is demonstrated on the multi-parameter estimation for a <b>non-salient</b> <b>pole</b> PMSM. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing peer algorithms in efficiency, accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, the new algorithm can be potentially realized in real-time microcontroller due to its simple structure and less memory requirement. The proposed algorithm can also be applied to other parameter identification and optimization problems...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a sensorless {{control method}} of {{permanent}} magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs), whose machine neutral points are accessible, for all speeds and at standstill is proposed, researched and developed. The sensorless method is called Direct Flux Control (DFC). The different voltages between a machine neutral point and an artificial neutral point {{are required for}} the DFC method. These voltages are used to extract flux linkage signals as voltage signals, which are necessary to approximate electrical rotor positions by manipulating the flux linkage signals. The DFC method is a continuous exciting method and based on an asymmetry characteristic and machine saliencies. The DFC method is validated by implementing on both software and hardware implementation. A cooperative simulation with Simplorer for the driving circuit and programming the DFC and Maxwell for doing finite element analysis with the machine design is selected as the software simulation environment. The machine model and the DFC method are validated and implemented. Moreover, the influences of different machine structures are also investigated {{in order to improve}} the quality of the measured voltages. The hardware implementation has been employed on two test benches, i. e. for small machines and for big machines. Both test benches use a TriCore PXROS microcontroller platform to implement the DFC method. There are several PMSMs, both salient <b>poles</b> and <b>non-salient</b> <b>poles,</b> which are used to validate the DFC method. The flux linkage signals are also analyzed. The approximation of the flux linkage signal is derived and proposed. A technique to remove the uncertainty of the calculated electrical rotor position based on the inductance characteristics has been found and implemented. The electrical rotor position estimation method has been developed based on the found flux linkage signal approximation function and analyzed by comparing with other calculation techniques. Moreover, the calculated electrical rotor position is taken into account to either assure or show the relation with the exact rotor position by testing on the hardware environment. The closed loop speed sensorless control of PMSMs with DFC is presented and executed by using the assured calculated electrical rotor position to perform the DFC capability. This thesis has been done in the Electric Machines, Drives and Power Electronics Laboratory, South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences, Soest, Germany. ...|$|R

A novel permanent magnet (PM) linear oscillatory actuator (LOA) of moving- iron and <b>non-salient</b> <b>pole</b> was presented {{on the basis}} of LOA research. The mathematical model of the LOA based on the magnetic circuit method was established, and derived the relationship between electromagnetic thrust and coil current, mover’s displacement.

The corresponding experimental results verifies the electromagnetic thrust is direct proportional to coil current and reverse proportional to mover’s displacement during effective mover’s displacement. So the derived mathematical model based on the magnetic circuit method is correct. This conclusion provides a theoretical basis for the further calculation of thrust, the selection of control current and the design of controlling method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Permanent-magnet {{brushless}} direct-current motors {{are easy}} to maintain, compared with direct-current motors. Therefore, they are attracting attention. In this paper, the authors discuss a <b>non-salient</b> <b>pole</b> brushless direct-current motors. Usually, the quadrature armature current which contributes to torque generation is supplied in this motor. But, {{in this case that}} the source voltage cannot be increased by supplying the direct armature current, that is, equivalently field weakening, a quadrature armature current can be increased. Consequently, the motor torque increases. In the case that the load characteristics are settled, the motor torque can have a maximum Tm by adjusting a direct armature current. At this time the rotational speed and output are maximum also. Tm changes with the change of the motor parameters. Consequently, the motor parameters which maximize Tm are optimal. In this paper, the authors have clarified an optimal parameter determination method considering by the load torque-speed characteristics and, armature resistance by the power factor, and efficiency where the motor has optimal parameters and generates the maximum output. Furthermore, the theory obtained has been confirmed experimentally by the authors. Introduction...|$|E
40|$|Inter-turn {{short circuit}} of field {{windings}} (ISCFW) may cause the field current of a generator to increase, output reactive power to decrease, and unit vibration to intensify, seriously affecting its safe and stable operation. Full integration of mechanical and electrical characteristics {{can improve the}} sensitivity of online monitoring, and detect the early embryonic period fault of small turns. This paper studies the calculations and variations of unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP), of which the excitation source of rotor vibration is the basis and key to online fault monitoring. In grid load operation, ISCFW are first calculated with the multi-loop method, so as to obtain the numerical solutions of the stator and the rotor currents during the fault. Next, the air-gap magnetic field of the ISCFW is analyzed according to the actual composition modes of the motor loops in the fault, so as to obtain the analytic expressions of the air-gap magnetic motive force (MMF) and magnetic density. The UMP of the rotor is obtained by solving the integral of the Maxwell stress. The correctness of the electric quantity calculation is verified by the ISCFW experiment, conducted in a one pair-pole <b>non-salient</b> <b>pole</b> model machine. On this basis, comparing the simulation analysis with the calculation results of the model in this paper not only verifies {{the accuracy of the}} electromagnetic force calculation, but also proves that the latter has the advantages of a short time consumption and high efficiency.

40|$|During {{the latest}} {{few years the}} need for new motor types has grown, since both high {{efficiency}} and an accurate dynamic performance are demanded in industrial applications. For this reason, new effective control systems such as direct torque control (DTC) have been developed. Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) are well suitable for new adjustable speed AC inverter drives, because their efficiency and power factor are not depending on the pole pair number and speed to the same extent as it is the case in induction motors. Therefore, an induction motor (IM) with a mechanical gearbox can often be replaced with a direct PM motor drive. Space as well as costs will be saved, because the efficiency increases and the cost of maintenance decreases as well. This thesis deals with design criterion, analytical calculation and analysis of the permanent magnet synchronous motor for both sinusoidal air-gap flux density and rectangular air-gapflux density. It is examined how the air-gap flux, flux densities, inductances and torque can be estimated analytically for salient pole and <b>non-salient</b> <b>pole</b> motors. It has been sought by means of analytical calculations for the ultimate construction for machines rotating at relative low 300 rpm to 600 rpm speeds, which are suitable speeds e. g. in Pulp&Paper industry. The calculations are verified by using Finite Element calculations and by measuring of prototype motor. The prototype motor is a 45 kW, 600 rpm PMSM with buried V-magnets, which is a very appropriate construction for high torque motors with a high performance. With the purposebuilt prototype machine it is possible not only to verify the analytical calculations but also to show whether the 600 rpm PMSM can replace the 1500 rpm IM with a gear. It can also be tested if the outer dimensions of the PMSM may be the same as for the IM and if the PMSM in this case can produce a 2. 5 fold torque, in consequence of which {{it may be possible to}} achieve the same power. The thesis also considers the question how to design a permanent magnet synchronous motor for relatively low speed applications that require a high motor torqueand efficiency as well as bearable costs of permanent magnet materials. It is shown how a selection of different parameters affects the motor properties. Key words: Permanent magnet synchronous motor, PMSM, surface magnets, buried magnet...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{electromagnetic}} design of light weight and high power density superconducting synchronous machines for 10 MW class wind turbine generators. Wind energy is well known as a clean energy source, and the installation of wind energy turbines is increasing annually worldwide. The size of wind turbines has also increased from an economical point of view. Direct-drive, low speed, and high torque systems are often adopted for multi-MW class wind turbines because higher efficiency and lower maintenance are expected. There are several proposals for generators that deliver over 10 MW of power. However, a generator’s weight and tower cost increase with its power generating capacity. It is important to develop lightweight and high power density generators for large capacity wind turbine generators. High-temperature superconducting (HTS) technology {{is one of the}} key solutions. Superconducting wind turbine generators have the potential to realize compact and high power density generators, and have been actively studied throughout the world. In general, these generator structures are made of superconducting field coils and copper armature windings. Fully superconducting generators that have superconducting field and armature windings have the potential to be more compact, and have higher output density generators than other machines owing to air gap reduction. However, fully superconducting generators have the technically challenging issue of how to reduce AC loss at the superconducting armature windings. If multifilament MgB 2 superconducting wires are applied to the superconducting generators, it is possible to reduce the AC losses. This research has three main purposes, namely (1) to develop the world’s first fully superconducting generator that has YBCO field coils and MgB 2 armature windings, (2) to develop the electromagnetic design of three types of superconducting generator and a permanent magnet-type wind turbine generator and (3) to investigate the electromagnetic characteristics of 10 MW class direct-drive wind turbine generators by using generator size, weight, HTS wire length, generator losses, and so on. The four wind turbine generators that we focused on were investigated using finite-element method (FEM) analysis, a conventional permanent magnet generator, a salient pole superconducting generator, <b>non-salient</b> <b>pole</b> superconducting generator, and a fully superconducting generator. In Chapter 1, we present the introduction of this study. First, the current status of global wind energy installation and large-scale wind turbine generator systems is described. Next, superconducting wind turbine generators are introduced as a solution to the issues after explaining the challenging technical issues associated with generators in the over 10 MW class. Chapter 2 refers to design conditions for 10 MW class wind turbine generators. First, we present initial design conditions such as output power and current voltage. Next, four generator structures and their cooling system design schemes are described. Then, the design concepts for generator components are explained. Chapter 3 describes the electromagnetic design of a permanent magnet type synchronous generator (PMSG). The PMSG characteristics were investigated with 2 D finite element method analysis (FEM). The calculation results showed that there are many technical challenges to realizing 10 MW class PMSGs from the perspectives of generator efficiency, weight, and cost. Chapter 4 shows the electromagnetic design of salient pole-type superconducting generators (S-SCG) with 2 D FEM. Two types of generators with different pole numbers and outer diameters were designed and investigated. The results showed that S-SCG can reduce by over 30 % of the generator diameter when compared to PMSG. Also, S-SCG was found to be suitable for the design of multiple and larger diameter structures. Chapter 5 explains the electromagnetic design of non-salient pole-type superconducting generators (NS-SCG) with 2 D FEM. Two types of NS-SCG having different diameters were designed. The generator characteristics showed that both NS-SCG structures require over 1000 km of YBCO wires because of its air-cored structure. Their generator characteristics showed that both NS-SCG structures had many technical challenges. Chapter 6 {{focuses on the}} electromagnetic design of fully superconducting generators (FSCG), which is the original work of this study. Electromagnetic design and characteristics of the FSCG have been investigated using 2 D FEM. Two types of FSCG were designed. Because of the air gap length reduction, the required length of HTS wire was reduced in spite of its air-cored structure. While the required length of the HTS wire was less than 200 km, the generator diameter was 4. 0 m. FSCG is therefore considered to be a good candidate for the 10 MW class wind turbine generator system. In Chapter 7, we compare the electromagnetic characteristics of four designed wind turbine generators in terms of generator diameter, weight, HTS wire length, generator loss, and so on. The results show that the FSCG and the S-SCG are the best candidates for 10 MW class offshore wind turbine generators from the size and cost perspective. In Chapter 8, we conclude this paper and discussed future works of this study. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2013 - 03 - 25; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電気系工学専...|$|E
