40|$|A novel dynamic {{register}} renaming {{approach is}} proposed in this work. The key {{idea of the}} novel scheme is to delay the allocation of physical registers until a late stage in the pipeline, instead of {{doing it in the}} decode stage as conventional schemes do. In this way the register pressure is reduced and the processor can exploit more instruction-level parallelism. Delaying the allocation of physical registers require some additional artifact to keep track of dependences. This is achieved by introducing the concept of virtual-physical registers, which do not require any storage location and are used to identify dependences among instructions that have <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>allocated</b> a register to its destination operand. Two alternative allocation strategies have been investigated that differ in the stage where physical registers are allocated: issue or write-back. The experimental evaluation has confirmed the higher performance of the latter alternative. We have performed an evaluation of the novel s [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes and investigates an {{incremental}} memory allocation method for mixed database workloads of simple hash-join queries and short read transactions. Traditionally, a DBMS allocates all memory reserved for a query {{at the beginning}} of the query execution. However, there may be a prolonged period from the time the query begins to the time that all reserved memory is actually consumed by the query process. We propose to allocate reserved memory to the query incrementally by smaller portions when the query process is actually ready to utilize this memory. Memory that was reserved but <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>allocated</b> to the query can be used temporarily as a shared buffer pool by other components of the workload. Through a series of simulation experiments we demonstrate that the incremental memory allocation for hash-join queries improves the performance of read transactions without penalizing queries.

30|$|The FIFO-Except {{scheduling}} criteria {{is supported}} in GridTS by setting a sequencer (ticket). The ticket in GridTS is implemented through a tuple (ticket tuple) in the tuple space. This tuple contains {{the value that}} has <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>allocated</b> to the sequencer ticket. In GridTS, {{in addition to the}} tasks and the sequencer being represented by tuples in the tuple space, the jobs are also represented by tuples in the space (job tuple). The definition of all tuples used in GridTS is presented in Sect.  7.4. When a broker wants to insert a tuple in the space, it needs to: (i) remove the tuple that represents the sequencer (ticket tuple) from space; (ii) inserts in the space the job tuple with the current ticket value; (iii) increases the ticket value and inserts a new ticket tuple, with the ticket value incremented, back in the space. In order to guarantee the FIFO-Except scheduling criteria, resources must pick the task of the job with the lowest ticket value. It can happen that the resource does not meet the requirements of any task of the application with the lowest ticket value, thus it must search for task of applications with highest ticket value.|$|E
40|$|A crescente demanda dos usuários por serviços de banda larga tais como dados a alta velocidade, vídeo, aúdio e multimídia, tem levado ao uso de sistemas rádio ponto- multiponto em freqüências superiores a 10 GHz, que além de menos utilizadas, permitem oferecer as grandes larguras de banda necessárias. Nessas freqüências, as perdas de propagação do sinal devem-se principalmente ao efeito de chuvas. A atenuação por chuvas afeta diretamente a cobertura e o desempenho dos sistemas que operam nestas faixas de freqüência. No presente trabalho é desenvolvido um modelo empírico para a previsão da distribuição cumulativa da atenuação por chuvas, utilizando a base oficial de ITU-R e resultados experimentais de medidas {{realizadas}} no Brasil. Este modelo fornece resultados mais precisos do que os atualmente propostos na literatura técnica e permite avaliar o impacto das chuvas na cobertura de sistemas ponto-multiponto tipo LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution System). Além disto, foram desenvolvidos dois modelos para a previsão da distribuição da atenuação diferencial por chuvas, fator essencial para a determinação de efeitops de interferência e seu impacto das chuvas no desempenho de sistemas LMDS. Finalmente, foram desenvolvidos modelos para a previsão da duração total e média, de eventos de atenuação por chuvas, estatísticas também relevantes na análise de performance de sistemas LMDS. The {{growing demand}} for broadband services such as high- speed data, video, audio and multimedia, has lead {{to the use of}} point-multipoint radio systems operating in frequencies above of 10 GHz, that are <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>allocated</b> for other services and allow the use of the large bandwidths required by these services. At these frequencies, the main contribution for the propagation losses is due to rain attenuation. The rain directly affects the area coverage and the performance of systems operating at these frequencies. In the present work, an empirical model is developed for predicting the cumulative distribution of rain attenuation prediction, using the ITU-R data base and results of propagation measurements campaigns performed in Brazil. The model provides better results than others currently found in the technical literature and allows the evaluation of the impact of rain attenuation in the coverage of LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution System/Local Multipoint Communications System). Also, two models were developed for predicting distributions of differential rain attenuation, an essential factor for interference effects and its impact in LMDS performance. Finally, models were developed for the prediction of total and average duration of rain attenuation events, also relevant for systems performance assessment...|$|E

Like the TRC 37L, this Lorraine 38L {{was equipped with}} an armoured tracked trailer. The total capacity was twelve men: the driver and one passenger in the driving compartment, four in the former cargo bay, and six in the trailer. To protect the infantry squad, high box-like armoured superstructures were built over both the bin and the trailer, with doors at their back. The loaded weight of the main vehicle was 7.7 tonnes. A total of 240 VBCP 38L vehicles were ordered, of which nine had been delivered on 1 September 1939 and around 150 by 25 June 1940. In view of the war threat, the order was made before the prototype could be tested. Of all participants in the Battle of France, the French army would thus be the only to employ a fully tracked APC. The vehicles were intended for the Bataillon de Chasseurs Portés, the (single) mechanised infantry battalion within the Division Cuirassée, or armoured division of the Infantry. However, on 10 May, they had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> been <b>allocated</b> to these units, who still used half-tracks.

40|$|The phase {{signs of}} the five main X-ray {{reflections}} from normal frog sciatic nerve have been determined as all positive using a technique of labeling with very small amounts of heavy metal. The changes in intensity of the individual reflections were studied {{as a function of}} uptake of metal label by the membrane. The possible localization of the metal label was decided from computer-analogue studies and from Patterson calculations. These phases are different from those determined by previous workers using techniques of trial of the best set of phases, or a step model, to give the best fit of the combined intensity data of normal and swollen myelin membranes. The electron density map has been calculated using eight reflections and their experimentally determined phases.
