To accommodate changes in visual environments throughout life history, salmon may adjust their spectral sensitivity. We investigated this possibility by examining ontogenetic and thyroid hormone (TH) -induced changes in visual pigments in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch, Walbaum). Using microspectrophotometry, we measured the <b>spectral</b> <b>absorbance</b> (quantified by λmax) of rods, and middle and long wavelength-sensitive (MWS and LWS) cones in three age classes of coho, representing both freshwater and marine phases. The λmax of MWS and LWS cones differed among freshwater (alevin and parr) and ocean (smolt) phases. The λmax of rods, on the other hand, did not vary, which is evidence that vitamin A 1 /A 2 visual pigment chromophore ratios were similar among freshwater and ocean phases when sampled {{at the same time}} of year. Exogenous TH treatment long wavelength shifted the λmax of rods, consistent with an increase in A 2. However, shifts in cones were greater than predicted for a change in chromophore ratio. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that at least two RH 2 opsin subtypes were expressed in MWS cones, and these were differentially expressed among alevin, parr and THtreated alevin groups. Combined with changes in A 1 /A 2 ratio, differential expression of opsin subtypes allows coho to alter the <b>spectral</b> <b>absorbance</b> of their MWS and LWS cones by as much as 60 and 90 nm, respectively.

While mimicking natural photosynthesis, they are currently the most efficient third-generation solar technology available. Among others, their cost is dominated by the synthetic dye which consists of efficient Ruthenium based complexes due to their high and wide <b>spectral</b> <b>absorbance.</b> However, the severe toxicity, sophisticated preparation techniques as well as the elevated total cost of the sensitizing dye is of concern. Consequently, the current global trend in the field focuses on the exploitation of alternative organic dyes such as natural dyes which have been studied intensively. The main attractive features of natural dyes are their availability, environmental friendly, less toxicity, less polluting and low in cost. This contribution reports on the possibility of using sepia melanin dye for such DSSC application in replacement of standard costly ruthenium dyes. The sepia melanin polymer has interesting properties such as a considerable <b>spectral</b> <b>absorbance</b> width due to the high degree of conjugation of the molecule. This polymer is capable of absorbing light quantum, both at low and high energies ranging from the infrared to the UV region. The comprehensive literature survey on Grätzel solar cells, its operating principle, as well as its sensitization by natural dyes focusing on sepia melanin has been provided in this master’s dissertation. The obtained results in investigating the morphology, chemical composition, crystalline structure as well as optical properties of sepia melanin samples using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy x-ray diffraction, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy as well as Photoluminescence (PL) for Grätzel solar cell application have been reported. These results represent an important step forward in defining the structure of melanin. The results clearly show that sepia melanin can be used as natural dye to DSSC sensitization. It is promising for the realization of high cell performance, low-cost production, and non-toxicity.
