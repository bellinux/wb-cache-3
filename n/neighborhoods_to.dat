5|$|Klein ISD creates {{attendance}} zones for neighborhoods {{within the}} boundaries of the district. All neighborhoods are zoned to a specific elementary school, intermediate school, and high school. When a new school opens, or a school becomes overcrowded, the district begins realigning and rezoning certain <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>to</b> ensure that there is balance among all schools. Students must attend the assigned schools for their neighborhood, with the exception of students who attend the International Business Academy at Klein Forest High School or the International Baccalaureate program at Klein Oak High School.|$|E

5|$|Saint Paul's Department of Planning and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into {{seventeen}} Planning Districts, {{created in}} 1979 to allow <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>to</b> participate in governance and use Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement {{directly from the}} city, the councils share a pool of funds. The councils have significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they organize residents. The boundaries are adjusted depending on population changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods. Though these neighborhoods changed overtime, preservationists have saved many of their historically significant structures.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{staircase}} exits: two {{going up to}} the northeastern corner of the intersection of Grand and Chrystie Streets, and one {{going up to the}} northwestern corner. The station originally only had the two street stairs to the northeastern corner of the intersection, but due to growing ridership over the years—mainly by commuters from various Brooklyn <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>to</b> Manhattan's Chinatown—the third staircase to the northwestern corner was added in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>to</b> the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E
5|$|NY414 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY352 (Denison Parkway) in the Steuben County city of Corning. It initially heads north on Cedar Street, following it past two largely commercial blocks {{that make up}} part of the Market Street Historic District. Past the district, the route changes names to Centerway and crosses over the Chemung River, which flows east–west {{through the center of}} Corning. Across the river, the route traverses more commercial <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>to</b> reach Pulteney Street, designated as NY415 west of this point. Along this stretch, NY414 passes the former Corning Armory and the Corning Museum of Glass, the latter located on the southwest corner of the junction with NY415.|$|E

The location was temporarily renovated to mirror an abandoned Federal Emergency Management Agency camp. Michael Riley, the production manager for the episode, contacted the Newnan Police Department to collaborate with producers. Because of the large size of the filming location, Riley's production company notified surrounding <b>neighborhoods,</b> <b>to</b> avoid inconvenience.|$|E

5|$|The lone {{portion of}} NY590 {{within the city}} of Rochester runs due north–south, acting as a divider between {{residential}} <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>to</b> {{the west and the}} Irondequoit Creek valley (much of which is part of Ellison Park) to the east. Little more than a half mile after entering the city, NY590 exits the city and enters the neighboring town of Irondequoit. Here, the freeway turns to the northwest to avoid the area surrounding the intersection of North Winton Road and NY404 (Empire Boulevard). After passing under North Winton Road, NY590 resumes its northward trek and connects to NY404 by way of a modified cloverleaf interchange. The expressway continues onward, separating a large residential area from Irondequoit Bay Park West as it progresses toward a northbound-only exit with Norton Street. One half-mile to the north of Norton, NY590 meets NY104 via a large interchange.|$|E

5|$|As Boykett argues, any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} {{is equivalent to}} an automaton in rectangular form, in which the cells are offset a half unit at each time step, and in which both the forward and reverse evolution of the automaton have neighborhoods with just two cells, the cells a half unit away in each direction. If a reversible automaton has neighborhoods larger than two cells, it can be simulated by a reversible automaton with smaller neighborhoods and more states per cell, in which each cell of the simulating automaton simulates a contiguous block of cells in the simulated automaton. The two axioms of a semicentral bigroupoid are exactly the conditions required on the forward and reverse transition functions of these two-cell <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>to</b> be the reverses of each other. That is, every semicentral bigroupoid defines a reversible cellular automaton in rectangular form, in which the transition function of the automaton uses the operation to combine the two cells of its neighborhood, and in which the operation similarly defines the reverse dynamics of the automaton. Every one-dimensional reversible cellular automaton is equivalent to one in this form.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop that runs from an interchange on US127 on the southern Ithaca city limits through downtown {{and back to the}} freeway north of the city. The southern end is at exit117 on US127, and from there, the business loop runs westward along Center Street through a cluster of businesses adjacent to the freeway interchange. Further west, Bus. US127 passes through residential <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>to</b> enter downtown Ithaca. At Main Street, the business loop turns northward one block to Emerson, then turns westward one block along Emerson to Pine River Street, bypassing downtown Ithaca. From there, Bus. US127 turns northward along the former route of US27 through town. North of downtown, the highway passes through another residential area before exiting Ithaca. North of town, the business loop passes a golf course before turning eastward a short distance along Polk Road to connect to the freeway.|$|E
