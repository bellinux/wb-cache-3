5|$|In the {{simplest}} type of circulatory system, two lateral vessels are {{joined at the}} ends to form a loop. However, many species have additional long-wise and cross-wise vessels. There is <b>no</b> <b>heart</b> nor pumping vessels, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of both the vessels and the body wall's muscles. In some species, circulation is intermittent, and fluid ebbs and flows in the long-wise vessels. The fluid in the vessels is usually colorless, but in some species it contains cells that are yellow, orange, green or red. The red type contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen, but {{the function of the}} other pigments is unknown.|$|E
5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is <b>no</b> <b>heart,</b> but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{a ring of}} four ganglia, {{positioned}} around the rhynchocoel near its front end. At least a pair of ventral nerve cords connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. Most nemerteans have various chemoreceptors, and on their heads some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli. These ocelli can detect light but can not form an image. Nemerteans respire through the skin. They have at least two lateral vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop, and these and the rhynchocoel are filled with fluid. There is <b>no</b> <b>heart,</b> and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of muscles in the vessels and the body wall. To filter out soluble waste products, flame cells are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels, and remove the wastes through a network of pipes to the outside.|$|E

25|$|Arachnid {{blood is}} {{variable}} in composition, {{depending on the}} mode of respiration. Arachnids with an efficient tracheal system {{do not need to}} transport oxygen in the blood, and may have a reduced circulatory system. In scorpions and some spiders, however, the blood contains haemocyanin, a copper-based pigment with a similar function to haemoglobin in vertebrates. The heart is located in the forward part of the abdomen, and {{may or may not be}} segmented. Some mites have <b>no</b> <b>heart</b> at all.|$|E

25|$|Self-repairing – Although {{of limited}} extent {{compared}} to well vascularised tissue (e.g. muscle), the valve leaflets do retain some capacity for repair {{due to the}} presence of regenerative cells (e.g. fibroblasts) in the connective tissue from which the leaflets are composed. As the human heart beats approximately 3.4x109 times during a typical human lifespan this limited but nevertheless present repair capacity is critically important. <b>No</b> <b>heart</b> valve prostheses can currently self-repair but replacement tissues grown using stem cell technology may eventually offer such capabilities.|$|E

The two teamed up on the WrestleMania 23 pre-show, and defeated the team of Chavo Guerrero and Gregory Helms. After weeks of conflict between Flair and Carlito, the team split up when Carlito attacked Flair during a match. At Judgment Day, Flair defeated Carlito with the figure four leglock.|$|E
25|$|From his spies Waller learnt it was possible, if a {{bold and}} sudden attack was made, that Hereford might be taken. Such workWaller loved, and he {{determined}} to try. With about 2,500 men {{he set out}} from Gloucester, and at daybreak on the 24 April appeared before Hereford. Some desultory fighting went on during the day, at times rather sharp, but the garrison had <b>no</b> <b>heart</b> in their resistance and deserted, {{so that there was}} nothing for Sir Richard Cave, the governor of Hereford, to do but to surrender. This he did, and on 25 April 1643. Waller entered Hereford in triumph. He was entitled to every credit that belongs to a bold and successful leader, and had more than restored his reputation as a conqueror. He had struck unexpectedly, and struck hard, with the result that he had dealt a blow where least expected, and one which was of considerable tactical importance, as he had severed the King's line of communication with Wales.|$|E

500|$|A {{blood vessel}} starts from the {{peritoneum}} (the membrane that loosely encloses the stomach), with blind capillaries supplying the stomach. The blood vessel leads {{up the middle}} of the body to a circular vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring, and in most species these are combined into one a little below the lophophore ring. The downward vessel(s) leads back to the peritoneum, and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is <b>no</b> <b>heart,</b> but muscles in the major vessels contract in waves to move the blood. Unlike many animals that live in tubes, phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration by the lophophore, which extends above hypoxic sediments. The blood has hemocytes containing hemoglobin, which unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments.

500|$|Dave Simpson from The Guardian gave a {{positive}} review for the Birmingham concert, awarding {{the show with}} 4 out of 5 stars. He stated that [...] "Gaga has often {{been accused of being}} all artifice and <b>no</b> <b>heart,</b> but tonight's show is a powerful statement from a star who refuses to be pinned down or written off." [...] Daniel Dylan Wray from The Independent awarded the Birmingham concert with 4 out of 5 stars and described ArtRave as [...] "loud, colourful and frequently emblematic of feel-good, throwaway party times". Katie Fitzpatrick from Manchester Evening News awarded the concert with 5 out of 5 stars. She praised Lady Gaga's voice, her live band, the outfits and the connection of the fans – especially in this show that Gaga helped a fan to propose to his partner on stage. Katie stated that [...] "the ostentatiously named ArtRave may reaffirm that Gaga the show-woman is definitely about her art. But this little lady with the powerful set of lungs is also undoubtedly all heart." [...] Ludovic Hunter-Tilney from the Financial Times rated the concert three out of five stars. He criticized the songs from Artpop except the title track, but complimented the acoustic and piano sequences.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} months of 2006, Carlito competed in several matches {{involving}} the Intercontinental Championship. His {{involvement in this}} angle ended at Cyber Sunday 2006, after being elected by the fans to face Jeff Hardy for the championship. Carlito, however, lost the match. During this time period Carlito's gimmick underwent a slight change and was sold as a [...] "ladies man", eventually getting involved in another fictional relationship with Torrie Wilson. During this time, Colón was present at Lockout, a special event presented by the World Wrestling Council that took place on December 16, 2006. At this event, he defeated Jon Heidenreich to become Universal Heavyweight Champion, but was stripped of the championship minutes later. Carlito participated in the 2007 Royal Rumble, where he was eliminated by The Great Khali. Following the Royal Rumble, Carlito started a feud with Ric Flair, in which Flair insulted Carlito for leaving a show early by claiming that he had <b>no</b> <b>heart,</b> no passion and was undeserving of his spot on the roster. After Carlito challenged and lost to Flair in a match, they were booked as a tag team, with Flair serving as a mentor to Carlito. The team {{was involved in a}} Money in the Bank qualifying match which was declared a [...] "no contest" [...] after The Great Khali interfered. This led to a triple threat match the following week which included and was won by Randy Orton.|$|E
