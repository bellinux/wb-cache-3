40|$|Com o objetivo de avaliar o efeito de herbicidas no controle de plantas daninhas, na produção e na qualidade fisiológica das sementes de amendoim (Arachis hypogaea L. 'Tatu'), foi instalado um experimento no campo, em solo Podzólico Vermelho-Amarelo Câmbico, fase terraço, com 2, 8 % de matéria orgânica e textura argilosa. Usaram-se os tratamentos: testemunha com capina, testemunha sem capina, trifuralin a 0, 58 kg do i. a. /ha; vernolate a 3, 6 kg do i. a. /ha; <b>nitralin</b> a 0, 75 kg do i. a. /ha; fluorodifen a 0, 9 kg do i. a. /ha e {{pendimethalin}} a 1, 5 kg do i. a. /ha. Avaliaram-se a população inicial, a produção de sementes, produção de casca, o amendoim com casca, e o número de plantas daninhas. Realizaram-se também, testes de avaliação da qualidade fisiológica das sementes de amendoim, os quais foram constituídos pelo teste-padrão de germinação após 20, 40 e 80 horas de permanência das sementes na câmara de envelhecimento precoce, que estava regulada para funcionar a 42 °± 3 °C e 95 % de umidade relativa. No campo observou-se predominância de trevo (Oxalis sp), picão-branco (Galinsoga parviflora Cav.) e tiririca (Cyperus rotundus L.). Trifuralin, fluorodifen e pendimenthalin fo-ram os herbicidas da maior eficiência no controle do trevo, enquanto para tiririca o tratamento com <b>nitralin</b> não diferiu da testemunha capinada, e para o picão-branco, o tratamento com pendimethalin controlou totalmente esta planta daninha. Para a produção de sementes de amendoim, não houve diferenças entre os tratamentos. A produção de casca e a produção de amendoim com casca, o tratamento com fluorodifen diferiu apenas da testemunha sem capina, suplantando-a. A ocorrência de patógenos nas sementes da testemunha sem capina, e o herbicida <b>nitralin</b> prejudicaram a germinação das sementes. O tratamento das sementes de amendoim na câmara de envelhecimento precoce, pelo período de 20 horas, promoveu nas sement es do tratamento testemunha sem capina e do tratamento com trifl uralin, deteriorização precoce. Para o período de permanência de 40 horas, na câmara de envelhecimento precoce os tratamentos testemunha com capina e fluorodifen não foram envelhecidos precocemente. An {{experiment was}} carried out in a Cambic Yellowish Red Podzolic soil, terrace phase, with 2, 8 % organic matter and claye y texture, to evaluate the effect of herbicides on weed control as w'ell as production and physiological quality of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L. 'Tatu'). The treatments were: weeded check, unweeded check, vernolate 3, 6 kg a. i. /ha; trifluralin 0, 58 kg a. i. /ha; fluorodifen 0, 9 kg a. i. /ha; <b>nitralin</b> 0, 75 kg a. i. /ha; pendimenthalin 1, 5 kg a. i. /ha. The initial stand, seed production, hull, hulled peanut, and the number of weeds were evaluated. The test to evaluate the peanut physiological seed quality was perfomed. The seeds were placed in the accelerated aging chamber {{for a period of time}} such as 20, 60, and 80 hours under 42 ° ± 3 °C and 95 % relative humidity, and then the standard germination test {{was carried out}}. The woodso rrel (Oxalis sp). small flower galinsoga (Galinsoga parviflora) and nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) predominat ed in the fie ld plots. Trifluralin, fluorodifen and pendimenthalin were the herbicides that controlled most of the woodsorrel. On the other hand nitra lin treatment did not differ of the unweeded check for nutsedge. The smal lf lower gali nsoga was totally controlled by pendimethalin. The herbicide treaments and the check plots did not differ statistically for seed production. The production of hull and hulled peanut with fluorodifen was only higher than weeded check plot. The peanut germination was damaged for the seed which came from weeded check and <b>nitralin</b> plots due to seed patho gens. The deterioration of the peanut seeds placed in the accelerated chamber was observed in the 20 hours period of time for weeded check and triflural in treatments.

40|$|Positive ion {{electron}} impact (PIEI), {{positive ion}} chemical ionization (PICI) and negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) mass spectra are presented for seven dinitroaniline herbicides; and each fragmentation pathway has been analyzed. In the PIEI mode, molecular ions appeared for all compounds, {{but they were}} relatively small. Base or intense cations at m/z M- 29, which probably correspond to [M-C 2 H 5] +, appeared in five compounds; [M - OH]+ peaks also observed for six compounds. In the PICI mass spectra, all compounds showed intense MH+ quasi-molecular ions, which constituted base peaks, together with small peaks at m/z M + C 2 H 5 and/or M + C 3 H 5; small peaks at m/z M - 33, which probably correspond to [MH- 2 OH]+,were observed in six compounds. In the NICI mass spectra, M- molecular anions appeared as base peaks in all compounds. Anions at m/z [M - 30]-, which {{may be due to}} loss of NO, were also observed in common for all compounds. The highest sensitivity could be obtained in the NICI mode by total ion monitoring for all compounds. The calibration curves obtained by selected ion monitoring in the NICI mode for isopropalin, <b>nitralin</b> and trifluralin, showed linearity in the range of 1. 56 - 100 pg on column, with detection limits of 2 - 20 pg on column. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Previous {{research}} has indicated several soil-applied herbicides are more effective by exposure to emerging shoots than from root uptake. Studies were conducted in the greenhouse and growth chamber to investigate effects of herbicide placement in soil on toxicity to emerging seedlings. In these studies, an inch of treated soil was placed above the seed, below the seed, or both {{above and below the}} seed. The seed was placed {{in the middle of a}} 1 -inch layer of untreated soil. Each soil layer was brought to field capacity separately and the entire container was covered with a plastic bag. The use of this plastic bag avoided the need for irrigation and subsequent herbicide movement. By this method, numerous herbicides were active on oats (Avena sativa) primarily through shoot exposure, with root exposure having little or no effect on foliage growth. These herbicides included EPTC (ethyl N, N-dipropylthiocarbamate), dichlobenil (2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile), trifluralin (α, α, α-trifluoro- 2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl-p-toluidine), <b>nitralin</b> (2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl- 4 -[methylsulphonyl] aniline), propachlor (2 -chloro-N-iso-propylacetanilide), DCPA (dimethyl 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachlorotereph-thalate), and CDEC (2 -chloroallyl diethyl dithiocarbamate). Sindone (isomers of 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4, 6 -diisopropylindanyl ethyl ketone) was more effective on sugar beets (Beta vulgaris) and annual rye-grass (Lolium multiflorum) through shoot exposure than root exposure. Some herbicides are more effective on oats through root exposure. These included bromacil (5 -bromo- 3 -sec-butyl- 6 -methyluracil), R 11913,¹ Nia 11092 (1, 1 -dimethyl- 3 -(3 -[N-tert-butylcarbamyloxy] phenyl) urea), pyrazon (5 -amino- 4 -chloro- 2 -phenyl- 3 [2 H]-pyridazinone), diuron (3 -[3, 4 -dichlorophenyl]- 1, 1 -dimethylurea), and atrazine (2 -chloro- 4 -ethylamino- 6 -isopropyl-amino-s-triazine). Dicamba (2 -methoxy- 3, 6 -dichlorobenzoic acid) and 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) were more effective on cucumber through root exposure than through shoot exposure. Some herbicides appear to be taken up differently by different plant species. R 11913 was more effective through shoot exposure on sugar beets and more effective through root exposure on oats. Atrazine proved more effective on oats through root exposure; however, with green foxtail (Setaria viridis) and annual ryegrass, shoot exposure was more important when an untreated buffer layer was present between the seed and the treated zone. The possibility existed that a reduction in transpiration, caused by the plastic bag could affect the mode of uptake. In studies without the use of the plastic bag, atrazine was still more effective on oats through root exposure and more effective on green foxtail through shoot exposure. Irrigation in this study was accomplished through straws extended into each layer to minimize herbicide movement. We noticed that green foxtail produced secondary roots as early as five days after planting or two days after emergence. This indicated that these newly-formed secondary roots, as well as the emerging shoot, could absorb atrazine placed in the shoot region. When the buffer layer was removed and atrazine-treated soil was placed adjacent to the seed, placement immediately below the seed showed the greatest toxicity to both oats and green foxtail. This indicates the variation in sensitivity of plants by exposure to different parts of the seedling. Studies were conducted on varying placement positions of the herbicide as well as concentrations. From these studies, proximity to the seed was a major factor in increasing toxicity to oat seedlings by atrazine and EPTC, and to annual ryegrass seedlings by diuron. Atrazine was also more effective to green foxtail and annual ryegrass seedlings with increased proximity to the seed. A narrow concentrated layer was more effective than a wider dilute layer with diuron, atrazine, and EPTC when placed either above or below the seed. With atrazine and diuron, placement of the dilute wider layer completely around the seed was just as effective as the concentrated layer adjacent to the seed. With EPTC, a concentrated layer adjacent to the seed was more effective than a dilute layer completely around the seed. The effects of a constant temperature regime (24 C) was compared with a temperature regime with a low night temperature (27 C/ 13 C) in relation to uptake of EPTC, expressed by toxic action on oats. The temperature regime with a low night temperature caused a slight increase in toxicity to oats through shoot exposure, as well as through root exposure. However, the increase in uptake of EPTC through root exposure was considerably greater than through shoot exposure. ¹No chemical name available, an experimental herbicide of Stauffer Chemical Company...|$|E
