40|$|NEST is a {{simulator}} {{for large}} networks of spiking point neurons for neuroscience research. A typical NEST simulation {{consists of two}} stages: first the network is wired up, and second {{the dynamics of the}} network is simulated. Our work aims at developing a performance model for the second stage, the simulation stage, by a semi-empirical approach. We collected measurements of the runtime performance of NEST under varying parameter settings on the JUQUEEN supercomputer at Forschungszentrum Jülich, and subsequently fitted a theoretical model to this data. This performance model defines the simulation time as weighted sum of algorithmic complexities which have been identified in the <b>NEST</b> <b>source</b> code. After parameter fitting, the coefficient of determination on the training data is close to 1. 0, and the model can be used to successfully extrapolate NEST simulation times. Furthermore, recommendations for algorithmic improvements of the NEST code can be derived from the modeling results...|$|E
40|$|Binford's (1989) {{monograph}} on {{the birds}} of Oaxaca makes that state's avifauna the best docu-mented of México (Parkes 1990). An impressive work of immense scope, Binford's careful docu-mentation of each species and its status should spur further work on birds in that state. Here we note important specimens and observations for several species that augment the material consid-ered by Binford (1989). Golden Eagle AquiJa chrysaetos (Linnaeus) Binford did not consider this species {{a member of the}} Oaxacan avifauna. It is with some interest, then, that we note the following. The late Allen Downs purchased a nestling Golden Eagle from a "comerciante man " in Tlaxiaco, who had in turn purchased it from a campesino in the small market town of Itundujia (sometimes known as Santa Cruz) in the Distrito de Putla in western Oaxaca. The Itundujia area at the time (date un-recorded) was "virgin mountain", where big pine trees grew. This bird lived out its life in captivity in Tlaxiaco. It was a very dark individual as an adult when seen and photographed by Warner (photograph BellMNH 41344) in late 1980. If the <b>nest</b> <b>source</b> of this bird was indeed near Itundujia (and we can think of no reason for the people in-volved to misrepresent this source), then this area may be the southernmost breeding locality for this species (see Friedmann 1950 : 456). Snail Kite Rostrhamus sociabjJis (Vieillot) Binford (1989 : 89) recorded a single Oaxaca speci-men. A second specimen is an adult female (BellMNH 13398) with small ovary collected by Warner 6 miles NE of Tehuantepec on 13 July 1957. This individual was molting in body, wings, and tail. Solitary Eagle Harpyhaliaetus solitarjus (Tschudi) Only one published specimen record was noted (Binford 1989 : 92), an individual in immature plumage taken by Sumichrast in the Tehuantepec region. Three sightings were also discussed (two supported by photographs). The only recent spe-cimen appears to be an adult male (BellMNH 12488; testes small, ca. 8 x 4 mm, molting in tail), collected by Dickerman 3 miles NNE of Tapana-tepec on 22 August 1956.

40|$|Efficient and {{reliable}} simulation tools {{are essential for}} progress in brain research. Since {{the early days of}} neuronal computing (Farley & Clark, 1954), a wide range of simulators have been developed, each specialized on one or few spatial and temporal scales (Brette et al., 2007). But the reliable and reproducible simulation of such complex systems as the brain is a very demanding challenge. Thus, the Computational Neuroscience community concentrated on a few reliable and widely used simulation tools in recent years. Neuronal network simulation is thus coming of age: Just as our colleagues in electrophysiology, we begin to base our work increasingly on the use of standard tools, with modifications and adaptations for our particular research, instead of building home-brew solutions from scratch. This concentration was not least the result of a series of large-scale EU funded projects, such as FACETS, BrainScaleS and the recently announced Human Brain Project. From its humble beginnings as a PhD-student project 20 years ago, the Neural Simulation Tool NEST (Gewaltig & Diesmann, 2007) saw its first incarnation as the SYNOD simulator in 1995 (Diesmann et al., 1995), leading to exciting results on synfire chains early on (Diesmann et al., 1999). By tightly coupling software development with computational neuroscience research (Kunkel et al., 2010), simulator technology evolved steadily, facilitating new scientific insight at (nearly) every step. Some key examples were parallelization (Morrison et al., 2005; Plesser et al., 2007), exact integration of model equations (Rotter & Diesmann, 1999), precise spike times in a time-driven simulator (Morrison et al., 2007; Hanuschkin et al., 2010), spike- time-dependent (Morrison et al., 2007) and neuro-modulated plasticity (Potjans et al., 2010), and a Topology module for spatially structured networks (Plesser & Enger, 2013). Streamlined data-structures (Kunkel et al., 2011) allow NEST to efficiently exploit the capabilities of some of the largest computers on Earth for simula- tions on the brain scale (Helias et al., 2012). Systematic quality assurance through testsuites (Eppler et al., 2009) and continuous integration technology (Zaytsev & Morrison, 2013) ensure simulator reliability (within limits). With a user-friendly Python-based interface (Eppler et al., 2008; Gewaltig et al., 2012), integration with PyNN (Davison et al., 2008) for simulator-independent scripting and MUSIC support (Djurfeldt et al., 2010) for integrated multi-scale simulation, NEST is a powerful simulation tool for brain-scale simulations today. NEST has been publicly available since 2004 and has been taught at summer schools and graduate courses since, training a generation of computational scientists. This has lead to a steady increase in computational neuroscience publications based on NEST simulations in recent years (see [URL] for a list), indicating that NEST is indeed establishing itself as a widely used tool for the simulation of large networks of (comparatively) simple model neurons. As of the NEST 2. 0 release in 2012, NEST is available under the GNU Public License to ensure wide dissemination. The further development of NEST is chaperoned by the NEST Initiative, a non-for-profit organization incorporated in Ecublens, Switzerland, which is open for interested scientists. We are currently preparing to move <b>NEST</b> <b>source</b> code to a distributed version control system, allowing all NEST users ”real time” access to bug fixes and improvements, and to facilitate contributions by the NEST Community. In our demonstration, we will illustrate the capabilities and versatility of NEST. We will in particular focus on three complementary approaches to simulating large-scale cortical networks: A data-driven approach based on detailed connectivity information (based on data from the Blue Brain Project), constructive network generation, based on connectivity patterns (Potjans & Diesmann, 2012), and simulation of advanced 3 D topological networks.

If the factors [...] "wafers" [...] and [...] "sites" [...] are treated as random effects, then it is possible to estimate a variance component due to each source of variation through analysis of variance techniques.

These sources often defeat traditional methods for source finding, which expand regions around points of high intensity. Extended sources often have no bright points and are only detectable when viewed as a whole, so a more sophisticated approach is required. Our algorithm operates at all scales simultaneously by considering a tree of nested candidate bounding boxes, and inverts a hierarchical Bayesian generative model to obtain the probability of sources existing at given locations and sizes. This model naturally accommodates the detection of <b>nested</b> <b>sources,</b> and no prior knowledge {{of the distribution of}} a source, or even the background, is required.

Supercolonies displayed a structural continuum from being small ( 10, 000 ha) and “diffuse ” with little continuity among detections.

These host wasps stock up their <b>nests</b> with food <b>sources</b> that contain nutrients the Chrysidid wasp cannot synthesize itself.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of benthic assemblages {{is a valuable}} tool to describe the ecological status of transitional water ecosystems, but species are extremely sensitive and respond to both microhabitat and seasonal differences. The identification {{of changes in the}} composition of the macrobenthic community in specific microhabitats can then be used as an "early warning" for environmental changes which may affect the economic and ecological importance of lagoons, through their provision of Ecosystem Services. From a conservational point of view, the appropriate definition of the spatial aggregation level of microhabitats or local communities is of crucial importance. The main objective of this work is to assess the role of the spatial scale in the {{analysis of}} lagoon biodiversity. First, we analyze the variation in the sample coverage for alternative aggregations of the monitoring stations in three lagoons of the Po River Delta. Then, we analyze the variation of a class of entropy indices by mixed effects models, properly accounting for the fixed effects of biotic and abiotic factors and random effects ruled by <b>nested</b> <b>sources</b> of variability corresponding to alternative definitions of local communities. Finally, we address biodiversity partitioning by a generalized diversity measure, namely the Tsallis entropy, and for alternative definitions of the local communities.

40|$|Key words: {{hierarchical}} linear model, multilevel research, {{sample design}} The hierarchical linear model {{approach to a}} two-level design is considered, some variables at the lower level having fixed and others having random regression coefficients. An approximation is derived to the covariance matrix of the estimators of the fixed regression coefficients (for variables at the lower and the higher level) {{under the assumption that}} the sample sizes at either level are large enough. This covariance matrix is expressed as a function of parameters occurring in the model. If a research planner can make a reason-able guess as to these parameters, this approximation {{can be used as a}} guide to the choice of sample sizes at either level. Multilevel and, in particular, two-level designs are used frequently in educational and social research. Hierarchical linear models incorporating both random and fixed effects provide a useful statistical paradigm for situations where nesting is an obvious and direct consequence of multistage sampling as well as situations with <b>nested</b> <b>sources</b> of random variability. (See Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992, for a general introduction; see Raudenbush, 1988, for a review.) Some applications of such models follow. 1. Nesting of microunits within macrounits—for instance, students within schools (e. g., Aitkin & Longford, 1986). The sampling design can be, but does not need to be, a multistage sample. 2. Multivariate analysis, with randomly sampled measurements on a latent construct where the measurements are nested within randomly sampled units (e. g., Goldstein, 1987, p. 61). 3. Assessment of change in a repeated measurements design, with the repeated measures assumed to be random samples within units, the samples being ordered in time (e. g., Bryk & Raudenbush, 1987).

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{communities}} in conservation in central Philippines, {{with reference to}} marine protected areas. It analyzes communities as intersections of multiple actors with stratified interests and power, involving complex processes of place-making, ecological knowledge, tenure, governance, markets, and negotiation with domestic and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). As rights to places are fundamentally at issue with protected areas, matters of tenure are central for the study. And because marine protected areas (MPAs) are community-based, questions of local empowerment have equal centrality. The ownership of rights to marine resources by village members is a necessary if not sufficient condition for the political empowerment of communities in conservation. The issue of property rights in the Philippines is irrevocably linked to issues of equity, as social actors confront prevailing unequal relations of power. The development of community commitment to the reconfigured arrangements of marine protected area establishment depends on substantial economic gains for marginalized villagers, an equitable distribution of those gain, the ecologically sound management of resources over which rights are negotiated and gains generated, and a socially meaningful realignment of relations of power among <b>nested</b> <b>sources</b> of authority. My analysis points to the advantages of a reinforced community property regime that would call for measures by the national government to enhance villagers' tenure over their settlements and community waters (katubigang barangay).

Displacement is a dominant display in which a red wattlebird will land on a perch that has been immediately vacated by another bird. A smaller red wattlebird adopts a horizontal appeasement posture side-on to the aggressor in which it lowers its head, flutters its wings and edges closer to the other bird. [...] As well as smaller bird species, red wattlebirds can mob and chase larger species such as the Australian magpie (Cracticus tibicen), butcherbirds and currawongs, the black-faced cuckooshrike (Coracina novaehollandiae), the olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), crows and ravens, the laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae) and even small raptors like the collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a simplified proof {{for the existence}} of nested lattice codebooks allowing to achieve the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise channel, as well as the optimal rate-distortion trade-off for a Gaussian source. The proof is self-contained and relies only on basic probabilistic and geometrical arguments. An ensemble of nested lattices that is different, and more elementary, than the one used in previous proofs is introduced. This ensemble is based on lifting different subcodes of a linear code to the Euclidean space using Construction A. In addition to being simpler, our analysis is less sensitive to the assumption that the additive noise is Gaussian. In particular, for additive ergodic noise channels it is shown that the achievable rates of the nested lattice coding scheme depend on the noise distribution only via its power. Similarly, the <b>nested</b> lattice <b>source</b> coding scheme attains the same rate-distortion trade-off for all ergodic sources with the same second moment...|$|R
5000|$|The saffron shiner (Notropis rubricroceus) is a North American {{species of}} ray-finned {{fish in the}} genus Notropis. It is found in cold, clear, and rocky streams and creeks in the Tennessee River drainage. Characteristics are a {{relatively}} deep body, dorsal fin origin above back half of pelvic fin base, medium-sized eye, narrow rounded snout, sub-terminal mouth, elongate spot at base of tail fin, dark side stripe on back half of body, olive back, silver sides, white belly, fins pale except for black mark on tail fin, and breeding males will be bright red with blue stripe on the side. The adults grow to between 40 - 60 mm in length and mature to reproductive status in one to two years. When spawning the females release approximately 440 to 1200 eggs and they either spawn over a chub nest or in gravel runs without a <b>nest.</b> Food <b>sources</b> for saffron shiners consist of insects, worms, spiders, plants and algae.|$|R

Households are assumed to choose a single type of move, intraMSA or interMSA, while simultaneously choosing a central city or suburban destination. We demonstrate that a nested logit model is appropriate on both theoretical and empirical grounds. The sample consists of intrametropolitan and intermetropolitan movers drawn from the 1990 U. S. Census PUMS. Personal characteristics drawn from the PUMS are matched to numerous site characteristics (climatic measures, other amenities, state and local fiscal characteristics, and other urban quality measures) drawn {{from a variety of}} <b>sources.</b> <b>Nested</b> logit direct and cross elasticities are presented for a number of site attributes.

40|$|What generates {{persistence}} in ination? Is ination persistence structural? This paper investigates learning {{as a potential}} source of {{persistence in}} ination. The paper focuses on the price-setting problem of 8 ̆ 5 rms and presents a model that <b>nests</b> structural <b>sources</b> of persistence (indexation) and learning. Indexation is typically necessary under rational expectations to match the inertia in the data and to improve the 8 ̆ 5 t of estimated New Keynesian Phillips curves. The empirical results show that when learning replaces the assumption of fully rational expectations, structural sources of persistence in ination, such as indexation, become unsupported by the data. The results suggest learning behavior as {{the main source of}} persistence in ination. This 8 ̆ 5 nding has implications for the optimal monetary policy. The paper also shows how ones results can heavily depend on the assumed learning speed. The estimated persistence and the model 8 ̆ 5 t, in fact, vary across the whole range of constant gain values. The paper derives the best- 8 ̆ 5 tting constant gains in the sample and shows that the learning speed has substantially changed over time...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{wideband}} fast kernel-independent modeling of large multiscale structures; we employ a <b>nested</b> equivalent <b>source</b> approximation (NESA) to compress the dense system matrix. The NESA {{was introduced by}} these authors for low and moderate frequency problems (smaller than a few wavelengths); here, we introduce a high-frequency NESA algorithm, and propose a hybrid version with extreme wideband properties. The equivalent sources of the wideband NESA (WNESA) are obtained by an inverse-source process, enforcing equivalence of radiated fields on suitably defined testing surfaces. In the low-frequency region, the NESA is used unmodified, with a complexity of mathcalO(N). In the high-frequency region, {{in order to obtain}} a fixed rank matrix compression, we hierarchically divide the far coupling space into pyramids with angles related to the peer coupling group size, and the NESA testing surfaces are defined as the boundaries of the pyramids. This results in a directional nested low-rank (fixed rank) approximation with mathcalO(NN) computational complexity that is kernel independent; overall, the approach yields wideband fast solver for the modeling of large structures that inherits the efficiency and accuracy of low-frequency NESA for multiscale problems. Numerical results and discussions demonstrate the validity of the proposed wor...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} the loop <b>nest</b> splitting <b>source</b> code optimization on the worst-case execution time (WCET). Loop nest splitting minimizes the number of executed if-statements in loop nests of embedded multimedia applications. Especially loops and if-statements of high-level languages are an inherent source of unpredictability and loss of precision for WCET analysis. This is caused {{by the fact that it}} is difficult to obtain safe and tight worst-case estimates of an application 2 ̆ 7 s flow of control through these high-level constructs. In addition, the corresponding control flow redirections expressed at the assembly level reduce predictability even more due to the complex pipeline and branch prediction behavior of modern embedded processors. The analysis techniques for loop nest splitting are based on precise mathematical models combined with genetic algorithms. On the one hand, these techniques achieve a significantly more homogeneous structure of the control flow. On the other hand, the precision of our analyses leads to the generation of very accurate high-level flow facts for loops and if-statements. The application of our implemented algorithms to three real-life multimedia benchmarks leads to average speed-ups by 25. 0...|$|R
