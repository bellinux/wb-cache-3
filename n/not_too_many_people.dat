2500|$|In 1978, Ronstadt, Dolly Parton, and Emmylou Harris, {{friends and}} admirers of one another's work (Ronstadt had {{included}} {{a cover of}} Parton's [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] on Prisoner in Disguise) attempted to collaborate on a Trio album. Unfortunately, the attempt did not pan out. Ronstadt later remarked that <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were in control {{at the time and}} everyone was too involved with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the recordings were included on the singers' respective solo recordings over the next few years.) This concept album was put on the back burner for almost ten years.|$|E
2500|$|Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said of Cornell: [...] "I’ve {{always said}} that Chris was the {{greatest}} songwriter to ever come out of Seattle. Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to {{at different points in}} our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> that have that many options with their voice. He could do {{a lot of different things}} with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that I got to be in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness." ...|$|E

50|$|The advice Gilbert offers is to {{use other}} people's {{experiences}} to predict the future, instead of imagining it. It is surprising how similar people are in much of their experiences, he says. He does <b>not</b> expect <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> to heed this advice, as our culture, accompanied by various thinking tendencies, is against this method of decision making.|$|R

5000|$|In Round 19 of the 2014 NRL season, Lulia scored four tries {{against the}} Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, equaling the club record set by Kevin McGuinness and Marika Koroibete. His coach, Mick Potter, said, [...] "that {{was a great}} {{performance}} from him. His finishing ability was just second to none. A couple of those tries he scored, <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> can do that sort of stuff." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mike Mitchell, {{a former}} competitor, {{said it was}} once easy to place {{in the top three}} with only about 50 judges, but now with over 300, he hasn’t been in a top-ten finish in a decade. Mitchell stated, [...] "I wish it would be like it used to be about ten years ago…. <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> little noise, and you knew everyone’s name." ...|$|E

50|$|The Multiflux pickups {{were the}} first commercially {{available}} pickups to use two humbucking pickups in one case. Dimarzio's Multibucker is a more recent take on this idea. The Multibucker has four side-by-side coils, {{as opposed to the}} Multiflux's two stacked coils. The Multiflux is a rather rare pickup, with <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> having ordered it. It carried a higher price tag than the other pickups in the range and the switching options could become rather confusing.|$|E

5000|$|Yo, so I {{just wanted}} to say a few things about John Cardiel. First off, he's an {{original}}; his style—there's <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> who skate like him. The way he skates is amazing, 'cause he'll skate so fast, but it seems like the faster he goes, the more control he has ... which is, you know, unexplainable. But he's unbelievable. I'm not trying to kiss too much butt, but he's a ripper, an original ripper ... He's an original Coors.|$|E
50|$|The {{average length}} of the school term was about fifty days {{during the summer months}} since the school houses were not {{suitable}} for use in cold weather.

30|$|This {{case report}} was not {{started with the}} {{intention}} to perform a scientific study to write a case report. The first intention of the athlete and his support crew was to achieve the 33 Ironman distances within 33  days. The idea was to secure a perimeter near facilities {{since there was no}} funding for the event and it was impossible to have a racing caravan. Unfortunately, sleep and eating pattern were <b>not</b> recorded. <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were involved in feeding and supporting the athlete and it was impossible to record accurately the ingested calories and the timing of feeding.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} walk-off home run, {{thousands}} of fans stormed the Yankee Stadium field to celebrate. Chambliss was mobbed on the basepaths {{and did not}} make an attempt to touch home plate. Instead, he ran straight toward the dugout {{and the safety of}} the Yankee clubhouse. Chambliss was then asked by Graig Nettles if he had touched home, and responded that he had <b>not</b> because <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were in the way. Nettles then told him that home plate umpire Art Frantz was waiting for him to touch home so that the home run could be ruled official. He was then escorted back out onto the field to touch home, but the plate had been stolen, so he touched the area where the plate had been.|$|R
50|$|The {{second section}} of the book {{describes}} the author's reason for versifying the Zaratushtnama. The author sees a book written in Middle Persian with Middle Persian script. He brings it to the Zoroastrian Mobed Mobedan and the Mobed reads {{a portion of the}} book for him. The Mobed complains that <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> are not aware of this script anymore, and I am afraid that this story will disappear. It is better if it is brought to the New Persian script and language.|$|E

Being {{able to go out}} there and practice with my teammates is a blessing. <b>Not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> come back positive from an ACL injury." [...] In an interview with The Daily Reveille, Alexander noted the strength of LSU's defensive line in recent years and suggested that, iff Penn State is Linebacker U. and USC is Halfback U., then LSU should be known as [...] "Defensive Line U": [...] "This is officially now Defensive Line University.

5000|$|This was {{a highly}} {{successful}} season for Dixon who won the series championship for the second time, and won his first Indianapolis 500, from the pole, to give car owner Chip Ganassi his second win in the race. He also won at Homestead, Texas, Nashville, Edmonton and Kentucky, a record equalling six wins for a season in the series. In the final points scoring race of the series, at Chicagoland Speedway, Dixon needed to finish no worse than eighth if Castroneves won the race. He placed second to Castroneves in a tight photo finish. Speaking to the media later he said {{it had been an}} amazing, unforgettable year. [...] "Getting married, winning the 500, winning a championship in one year - <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> can probably say they've done that."

5000|$|In the graveyard, {{there are}} graves with old ornamented wooden tombstones called as [...] "gombfa".

5000|$|In {{his book}} The Ultimate Resource 2, Julian Simon claimed {{that there is}} a strong {{correlation}} between government corruption and lack of sufficient supplies of safe, clean water. Simon wrote, [...] "there is complete agreement among water economists that all it takes to ensure an adequate supply for agriculture as well as for households in rich countries is that there be a rational structure of water law and market pricing. The problem is <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> but rather defective laws and bureaucratic interventions; freeing up markets in water would eliminate just about all water problems forever... In poor water-short countries the problem with water supply—as with so many other matters—is lack of wealth to create systems to supply water efficiently enough. As these countries become richer, their water problems will become less difficult". This theoretical argument, however, ignores real-world conditions, including strong barriers to open water markets, the difficulty of moving water from one region to another, inability of some populations to pay for water, and grossly imperfect information on water use. Actual experience with peak water constraints in some wealthy, but water-short countries and regions still suggests serious difficulties in reducing water challenges.|$|E
5000|$|Martin {{called the}} second season [...] "a sophomore series that {{embodied}} almost everything that was sublime about its mother-ship back in its heyday." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide wrote in October 2008 that {{although he did not}} enjoy the premiere episode of season two, [...] "then the show got good. Really good." [...] He ranked the spin-off above General Hospital itself, saying [...] "it's indisputably superior to the mob-infested soap that spawned it." [...] Logan added that [...] "This late-night SOAPnet series is refreshingly retro, focusing as GH once did on the lives of doctors and their patients. (Imagine that!) The pleasures are many, from the frisky interplay of interns Claire and Kyle (she's straight, he's not) to the profoundly moving performances of Finola Hughes and Tristan Rogers as Anna and her cancer-stricken Robert." [...] Michael Fairman called Rogers' performance [...] "poignant" [...] and noted that [...] "if it could have been in Emmy contention this year, it would stand among the best." [...] Rogers himself said of the season, [...] "Night Shift was a wonderful glimpse of what was possible to do with a daytime format and a primetime format, shot in HD, edited like a movie, and essentially brought up to date, which was subtle. It was written by Sri Rao, who really understood the genre. He really got it ... I think this is an issue of what goes on with the daytime soaps. There are <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> out there now who want to take what history there is, and take it and build on it. I can see why they don’t want to do that, but on the other hand, I don’t think there is much point in changing history for the sake of change. If you have a really good reason to change it then do it, otherwise use it!" [...] De Lacroix wrote that Season Two [...] "expertly delivered traditional soap opera in a modern form while reinforcing love as the center of the medium, instead of devaluing it as so many soaps do today," [...] adding that [...] "All the characters on NS2 were intelligent adults, {{the way they used to}} be on soap operas before about a decade ago when most characters were rendered brainless and stupid." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} {{behavior}} differs fundamentally {{from the study}} of the psyche and logically cannot share the same discipline. However, while disciplines might be defined through technical exercises, they function through exercises of political power. The evolution of a discipline, though based on field and laboratory data interpreted within a specific paradigm and justified publicity by its utility to solve personal and social problems, follows a course of development in the political arenas of the academies and the professions. We happen to have a discipline, roughly connoted by the label “behavior analysis,” without an academic home (the present ones haphazardly tolerate our activities), without a professional organization (the present one lobbies only “for behavior analysis”), and without a true professional name (the present one implies an approach not a discipline). No scientific community lasts long without a supporting professional infrastructure. In explicitly asserting ourselves as a discipline, we confront a number of difficult issues such as continuing to work in departments antithetical to behaviorism and a number of problems such as what we call ourselves to identify our professional and scientific concerns. (For example, we need a term descriptive of our science in its broad sense. That term is <b>not</b> psychology. <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> persist in maintaining its commitment to cognitivism. On whatever term we agree, “behavior” should constitute its stem, for our efforts focus there, not in the putative underlying psyche or its current cognitive update.) The focus of our concerns and the solutions of our problems rest on one issue: Will our discipline prosper most as a branch of psychology or as an independent discipline? Slowly, but surely, our actions demonstrate that the latter is the preferred option, but these actions, though fortuitous, occur almost by accident. By specifically programming to achieve an independent professional status we increase the probability of doing so...|$|R
40|$|While {{contemplating the}} qualities that make a great leader and {{specific}} leaders in general, several people began to come to mind. Many of the great leaders of all time were not necessarily “positive leaders. ” Some were famous; others were infamous. Leaders come in all shapes in sizes: Some are loud and aggressive; others say very little and let their actions be their example. Although level of fame does not necessarily dictate {{the effectiveness of a}} leader, it does help in making them more universal—thus having the greatest impact on the masses. The lesser known leaders have to make their impact on a much smaller, but no less important scale. Some leaders we know through history’s recollections; others we may have known personally. George “Buck ” Weaver is not a household word and may never get the credit he truly deserves, yet nonetheless exhibited {{some of the most important}} qualities of leadership. Now unless you are an avid baseball fan, with an appreciation for the history of the game, you may not know who Buck Weaver is. And if you do know who he is, you might be wondering why on earth someone would be writing about the qualities of leadership about this particular person—especially in regard to how he is remembered in history. Buck Weaver played third base for the Chicago White Sox. That fact alone does <b>not</b> mean much <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> since there have been countless numbers of White Sox third basemen over the years. But the fact that Buck Weaver was the third basemen for the 1919 White Sox (or Black Sox as they were called) might ring a bell. Eight players from the 1919 White Sox were banned for life from baseball for throwing the 1919 World Series. The starting third baseman for the Chicago White Sox...|$|R
