5|$|Coniferous trees such {{as black}} spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and <b>Norway</b> <b>maple</b> is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other non-native species grown.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (<b>Norway</b> <b>maple),</b> Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and Ericaceae.|$|E
5|$|Most {{land around}} the oxbow is steep. It {{is covered by}} hemlock and {{hardwood}} forests, as well as skunk cabbage seeps. The forests around the lake also contain black birch, yellow birch, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, tulip poplar, and <b>Norway</b> <b>maple,</b> while the understory contains slippery elm, European privet, Japanese barberry, American elderberry, wild hydrangea, witch hazel, mountain laurel, ironwood, and the rare American yew. The American yew population was in significant decline by 2004 due to heavy grazing by deer.|$|E
5000|$|Chapman Parkway - Named {{in memory}} of the Rev. John Wilbur Chapman, a {{principal}} member of the Stony Brook Assembly, it was given by his widow Mabel and was completed in 1919. The paved parkway is lined with <b>Norway</b> <b>Maples</b> and is the main drive and address of the school.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, {{a survey}} in {{registered}} 84 species {{of trees and}} shrubs including: white birch, common hawthorn, alders, sweet chestnuts, silver berry, common salt trees, walnut trees, magnolias, jasmines, poplars, silver poplars, cherry trees, English oaks, robinias, sumacs, elder berries, willows, lime trees, elms, basalm trees, firs, white firs, sawara cypresses, Norway spruces, blue spruces, mountain pines, pine trees, Swiss pines, English yews, ashleaf <b>maples,</b> ailanthus, sycamores, <b>Norway</b> <b>maples,</b> field maples, silver maples, horse-chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, beeches, European beeches, hornbeams and European hornbeams.|$|R
50|$|It {{is favored}} {{due to its}} tall trunk and {{tolerance}} of poor, compacted soils and urban pollution, conditions that sugar maple cannot grow in. Because of the <b>Norway</b> <b>maple's</b> invasive nature, the London plane, Platanus X acerifolia, is often recommended as a pollution tolerant urban tree for planting where trees cannot be allowed to freely colonise new areas.|$|R
5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (<b>Norway</b> <b>maple),</b> and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant life}} around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek {{includes}} various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's riparian buffer contains old growth forest, including tulip poplar trees. In addition to tulip popular, hemlock and pine also {{occur in the}} Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some riparian buffering. Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas are full of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include Japanese knotweed, <b>Norway</b> <b>Maple,</b> and Ailanthus. Overall, the riparian buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land.|$|E

500|$|A {{system of}} public parks was {{developed}} in Missoula in 1902 with the donation by lumber baron Thomas Greenough and his wife Tessie. They gave a [...] tract of land along Rattlesnake Creek for Greenough Park, {{on the condition that}} [...] "the land forever be used as a park and for park purposes to which the people of Missoula may ... find a comfortable, romantic and poetic retreat". In a follow-up nine years later {{in a letter to the}} Missoulian, he stressed his interest in having the park remain in as close to a native state as possible. That request, along with the discovery that non-native <b>Norway</b> <b>maples</b> were inhibiting the growth of native trees and shrubs such as cottonwoods, ponderosa pines and Rocky Mountain maples, led to the controversial decision to remove <b>Norway</b> <b>maples</b> from the park with the hope of returning it to its natural state.|$|R
50|$|At least 15 {{memorials}} {{are on the}} plaza, {{including the}} New York State Fallen Firefighters Memorial as well as memorials for World War II and the Vietnam War.

25|$|Among other notable {{parks are}} the Maritime Victory Park on Krestovsky Island and the Moscow Victory Park in the south, both commemorating the victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War, {{as well as}} the Central Park of Culture and Leisure occupying Yelagin Island and the Tauride Garden around the Tauride Palace. The most common trees grown in the parks are the English oak, <b>Norway</b> <b>maple,</b> green ash, silver birch, Siberian Larch, blue spruce, crack willow, limes, and poplars. Important dendrological {{collections}} dating back to the 19th century are hosted by the Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden and the Park of the Forestry Academy.|$|E
25|$|Pine forests (with Pinus sylvestris) are {{the most}} {{widespread}} and occupy 51% of the forested area of the Karelian Isthmus, followed by spruce forests (with Picea abies, 29%) and birch forests (with Betula pendula and B. pubescens, 16%). Stands on more fertile soils and in more favorable locations are occasionally dominated by <b>Norway</b> <b>maple,</b> black alder, grey alder, common aspen, English oak, grey willow, dark-leaved willow, tea-leaved willow, small-leaved lime or European white elm. Common vegetation of various types of pine forests includes heather, crowberry, common juniper, eared willow, lingonberry, water horsetail, bracken, graminoids (i.e. grasses in the wider sense) Avenella flexuosa and Carex globularis, mosses Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium and S. russowii, and lichens Cladonia spp. Prominent in various spruce forests are wood horsetail, common wood sorrel, bilberry, lingonberry, graminoids Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis arundinacea, Carex globularis, and mosses Polytrichum commune and Sphagnum girgensohnii. Prominent vegetation of various birch forests include meadowsweet, common wood sorrel, bilberry and graminoids Calamagrostis arundinacea and C. canescens.|$|E
500|$|The {{sycamore}} {{gall mite}} Eriophyes macrorhynchus produces small red galls, {{similar to those}} of the nail gall mite Eriophyes tiliae, on leaves of sycamore and field maple, Acer campestris from April onwards. [...] Another mite, Aceria pseudoplatani causes a 'sycamore felt gall' on the underside of leaves of both sycamore and <b>Norway</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer platanoides). The sycamore aphid Drepanosiphum platanoidis sucks sap from buds and foliage, producing large quantities of sticky honeydew that contaminate foliage, cars and garden furniture beneath.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation in {{the area}} is divided into several sections. Near the Lake Mendota Drive {{entrance}} there is a heavy population of red pine, spruce, white pine, red cedar and catalpa trees. Species in the southern portion of the point include silver maple, hackberry, green ash, box elder, and cottonwood trees. Several hardwood trees round out holes in the forest, including sugar maple, hackberry, basswood, and black cherry, along with red elderberry shrubs. The area has issues with invasive non-native vegetation, such as buckthorn, honeysuckle, and <b>Norway</b> <b>maples.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Climate change {{appears to}} be {{affecting}} the maple sugar industry. Sugar maples {{have been subject to}} stress by acid rain, asian longhorn beetles, pear thrips, and, in 2011, an excessive deer herd that is forced to eat bark in the winter. These maples need a certain amount of cold to produce sap for maple syrup. The time to tap these trees has shrunk to one week in some years. The tree may be replaced by the more aggressive <b>Norway</b> <b>maples,</b> in effect forcing the sugar maples to [...] "migrate" [...] north to Canada.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the woodpile goes back to a mansion built by 19th century Swiss {{immigrant}} August Rudli, who imported two <b>Norway</b> <b>maples</b> to grace his estate. A century later the house {{had gone back to}} nature, but one of the maples still thrived, until all the hardwood timber on the lot was sold and logged in the winter of 1938. The logs cut from the tree end up in Gahato at Dan Pringle's sawmill, where the next spring they are sawn into boards and stored in Pile No. 1027.|$|R

2500|$|The {{banknote}} {{designs were}} criticised by Keith Rushton, {{chairman of the}} graphic design department at the Ontario College of Art and Design as being [...] "trite, banal, ordinary and not too inspiring". Botanist Sean Blaney told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that the depiction of the maple leaf on the banknote is that of an invasive five-lobed <b>Norway</b> <b>Maple,</b> not a maple tree indigenous to Canada such as the three-lobed sugar maple. A spokesperson for the Bank of Canada stated that the design was [...] "a stylized blend of different Canadian maple species". The 2009 focus group report stated {{that the image of}} the train on the $10 banknote was attractive but uninspiring and outdated, and drew complaints from people in Atlantic Canada where many [...] "railway links have been decommissioned".|$|E
5|$|Native {{riparian}} {{plant life}} includes sandbar willows and cottonwoods with Montana's state tree, the ponderosa pine, also being prevalent. Other native plants include wetland {{species such as}} cattails and beaked-sedge as well as shrubs and berry plants like Douglas hawthorn, chokecherry, and western snowberries. To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted knapweed, leafy spurge, St. John's wort, and sulfur cinquefoil. Controversially, the <b>Norway</b> <b>maples</b> that line many of Missoula's older streets have also been declared an invasive species.|$|R
5|$|The Fonteyn Kill and its {{riparian}} zone {{are home to}} a variety of species. Caddisflies, clams and mussels, crayfish (Astacidae), damselflies, gammarids, isopods (Asellidae), oligochaetes, black flies, leeches, chironomids, bladder snails, and other snails were recorded in the stream in 2010. Trees {{along the banks of the}} Fonteyn Kill include American elms, sugar <b>maples,</b> black cherries, <b>Norway</b> <b>maples,</b> and red maples, while barberry, privet, holly, Japanese knotweed, honeysuckle, spicebush, common reeds, and Japanese roses make up the kill's riparian shrubs. Carp, mallards, great blue herons, frogs, snapping turtles, and other birds also reside in and around the stream. A 1924 source observed that trout fishing occurred on the kill.|$|R
50|$|In April 1934 the Bradleys hired Carl Urban, {{a fourth}} {{generation}} gardener, {{to supervise the}} crew and the planting of the garden beds and trees. Trained in Germany and the United States, Urban observed that {{when he first saw}} the acreage behind the house it consisted mainly of corn fields with horses, sheep, goats and 13 oak trees. Over time, nearly 4,000 trees were planted on the property—several varieties of elms as well as Norwegian, Austrian and Scotch pines, <b>Norway</b> <b>maples,</b> a Danish plum tree, seven varieties of birch trees and Kentucky coffee trees. Urban remained on the staff and resided in the apartment in the barn until his death in 1991.|$|R
2500|$|Skuleskogen {{is located}} on the {{northern}} border of the range of several plant species. Thus several deciduous tree species are present in the park, such as the little-leaf linden (...) , the common hazel (...) , the guelder-rose (...) , and the <b>Norway</b> <b>maple</b> (...) [...] The presence of these species is considered more of a relic of a warmer era than a feature of the current times. Their survival has been rendered possible by the unusual conditions encountered at the foot of certain mountains called [...] (literally [...] "mountain of southern-like vegetation"): the orientation of the rock face to the sun and the humidity brought about by the mountain offer a favorable microclimate which, in conjunction with the fertile soil, permits plants which do not normally grow at so high a latitude to thrive.|$|E
50|$|The {{sugar maple}} is also often {{confused}} with the <b>Norway</b> <b>maple,</b> though they are not closely related within the genus. The sugar maple is most easily identified by clear sap in the leaf petiole (the <b>Norway</b> <b>maple</b> has white sap), brown, sharp-tipped buds (the <b>Norway</b> <b>maple</b> has blunt, green or reddish-purple buds), and shaggy bark on older trees (the <b>Norway</b> <b>maple</b> bark has small grooves).

50|$|In {{some parts}} of New England, {{particularly}} near urbanized areas, the sugar maple is being displaced by the <b>Norway</b> <b>maple.</b> The <b>Norway</b> <b>maple</b> is also highly shade tolerant, but is considerably more tolerant of urban conditions, resulting in the sugar maple's replacement in those area. In addition, <b>Norway</b> <b>maple</b> produces much larger crops of seeds, allowing it to out-compete native species.|$|E

5000|$|Once he had {{purchased}} the land, Alvord laid {{out all the}} necessary utilities and marked the entrance of most streets with brick piers with cast concrete plaques bearing the bas-relief inscription [...] "PPS". He also hired John Aitkin, a Scottish landscape gardener, to supervise the plantings for the lawns and malls, with meticulous attention given to details. Trees, for instance, were not planted only along the curb line, but also at the building line as well, to give the streets greater breadth of vision, to block out adjoining houses, and provide the illusion that each house {{was the only one}} on the block. Both <b>Norway</b> <b>maples</b> and Carolina poplars were used: the poplars for immediate shade, and the slower-growing maples for long-term shade. Alvord did all this before selling a single plot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} allée {{was planted}} in the mid-1920s by Princeton Nurseries, at one time the country's largest commercial plant nursery.
