Lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies, but because of interference from the Sun, the radiation from the Milky Way was <b>not</b> <b>detectable.</b>|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{mutations}} are {{detected by}} sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means {{that some people}} with the clinical diagnosis have mutations that are <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> by current technology, or that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of {{and to provide a}} means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family even if they have not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E
25|$|A second {{limitation}} is that gene-environment correlation is <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> {{as a distinct}} effect. Addressing this limit requires incorporating adoption models, or children-of-twins designs, to assess family influences uncorrelated with shared genetic effects.|$|E

25|$|Structures {{subject to}} a {{follower}} (nonconservative) load may suffer instabilities which are not of the buckling type and therefore are <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> with a static approach. For instance, the so-called 'Ziegler column' is shown in Fig.5.|$|E
25|$|Sibutramine and its two active N-demethylated {{metabolites}} may {{be measured}} in biofluids by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Plasma levels of these three species are usually in the 1–10 μg/L range in persons undergoing therapy with the drug. The parent compound and norsibutramine are often <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> in urine, but dinorsibutramine is generally present at concentrations of >200 μg/L.|$|E

25|$|Both {{partners}} {{should get}} tested for STIs before initiating sexual contact, or before resuming contact if a partner engaged {{in contact with}} someone else. Many infections are <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> immediately after exposure, so enough time must be allowed between possible exposures and testing for the tests to be accurate. Certain STIs, particularly certain persistent viruses like HPV, may be impossible to detect with current medical procedures.|$|E
25|$|Because the mother's body is able {{to break}} down {{phenylalanine}} during pregnancy, infants with PKU are normal at birth. The disease is <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> by physical examination at that time, because no damage has yet been done. However, a blood test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after {{one or two days}} of normal infant feeding. This is the purpose of newborn screening, to detect the disease with a blood test before any damage is done, so that treatment can prevent the damage from happening.|$|E
25|$|Before IBAN, differing {{national}} standards for bank account identification (i.e. bank, branch, routing codes, and account number) were confusing for some users. This often led to necessary routing information being missing from payments. Routing information as specified by ISO 9362 (also known as Business Identifier Codes (BIC code), SWIFT ID or SWIFT code, and SWIFT-BIC) {{does not require a}} specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. It also does not contain check digits, so errors of transcription were <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> and it was not possible for a sending bank to validate the routing information prior to submitting the payment. Routing errors caused delayed payments and incurred extra costs to the sending and receiving banks and often to intermediate routing banks.|$|E

500|$|Psilocybe tampanensis {{contains}} the psychedelic compounds psilocin and psilocybin, and is consumed for recreational and entheogenic purposes. The species {{was found to}} be one of the most popular psychoactive mushrooms confiscated by German authorities in a 2000 report, behind Psilocybe cubensis, Psilocybe semilanceata, and Panaeolus cyanescens. The alkaloid content in the confiscated samples ranged from <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> to 0.19% psilocybin, and 0.01 to 0.03% psilocin. According to mycologist Michael Beug, dried fruit bodies can contain up to 1% psilocybin and psilocin; in terms of psychoactive potency, Stamets considers the mushroom [...] "moderately to highly active".|$|E
500|$|Hurricane Dog is {{believed}} to have developed from a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on August24. Its first observation as a tropical cyclone occurred on August30, when it was a [...] hurricane; the storm {{is believed}} to have begun farther east as a Cape Verde-type hurricane, but was <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> before August 30. At the time, Dog was located east of the Lesser Antilles, and it quickly attained major hurricane status as it moved to the west-northwest. Dog passed through the Lesser Antilles with winds of [...] It was considered among the worst hurricanes in the history of Antigua, where thousands were left homeless. Damage was estimated at $1million (1950USD, $ USD), and there were two deaths from drowning in the region.|$|E

If there is high clinical suspicion, a more sensitive imaging test (CT angiogram, MR angiography, or transesophageal echo) may be warranted.|$|E
30|$|The {{recombinant}} TcAAD enzyme {{expressed by}} yeast {{was shown to}} possess AAD activity by its ability not only to reduce benzyl aldehyde via NADPH at pH  6.0 but also to oxidize benzyl alcohol via NAD+ at pH  9.6. It {{is interesting to note}} that reduction of benzyl aldehyde by the TcAAD at pH  6.0 is NADPH-dependent while NADH did <b>not</b> yield <b>detectable</b> activity under the same conditions (results not shown). Oxidation of benzyl alcohol by the TcAAD at pH  9.6 is NAD+-dependent (Table  1) while NADP+ did <b>not</b> yield <b>detectable</b> activity under the same conditions (results not shown).|$|R
50|$|In immunology, {{seroconversion}} is {{the time}} period during which a specific antibody develops and becomes detectable in the blood. After seroconversion has occurred, the disease can be detected in blood tests for the antibody. During an infection or immunization, antigens enter the blood, and the immune system begins to produce antibodies in response. Before seroconversion, the antigen itself may or may <b>not</b> be <b>detectable,</b> but the antibody is, by definition, absent. During seroconversion, the antibody is present but <b>not</b> yet <b>detectable.</b> Any time after seroconversion, the antibodies can be detected in the blood, indicating a prior or current infection.|$|R

2500|$|Genetic {{disruption}} of the Kcne3 gene in mice impairs intestinal cyclic AMP-stimulated chloride secretion via {{disruption of}} intestinal KCNQ1-KCNE3 channels that are important for regulating the chloride current. [...] KCNE3 also performs a similar function in mouse tracheal epithelium. Kcne3 deletion in mice also predisposes to ventricular arrhythmogenesis, but KCNE3 expression is <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> in mouse heart. The mechanism for ventricular arrhythmogenesis was demonstrated to be indirect, and associated with autoimmune attack of the adrenal gland and secondary hyperaldosteronism (KCNE3 is <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> in the adrenal gland). [...] The elevated serum aldosterone predisposes to arrhythmias triggered in a coronary artery ligation ischemia/reperfusion injury model. [...] Blockade of the aldosterone receptor with spironolactone removed the ventricular arrhythmia predisposition in Kcne3-/- mice. [...] Kcne3 deletion also impairs auditory function because {{of the loss of}} regulation of Kv4.2 channels by KCNE3 in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) of the auditory system. KCNE3 is thought to regulate SGN firing properties and membrane potential via its modulation of Kv4.2.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnosis {{or early}} {{detection}} of lymphedema is difficult. The first signs may be subjective observations such as [...] "my arm feels heavy" [...] or [...] "I have difficulty these days getting rings on and off my fingers". These may be symptomatic of early stage of lymphedema where accumulation of lymph is mild and <b>not</b> <b>detectable</b> by changes in volume or circumference. As lymphedema develops further, definitive diagnosis is commonly based upon an objective measurement of differences between the affected or at-risk limb at the opposite unaffected limb, e.g. in volume or circumference. No generally accepted criterion is definitively diagnostic, although a volume difference of 200ml between limbs or a 4-cm difference (at a single measurement site or set intervals along the limb) is often used. Bioimpedance measurement (which measures the amount of fluid in a limb) offers greater sensitivity than existing methods.|$|E
