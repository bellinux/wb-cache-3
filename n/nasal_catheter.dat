30|$|A {{temperature}} of ~[*]−[*] 7  °C and a flow rate of 14 – 15  L/min were chosen {{from the results}} of a small series of titration experiments in six pigs in which both temperature and flow rate were adjusted with the target of cooling the brain to 32 – 34  °C within 30 – 45  min. Although it is unlikely that air at subzero temperature will induce freezing damage to the mucosa and embedded blood vessels and nerves of the nasal cavity, we monitored the temperature inside the nasal cavity to avoid subzero temperature. A thermistor was placed at the tip of one of the two <b>nasal</b> <b>catheters</b> to measure the temperature inside the nasal cavity throughout the experiments. Even at a flow rate of 14 – 15  L/min and a {{temperature of}} ≈[*]−[*] 7  °C, the air was warmed rapidly along the <b>nasal</b> <b>catheters</b> before reaching the nasopharyngeal tissue. An average temperature of about 6 – 7  °C was consistently measured with the catheter tip thermistor.

30|$|The commercially {{available}} vortex tube (adjustable cold air gun, ITW Vortec Ltd.) is a compact and simple mechanical device {{that can produce}} cold air at different temperatures and flow rates from a stream of compressed gas without any moving parts, chemical reactions, or external energy supply. The source of compressed air was either medical air cylinders supplied by L’Air Liquide Ltd. (St. Thomas, ON, CA), with a capacity of 6569  L at fill pressure of 15, 617  kPa downregulated to 344  kPa, or a hospital medical air outlet at fixed outlet pressure of 344  kPa. High-pressure compressed air from either source {{was applied to the}} inlet nozzle of an electropneumatic pressure regulator (PULSTRONIC II series 605, Numatics Inc.) to monitor and precisely regulate the pressure of compressed air before entering the vortex tube. The compressed air then passed through a generation chamber (inside the vortex tube) which created the vortices inside the tube and caused the compressed air flow to be separated into a cold and a hot stream traveling in opposite directions in the tube. The fraction of compressed air exiting as cold air (also referred as cold fraction ratio) was adjusted by a throttle needle valve via a stepper motor (IMDE 17 -M Integrated Motor/Driver, RMS Technologies Inc., NV, USA). Both temperature and flow rate of the cold air stream were controlled and monitored continuously by a microprocessor-based digital controller that included a feedback system (Atmel’s AVR Microcontroller, ATmega 64 A 8 -bit with 64 K bytes in-system programmable flash). It automatically regulated the inlet pressure and fraction ratio based on the desired cold output air temperature and flow rate from the vortex tube to tightly control the brain temperature and rewarming rate throughout the experiments. Moreover, the temperature of air exiting the cold air outlet of the vortex tube was monitored and recorded continuously with a thermometer (Thermometer/Data Logger, HH 309 A, with Four Type K Thermocouple Inputs, Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT; resolution 0.1  °C). Intranasal brain cooling was achieved by connecting two <b>nasal</b> <b>catheters</b> (made from polyvinyl chloride, PVC) to the tube from the cold air outlet of a vortex tube. The catheters were coated with 2  % lidocaine gel for local anesthesia and ensuring their better contact with turbinates in the nasal cavity and were inserted 8 – 10  cm into each nostril. A thermistor was also placed inside one of the two <b>nasal</b> <b>catheters</b> to monitor temperature inside the nasal cavity throughout the experiments.

40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{describe}} the epidemiology of stroke disability and the use of health resources in South Madrid. Methods—Among a population of 665 168 residents in South Madrid, patients with an acute stroke of clinical onset during March to July 1996 who were seen at a general hospital or at 1 of 3 primary care centers were evaluated at baseline (n 5147) and at 3 months (n 5110) and 6 months (n 5112) after stroke. We assessed the frequencies of stroke and stroke-related residual disability per population unit, as well as the impairment, disability, secondary complications, use of health resources, and impact on quality of life. Results—In patients $ 60 years old, the incidence of stroke with severe residual disability after 6 months was 75 per 10 000, was higher in men, and increased with age; the proportion of survivors among those examined at baseline was 20 %. The use of hospital days per population unit was similar to that of reported European data, but the use of other health care resources was less. Patients frequently used bladder and <b>nasal</b> <b>catheters</b> and presented with shoulder pain. Social activities were infrequent and decreased after stroke. Access to technical aids was limited, and home adaptations were exceptional. The impact of stroke on health-related quality of life among patients and main caregivers was modest. Conclusions—The study shows that in South Madrid, (1) the use of health resources after stroke is low; (2) patients with stroke register low activities of daily living scores with a comparatively small impact on quality of life; and (3) relativ...|$|R

30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that using the vortex tube allows initial rapid and specific brain cooling in rabbits. Moreover, comparing results between piglets and rabbits demonstrates {{that the lack of}} a carotid rete does not prevent specific cooling of the brain by means of the nasopharyngeal method. To evaluate the efficiency of the method and reproducibility of the cooling, we will switch to a large animal model, juvenile pigs, in our next set of experiments and explore maintenance of the brain-body temperature gradient for 6 – 7  h cooling and gradual rewarming rate (0.25  °C/h). In future studies, we will be blowing humidified air into nasal cavities and humidity will be measured and controlled inside of the <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter</b> right before nasal cavities. Histopathological studies on the lining of the nasal cavity will also be performed to demonstrate that there is no damage induced by blowing air for an extended period into the nostrils.|$|E
30|$|An {{attractive}} {{alternative to}} these methods is to induce brain hypothermia, especially {{because of the}} decreased risk of side effects associated with whole-body cooling. Cranial cooling cap devices placed around {{the head and neck}} can easily decrease tympanic temperature; however, they are mostly effective in children because of their favourable ratio of head-to-body surface area [61]. Nasopharyngeal cooling devices, which use volatile coolant fluids via a specific <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter,</b> can rapidly reduce brain temperature with a concomitant reduction of core temperature around 1.0 – 1.5  °C/h [62]. These systems are quite safe, are not dependent on an external energy source and can be initiated even during cardiopulmonary resuscitation [63]. Alternatives methods for cooling could be continuous renal replacement therapy, peritoneal lavage and, in case of severe cardiogenic shock, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices; however, these methods are particularly invasive and their use has been limited to very selected cases [64 – 66].|$|E
40|$|Background: Special {{clinical}} {{situations where}} general hypothermia cannot be recommended {{but can be}} a useful treatment demand a new approach, selective brain cooling. The {{purpose of this study}} was to selectively cool the brain with cold saline circulating in balloon catheters introduced into the nasal cavity in pigs. Material and methods: Twelve anaesthetised pigs were subjected to selective cerebral cooling for a period of 6 h. Cerebral temperature was towered by means of bilaterally introduced <b>nasal</b> balloon <b>catheters</b> perfused with saline cooled by a heat exchanger to 8 - 10 degrees C. Brain temperature was measured in both cerebral hemispheres. Body temperature was measured in rectum, oesophagus and the right atrium. The pigs were normoventilated and haemodynamic variables were measured continuously. Acid-base and electrolyte status was measured hourly. Results: Cerebral hypothermia was induced rapidly and within the first 20 min of cooling cerebral temperature was lowered from 38. 1 +/- 0. 6 degrees C by a mean of 2. 8 +/- 0. 6 to 35. 3 +/- 0. 6 degrees C. Cooling was maintained for 6 h and the final brain temperature was 34. 7 +/- 0. 9 degrees C. Concomitantly, the body temperature, as reflected by oesophageal temperature was decreased from 38. 3 +/- 0. 5 to 36. 6 +/- 0. 9 degrees C. No circulatory or metabolic disturbances were noted. Conclusions: Inducing selective brain hypothermia with cold saline via <b>nasal</b> balloon <b>catheters</b> can effectively be accomplished in pigs, with no major disturbances in systemic circulation or physiological variables.

40|$|Six commercially {{available}} devices were tested {{to determine the}} alveolar oxygen concentration that is achieved and the volume of rebreathing that can occur in conditions simulating clinical use.

Multiple sampling of breath from 3 adults was performed after initial lactulose loads to increase breath hydrogen excretion. The variability between the different assay techniques was less than the inherent variability of repeated breath hydrogen assays using the same technique.

40|$|Abstract Background Wireless capsule pH-metry (WC) {{is better}} tolerated than {{standard}} <b>nasal</b> pH <b>catheter</b> (SC), but endoscopic placement is expensive. Aims: {{to confirm that}} non-endoscopic peroral manometric placement of WC is as effective and better tolerated than SC and to perform a cost analysis of the available esophageal pH-metry methods. Methods Randomized trial at 2 centers. Patients referred for esophageal pH testing {{were randomly assigned to}} WC with unsedated peroral placement or SC after esophageal manometry (ESM). Primary outcome was overall discomfort with pH-metry. Costs of 3 different pH-metry strategies were analyzed: 1) ESM[*]+[*]SC, 2) ESM[*]+[*]WC and 3) endoscopically placed WC (EGD[*]+[*]WC) using publicly funded health care system perspective. Results 86 patients (mean age 51 [*]±[*] 2 [*]years, 71 % female) were enrolled. Overall discomfort score was less in WC than in SC patients (26 [*]±[*] 4 [*]mm vs 39 [*]±[*] 4 [*]mm VAS, respectively, p[*]=[*] 0. 012) but there were no significant group differences in throat, chest, or overall discomfort during placement. Overall failure rate was 7 % in the SC group vs 12 % in the WC group (p[*]=[*] 0. 71). Per patient costs ($Canadian) were $ 1475 for EGD[*]+[*]WC, $ 1014 for ESM[*]+[*]WC, and $ 906 for ESM[*]+[*]SC. Decreasing the failure rate of ESM[*]+[*]WC from 12 % to 5 % decreased the cost of ESM[*]+[*]WC to $ 991. The ESM[*]+[*]SC and ESM[*]+[*]WC strategies became equivalent when the cost of the WC device was dropped from $ 292 to $ 193. Conclusions Unsedated peroral WC insertion is better tolerated than SC pH-metry both overall and during placement. Although WC is more costly, the extra expense is partially offset when the higher patient and caregiver time costs of SC are considered.

Radioactivity over the appropriate region was then determined with a gamma camera. Mucociliary transport of 99 mTc DTPA appeared not to contribute to the disappearance of 99 mTc DTPA. Time-activity curves were obtained and half life values calculated by fitting a monoexponential equation to the experimental data. A progressive reduction in 99 mTc DTPA was recorded from the nasal and tracheobronchial airways and from the bronchoalveolar airway, suggesting that absorption was occurring. The disappearance of 99 mTc DTPA was fastest from the bronchoalveolar region, which also had the largest mucosal surface. The similar shape of the retention curves for the nasal and tracheobronchial regions suggests that the characteristics of nasal absorption of 99 mTc DTPA could prove applicable to the tracheobronchial region.

40|$|Although {{techniques}} for the short-term control of end-tidal gases exist, {{the lack of}} a satisfactory technique for longer-term control of the end-tidal gases has limited protracted physiological experiments of this nature. We have constructed a chamber in which subjects can be comfortable for many hours while having their end-tidal gas composition monitored and controlled. The system for controlling the end-tidal gas composition is based on a principle described by Swanson and Bellville (J. Appl.

End-tidal and inspired gas tensions are measured via a <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter</b> connected to a mass spectrometer. A computer averages the end-tidal and inspired gas tensions and, at 5 -min intervals, adjusts the gas composition inside the chamber.

30|$|This {{study has}} the {{following}} limitations. First, direct brain temperature measurements {{were made by}} a thermocouple thermometer implanted into the brain. Furthermore, invasive temperature probe can only provide a point measurement whereas {{it is important to}} know if temperature gradients exist in the brain with hypothermia induced by blowing cold air into the nasal cavities. With regard to this first limitation, MRI can measure brain temperature to within 1  °C [45]; but it is not a bedside method and cannot be used to monitor brain temperature at frequent intervals throughout the period of hypothermia that can last for a period of 12 to 72  h [32, 45]. Also, we had examined the temperature gradient within the brain of four pigs by measuring temperatures at the frontal and parietal lobe, and the gradient calculated as the difference was found to be no more than 0.1  °C. This could be due to the CSF circulation in the brain which minimizes temperature gradients if they exist. Furthermore, there are other several anatomical differences between pigs and human (e.g., cerebral blood flow, distance from the nasopharynx to the brain, ratio between the size of the nasal cavity to the brain) that are important in this context and may alter the results. With regard to the distance from the nasopharynx to the brain, we had examined the efficiency of intranasal cooling with a shortened <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter</b> (4 – 5  cm) for which the results were found to be similar to this study [46]. One important aspect which was not tested in our experiments is controlling the rewarming rate. Rewarming is a critical phase of therapeutic hypothermia in that too fast a rewarming rate may re-trigger destructive processes at the cellular level [47]. However, our method can also be used to control the rewarming rate and maintain normothermia in the post-rewarming period. In a recent study [46], we showed the potential use of our method to tightly control the rewarming rate within 0.3 [*]±[*] 0.1  °C per hour by manually increasing the air temperature gradually and adjusting the flow rate on four juvenile pigs. In future studies, we will upgrade our controller to automatically adjust the flow rate and temperature of cold air according to the tympanic (ear drum) temperature measured by a near-infrared sensor in the ear canal as surrogate of the brain temperature. Moreover, in future studies, we will be blowing humidified air into the nasal cavities and humidity will be measured and controlled inside of the <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter</b> right before the nasal cavities. Histopathological studies on the lining of the nasal cavity will also be performed to demonstrate that there is no damage induced by blowing air for an extended period into the nostrils. As an initial step, we will obtain large animal data to prove that brain cooling with our fully automated device does provide brain protection in resuscitated cardiac arrest models in pigs.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: (1) to {{determine}} the within-subject, between-day variability in end-tidal P(CO 2) (P(ET,CO 2)); (2) {{to determine whether the}} within-subject, between-day variability in P(ET,CO 2) was caused by variations in metabolic acid-base status; and (3) to determine whether between-subject variations in blood gas variables arose predominantly through variations in respiratory or renal pH control mechanisms. Fourteen healthy males were studied, of whom 12 provided adequate data for further analysis. Each subject was studied on at least six different occasions, with each visit separated by at least 1 week. On each occasion, P(ET,CO 2) was determined over a 4 - 10 min period using a fine <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter</b> taped just inside the nose, and an arterialised capillary blood sample was obtained from each ear and analysed for blood gases. The following results were obtained. (1) P(ET,CO 2) showed a standard deviation (S. D.) for the within-subject, between-day variation of 1. 06 mmHg. (2) Less than 5 % (P = NS) of the variability in P(ET,CO 2) could be explained by underlying variations in metabolic acid-base status. (3) The variation in blood gas values between individuals did not fit a pattern associated with either a predominantly respiratory or a predominantly renal origin.

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to explore {{whether or not a}} neural reflex linking the esophagus and the nasal airway exists, as a pathogenic mechanism accounting for the association between gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). A prospective trial of healthy human volunteers was performed. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers without GER or sinonasal disease were investigated using an acid infusion challenge test. Normal saline and hydrochloric acid were infused into the lower esophagus through an esophageal manometry <b>catheter.</b> <b>Nasal</b> responses in symptom score, nasal inspiratory peak flow, and mucus production were analyzed after the esophageal challenge. Results: A tendency for an increase in nasal mucus production was observed after esophageal stimulation with both normal saline and HCl. This returned to baseline level 45 minutes after the acid infusion. A similar trend was also observed with the measurements of nasal symptom scores and, to a lesser extent, nasal inspiratory peak flow.

Results: The evolution was similar for the control and study groups without statistically significant differences of the variables analyzed except for the PaO 2. On comparing the groups, the PaO 2 improved significantly (p = 0. 0009) with the use of NPPV for 30 minutes after extubation, but there was no statistically significant difference in the PaCO 2 (p = 0. 557). Conclusion: The use of NPPV for 30 minutes after extubation improved oxygenation in the immediate postoperative period of heart surgery. Descriptors: Heart surgery procedures. Intensive care unit.

40|$|RUPTURE OF THE NORMAL STOMACH d u e tO sudden distention during {{oxygen therapy}} by {{insufflation}} through a <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter</b> {{is a rare}} but tragic occurrence. The patients re-ceiving this type of treatment are, of course, suffering from a serious condition {{or the use of}} oxygen would not be indicated. The tear in the stomach or esophagus with sudden severe distention of the abdomen with oxygen and leakage of stomach contents may well be more than the ailing individual can tolerate {{as was the case in}} two of the three instances here reported. Three similar cases have recently been published (1). When properly applied, the method of oxy-gen administration originally described by Wineland and Waters in 1931 (2), involves use of a well-lubricated catheter, the tip of which lies in the oropharynx. This insures the in-halation of oxygen-rich air with every inspira-tion whether the patient breathes through the mouth or the nose. The method is simple and reliable but is by no means fool-proof. Leaks often occur in the system so that a patient may in fact be receiv-ing no oxygen whatever despite the fact that there is active bubbling in the botde used to moisten the oxygen. The catheter must be firmly fixed in position. Ordinarily a properly positioned catheter is visible just opposite the uvula. It has been routine to check its position before turning on the flow of oxygen. A flo...|$|E
40|$|A low arousal {{threshold}} {{is believed to}} predispose to breathing instability during sleep. The present authors hypothesised that trazodone, a nonmyorelaxant sleep-promoting agent, would increase the effort-related {{arousal threshold}} in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients. In total, nine OSA patients, mean+/-sd age 49 +/- 9 yrs, apnoea/hypopnoea index 52 +/- 32 events. h(- 1), were studied on 2 nights, one with trazodone at 100 mg and one with a placebo, in a double blind randomised fashion. While receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), repeated arousals were induced: 1) by increasing inspired CO(2) and 2) by stepwise decreases in CPAP level. Respiratory effort was measured with an oesophageal balloon. End-tidal CO(2) tension (P(ET,CO(2))) was monitored with a <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter.</b> During trazodone nights, compared with placebo nights, the arousals occurred at a higher P(ET,CO(2)) level (mean+/-sd 7. 30 +/- 0. 57 versus 6. 62 +/- 0. 64 kPa (54. 9 +/- 4. 3 versus 49. 8 +/- 4. 8 mmHg), respectively). When arousals were triggered by increasing inspired CO(2) level, the maximal oesophageal pressure swing was greater (19. 4 +/- 4. 0 versus 13. 1 +/- 4. 9 cm H(2) O) and the oesophageal pressure nadir before the arousals was lower (- 5. 1 +/- 4. 7 versus - 0. 38 +/- 4. 2 cm H(2) O) with trazodone. When arousals were induced by stepwise CPAP drops, the maximal oesophageal pressure swings before the arousals did not differ. Trazodone at 100 mg increased the effort-related arousal threshold in response to hypercapnia in obstructive sleep apnoea patients and allowed them to tolerate higher CO(2) levels...|$|E
40|$|Many patients, {{especially}} those in certain "high risk " groups, undergo operative procedures under regional analgesia {{in the belief that}} this approach is safer than general anaesthesia; this is particularly the case for patients with coexistent lung disease. During the procedure, sedation is often provided with an i. v. agent, for example midazolam, diazepam or propofol. It seems (from personal observation) that administration of oxygen to the patient in this situation is not routine in current European practice. There is only equivocal guidance on this topic from reference works on local anaesthesia [1, 2] and most do not mention the use of oxygen, except to treat the complications of regional anaesthesia [3 - 5]. We decided to study the effects of sedation with midazolam on oxygen saturation (5 a 0 j) as meas-ured by pulse oximetry in patients undergoing surgery under regional conduction block. PATIENTS AND METHODS A study was planned of 100 patients aged 20 - 85 yr and in ASA categories I—III. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups according to the last digit of the hospital number: the first group (odd digit) received oxygen 2 litre min~l via a 12 -French gauge <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter</b> (without foam nostril plug) during surgery, the second group (even digit) received no additional oxygen unless. SaOj decreased to less than 90 %. All patients underwent surgery under regional conduction block in combination with sedation using incre-ments of midazolam 1. 0 - 2. 5 mg i. v. as required...|$|E
40|$|DELAY in {{canalization}} of the naso-lacrimal duct is by {{no means}} uncommon, and is often associated with chronic dacryocystitis. Guerry and Kendig (1949) found 6 per cent. impatency of the duct in full-term infants, and Cassady (1948) found an imperforate membrane at birth in 84 per cent. of infants, although this usually ruptured before the onset of tears at about 31 weeks. In a further series of full-term foetuses (Cassady, 1952), he found an instance of 73 per cent. imperforate membrane {{at the lower end of}} the naso-lacrimal duct. Encysted mucocele at birth is, however, very rare. Becker (1938) found two cases in a series of 250 infants over a period of 10 years. Case Report A male infant was born on May 11, 1962, weighing 5 j lb. The delivery was normal although there was some difficulty in establishing breathing after birth, and this was thought to be associated with a swelling in the region of the right lacrimal sac. After mucus was removed with a <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter,</b> breathing commenced. The child was seen by one of us (H. J.) on the day after birth; there was a tense, bluish subcutaneous swelling in the region of the right lacrimal sac with some telangiectasis in relation to the swelling (Figure). Pressure over the swelling did not result in its reduction. It was thought that the lesion was an encysted mucocele of the lacrimal sac, a haematocele, or a haemangioma of the sac. Expectant treatment was advised. FIGURE. -Swelling in right lacrimal sac. * Received for publication January 10, 1963...|$|E

Open columns show dailyfluid intake, solid columns show daily urinary output. The drug was withheld for several days and the patient's symptoms recurred. Treatment was started again on day 8 (point C in Fig.) and was thereafter continued. She was able to concentrate her urine satisfactorily on a schedule of 5,ug DDAVP twice daily. No side-effects were noted, and the patient easily administered the preparation with confidence. The patient has since remained well. Discussion DDAVP is a new synthetic analogue of vasopressin administered intranasally via a plastic <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter</b> ('rhinyle'). A measured quantity of a solution ofthe preparation is collected in the 'rhinyle', one end of which is inserted through the anterior nares; the other end is placed between the lips, and the patient then blows {{the contents of the}} 'rhinyle' onto the nasal mucosa, from where the substance is absorbed. In view of its ease of administration, freedom from side effects, and relatively long duration of action, DDAVP seems to be a useful preparation in the treatment of pituitary diabetes insipidus in children. Summary Idiopathic pituitary diabetes insipidus in a 10 -year-old girl was successfully treated with a new synthetic analogue of vasopressin, 1 -deamino- 8 -D-arginine vasopressin, given intranasally.

40|$|AbstractNoninvasive {{continuous}} positive airway pressure ventilation {{may improve}} postoperative oxygenation, lung functions and reduce postoperative complications in morbidly obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy. AimEvaluation {{of the effect}} of immediate postoperative CPAP therapy after sleeve gastrectomy in improving oxygenation, pulmonary functions values, reducing atelectasis and reducing postoperative pulmonary complications. Patients and methodsSingle blind randomized clinical trial, was conducted in Gastroenterology Centre and Chest Department, Mansoura University Hospitals during the period from 2013 to 2015 on 46 morbidly obese patients after sleeve gastrectomy. Patients were divided into two groups; group (A) immediately placed on CPAP (8 – 12 cm H 2 O) for at least 8 h and group (B) control group, received oxygen support 4 – 6 L per minute via <b>nasal</b> <b>catheter.</b> The primary end points of the study were CXR, spirometric pulmonary function (FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 /FVC) and O 2 tension and saturation measured 24 h postoperatively and the secondary endpoints were postoperative pulmonary complications during the first 2 weeks. ResultsAs regards FEV 1 and FVC, there was a high statistically significant difference between both groups after treatment and there was a statistically significant increase in group (A) after treatment versus before treatment. As regards oxygen tension and saturation there were high statistically significant differences between both groups after treatment. There was a statistically significant decrease in atelectasis in group (A). There were statistically significant differences between both groups as regards postoperative respiratory failure and persistent atelectasis but there were no statistically significant differences in pneumonia and gastric distension. ConclusionThe use of immediate CPAP after sleeve gastrectomy in morbidly obese patients is effective in improving oxygenation, spirometric values, reducing atelectasis and decreasing postoperative pulmonary complications...|$|E
