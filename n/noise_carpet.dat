40|$|Environmental {{aspects of}} air {{transport}} are constraining factors {{for the present}} and future air transportation system. On the local scale, especially aircraft noise impacts the potential of traffic growth negatively. In order to reduce noise impact of aircraft operations around airports there are several technological and operational approaches. A promising measure to reduce aircraft noise is the adaption of approach procedures. A variety of concepts exist that aim at the adaption of the final approach trajectory, including the concept of multiple runway aiming points in which landing trajectories are optimized with respect to individual aircraft states and environmental conditions. By shifting the individual approach path, the <b>noise</b> <b>carpet</b> generated by the aircraft is shifted {{as close as possible to}} the airport 0 s center. In this paper, an approach to assess the impact of multiple runway aiming points resulting from optimized aircraft landing trajectories on the technical capacity of a runway system is investigated. Therefore equations that allow for the calculation of separation times between the possible aircraft pairings as well as a simulation environment to determine technical hourly capacity of a single-runway system are introduced. For the presentation of the results, different scenarios to assess the impact of the concept of multiple runway aiming points on arrival capacity and on the capacity curve of a single-runway system are investigate...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{population}} in the United States is experiencing {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of older adults and this trend will continue with the aging of the baby boomer generation. Many of these older adults want to remain independent in the community, however, when physical or mental health needs do not allow this, purpose-built facilities provide alternative housing/residential care options. The most rapidly growing type of residential care for older adults in the United States is assisted living facilities. It is important for design practitioners and researchers to understand whether current purpose-built housing for older adults, such as assisted living facilities, are addressing their shelter and healthcare needs. The purpose of this study was to explore if and how specific interior spatial features (light, color, floor covering, and furniture) in the kitchen, dining, and sitting areas of two assisted living facilities in Oregon influenced space use and perception of space of the facilities’ occupants. Based on Weisman, Chaudhury, and Moore’s (2000) Environment and Aging Model, the study explored two specific research questions: 1) Is there a difference in observed behavior of residents in the kitchen/dining/sitting areas of the two facilities? and 2) How do residents and staff perceive the interior spatial features in the kitchen/dining/sitting area of each of the two facilities? The methods used in this study were photographic analysis, behavioral observations, demographic surveys, and semi-structured participant interviews. Behavioral mapping was used for the observations to examine occupant use of the space. Participant interviews provided resident and staff perception of space data. Information from both observations and interviews was used to create annotated floor plans and photographs indicating positively and negatively perceived interior spatial features. Results indicate that there is a relationship between interior spatial features and how residents use the space. Layout, circulation, accessibility, and furniture type are aspects of the physical environment that affected space use. Aspects of the social environment affecting space use included social interaction among residents and between residents and staff, along with the dining area being the social hub of the facilities. Autonomy and resident involvement are the aspects of the organizational environment that emerged in this study. Results indicated a mix of positively and negatively perceived environmental characteristics. Features perceived positively at both sites include the small scale of the buildings, the dining table arrangement, non-white walls, a connection to nature, social interaction in the space, and resident choice in level of involvement. Features perceived negatively at both sites were <b>noise,</b> <b>carpet</b> flooring in the kitchen work space, the sitting area upholstery, and the aesthetic of lighting fixtures. Limitations of this study were sample size selection, time, individual differences, and varied location of interviews. Based on the findings from the observations and interviews, practical implications are discussed, as well as suggestions for future research...|$|E

40|$|Tackling the HARTII test case: A {{joint effort}} by DLR and JAXA The paper {{focuses on the}} {{validation}} and verification of the high-fidelity aero-mechanical tools of DLR and JAXA. The CFD based tools are validated against the HART II test campaign, for which blade deformations, airloads and <b>noise</b> <b>carpets</b> have been measured. The validation is split into three steps. The first step compares the different blade motion modelling approaches for the baseline case, here either fully or partially utilizing the measured blade motion from the experiment or fully simulating the blade motion. The second step compares the fully elastic modelling between the DLR and JAXA codes for all three HARTII test cases (baseline, minimum noise, and minimum vibration). In the last step, {{the resolution of the}} blade-vortex interaction (BVI) is investigated. The effect on the <b>noise</b> <b>carpets</b> of the applied higher order schemes of DLR and JAXA is analyzed for different grid sizes. From this research, it is observed that the blade motion can be simulated in a good agreement with the experiment, while for capturing the BVI well requires a higher order method along with a fine mesh resolution in the flow computation...|$|R

40|$|Control {{of sound}} {{transmission}} through {{the structure and}} reflection from the structure immersed in fluid media impose highly conflicting requirements {{on the design of}} the <b>carpeted</b> <b>noise</b> control linings. These requirements become even more stringent if the structure is expected to be moving with considerable speed particularly under intense hydrostatic pressure. Numerous configurations are possible for designing these linings. Therefore, in this paper, a few lining configurations are identified from the literature for parametric study so that the designer is provided with an environment to analyze and design the lining. A scheme of finite element analysis is used to analyze these linings for their acoustic performance. Commercial finite element software, NISA®, is used as a platform to develop a customized environment wherein design parameters of different configurations can be varied with consistency checks and generate the finite element meshes using the 8 -noded hexahedral element. Four types of designs proposed and analysed here address the parameters of interest such as the echo reduction and the transmission loss. Study of the effect of different surface distributions of the cavities is carried out. Effect of static pressure on different designs is reported...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} done a test of <b>noise</b> {{reduction}} using <b>carpet</b> by variating its thichness and its distance to noise source in a room (glass box). The thichnes of carpet was 0, 246 cm, 0, 492 cm and 0, 738 cm. The noise reduction was measured at three different position of 30 cm, 50 cm and 70 cm from the noise source. The frequency of noise source used was 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz. The measurement was performed at 95 cm to the nosie source by using sound level meter (SLM) SL 4112. The result showed that for a same thichness and variated measurement distance, the value of noise reduction was independent to the frequency. Noise reduction was getting smaller as increasing {{the thickness of the}} carpet. It 2 ̆ 7 s value was maximum at the frequency of 2000 Hz and minimum at the frequency of 500 - 1000 Hz. The relation noise reduction to with frequency yielded a certain pattern, which was the larger carpet thichness the higher the nosie reduction would be. The lowest noise reduction was found at frequency of 500 - 1000 Hz, and the maximum noise reduction was accured at 2000 Hz...|$|R
