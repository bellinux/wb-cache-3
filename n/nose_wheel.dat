5|$|On 12 May 1962, a PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (registration CF-IHA) crashed during landing at Nuuk Airport. The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} a mechanical malfunction in the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> doors preventing them from closing during landing on water, resulting in the aircraft sinking. The accident killed 15 of the 21 people on board.|$|E
5|$|The Sukhoi Su-33 (-33; NATO {{reporting}} name: Flanker-D) is an all-weather carrier-based twin-engine {{air superiority}} fighter designed by Sukhoi and manufactured by Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association, {{derived from the}} Su-27 and initially known as the Su-27K. Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure, folding wings and stabilators, all for carrier operations. The Su-33 has canards and its wings are larger than the Su-27 for increased lift. The Su-33 has upgraded engines and a twin <b>nose</b> <b>wheel,</b> and is air refuelable.|$|E
5|$|A84-201 {{continued}} and next landed at RAAF Woomera Airfield in South Australia to refuel. Its <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> locked up while landing due to ice accretion, {{but this was}} able to be repaired and the aircraft took off at 0:19am, local time. The repairs delayed the aircraft by 83 minutes, however. A84-201 arrived at Harewood Airport in Christchurch at 4:32am local time, and placed second in the race with a flight time of 22hours and 29minutes. The winning aircraft, RAF Canberra WE139, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Monty Burton completed its flight in 22hours and 25minutes. The £3,000 prize money awarded to Raw for placing second was later donated to the RAAF Welfare Trust Fund.|$|E
50|$|Trade-offs {{in shock}} {{absorber}} {{design of a}} <b>nose</b> <b>wheeled</b> aircraft. Geometry, horizontal tail loads at rotation, elevator angle required for rotation, tires selection, FAR 23 design loads, shock absorber stroke, approximate sizing of main gear fiberglass spring.|$|R
50|$|From 1959 to 1972 {{at least}} 500 units were built for various general-transport, utility, {{firefighting}} and flying-crane duties, {{the last two}} sub-types not being fitted with the large fixed wings, which in other versions bear part of the lift in cruising flight and thus enable higher speeds to be attained. The twin <b>nose</b> <b>wheels</b> and large low-pressure main wheels do not retract.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} the {{aircraft}} was test flown a pair of twin <b>nose</b> <b>wheels</b> had been added to stop the aircraft nosing over on soft grass airfields. After the aircraft had performed a number of test flights the military had lost interest in spending on new equipment in the post-war era. A civil version was looked at {{but it would have}} been too large and the BN.4 was not ordered into production.|$|R
5|$|In January 1953 Raw, who was by now a {{squadron}} leader, was appointed {{the commanding officer}} of No. 2 Squadron. On 23 February he also became the initial commander of No. 1 Long Range Flight, which had been formed {{to participate in the}} 1953 London to Christchurch air race using two of the RAAF's new English Electric Canberra bombers. He handed this position to Wing Commander Derek Cuming in May, but remained a member of the flight. In July Raw temporarily vacated his position at No. 2 Squadron so he could focus on preparing for the air race. The Canberras piloted by Raw and Cuming departed Australia for the United Kingdom on 10 September, and the race began on 9 October. Raw's aircraft suffered damage to its <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> while landing to refuel at Woomera, but was able to be repaired. This accident cost Raw the lead in the race. He arrived at Christchurch at 04:32 on 10 October, finishing second behind a RAF Canberra piloted by Flight Lieutenant Roland (Monty) Burton.|$|E

40|$|Shimmy of {{tail and}} <b>nose</b> <b>wheels</b> may be {{eliminated}} by installation of dampers {{and use of}} large trail; however, this produces construction and operational disadvantages. It is more favorable to employ, instead of the customary tail-wheel tires, tires with lesser shimmy tendency. A description of the best possible form for these tires follows: furthermore, a few general concepts regarding {{the effects of the}} condition of the tire, of the type of rolling motion, and of the landing, are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The 1965 Skyways Coach-Air Avro 748 crash {{occurred}} on 10 July 1965 when Avro 748-101 Series 1 G-ARMV, flown during a scheduled international passenger flight from Beauvais Airport, Oise, France, crashed on landing at its intended destination of Lympne Airport, Kent, United Kingdom. The accident {{was due to}} the grass runway being unable to support the weight of the aircraft during a heavy landing. This caused the <b>nose</b> <b>wheels</b> to dig in and the aircraft to overturn, losing both wings and the starboard tailplane in the process. All 52 people on board survived. This was the first accident involving the Avro 748/HS 748 that resulted in a write-off. A concrete runway was later installed at Lympne.|$|R

25|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> is steerable, dual {{controls}} were factory standard, while the vertically-hinged cockpit doors were an option. With no occupants the aircraft sits on its tail.|$|E
25|$|The Ascender III-A {{is similar}} to the {{original}} Pterodactyl Pfledge. It lacks a canard and pitch control is by weight shift, although it incorporates some refinements, such as <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering. The 2003 price was USD$6800.|$|E
50|$|Beneath {{the forward}} crew {{compartment}} was the <b>nose</b> gear <b>wheel</b> well, {{through which the}} pilot and gunner entered and exited the aircraft. The forward gear leg retracted to the rear, up against a contoured cover that when closed for flight formed part of the cockpit floor; the gear would not have space to retract with it open. The oleo scissor faced forwards. The nosewheel was centered, with the strut forking to the aircraft's left. The nosewheel was approximately ¾ {{the diameter of the}} main <b>wheels.</b> <b>Nose</b> gear doors were two pieces, split evenly longitudinally, and hinged at each outboard edge.|$|R
50|$|A Sport {{model was}} offered {{beginning}} in 1999 with eight-way power adjustable seats, heated front seats, 17-inch wheels, driver's seat memory, audible theft-deterrent system, three-channel garage door opener, high-intensity discharge headlamps, and a rear spoiler. The Catera received a facelift in 2000 with revised <b>nose,</b> tail, <b>wheels,</b> interior trim, mirrors, optional HID headlamps, stiffer suspension settings, and side airbags.|$|R
40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{investigation has}} been conducted {{to determine the effect}} of various factors on the shimmy of castering wheels. The factors considered were the geometric arrangement, the tire types, the variations of load, the spindle moment of inertia, and the tire inflation. A comparison {{of the results of the}} present investigation with those calculated from existing theory was made. The constants needed in the calculations to determine the damping required for a castering wheel were measured. The results indicate that solid friction appears to be impracticable as the sole damping agent for castering <b>nose</b> <b>wheels</b> on large airplanes. Also it was concluded that the existing theory is adequate for calculating the damping required to prevent shimmy. The caster angle and the spindle moment of inertia were found to influence the solid friction required to prevent shimmy. The effect of variations in the type and the pressure of the tire was insignificant...|$|R
25|$|On 7 January 1960, Vickers Viscount G-AOHU of BEA {{was damaged}} beyond {{economic}} repair when the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> collapsed on landing. A fire then developed and burnt out the fuselage. There were no casualties among the 59 people on board.|$|E

50|$|In 1982 a Spantax DC-10 was {{preparing}} for takeoff at Malaga to New York when the pilot attempted to abort the takeoff. Their fully fueled airplane overshot the runway and hit the ILS equipment. The plane stopped at 450 m after {{the threshold of the}} runway and ignited. The cause of the aborted takeoff was a burst <b>nose</b> gear <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first flight}} of the LJ31 took place on 11 May 1987. The Learjet 31A variant was {{introduced}} in October 1990.

The <b>nose</b> gear <b>wheel</b> is steered by a Steer by Wire system. The windshield could be heated electrically.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{dynamic and}} control {{issues related to}} a dynamical model called the classical shimmying wheel. The classical shimmying wheel models the rolling dynamics of many physical rolling systems such as aircraft <b>nose</b> <b>wheels,</b> motorcycles, automotive systems and tractor [...] trailer systems. Such system can exhibit undesirable unstable rolling motion, i. e. shimmying, which can often lead to disastrous results. Prior work with this particular model {{has focused on the}} stability of the system as well as an analysis of the qualitative nature of its dynamics, including numerical observation of possible chaotic behavior. Such behavior is observed when the rolling element is allowed to slip under certain conditions, which is intended to realistically model real physical rolling systems. In cases where the rolling dynamics of the system are unstable, the dynamics are characterized by the presenece of an attractor wherein the system repeatedly switches back and forth between rolling and [...] ...|$|R

25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{the nose}} landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The {{nose landing gear}} leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.|$|E
25|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> {{was located}} aft of the intake and {{retracted}} rearwards, with the light-weight main gear {{mounted on the}} fuselage. A sharply swept vertical tail was mounted on a spine {{on top of the}} rear fuselage, and was supplemented by two steeply canted ventral strakes, mounted on the ends of the wing root fillets. Composites, used in 22% of the airframe, allowed aerolastic tailoring to the wings. They were used also in the vertical tail, the canards, and various doors and panels. IAI claimed a significant reduction in radar cross section.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of our {{paper is to}} introduce rolling maps using the formalism of differential geometry, as done in Sharpe [3], while illustrating the mathematical concepts using simple examples of manifolds which are particularly important in Robotics. Rolling maps describe how one smooth manifold rolls on another, without twist or slip. The most consagrated of these nonholonomic mechanical systems is the rolling sphere. There {{are two types of}} constraints for a rolling sphere on a surface. A holo-nomic one, which insures that the sphere remains tangent to that surface, and two nonholonomic constraints which ensure that the sphere rolls without slip or twist. Examples of mechanical systems which contain rolling elements, and are naturally modeled as nonholonomic systems, are: aircraft <b>nose</b> <b>wheels,</b> motorcycles, automotive systems and trailer systems. Rolling motions appear in the robotics context associated with rigid bodies moving while keeping point contact. As a consequence, understanding the geometry of rolling from a theoretical point of view is an important step towards applications in Robotics. This methodology may be applied in several situations, suc...|$|R
