2500|$|Landscape-paintings {{depicting}} Cornish Elm include Holman Hunt's watercolour Helston, Cornwall (1860), showing hedgerow elms, and the watercolour Egloshayle, Cornwall by Thomas Campbell-Bennett (1858-1948), showing Cornish Elms {{beside the}} River Camel, opposite {{the church of}} St Mary, Egloshayle. The latter illustrates Gerald Wilkinson's observation that [...] "In its <b>normal</b> <b>habitat</b> the Cornish Elm often has a flat, wind-cut top".|$|E
2500|$|The River Thames whale was a {{juvenile}} female {{northern bottlenose whale}} which was discovered swimming in the River Thames in central London on Friday 20 January 2006. [...] According to the BBC, she was five metres (16 ft) long and weighed about seven tonnes (24,400lb). [...] The whale {{appeared to have been}} lost, as her <b>normal</b> <b>habitat</b> would have been around the coasts of the far north of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and in the seas around the Arctic Ocean. It {{was the first time the}} species had been seen in the Thames since records began in 1913. She died from convulsions as she was being rescued shortly after 19:00 GMT on 21 January 2006.|$|E
2500|$|March of the Penguins (French La Marche de l'empereur [...] ) is a 2005 French feature-length nature {{documentary}} {{directed and}} co-written by Luc Jacquet, and co-produced by Bonne Pioche and the National Geographic Society. The documentary depicts the yearly journey {{of the emperor}} penguins of Antarctica. In autumn, all the penguins of breeding age (five years old and over) leave the ocean, their <b>normal</b> <b>habitat,</b> to walk inland to their ancestral breeding grounds. There, the penguins participate in a courtship that, if successful, results in the hatching of a chick. For the chick to survive, both parents must make multiple arduous journeys between the ocean and the breeding grounds over the ensuing months.|$|E

50|$|Bagrichthys species live {{in large}} muddy rivers {{throughout}} Southeast Asia. However, juveniles {{may be found}} in smaller streams and flooded forests during the rainy season. The <b>normal</b> <b>habitats</b> of Bagrichthys species are large, slow-flowing rivers, generally acidic(pH 5 - 6) and with turbid water and a muddy substrate.|$|R
50|$|The orange chat is nomadic, {{but less}} {{so than the}} crimson chat, and moves around irregularly. Movements are often {{determined}} by weather conditions which will affect the availability of food in an area. During droughts or dry spells the orange chat will be absent or nearly so from <b>normal</b> <b>habitats</b> and will sometimes be recorded towards the periphery of their usual range.|$|R
50|$|Most {{land-based}} tortoises are herbivores, {{feeding on}} grasses, weeds, leafy greens, flowers, and some fruits, although some omnivorous species {{are in this}} family. Pet tortoises typically require diets based on wild grasses, weeds, leafy greens and certain flowers. Certain species consume worms or insects and carrion in their <b>normal</b> <b>habitats.</b> Too much protein is detrimental in herbivorous species, and {{has been associated with}} shell deformities and other medical problems. As different tortoise species vary greatly in their nutritional requirements, it is essential to thoroughly research the dietary needs of individual tortoises.|$|R
50|$|Micrococcus lylae is a gram {{positive}} bacterium. The <b>normal</b> <b>habitat</b> {{for this}} Micrococcus species is skin, dust, and water. Its type strain is ATCC 27566. It grows in tetrads, irregular clusters, and cubical packets of eight, and colonies are often brightly pigmented. They are strictly aerobic.|$|E

50|$|As Alosa {{species are}} {{generally}} anadromous, they {{are faced with}} various obstacles to survival. They may have to pass through numerous barriers and waters to get to either their spawning grounds or <b>normal</b> <b>habitats</b> (the sea in most cases). Estuaries are {{a major factor in}} numerous Alosa species' migration. Estuaries can be highly variable and complex environments contributing to fluctuating biological interactions, with shifts in osomolarity, food sources, predators, etc. Since many adult Alosa species die after spawning, the young generally have to migrate to the sea from the spawning grounds. Duration of migration varies among fish, but it can greatly affect survival.|$|R
50|$|In Hawaii, Mycale grandis {{was first}} {{reported}} from Pearl Harbour in 1996. Since {{then it has}} moved out of its <b>normal</b> <b>habitats</b> and is also found on reef slopes in KƒÅne'ohe Bay where it is overgrowing and suppressing native coral species such as Montipora capitata and Porites compressa. A study that took place from 2004 onwards {{found that it was}} spreading to further sites. Attempts were made to remove the sponges mechanically but the results were equivocal; regrowth of the sponges occurred and the corals were damaged inadvertently. Further trials included the injection of compressed air into the sponges. This proved more successful.|$|R
50|$|The Australian {{barracuda}} has a short {{spawning season}} which runs from November to January and February in South Australia. Most females reproduce {{once they have}} attained a length of 42cm which length is normally reached after around 2 years old. Spawning is probably done {{in a series of}} batches. During spawning the fish are absent from their <b>normal</b> <b>habitats</b> and this is suggestive that they migrate offshore to spawn in deeper water. The females lay and average total of 375,000 eggs in a season, their fecundity increasing with their size. This species can live for up to 20 years.|$|R
5000|$|Boletina trispinosa is a Palearctic [...] {{species of}} 'fungus gnat' {{in the family}} Mycetophilidae. Members of this genus are found in {{a wider variety of}} {{habitats}} from wooded streams to wetlands and open moorland. They make use of diverse breeding sites from the more <b>normal</b> <b>habitat</b> of rotting wood to mosses and liverworts. The breeding biology of most species is largely unknown.|$|E
50|$|Body {{size does}} not {{normally}} affect the frequency, but both the animals' <b>normal</b> <b>habitat</b> and social organization do appear to influence {{their chances of}} coming ashore in large numbers. Odontocetes that normally inhabit deep waters and live in large, tightly knit groups are the most susceptible. This includes the sperm whale, oceanic dolphins, usually pilot and killer whales, and a few beaked whale species.|$|E
50|$|Kocuria kristinae, {{formerly}} known as Micrococcus kristinae is a gram positive bacteria first isolated from the rhizoplane of the Typha angustifolia The <b>normal</b> <b>habitat</b> for this Kocuria species is skin, and has also {{been found in the}} urinary tract of patients with urinary tract infections. Its type strain is ATCC 27566. It is associated with acute cholecystitis. It grows in tetrads, irregular clusters, and cubical packets of eight. It is strictly aerobic.|$|E
50|$|T. europaea {{have also}} been found {{to spend a lot}} of time at the sides of {{drainage}} lines and streams but do not inhabit flooded or dry soils. However, dry areas do become important when their <b>normal</b> <b>habitats</b> become flooded. Factors such as the type of soil, vegetation present, and altitude have no effect on the areas that moles choose to inhabit. The one factor that does greatly influence the mole population in a specific area is the abundance of earthworms. One would expect for the earthworm population to decrease as the moles feed, however no research has shown this to be true.|$|R
25|$|Like most {{freshwater}} bottom feeders, the {{wels catfish}} lives on annelid worms, gastropods, insects, crustaceans, and fish. Larger specimens {{have been observed}} to eat frogs, mice, rats, aquatic birds such as ducks and can also be cannibalistic. According to a study published {{by researchers at the}} University of Toulouse, France in 2012, individuals of this species in environments outside of their <b>normal</b> <b>habitats</b> have been observed lunging out of the water to feed on pigeons on land. Out of all beaching behaviors observed and filmed in this study, 28% of them were successful in bird capture. Stable isotope analyses of catfish stomach contents using carbon 13 and nitrogen 15 revealed a highly variable dietary composition of terrestrial birds. This is likely the result of adapting their behavior to forage on novel prey in response to new environments upon its introduction to the Tarn River in 1983 since this type of behavior has not been reported before within the native range of this species.|$|R

Optimal growth temperatures range from 25 to 35 degrees Celsius. Micrococcus roseus is a strictly aerobic organism.|$|E
50|$|The Davenport Tide Pools {{are located}} {{just past the}} town of Davenport, California in the United States. They are located off Davenport Landing, which is a street off Highway 1. The tide pools are unique due to the ridges that {{run up and down}} the tide pools, {{allowing}} for different organisms to live close, even though in a <b>normal</b> <b>habitat</b> they would be unable to do so. The Beach is open sunrise to sunset, and is day use only.|$|E
50|$|The Himalayan Quail has {{not been}} {{reliably}} recorded in the wild after 1876. The locations where they were historically found have been greatly altered by human activity and the current habitats in these locations may not represent their <b>normal</b> <b>habitat</b> requirements.

40|$|A {{knowledge}} of the ecological requirements of aquatic organisms, especially the benthic forms, is of outstanding importance to biologists in determining the degree and extent of pollution in streams. An examination of bottom fauna serves to indicate conditions {{not only at the}} time of examination but also over considerable periods in the past. Those organisms having an annual life cycle will by their presence or absence indicate any unusual occurrence which took place during several previous months. Satisfactory use of aquatic organisms as indicators of pollution and self-purification of water is dependent upon a know-ledge of the <b>normal</b> <b>habitats</b> of these organisms and their sensitivity to varying environmental factors such as pollution. Among the aquatic invertebrates, insects such as the mayflies, stoneflies, and caddis flies are primarily restricted to clean water conditions. By comparison, forms such as the pulmonate snails, Tubificid worms, and certain species of leeches can more often be found under conditions where high organic and/or low oxygen content exist. Still other groups such as the Diptera, or true flies, are repre...|$|R
40|$|This study {{maintains}} {{that the impact of}} disasters depends on the nature and intensity of the event, but in all cases the impact varies according to the degree of vulnerability of the social groups that constitute the affected population. Women, being more so-cially and economically vulnerable than men in most societies, are more severely affected than men. This article highlights the gendered impact of the earthquake and the bias against women in the management of the earthquake in Latur, India. Disasters are human tragedies, even if the originating events are natural. While famines and epidemics may strike us as an event, they are the cumulative result of various factors that are largely social and political. Epidemics usually occur in situations of high popula-tion density, combined with insanitary conditions, such as refugee camps during a war or warlike conditions and where people are dis-placed in large numbers from their <b>normal</b> <b>habitats,</b> leading to a total disruption of their lives. The recent plague epidemic in Surat, India, occurred due to the complete neglect of hygienic waste disposal...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of intermedilysin, a human-specific cytolysin, among the anginosus group streptococci and {{the correlation of}} toxin production and infection by Streptococcus intermedius were investigated. PCR and Southern hybridization specific for the intermedilysin gene revealed that the toxin gene exists only in S. intermedius and no homologue to the toxin gene is distributed in S. anginosus and S. constellatus. Thus, the intermedilysin gene is useful as a marker gene of S. intermedius. Moreover, a human-specific hemolysis assay and Western blotting with intermedilysin-specific antibodies clearly demonstrated that the intermedilysin production level in isolates from deep-seated infections, such as brain and liver abscesses, is higher (6. 2 - to 10. 2 -fold, respectively) than in strains from <b>normal</b> <b>habitats,</b> such as dental plaque, or from peripheral infection sites. However, other candidate virulence factors of S. intermedius, such as chondroitin sulfate depolymerase, hyaluronidase, and sialidase activities, did not show such a clear correlation between enzymatic activity and isolation sites or disease severity. From these results, intermedilysin {{is likely to be}} the pathogenic or triggering factor of significance in inducing deep-seated infections with S. intermedius...|$|R
5000|$|Adult river frogs have a {{home range}} of about 16 m2. They are largely nocturnal and feed on insects and other invertebrates, as well as small vertebrates, {{including}} frogs.

50|$|Clubiona subsultans is {{normally}} found under stones and bark and in moss and litter, mostly in coniferous forests. In Britain {{it is called}} Caledonian sac-spider because the native Scots pine forest is the <b>normal</b> <b>habitat.</b> Clubiona subsultans is associated with Caledonian pine woods, {{where it has been}} found under bark, on branches, in pine litter, among young pines, and on juniper growing as an under-storey within a pine wood. Recently it was found to have been the commonest spider caught in artificial nestbox traps which were put out in Abernethy Forest to survey for the bee Osmia uncinata. Adult male and female spiders have been found in June, the males also in September.|$|E

500|$|No {{living species}} of crocodilian can be {{considered}} truly marine; although the saltwater crocodile and the American crocodile are able to swim out to sea, their <b>normal</b> <b>habitats</b> are river mouths, estuaries, mangrove swamps, and hypersaline lakes, though several extinct species have had marine habits, including the recently gone [...] "Gavialis" [...] papuensis, which occurred in a fully marine habitat in the Solomon Islands coastlines. All crocodilians need to maintain the concentration of salt in body fluids at suitable levels. Osmoregulation {{is related to the}} quantity of salts and water exchanged with the environment. Intake of water and salts takes place across the lining of the mouth, when water is drunk, incidentally while feeding, and when present in foods. Water is lost from the body during breathing, and both salts and water are lost in the urine and faeces, through the skin, and via salt-excreting glands on the tongue, though these are only present in crocodiles and gharials. The skin is a largely effective barrier to both water and ions. Gaping causes water loss by evaporation from the lining of the mouth, and on land, water is also lost through the skin. Large animals are better able to maintain homeostasis at times of osmotic stress than smaller ones. Newly hatched crocodilians are much less tolerant of exposure to salt water than are older juveniles, presumably because they have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio.|$|R
