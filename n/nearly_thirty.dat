40|$|This thesis {{talks about}} E. M. Forster's fourth novel, Howards End. The {{focus of the}} {{discussion}} is on the characterization of the main character, Margaret Schlegel while she is <b>nearly</b> <b>thirties.</b> Margaret is a romantic person {{at the beginning of}} the story. Her idea about literature is shaped by her father who adores literature. Margaret's character develops when she encounters an outsider's view of life that is different from her. Her romantic view of life makes her think that having the appreciation toward literature is important for her life and others who also know literature, because it will make people alive in the midst of their misery. Besides her romantic view of life, she is also very naive. This makes her blind to see the reality of human nature which has goodness and weakness. After seeing and facing her problems, she develops into a different person in facing reality. She has realized her false idea and she can see reality in better way...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{literature}} on chondromalacia of the patella shows that its etiology is ill understood. Most writers have been willing to accept injury as its cause without much question. I have long been interested in this problem, and for some years I have been in the habit, when excising a semilunar cartilage, of carefully observing and recording the condition of the articular cartilage on the deep surface of the patella. In 196 cases of medial meniscectomy the number of patellae showing healthy articular cartilage was approximately equal to the number showing pathological change (Table I). This is a lower incidence of chondromalacia than that reported by many other writers. Wiles, Andrews and Devas (1956) stated that chondromalacia patellae “ often begins during the second decade, and by the age of <b>thirty</b> <b>nearly</b> everyone is affected. ” Owre (1936) examined 124 patellae at necropsy and found a high incidence of abnormal cartilage: of subjects over twenty years of age, ninety-seven out of 106 showed pathological changes. Thus it must be accepted that chondromalacia of the patella is far more common than is generally believed, because usually it does not cause symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Procedures are {{described}} for recording postsynaptic currents from neurones in slices of rat brain using patch clamp techniques. The method involves cutting brain slices (120 - 300, µm thick) with a vibrating microtome followed by localization of cell somata, {{which can be}} clearly seen with Nomarski differential interference contrast optics in the light microscope. Tissue covering the identified cell is then removed mechanically and standard patch clamp techniques are applied. Using these methods, spontaneously occurring and stimulus-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were recorded from neurones in rat hippocampus at greatly improved resolution. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, to block presynaptic action potentials, spontaneous IPSCs seldom exceeded 25 pA. Evoked IPSCs elicited by constant electrical stimulation of a presynaptic neurone were larger and fluctuated in their amplitudes. Single-channel currents, activated by the putative inhibitory transmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), had a size of about 1 pA. The number of postsynaptic channels activated by a packet of inhibitory transmitter is probably not more than <b>thirty,</b> <b>nearly</b> two orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported estimates for CNS synapses. This might reflect matching of synaptic efficacy to the high input resistance of hippocampal neurones and could be a requirement for fine tuning of inhibition...|$|R

60|$|From Kosheh to Kerma, {{the first}} Dervish position, the {{distance}} by river is 127 miles. A {{study of the}} map shows that by land marches this can be shortened by <b>nearly</b> forty-one miles; <b>thirty</b> miles being saved by cutting across the great loop of the Nile from Kosheh to Sadin Fanti, and eleven miles by avoiding the angle from Fereig to Abu Fatmeh. From Kerma to Dongola, which latter town was {{the objective of the}} expedition, a further distance of thirty-five miles must be traversed, making a total of 120 miles by land or 161 by river. The long desert march from Kosheh to Sadin Fanti was the only natural difficulty by land. Although the river from Kosheh to Kerma is broken by continual rapids, it is, with one interval, freely navigable at half Nile. The Amara Cataract, ten miles beyond Kosheh, is easily ascended by sailing boats with a fair wind, and by steamers without assistance. From Amara to the Kaibar Cataract stretches a reach of sixty-five miles of open water. The Kaibar Cataract is, during the flood, scarcely any hindrance to navigation; but at Hannek, about thirty miles further on, the three miles of islands, rocks, rapids, and broken water which are called the Third Cataract are, except at high Nile, a formidable barrier, Once this is passed, there is open water for more than 200 miles at all seasons to Merawi. The banks of the river, except near Sadin Fanti, where the hills close in, are flat and low. The Eastern bank is lined with a fringe of palm-trees and a thin strip of cultivation, which constitutes what is called 'the fertile province of Dongola.' On the other side the desert reaches the water's edge. Along the right bank of this part of the river the army was now to move.|$|R

The shape of the mountains reminded him of the huge glass furnaces (glasshouses) back in his native Yorkshire and he named them accordingly. In his log for 17 May 1770 he wrote:this place may always be found by three hills which lay to the northward of it in the latitude of 26 degrees 53 minutes south. These hills lay but a little way inland and not far from each other; they are very remarkable on account of their singular form of elevation which very much resembles glass houses which occasioned me giving them that name: the northern most of the three is the highest and largest. There are likewise several other peaked hills inland to the northward of these but they are not <b>nearly</b> so remarkable.Nearly <b>thirty</b> years later, Lieutenant (later Captain) Matthew Flinders sailed up the coast in the sloop Norfolk. In his report to the Governor of New South Wales, Captain John Hunter, dated 14 July 1799 he wrote:At dusk Cape Moreton bore west two or three miles, and the highest glass house, whose peak was just topping over the distant land, had opened around it at 3 degrees west or 4 degrees north. Two Haycock like hummocks distinct from any other land opened soon after a few degrees to the southward.On 26 July Flinders took two sailors and the Aborigine Bungaree and landed on the shore with the intention of climbing Mount Tibrogargan. They climbed Mount Beerburrum before setting off for Tibrogargan, which they reached the next day, but which they did not climb.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} an {{historical}} {{account of the}} development and dissemination of birth control knowledge in Scotland {{in the twentieth century}} up to 1975. The question posed is, given that Scotland in the twenty-first century has a higher rate of teenage pregnancies than most of Western Europe despite there being no restriction on the ability to access contraceptive advice, was advice always so readily available and if so from whom ? Post 1870 there was a pan European fertility decline which was mirrored in Scotland some forty years later. The debate amongst demographers and social historians is thus as to the causes of this fertility decline. Religion being cast as the impediment to the early development of the fertility decline ensured that an examination of the Roman Catholic versus Scottish Protestant views on birth control be explored. Historical accounts have considered that the desire for contraceptive advice was a phenomenon of {{the early years of the}} twentieth century and that letters to Marie Stopes were the first interactions between the general public and those competent to offer advice. However, the historical record shows that from the early years of the nineteenth century members of the public sought information on methods of birth control by writing to journals, a pattern that continued throughout the period covered by this thesis. Scotland remains distinctive from other parts of the UK by virtue of its separate legal system, both civil and criminal, its separate Church history with the parish church and state having been virtually one and the same and the rural parish church being a precursor of the local authorities. The employees of the local government authorities, the Medical Officers of Health were responsible, in agreement with their political masters of whatever hue, for the policies in relation to health and welfare adopted in a particular locality; in this case birth control advice. The administrative devolution of central government has meant that successive Scottish Secretaries of State have been able to obfuscate and hinder developments in Scotland which would have facilitated widespread dissemination of birth control advice and of course the fact that the NHS Acts in Scotland and England and Wales are distinct has ensured that legislative change has been delayed. The thesis draws upon medical and scientific journals and contemporary literature to set the scene by explicating the developments in the understanding of sexuality and reproductive physiology, a necessary precursor to the developments later in the twentieth century of the oral contraceptive pill and the impact that this preparation had on society, removing the procreative function of sexual intercourse from the hedonic. Thus freeing women from ‘the burden of pregnancy’ should they wish it, should it be available, from whom and at what cost. The politicians having debated from the 1930 s to the 1970 s the subject of contraceptive advice being available only to married women and initially, only available to those for whom a further pregnancy would be hazardous. Oral history testimony has been taken, and used to inform the discussion, from retired health care professionals, family planning nurses, GPs, family planning doctors, pharmacists and obstetricians as well as patients and retired clergymen who were involved in prescribing, dispensing, researching methods of contraception or in the case of the patients at the receiving end of the wisdom or ignorance of the professionals and of course in the case of the clergy advising on the moral questions in relation to the practice of birth control. In Glasgow, poor housing and social conditions, grassroots’ feminism and working class women were instrumental in establishing the first birth control clinics whereas in Edinburgh the Cooperative Women’s Guild organised public meetings to raise the issue and call on government to allow maternity centres to provide guidance and instruction in birth control to married women. In Aberdeen it was wealthy philanthropic women who promoted birth control ideals and facilitated the first birth control clinic in the north of Scotland. The issue however was politically sensitive, especially in the west of Scotland, as the Labour Party needed to secure the votes of the Roman Catholic Population. The medical profession were not at the forefront of providing this advice in part due to ignorance but also lack of interest and also not wishing to be seen as promoting immorality and offending the Church, a powerful body in Scotland. The Protestant and Catholic Churches in Scotland had an alliance condemning all acts of birth control until the 1930 s when the clamour from the public forced politicians, heretofore virtually absent from the debate, to confirm what was and was not available at government expense. That guidance, similar to that offered in England, was not available to the public in Scotland as evidenced by contemporary accounts in the National Records of Scotland, merely highlights the differing attitudes of politicians in Scotland who at a local and national level were ever mindful not to risk offending the Roman Catholic Church’s teachings or risk suffering at the ballot box. Teaching of birth control techniques was absent from most medical schools in Scotland although Edinburgh University appointed a lecturer in family planning in 1946. Thus most young practitioners from Scottish medical schools remained ignorant and unable to help their patients even if willing to do so. Despite the Royal Commission on Population of 1949 recommending that advice on contraception to married persons be available, as part of the National Health Service, it was to take <b>nearly</b> another <b>thirty</b> years before contraceptive advice to all who wished it were freely available. In the intervening years the medical profession, although reluctant to become involved, had accepted initially that they could charge a fee for this private service and later that item of service payments for providing contraceptive advice was acceptable, although interviewees conceded that in many cases general practitioners were untrained to provide this service. This account of the history of the dissemination of birth control advice shows how the medical profession, initially uninterested in this subject, became, as reproductive physiology was better understood and with developments of hormonal manipulation of the menstrual cycle, to embrace contraception as a legitimate topic on which to provide advice to patients. The notion, of course, of general medical practitioners having responsibility for a group of patients unless as private practitioners was only apparent after the inception of the NHS...|$|R
