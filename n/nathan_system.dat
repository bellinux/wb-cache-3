50|$|On 4 April 1927, Grant Hay wired a {{cable to}} Dr Nathan Leopold in Zurich, Switzerland for {{the order of}} the first Swiss <b>Nathan</b> Brewing <b>System</b> to be shipped to Melbourne and to be {{accompanied}} by Master Swiss Brewer, Heinrich Walter Haenggi of Zurich. Over the course of three months, Grant Hay proceeded to buy up five industrial sites adjoning his Church Street property. He then ordered a consignment of three thousand units of purified gin to be shipped from British Army headquarters in Lahore and resold the rebottled gin to American bootleggers in prohibition controlled Chicago, netting Coulson Hay & Co. a million pounds. The deal set Grant Hay up for life, and bankrolled the construction of the brewery.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{nucleotide}} sequence of a polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA) could answer several important questions about its translation. Does either initiation or termination of protein synthesis {{require more than}} a single codon? Are there any {{nucleotide sequence}}s between cistrons, and i'f so, what is their function? Are the sequences near the ends of the RNA molecule translated into protein or do they have some other role? What is the frequency with which different codons are used in vivo? And are there regions in the molecule which have secondary structure? As yet very few sequences from mRNAs are known. This dirth of information results, first, from the difficulty of obtaining most mRNAs in a pure form and, secondly, from the great size of mRNAs: many mRNAs are between 1000 and 10, 000 nucleotides in length while the largest P~NA mole-cules of known sequence, 5 S RNAs, contain 120 nucleotides (Brownlee, Sanger, and Barrell, 1967; Forget and Weissman, 1967). Some of the best characterized mRNAs which can be obtained in a pure form are those isolated from the RNA bacteriophages, such as R 17, f 2, and MS 2 (which are all very closely related) and Qfl (Zinder, 1965). The phage RNAs are single-stranded and probably contain the information to code for only three proteins (Gussin, 1966; Horiuchi, Lodish, and Zinder, 1966). They function as active mRNAs in a cell free <b>system</b> (<b>Nathans,</b> Notani, Schwartz, and Zinder, 1962) and direct the synthesis of at least two (Capecchi 1966) and probably all three of the phage specific proteins (Eggen, Oeschger...|$|R
40|$|Polyculture of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, and {{juvenile}} tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, in indoor biofloc aquaculture <b>systems</b> <b>NATHAN</b> A. KRING* and ANDREW J. RAY, Division of Aquaculture, Kentucky State University, Land Grant Program, Frankfort KY 40601. Biofloc aquaculture systems contain a dense community of microorganisms {{in the water}} column which is responsible for maintaining water quality and can provide supplemental feed for animals. These systems use very little water and allow for inland production of marine animals, as salt can be conserved. This study examined the effects of juvenile tilapia (O. nilotictus) on the water quality and production of marine shrimp (L. vannamei) in biofloc systems. Eight sets of two tanks were used with one tank raised above the other, shrimp were stocked in all eight of the raised tanks while only four of the lower tanks were stocked with tilapia, creating two treatments: one with tilapia and one without. Water was constantly pumped between each pair of tanks. Shrimp were fed a commercial diet while tilapia were not given feed directly; they were left to consume the microbial community. Final data are still pending, but we expect to find that tilapia consumed a portion of the microorganisms, helping to improve water quality by controlling particulate matter concentration. Food-size shrimp are expected {{at the same time that}} fish reach a pond “stocker” size, thereby creating two marketable products with only one source of feed inputs. This study may assist in the development of ecologically-sustainable, integrated food production systems...|$|R
40|$|Feather {{coloration}} {{has been}} known to be connected with sexual selection for many years. It also provides an opportunity to study evolution, focusing on sexual selection and natural selection. Plumage is affected by both of these forces and the equilibrium is where these forces balance. The white-throated sparrow gives us a unique opportunity to observe the effects of the different strengths of these forces within a species. First, I established that there were differences in plumage characteristics between the morphs and sexes. White males had the brightest white and darkest black feathers. White females and tan males were the next brightest, with tan females having the dullest white and lightest black head stripes. Using plumage characteristics I was able to predict the morph/sex class of the bird significantly more than by chance. With the exact differences between each morph/sex class now known, I looked at the relationship between fitness and plumage. White males with higher overall contrast (brighter white, darker black) were more successful than duller white males. This was attributed to the males displaying their quality to females. Duller tan males however, were more successful than brighter tan males. With duller plumage, they may reduce predation on their nest while they are feeding their offspring. The differences in reproductive strategy changed the relative strength of natural and sexual selection between the morphs. Observing this interaction in this system will let us judge the relative strength of these forces in other <b>systems.</b> <b>Nathan</b> RathbunTuttle, ElainaRusty GonserDavid EnstromRebecca SafranMaster of ScienceDepartment of BiologyCunningham Memorial library, Terre Haute,Indiana State UniversityGS 071610 - 201001 MastersTitle from document title page.
