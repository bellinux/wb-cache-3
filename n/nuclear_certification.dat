On 25 May, the DTRA issued the 5th Bomb Wing an [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] rating, the lowest rating possible, from the inspection. The 5th passed the inspection in nine of ten areas, but failed {{in the area of}} nuclear security. Following the inspection, Westa stated, [...] "Overall, their assessment painted a picture of some things we need to work on in the areas of training and discipline". The 5th Bomb Wing Security Forces Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Worley, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Weaver on 16 June 2008. In spite of failing the NSI, the wing kept its <b>nuclear</b> <b>certification.</b> Said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists about the 5th's failure in the inspection, [...] "It makes you wonder what's going on elsewhere, like the nuclear weapons stationed at bases overseas, and at Barksdale Air Force Base and Whiteman Air Force Base."

50|$|Theodore Roosevelt {{completed}} her overhaul in January 1974. During {{the following two}} months, she conducted sea trials out of Charleston. In April and May shakedown training and <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>certification</b> preparations occupied her time. In June, she conducted a one-week United States Naval Academy midshipman familiarization cruise out of New London, then underwent nuclear propulsion safety training before deperming at Norfolk. In mid-June, she received word of her reassignment to the United States Pacific Fleet with her new home port to be Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Between July and September 1974, Theodore Roosevelt conducted another midshipman training cruise; then settled into pre-deployment training and preparations. She departed Charleston on 20 September 1974, transited the Panama Canal on 5 October, and, after a nine-day stop for missile load-out at Strategic Weapons Facility, Pacific in Bangor, Washington, continued on to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 4 November 1974. On 10 November, she departed Pearl Harbor, bound for the Mariana Islands. She entered port at Guam on 24 November, underwent refit at her new advanced base there, and began her first deterrent patrol in the Pacific Ocean on 31 December 1974.|$|R

5000|$|In mid-January 1983, Towers {{commenced}} Team Spirit 83, a joint exercise off South Korea, {{followed by}} the periodic <b>Nuclear</b> Weapons <b>Certification</b> inspection. After a short period at Yokosuka (10-27 February 1983), the warship conducted another set of battle group operations. Unfortunately, during the afternoon watch on 2 March, while en route to Chinhae, Korea, a ruptured steam line in number one fire room inflicted serious injuries on FNs Pino and Jones and BT2 Dyer; all were med-evaced by helicopter to Midway. FN Pino died from his injuries. Towers subsequently returned to Sasebo for repairs between 2-19 March. Following more battle group operations, the ship returned to Chinhae for a Nuclear Technical Proficiency Inspection (23-27 March), thereafter participating in FleetEx 83-1, a major northern Pacific exercise involving carriers , [...] and Midway. Gunnery exercises in April, a joint midshipmen cruise with the JMSDF out of Kure and Valiant Usher 83, a combined amphibious assault exercise {{off the coast of}} Korea, rounded out the summer. After a maintenance availability in Yokosuka (13-25 August), Towers sailed south with DesRon 15, bound for the Indian Ocean. During the transit, the guided missile destroyer helped track a Soviet Echo II guided missile submarine and her escorts through the Malacca Straits. On 20 September, she arrived at Diego Garcia to refuel, subsequently transiting to Phuket, Thailand, for a five-day visit. After a stop at Subic Bay on 11 October, the warship supported the final salvage stages of salvage work at the Korean Air Lines Flight 007 crash site (22 October - 6 November) before reaching Yokosuka on 9 November.|$|R

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{examined}} the experimental and analytic bases for understanding the performance {{of each of the}} weapon types that are currently planned to remain in the US enduring nuclear stockpile. They have also examined whether continued underground tests at various nuclear yield thresholds would add significantly to the confidence in this stockpile in the years ahead. The starting point for this examination was a detailed review of past experience in developing and testing modern <b>nuclear</b> weapons, their <b>certification</b> and recertification processes, their performance margins, and evidence of aging or other trends over time for each weapon type in the enduring stockpile. The findings, as summarized in Conclusions 1 through 6, are consistent with US agreement to enter into a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of unending duration, that includes a standard ``supreme national interest`` clause. Recognizing that the challenge of maintaining an effective nuclear stockpile for an indefinite period without benefit of underground tests is an important and also a new one, the US should affirm its readiness to invoke the supreme national interest clause should the need arise as a result of unanticipated technical problems in the enduring stockpile...|$|R
40|$|The European Nuclear Education Network Association, {{whose mission}} is the {{preservation}} and {{further development of}} expertise in the nuclear fields by higher education and training, has recently celebrated its 10 th Birthday (September 22, 2013). During the last decade the Association was established as a spin-off of a European Project, took off and gained momentum, acquiring {{a huge number of}} member Institutions (presently in the range 60 - 70). Several European projects were run in this period under the coordination of the Association or with its active cooperation, leading to tangible results in terms of mutual recognition of curricula, of the establishment of the European Master of Science in <b>Nuclear</b> Engineering <b>certification,</b> of organising PhD Events and of contacts among Member Institutions, thus favouring student and teacher exchanges. Part of this effort was spent in order to address non-European Countries, aiming at enlarging the cooperation already established at the European level with several MoUs and practical agreements. In particular, in these years ENEN actively participated in several Euratom Fission Training Schemes (EFTS) and coordinated contributions coming from its Members to better achieve mutual recognition and harmonisation of their high level studies. The initial focus on Nuclear Engineering broadened to include also the fields of waste management and radiation protection, providing full scope educational opportunities in the nuclear sector and making use of the European Credit Transfer system (ECTS) to promote curricula establishment and recognition. Training was also added to the classical educational core business of academic institutions, involving industry and training centres in the development of curricula for specific target groups of professionals to be employed in the nuclear sector. This lead towards the adoption of the European Credit system for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) and to implement the latest approaches in detailing learning outcomes of courses at the level of knowledge, skills and attitudes (competences). The initiatives of the Members during these years also involved the use of instruments developed to favour borderless mobility and high level education and training, including the Erasmus scheme and KIC-InnoEnergy. Moving beyond education and training towards information actions, the recently started NUSHARE project (Sharing & Growing Nuclear Safety Culture Competence) has the aim to respond to the need, underlined by two EC Commissioners, to develop and implement Education, Training and Information (ETI) programmes aimed at strengthening safety culture in the nuclear sector and at sharing relevant best practices at the European level. This represents a very ambitious goal that the ENEN Association will face in the coming years, {{in the aftermath of the}} Fukushima accident. The paper reports about the lesson learned by the work performed so far, about the challenges and the successes obtained in the various activities, drawing conclusions and discussing about the future actions to be made by the ENEN Association in its service to European citizens...|$|R
40|$|The World Health Organization {{published}} in 2004 a bulletin addressing {{the gap between}} research, technology, and its implementation in the health systems of different countries (Haines, Kuruvilla, & Borchert, 2004). Among the barriers described {{for the implementation of}} new knowledge in the medical practice is the lack of connection between research results and policy makers. This happens in different subfields within the medical field. The focus of this project is to analyze the differences in implementation of radionuclide therapy technology between the EU and the US. The hypothesis is that this technology has been implemented in the EU earlier and more often than in the US, and that this variation can be connected to the differences in the policies relevant to nuclear medicine. Nuclear medicine is a unique field because of the way radioactive material is used to create diagnostic images and treat illnesses (mostly cancer). Although radiation is used every day in radiotherapy and radiology, the main difference between these two fields and nuclear medicine is the type of radiation used. Radiotherapy and radiology use closed sources of radiation, or particle accelerators that produce radiation, while nuclear medicine uses open sources of radiation that are injected into the patient’s body. This is an important difference because the accelerators used in radiotherapy and radiology can be turned on and off unlike the open sources of radiation used for nuclear medicine. If not handled properly, open sources of radiation may cause radiation contamination. Additionally, the radioactive material must be supplied on a daily basis. With nuclear medicine is possible to create diagnostic images of the body, and to record bodily functions {{all the way down to}} the molecular level. It is also possible to treat certain illnesses, such as some types of cancer, in a targeted manner. This is possible because the radioactive material is “connected” with a chemical compound (or drug) that carries the radioactive atoms to a desired location in the body; this is called targeted therapy. It is also possible to inject the radioactive material directly into the organ or region of interest. The targeted therapy and injected techniques are two processes that are part of radionuclide therapy technology. In order to check the status of the implementation of radionuclide therapy I used the practice guidelines published on the websites of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) in the US. Assuming that the practice guidelines are evidence of well-established and implemented techniques in the regions, these documents were evaluated according to their content and publication date. The content analysis was focused on the type of practices described: diagnostic, general, or therapy, as well as the type of radioactive material (or radioactive isotopes) used in such practices. The practice guidelines evaluation was done in Nvivo, a text analysis software. In addition to the analysis of practice guidelines, a bibliometric analysis of four databases (Pubmed, Medline, Biosis, and ISI Web of Science) was conducted in four databases. The keywords used for the search were (“radionuclide therapy” AND case AND report) OR (radioinmunotherapy AND case AND report). Case reports are publications that expose the day-to-day practice of physicians, and allow medical personnel to take a detail look into a specific case. The records from these sources were analyzed in Vantage Point, a bibliometric analysis software. From the policy landscape, three main types of policies were studied in relation to the practice of nuclear medicine: first, the education standards for the different professionals involved; second, the policies related to the approval of radiopharmaceuticals in the different drug administration entities; and finally, the policies concerning the production of radionuclide therapies in the two regions. The main finding of this project is that Europe and US have different policy approaches that affect, directly or indirectly, the nuclear medicine field. The main differences are in the standards of education for nuclear medicine specialist that is divided between radiologist and nuclear medicine specialists in the US; the production of radioactive material, which is commercially supplied by a very few reactors in the world, none of them in the US; and the drug administration institutions, which have very different approaches approving new drugs. Aditionally, Europe has implemented more radionuclide therapy technologies than US. From the practice guidelines analysis, it was evident that the US started publishing guidelines for nuclear medicine several years before Europe. The US published its first guideline in 1994, while the EU’s first guideline was {{published in}} 2000. However, as of July 2013, the European association had published more guidelines with 54 unique ones versus 49 from the US. EU also leads in the number of guidelines in regards to therapy, with 13 versus 2 from the US. Additionally, there is more variety in the radioisotopes used in therapy than the ones in diagnostics, and all the radioisotopes are mentioned in the European guidelines, while the US doesn’t have guidelines that mention Lu- 177, Re- 186, and Y- 90 isotopes. From the bilbiometric analysis it was evident that Europe had published case reports for more time and more frequently than the US regarding radionuclide therapy. The first case report record from Europe was published in 1988, almost a decade before the first case report in the US. Additionally, the US has only 10 publications that match the keywords while the EU has 37. In conclusion, the EU has more practice guidelines on radionuclide therapies regarding more types of illnesses and more radioisotopes, and Europeans have published more case reports on these therapies, which indicates that the EU has implemented radionuclide therapy technology more fully than has the US. The differences in the policies and standards in education for Nuclear Medicine may influence this difference, because EU has a more standardized education and a more unified professional field than US. While the EU has a proposed syllabus for nuclear medicine practitioners, medical physicists, and radiopharmacists, in the US the education is neither standardized nor unified. Two different boards can certify physicians specializing in nuclear medicine: the American Board of Radiology and The American Board of Nuclear Medicine. The first one does a <b>Nuclear</b> Radiology <b>certification</b> for which the physicians are not required or allowed to conduct radionuclide therapies, while the American Board of Nuclear Medicine requires more nuclear medicine training and involves diagnostics and therapy. These differences are important in the implementation of radionuclide therapy techniques, because not all the nuclear medicine physicians in the US are trained on this aspect or allowed to practice it. For that reason a fraction of the professionals may not be interested or informed about these techniques, leaving the field of nuclear medicine in the US behind its EU counterpart. The policies that involve the production of radioisotopes and the market for this good deeply affects the status of the field in both regions. Since most of the radionuclide materials for therapies are produced in nuclear reactors, this is a very complex topic. Nuclear reactors are recognized for their capability to produce nuclear energy and not frequently associated with medicine. The precautionary approach that some regions apply to this topic may affect the availability of the radioisotopes in local markets. The EU has more nuclear reactors capable of the production of materials for radionuclide therapies, while the production of radioisotopes in the US is less and it focused on research. Therefore, the EU has a more stable and reliable supply of radioisotopes, which allows them to use the technology in everyday practice. Finally, the drug administration entities seem to differ in the clarity of their procedures for the approval of radiopharmaceuticals. The EU tools for approval are clear and easy to find, which may encourage European researchers to work on new radiopharmaceuticals and to carry their findings to the application level. The European Medicines Agency has a Radiopharmaceutical Drafting Group that supports the creation and approval of radiopharmaceuticals. In addition, one of the practice guidelines from the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) is about the approval of new drugs. This is not replicated in the US; although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a special group that works with radiation therapies and devices, there are no references to a group that relates to radiopharmaceuticals, or the information is not as easy to find. It also looks like the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) is focusing more on research and approval of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) radiopharmaceuticals than on therapy based ones. This is understandable since the radioactive material for PET images is produced in cyclotrons available at many clinics and hospitals around the world. In conclusion, nuclear medicine is a very diverse field that is capable of important contributions to medicine. However, the radioactive nature of the material needed for the development of new radionuclide therapies presents a barrier to the development of new drugs. The availability of the drug and the personnel trained in these matters are the most important factors for the successful use of this technology. Although the US and the EU have been collaborating more and more in the creation of standardized procedures for nuclear medicine, it is evident that the EU has more experience in the day to day application of the technology, and the technology is also more accessible in the EU by the physicians interested in it. A trained and informed group of professionals can raise awareness in the public and influence the policy making by monitoring agencies to create clearer paths for drug approvals, and pushing for laws that approve the research and production of alternatives for radioisotopes production such as Low Enriched Uranium reactors.
