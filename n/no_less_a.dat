25|$|Hungary elected Leopold as its king in 1655, with Bohemia and Croatia {{following}} suit in 1656 and 1657 respectively. In July 1658, {{more than}} a year after his father's death, Leopold was elected Emperor at Frankfurt in spite of the French minister, Cardinal Mazarin, who sought to put the Imperial Crown on the head of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria, or some other non-Habsburg prince. To conciliate France, which had considerable influence in German affairs thanks to the League of the Rhine, the newly elected Emperor promised not to assist Spain, then at war with France. This marked the beginning of a nearly 47-year career filled with rivalry with France and its king, Louis XIV. The latter's dominant personality and power completely overshadowed Leopold, even to this day, but though Leopold did not lead his troops in person as Louis XIV did, he was <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> warrior-king given the greater part of his public life was directed towards the arrangement and prosecution of wars.|$|E

We've been up against great defenses and great personnel, so it's nothing new for us." [...] Heading into the game, Georgia was ranked ninth in total defense, giving up only 264yards per game, and 22nd in scoring defense, allowing an average of just 17.1points a game.|$|E

He cut according to the sound of it." [...] Rebecca Dana of The Daily Beast said of Life that it [...] "covers all the bases: sex, drugs, guitar riffs, the size of Mick Jagger’s endowment. It also digs down into softer spots, including Richards’ tumultuous relationship with Anita Pallenberg and the death of their son. The book, which already seems to have earned a place in the admittedly small canon of genuinely great rock lit, is dishy but not lurid, technical but not wonky. Richards’ voice, filtered through Fox’s brain, is so relentlessly endearing, <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> critic than Maureen Dowd has declared the prince of darkness a [...] "consummate gentleman."

500|$|Streep portrayed Roberta Guaspari, {{a real-life}} New Yorker who found passion and {{enlightenment}} teaching violin to the inner-city kids of East Harlem, {{in the music}} drama Music of the Heart (1999). A departure from director Wes Craven's previous work in films like A Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream series, Streep replaced singer Madonna, who left the project before filming began due to creative differences with Craven. Required to perform on the violin, Streep went through two months of intense training, five to six hours a day. Streep received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she {{may be the most}} versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's – with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood." ...|$|E
