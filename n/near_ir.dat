25|$|Silica {{exhibits}} {{fairly good}} optical transmission {{over a wide}} range of wavelengths. In the near-infrared (<b>near</b> <b>IR)</b> portion of the spectrum, particularly around 1.5 μm, silica can have extremely low absorption and scattering losses of the order of 0.2dB/km. Such remarkably low losses are possible only because ultra-pure silicon is available, it being essential for manufacturing integrated circuits and discrete transistors. A high transparency in the 1.4-μm region is achieved by maintaining a low concentration of hydroxyl groups (OH). Alternatively, a high OH concentration is better for transmission in the ultraviolet (UV) region.|$|E
25|$|The vacuum {{ultraviolet}} (VUV) band (100–200nm) can {{be generated}} by non-linear 4 wave mixing in gases by sum or difference frequency mixing of 2 or more longer wavelength lasers. The generation is generally done in gasses (e.g. krypton, hydrogen which are two-photon resonant near 193nm) or metal vapors (e.g. magnesium). By making one of the lasers tunable, the VUV can be tuned. If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the VUV production is intensified. However, resonances also generate wavelength dispersion, and thus the phase matching can limit the tunable range of the 4 wave mixing. Difference frequency mixing (lambda1 + lambda2 − lambda3) has an advantage over sum frequency mixing because the phase matching can provide greater tuning. In particular, difference frequency mixing two photons of an ArF (193nm) excimer laser with a tunable visible or <b>near</b> <b>IR</b> laser in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced tunable VUV covering from 100nm to 200nm. Practically, the lack of suitable gas/vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride cut-off wavelength limit the tuning range to longer than about 110nm. Tunable VUV wavelengths down to 75 nm was achieved using window-free configurations.|$|E

40|$|We present surface {{brightness}} fluctuations (SBFs) in the <b>near</b> [...] <b>IR</b> for 191 Magellanic {{star clusters}} {{available in the}} Second Incremental and All Sky Data releases of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2 MASS), and compare them with SBFs of Fornax Cluster galaxies and with predictions from stellar population models. Our goals are twofold. First, to provide an empirical calibration of <b>near</b> [...] <b>IR</b> SBFs, given that existing stellar population synthesis models are particularly discrepant in the <b>near</b> [...] <b>IR.</b> Second, whereas most previous SBF {{studies have focused on}} old, metal rich populations, this is the first application to a system with such a wide range of ages (~ 10 ^ 6 to more than 10 ^ 10 yr, i. e., 4 orders of magnitude), {{at the same time that}} the clusters have a very narrow range of metallicities (Z ~ 0. 0006 [...] 0. 01, ie., 1 order of magnitude only). Since stellar population synthesis models predict a more complex sensitivity of SBFs to metallicity and age in the <b>near</b> [...] <b>IR</b> than in the optical, this analysis offers a unique way of disentangling the effects of age and metallicity. We find a satisfactory agreement between models and data. We also confirm that <b>near</b> [...] <b>IR</b> fluctuations and fluctuation colors are mostly driven by age in the Magellanic cluster populations, and that in this respect they constitute a sequence in which the Fornax Cluster galaxies fit adequately. Moreover, fluctuation colors display a tendency to redden with age that can be fit by a straight line. Finally, we use for the first time a Poissonian approach to establish the error bars of the fluctuation measurements, instead of the customary Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|INTRODUCTION There {{are over}} 5000 {{quadrupole}} emission lines {{arising from the}} energy levels of the ground electronic state of the hydrogen molecule (H 2), spanning the range from the UV to the far [...] IR (see Dabrowski, 1984).
