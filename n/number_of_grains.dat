This book {{mentions}} the heliocentric {{theory of the}} solar system proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas {{about the size of the}} Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> of sand required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias.

500|$|In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes {{set out to}} {{calculate}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged {{the notion that the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: [...] "There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of Hiero II), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited." [...] To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the myriad. The word is from the Greek [...] murias, for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 vigintillion, or 8.|$|E

40|$|To {{improve a}} complex {{character}} such as yield with low heritability, {{the use of}} indirect selection through other characters and a selection index based on different effective traits is recommended. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate different selection methods by using 23 F 2 : 4 wheat lines derived from the cross of Virmarin (susceptible cultivar) and Sardari (tolerant cultivar) at Research Farm of Isfahan University of Technology. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used in two irrigation treatments (i. e. irrigation after 70 ± 3 and 120 ± 3 mm evaporation from class A pan). For each irrigation treatment, different selection indices were constructed based on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> spike per m 2, days to heading, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> per spike and 1000 – kernel weight. Also direct and correlated responses were calculated for these traits. The results of the response to selection and correlated response indicated that in the same conditions of this study, early heading cultivars with high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> spikes and low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> per spike with high 1000 -kernel weight will have more yield potential. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> spike per m 2 and 1000 -kernel weight exhibited positive response in most of the indices and both irrigation treatments, while days to heading and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> per spike revealed negative responses. Thus selection based on these indices would result in early heading cultivars with high spike per m 2, low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> per spike and high 1000 –kernel weight.

40|$|From {{sediment}} transport in rivers to landslides, predictions of granular motion {{rely on a}} Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion parameterized by a friction angle. Measured friction angles are generally large for single grains, smaller for large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains,</b> and no theory exists for intermediate <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains.</b> We propose that a continuum of friction angles exists between single-grain and bulk friction angles due to grain-to-grain force chains. Physical experiments, probabilistic modeling, and discrete element modeling demonstrate that friction angles decrease by up to 15 ° as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> potentially mobile <b>grains</b> increases from 1 to ~ 20. Decreased stability occurs as longer force chains more effectively dislodge downslope “keystone” grains, implying that bulk friction angles are set by the statistics of single-grain friction angles. Both angles are distinct from and generally larger than grain contact-point friction, with implications {{for a variety of}} {{sediment transport}} processes involving small clusters <b>of</b> <b>grains...</b>|$|R

In this study, 3 -D ternary three-phase polycrystalline materials were modeled {{to study the}} effect of bulk diffusion and phase arrangement on the coarsening kinetics. The diffusion mobilities were defined to be different in the three phases. By varying the phase boundary and grain boundary energies, microstructures with different phase arrangements were obtained, in which the different types <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> {{had a tendency to}} alternate or cluster. In all cases, a regime was reached where the average grain size follows a power growth law with growth exponent n = 3, indicating bulk diffusion controlled coarsening. The overall growth rate and that of the individual phases were clearly affected by the phase arrangement, the magnitude of the phase boundary energy and the diffusion mobilities of the different phases. In all cases, the phase with the lowest diffusion mobility showed the highest growth rate and on average a larger <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> faces. While the average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> faces became constant in time in systems with constant grain boundary energy, the average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> faces continued to increase during the whole simulation time when the grain boundary energy was misorientation dependent. status: publishe...|$|R

60|$|In {{the four}} {{previous}} classes, plants raised {{from the three}} forms fertilised with pollen from either the longer or shorter stamens of the same form, but generally not from the same plant, have been described. Six other illegitimate unions are possible, namely, between the three forms and the stamens {{in the other two}} forms which do not correspond in height with their pistils. But I succeeded in raising plants from only three of these six unions. From one of them, forming the present Class 5, twelve plants were raised; these consisted of eight short- styled, and four long-styled plants, with not one mid-styled. These twelve plants never attained quite their full and proper height, but by no means deserved to be called dwarfs. The anthers in some of the flowers were contabescent. One plant was remarkable from all the longer stamens in every flower and from many of the shorter ones having their anthers in this condition. The pollen of four other plants, in which none of the anthers were contabescent, was examined; in one a moderate <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> were minute and shrivelled, but in the other three they appeared perfectly sound. With respect to the power of producing seed, five plants (Numbers 21 to 25) were observed: one yielded scarcely more than half the normal number; a second was slightly infertile; but the three others actually produced a larger average number of seeds, with a higher maximum, than the standard. In my concluding remarks I shall recur to this fact, which at first appears inexplicable.|$|E
60|$|As Professor Asa Gray has {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} this species and L. acuminata, {{as well as some}} species in the allied genus Drymispermum, are dimorphic or heterostyled (3/15. 'American Journal of Science' 1865 page 101 and Seemann's 'Journal of Botany' volume 3 1865 page 305.), I procured from Kew, through the kindness of Dr. Hooker, two dried flowers of the former species, an inhabitant of the Friendly Islands in the Pacific. The pistil of the long-styled form is to that of the short-styled as 100 to 86 in length; the stigma projects just above the throat of the corolla, and is surrounded by five anthers, the tips of which reach up almost to its base; and lower down, within the tubular corolla, five other and rather smaller anthers are seated. In the short-styled form, the stigma stands some way down the tube of the corolla, nearly on a level with the lower anthers of the other form: it differs remarkably from the stigma of the long-styled form, in being more papillose, and in being longer in the ratio of 100 to 60. The anthers of the upper stamens in the short-styled form are supported on free filaments, and project above the throat of the corolla, whilst the anthers of the lower stamens are seated in the throat on a level with the upper stamens of the other form. The diameters of a considerable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> from both sets of anthers in both forms were measured, but they did not differ in any trustworthy degree. The mean diameter of twenty-two grains from the short-styled flower was to that of twenty-four grains from the long-styled, as 100 to 99. The anthers of the upper stamens in the short-styled form appeared to be poorly developed, and contained a considerable number of shrivelled grains which were omitted in striking the above average. Notwithstanding the fact of the pollen-grains from the two forms not differing in diameter in any appreciable degree, there can hardly be a doubt from the great difference in the two forms in the length of the pistil, and especially of the stigma, together with its more papillose condition in the short-styled form, that the present species is truly heterostyled. This case resembles that of Linum grandiflorum, in which the sole difference between the two forms consists in the length of the pistils and stigmas. From the great length of the tubular corolla of Leucosmia, {{it is clear that the}} flowers are cross-fertilised by large Lepidoptera or by honey-sucking birds, and the position of the stamens in two whorls one beneath the other, which is a character that I have not seen in any other heterostyled dimorphic plant, probably serves to smear the inserted organ thoroughly with pollen.|$|E
