5000|$|On October 8, 2003, Paris Club members {{announced}} a new approach {{that would allow the}} Paris Club to provide debt cancellation to a broader group of countries. [...] The new approach, named the “Evian Approach” introduces a new strategy for determining Paris Club debt relief levels that is more flexible and can provide debt cancellation to a greater number of countries than was available under prior Paris Club rules. Prior to the Evian Approach’s introduction, debt cancellation was restricted to countries eligible for IDA loans from the World Bank under <b>Naples</b> <b>Terms</b> or HIPC countries under Cologne terms. Many observers believe that strong U.S. support for Iraq debt relief was an impetus for the creation of the new approach.|$|E
5000|$|Togo {{returned}} to the Paris Club in 1995 and received <b>Naples</b> <b>terms,</b> the club's most concessionary rates. With the economic downturn associated with Togo's political problems, scheduled external debt service obligations for 1994 were greater than 100% of projected government revenues (excluding bilateral and multilateral assistance). By 2001, Togo was embarked on an IMF Staff Monitored Program designed to restore macroeconomic stability and financial discipline but without any new IMF resources pending new legislative elections. New IMF, World Bank and Africa Development Bank (ADB) lending must await the willingness of Togo's traditional donors [...] - [...] the European Union, principally, but the US also [...] - [...] to resume aid flows. So far, Togo's problematic legislative and presidential elections and the government's continued unwillingness to transition from an Eyadéma-led autocracy to democracy have deterred these donors from providing Togo with more aid. As of the fall 2002, Togo was $15 million in arrears to the World Bank and owed $3 million to the ADB.|$|E
40|$|This {{report of}} the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) {{indicates}} that the envisaged strategy of a partial substitution of domestic debt by increased inflows of external grants and concessional loans, {{as well as a}} rescheduling of external debt by the Paris and London Clubs, would facilitate the achievement of debt sustainability. The DSA also confirms that such a debt rescheduling could constitute an appropriate exit strategy for Kenya. The DSA also shows that debt sustainability would improve significantly with a concessional rescheduling, particularly under the <b>Naples</b> <b>terms.</b> Debt sustainability analysis;external debt, debt service, export growth, government debt, exports of goods, debt sustainability, debt service to exports, ratio of debt service to exports, current account, central bank, debt-to-exports ratio, domestic debt, external debt indicators, external borrowing, debt rescheduling, export commodity, current account balance, public debt, ratio of debt, export prices, debt ratios, debt-service-to-exports ratio, debt dynamics, exchange rate depreciation, external debt service, total external debt, multilateral creditors, commercial creditors, debt relief, foreign currency debt, long-term debt, stock-of-debt operation, current account deficit, net present value of debt, external public debt, short-term debt, balance of payment, debt obligations, stock of debt...|$|E
40|$|The {{plethora of}} {{acronyms}} in the IMF {{has a new}} addition- the ‘PSI’. On October 17, 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved Nigeria’s request for a Policy Support Instrument (PSI), thereby documenting Nigeria as the first user of the new IMF program. Following {{the approval of the}} PSI, Nigeria signed an agreement with its Paris Club creditors on October 20 2005 under which approximately 60 % of its $ 30 bn debt was written off on <b>Naples</b> <b>terms,</b> with the remainder to be paid back in two tranches over 6 months. Obtaining approval for its economic reform program through the Policy Support Instrument was one of the conditions for Nigeria’s debt restructuring negotiations with the Paris Club. The PSI is a voluntary instrument requested {{by a member of the}} IMF in order to get IMF approval for its economic policies. According to the ‘PSI Factsheet’ on the IMF website, the PSI which was introduced in October 2005 to “enable[] the IMF [] support low-income countries that do not want or need Fund financial assistance”. “The PSI will help countries design effective economic programs, and, once approved by the IMF’s Executive Board, will signal to donors, multilateral development banks, and markets the Fund’s endorsement of a member’s policies”. This paper intends to discuss the PSI using Nigeria as a reference point. What exactly is the PSI about and what is its purpose? How is it different from similar IMF instrument(s) which are currently operational? What is the modus operandi of the PSI? What are the eligibility criteria for the PSI? What is the standard of assessment to be used in evaluating a PSI? These and more will be the focus of this research paper...|$|E
