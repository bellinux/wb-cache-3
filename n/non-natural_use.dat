40|$|Posttranslational {{modifications}} (PTMs) {{of proteins}} determine their structure-function relationships, interaction partners, {{as well as}} their fate in the cell and are crucial for many cellular key processes. For instance chromatin structure and hence gene expression is epigenetically regulated by acetylation or methylation of lysine residues in histones, a phenomenon known as the ‘histone code’. Recently it was shown that these lysine residues can furthermore be malonylated, succinylated, butyrylated, propionylated and crotonylated, resulting in significant alteration of gene expression patterns. However the functional implications of these PTMs, which only differ marginally in their chemical structure, is not yet understood. Therefore generation of proteins containing these modified amino acids site specifically is an important tool. In the last decade methods for the translational incorporation of <b>non-natural</b> amino acids <b>using</b> orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) :tRNAaaCUA pairs were developed.

40|$|Early modern diaries {{and letters}} are replete with {{complaints}} {{about the state of}} the body after illness. ‘A long sicknes…has much drained mee…and indeed…my feeble hands…can scarce write’, remarked Rev. Thomas Lowgh from Cumbria in 1654. A few years later, the London gentlewoman Ann Fanshawe recorded in her memoirs, ‘a very ill kind of fever…brought me so low that I was like an anatomy’. Serious physical illness thus left the body weak and lean, full of the ‘footsteps of disease’, to use the early modern term. It was not until full strength and flesh had returned that the patient was pronounced back to health. This chapter asks how doctors and laypeople measured the patient’s growing strength after illness, and analyses the physiological processes through which this restitution was thought to occur. It shows that both the measures, and the mechanisms, for the restoration of strength were intimately connected to the ‘six non-natural things’, excretion, sleep, food, passions, air, and exercise. Patients’ sleeping patterns, appetites for foods, and emotions, along with other inclinations and behaviours that related to the <b>non-naturals,</b> were <b>used</b> to track their progression on ‘the road to health’. Medical practitioners and the patient’s family sought to regulate each non-natural in order to promote the body’s restoration, and guard against possible relapse. I argue that this regulation, together with the assiduous monitoring of the patient’s growing strength, constitute a concept of convalescent care. Convalescence has rarely been addressed in the historiography of early modern medicine, perhaps because scholars have assumed that it was a later, Victorian invention. As this study shows, however, the concept has much older origins, rooted in ancient Hippocratic-Galenic medical traditions. ...|$|R

Prediction of binding site of ligands in proteins, starting with the apo-protein is one of the challenges in the field of virtual ligand screening.

In order to stop freshwater biodiversity loss, {{it is essential to}} quantify the relationships between freshwater diversity and catchment Land use and water nutrient concentrations. 2. A literature survey was carried out on biodiversity data from rivers and streams. Fish and macroinvertebrates were selected as focal groups as they are widely used as indicator species of river and stream health. Only published data were selected that (a) compared data found at impaired sites with a pristine reference situation (either in time or space), (b) clearly defined the stressors studied (Land use cover and/or nutrient concentrations), and (c) clearly defined biodiversity (number of native species, species lists or IBI-scores). 3. The number of native taxa found in each study was transferred in an index of relative taxon richness (RTR) ranging from 0 (severely altered) to 100 (pristine reference conditions). Only those taxa were included that were (at least) present in the most pristine situation. This made it possible to combine, compare and analyse results from different studies.

40|$|Neuropathic pain is a {{prevalent}} {{disease with}} no effective, safe treatments and limited knowledge on the mechanisms involved. One target for neuropathic pain treatment {{may be the}} blockade of Dynorphin A (Dyn A). Dyn A is a unique endogenous ligand that possesses well-known neuroinhibitory effects via opioid receptors and neuroexcitatory effects that are mediated through the bradykinin 2 receptors (B 2 Rs). Extensive SAR was carried out to develop a ligand for the blockade of the excitatory actions of Dyn A at the B 2 R. A lead ligand was able to block Dyn A-induced hyperalgesia in naïve animals and was effective in a neuropathic pain model. However, the ligand was susceptible to enzymatic degradation. In an effort to increase the stability, modifications of the ligand <b>using</b> <b>non-natural</b> amino acids were performed. Analogues substituted {{at or near the}} N-terminus with a D-isomer retained binding at the receptor as well as provided a large increase in stability. These ligands were also found to be non-toxic in a cell toxicity assay. Dyn A has been found to not activate the classical signaling of the B 2 R, PI hydrolysis or Ca²⁺ mobilization. In an effort to determine Dyn A's signaling, a study was done examining up-regulation of phosphorylated proteins. It was found that Dyn A did not activate; pERK, 7 PKC isoforms or PKA. A well known B 2 R antagonist, HOE 140, was found to have low affinity at rat and guinea pig brain B 2 Rs but high affinity in the guinea pig ileum. Further examination revealed that this discrepancy in binding may arise from a different isoform of the B 2 R that has not been previously examined. To date, we have discovered Dyn A analogues that have high affinity for the B 2 R, are very stable, and have low toxicity. The signaling pathway is still not fully understood, but further studies are underway. Also, there is evidence that the B 2 R in which the analogues are interacting at may be a different form than what has previously been described. Targeting this different isoform of the B 2 R with our current stable ligands may provide beneficial therapeutics for the treatment of neuropathic pain without the cardiovascular liabilities...|$|R

However, despite the efforts made the past years the site-directed incorporation of different moieties, like carbohydrates, peptides, polymers, DNA, etc. specifically to the required position at the enzyme remains a challenging task. Applying conventional methods of chemical modification on a protein attached covalently or reversible to a surface or matrix can provide an important simplification of current protocols of modification. The main objective of this Doctoral Thesis has been {{the development and implementation of}} new strategies of site-directed chemical modifications of proteins on solid phase to improve their catalytic properties. Joining genetic and chemical modification approaches 5 strategies were developed using immobilized lipases as model enzymes: - Chemical glycosylation of lipases on solid phase - Promotion of the open conformation o lipase by two cysteine ligation - Development of semisynthetic lipases conjugates - Active center redesign with non-natural moieties - Development of hybrid catalysts: lipase active-site anchoring of organometallics These strategies were successfully applied, obtaining modified proteins with quantitative yields in almost all the cases. These new modified lipases showed improved activity, regioselectivity, enantioselectivity in several important biotransformations. The strategies developed during this thesis combine simplified and easy handling of the enzyme during all modification steps with highly selective chemical modification protocol. Methods are potentially extendable to other proteins and fields therefore offering general strategies for obtaining improved enzyme variants applying solid-phase chemical modification strategies...|$|R

The most occurring form of cancer amongst women is breast cancer and the triple negative cell subtype (TNBC) is responsible for a high metastatic and mortality rate, as it presents molecular and genetic shifts, lacks specific targeting and responds poorly to existing therapies. Recent studies have provided convincing evidence that the therapeutic outcome of chemotherapy may be affected by the expression and activity of receptor tyrosine kinases and their phosphatase pathways (MAPK/ERK, PI 3 /AKT, among others). These proteins are implicated in mechanisms of cell survival, drug resistance and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), and are therefore key targets for TNBC cancer cell subtype. However, many inhibitors developed for these targets have not succeeded at a clinical level and present low solubility. As a result of the pronounced decline in productivity experienced by drug discovery efforts in the last years, novel approaches to the rational design of new drugs are now being pursued. A potential solution might be the use of natural or synthetic peptides and peptidomimetics targeting protein-protein interactions essential for signaling networks function. The combination of several bioinformatic approaches (docking, virtual screening, pharmacophore models, among others) allows the use of the vast amount of existing information on available compounds and protein-protein interactions in structural databases. In this study we designed a procedure for small peptidomimetics structure-based rational drug design capable of blocking the active sites of SNAiL 1, a protein that has been suggested as a potent repressor of E-cadherin expression and consequently, as an inducer of EMT transition in TNBCs. A random library was created using a composite approach for drug-like compound identification from the PubChem and Development Therapeutics NCI/NIH compound databases, which combined structure-based virtual screening (known motifs of peptide structures within proteins and small molecules) and Z-score comparison. Docking studies were performed to map the polypeptides activity and stability: (1) point alteration studies <b>using</b> <b>non-natural</b> aminoacids for helical stability over a wider range (since linear peptides adopt many confirmations in aqueous solution) using Ramachandran plot dihedral angles estimation; (2) quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) using radical modification chemical studies and (3) umbrella sampling for dissociations studies. The peptidomimetic SNAiL 1 model created suggested at least two radical modifications for a strong inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Human and bovine RSVs {{cause severe}} disease in humans and in cattle respectively. They have been {{recognised}} as important respiratory pathogens {{in the last}} five decades, and this has resulted in significant research activities on the pathogenesis and intervention strategies around the world. Physicians and veterinarians have been puzzled by conflicting results from field and experimental observations: for example which mechanism are involved in the development of disease signs and symptoms,; how to diagnose and treat the disease; what is the effect of vaccination with different vaccine candidates, and how to develop other intervention strategies for RSV infections?. The most intriguing observations occurred in the 1960 s, when the first hRSV vaccines were evaluated in children under field conditions. The vaccine-enhanced RSV disease has triggered many studies about the possible mechanisms involved, however without delivering a final answer to this question so far. Despite many years of considerable research efforts there are still no effective hRSV vaccines available. For bRSV vaccines that are available on the market, there is still a need for more knowledge regarding efficacy and safety. Essentially two types of animal models can be distinguished: heterologous (so called surrogate) models in which <b>non-natural</b> hosts are <b>used,</b> and homologous (so called natural-host models) infection models. Surrogate RSV models, most commonly using mice and cotton rats, have extensively been used for hRSV research. Unfortunately these animals are semi-permissive for viral replication and do not exhibit hRSV disease as observed in naturally infected children. On the other hand, these laboratory animal models offer the advantage of working in a well defined genetic background, are easy to handle, relatively cheap, can be used more easily with statistically relevant numbers, and can allow all appropriate controls [1]. An other advantage of using mouse models is that many immunological reagents are available, in contrast to cotton rats, for which much less immunological reagents are available. Our homologous challenge model for bRSV in cattle, in which severe disease is observed upon aerosol infection, and vaccination-enhanced disease can be reproduced 4 - 6 months after vaccination with inactivated and adjuvanted vaccine by challenge-infection, appears instrumental in better understanding the mechanisms underlying disease augmentation. In particular, it has become clear that serological data alone are inadequate or at least insufficient to evaluate safety or potency of vaccines and the data presented in this thesis suggest that a combination of serological, cellular and immunological parameters must be measured in a suitable animal model and preferably in field studies. In this way the potential and limitations of bRSV vaccine candidates may be better assessed in the field. Our studies therefore have added major tools to the field of safety and efficacy evaluation of bRSV vaccines. The higher predictive value of a homologous animal model in natural host species may also provide important insights and tools {{that can be used in}} hRSV vaccine developmen...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. February 2014. Major: Medicinal Chemistry. Advisor: Dr. Carston R. Wagner. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvii, 240 pages. We have developed chemically self-assembled nanostructures (CSANs) {{as a platform}} to achieve targeted drug delivery. CSANs are composed of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and its inhibitor methotrexate. We have demonstrated that DHFR nanorings spontaneously self assemble in a controlled manner, when two fused DHFR molecules (DHFR 2) are mixed with two chemically attached methotrexate (bis-MTX) molecules. Targeting CSANs selectively to the cancer cells was achieved by fusing one of the DHFR molecules with a {{single chain variable fragment}} (scFv) of an antiCD 3 antibody. Delivery of antiCD 3 scFv functionalized CSANs to CD+ leukemia T-cells have been demonstrated. The next step was to exploit the targeting ability of CSANs towards delivery of payload molecules such as drugs, nucleic acids and imaging agents. The research presented in the thesis focuses on evaluating the CSANs for its ability to achieve targeted drug delivery. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we have engineered DHFR-DHFR dimer interface to drive the equilibrium towards formation of preferential heterodimers of DHFR. We have performed a series of point mutations at the dimer interface and screened mutants for the formation homodimeric and heterodimeric species. We have demonstrated that 65 % heterodimers of DHFR could be obtained by this method compared to 50 % obtained when protein mixed in the stoichiometric proportion. The second part of the thesis focuses on CSANs mediated targeted delivery of oligonucleotides. CSANs were functionalized with antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 E (eIF 4 E) via bis-MTX. Targeting was achieved using cyclic RGD peptide that binds to the alfa-v beta- 3 integrin receptors. We have demonstrated that ASO bearing RGD CSANs bind to the alfa-v beta- 3 integrin positive breast cancer cells, undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis and knock down the expression of eIF 4 E protein. In the third part, we have assembled bispecific CSANs that engage the immune cells to attack the cancerous cells. Bispecifc CSANs are composed of DHFR 2 antiCD 3 scFv that binds to the CD 3 receptor on immune T-cells and DHFR 2 linked to a small peptide that target the epitopes on cancer cell surface. In the current study, we have targeted epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is over-expressed on several solid tumors. We observed about 70 % killing of EGFR positive glioblastoma cells over 24 hrs when incubated with T-cells that were functionalized with bispecific CSANs. In the last part of the thesis, we have evaluated targeted CSANs for their in-vivo biodistribution in mice bearing human tumors. Our preliminary studies demonstrate higher uptake of the CSANs by organs such as the liver, pancreas and kidneys primarily due to the macrophage uptake. To overcome this problem we have site-specifically PEGylated the CSANs <b>using</b> <b>non-natural</b> amino acid mutagenesis. In the in-vitro studies, we have demonstrated that PEGyaltion of CSANs does not affect their cancer cell binding ability but significantly reduced their macrophage uptake. In addition, we have also performed the biodistribution of PEGylated CSANs in mice tumor models...|$|R

Synthetic {{peptides}} {{derived from}} the active core of a natural antimicrobial peptide were used as a template {{for the design of}} novel bolaamphiphilic peptides and hybrid molecules. The amphiphilic character of the original compounds was modified by <b>using</b> <b>non-natural</b> amino acids (AAs) – such as ω-AA – and varying the hydrophobic content. The outcomes of these modifications were studied focusing on structural and biological properties. Because of the bolaamphiphilic character, the alternation of polar and non-polar AAs and the use of hydrophobic AAs such as tyrosine and leucine, these novel molecules were designed to undergo self-assembly in response to certain stimuli (e. g. a pH increase). This significant property was investigated by means of different tools, such as fluorescence measurements, electron microscopy (EM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and circular dichroism (CD). By using fluorescence it was possible to determine the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) of the new compounds. Differences in amino acid composition, which were reflected into diverse secondary structures and hydrophobicity (H), resulted in different CAC values and aggregation profiles. The data were consistent with the literature and showed that (i) the aggregation of these basic compounds was triggered by a pH increase, (ii) the use of hydrophobic AA highly augmented the self-assembly tendency while (iii) the presence of proline strongly reduced it. EM revealed the morphology of the peptide assemblies: microtubes and microvesicles were identified and characterised by dimensions of 500 nm to 2 μm. The presence of 3 -way junctions and vesicles budding out of the microtubes demonstrated that the self-assembly is a dynamic process. The aggregation was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy, by studying the dried peptide assemblies and the significant spectral signs the process left, especially in the amide II envelope. The relationship between hydrophobicity and self-assembly was expanded by experimentally and theoretically determining the hydrophobic content of the novel bolaamphiphiles. Data from liquid chromatography and computational calculations (two common ways used to determine the hydrophobicity of a given molecule) correlated well with the tendency to self-assemble, as expressed by CAC values. Importantly, some structural parameters (such as the presence of β-turn induced by proline) also showed significant influence on the aggregation, highly limiting the role of the peptides’ hydrophobicity. These novel peptide bolaamphiphiles displayed a very low haemolytic action and retained some antimicrobial activity at high concentrations against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Unfortunately, the activity was greatly reduced at low concentrations, as clearly demonstrated by the use of two antimicrobial tests. The inability to provoke cell lysis was also evident when using liposomes mimicking a negative bacterial membrane. The loss of activity is possibly related to the modifications of the three-dimensional structure caused by the use of ω-AA and proline, which strongly alter the secondary structure. The results of this study were valuable in terms of understanding the relationships between self-assembly and structural parameters, such as AA compositions, hydrophobicity and secondary structure. Possible applications of the synthesised compounds were however limited {{as a result of the}} loss of the biological activity at low concentrations...|$|R
