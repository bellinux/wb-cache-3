40|$|Protonated <b>nitroarginine,</b> [R(NO 2) + H](+), which {{contains}} the nitroguanidine 'explosophore,' undergoes homolytic N - N nitro-imine bond cleavage to expel NO 2 (•) {{and form a}} radical cation of arginine in high yield (100 % relative abundance) upon low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID). Other ionization states of <b>nitroarginine,</b> including [R(NO 2) - H](-), and a fixed-charge derivative of <b>nitroarginine</b> do not expel NO 2 (•) (< 1 %), but instead dissociate via heterolytic bond cleavage with abundant losses of small molecules (N 2 O and H 2 N 2 O 2) from the nitroguanidine group. The effects of proton mobility on the CID reactions of <b>nitroarginine</b> containing peptides was investigated for peptide derivatives of leucine enkephalin, including XYGGFLR(NO 2), X = D, G, K, and R, by examining the different protonation states: [M - H](-); [M + H](+); and [M + 2 H](2 +). For [M + H](+) containing the less basic N-terminal residues (X = D, G) and all [M + 2 H](2 +), mobile proton fragmentation reactions that result in peptide sequence ions dominate. In contrast, for peptides containing the basic N-terminal residues (R and K), the CID spectra of both the [M - H](-) and [M + H](+) are dominated by the losses of small even-electron neutrals from the <b>nitroarginine</b> side-chain. The fraction of nitroguanidine directed fragmentation of the <b>nitroarginine</b> side chain that results in bond homolysis to form [XYGGFLR](+•) by expulsion of NO 2 (•) increases by more than 10 times as the protonation state changes from [M - H](-) (< 10 %) to [M + 2 H](2 +) (ca. 90 %) and by about four times as the acidity of the [M + H](+) N-terminal residue increases from R (19. 0 %) to D (76. 5 %). These results indicate that protonated peptides containing <b>nitroarginine</b> can undergo non-canonical mobile proton triggered radical fragmentation. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E

The enzyme consists of a central calmodulin-binding sequence flanked on the N-terminal side by a haem-binding region that contains the arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin sites and on the C-terminal side by a region homologous with NADPH:cytochrome P- 450 reductase. By using domain boundaries defined by limited proteolysis of full-length enzyme, recombinant haem-binding regions of rat brain neuronal nitric oxide synthase were expressed and purified. Two proteins were made in high yield: one, corresponding to residues 221 - 724, contained bound haem and tetrahydrobiopterin {{and was able to}} bind Nomega-nitro-l-arginine (<b>nitroarginine)</b> or arginine; the other, containing residues 350 - 724, contained bound haem but was unable to bind tetrahydrobiopterin, <b>nitroarginine</b> or arginine. These results showed that rat brain neuronal nitric oxide synthase contains a critical determinant for arginine/tetrahydrobiopterin binding between residues 221 and 350. Limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin of the former protein resulted in a new species with an N-terminal residue 275 that retained the ability to bind <b>nitroarginine,</b> further defining the critical region for arginine binding as being between 275 and 350. Comparison of the sequences of nitric oxide synthase and the tetrahydrobiopterin-requiring amino acid hydroxylases revealed a similarity in the region between residues 470 and 600, suggesting that this might represent the core region of the pterin-binding site.

40|$|Nitric oxide synthase (EC 1. 14. 13. 39) is a homodimer. Limited {{proteolysis}} {{has previously}} {{shown that it}} consists of two major domains. The C-terminal or reductase domain binds FMN, FAD and NADPH. The N-terminal or oxygenase domain is known to bind arginine, (6 R) - 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydro-l-biopterin (tetrahydrobiopterin) and haem. The exact residues of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein involved in binding to these molecules {{have yet to be}} identified, although the haem moiety is known to be co-ordinated through a cysteine thiolate ligand. We have expressed two forms of the haem-binding domain of human iNOS (residues 1 - 504 and 59 - 504) in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The iNOS 1 - 504 and 59 - 504 fusion proteins bound similar amounts of haem, Nomega-nitro-l-arginine (<b>nitroarginine)</b> and tetrahydrobiopterin, showing that the first 58 residues are not required for binding these factors. Using site-directed mutagenesis we have mutated Cys- 200, Cys- 217, Cys- 228, Cys- 290, Cys- 384 and Cys- 457 to alanine residues within the iNOS 59 - 504 haem-binding domain. Mutation of Cys- 200 resulted in a complete loss of haem, <b>nitroarginine</b> and tetrahydrobiopterin binding. Mutants of Cys- 217, Cys- 228, Cys- 290, Cys- 384 or Cys- 457 showed no effect on the haem content of the fusion protein, no effect on the reduced CO spectral peak (444 nm) and were able to bind <b>nitroarginine</b> and tetrahydrobiopterin at levels equivalent to the wild-type fusion protein. After removal of the GST polypeptide, the wild-type iNOS 59 - 504 domain was dimeric, whereas the C 200 A mutant form was monomeric. When the mutated domains were incorporated into a reconstructed full-length iNOS protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes, only the Cys- 200 mutant showed a loss of catalytic activity: all the other mutant iNOS proteins showed near wild-type enzymic activity. From this systematic approach we conclude that although Cys- 217, Cys- 228, Cys- 290, Cys- 384 and Cys- 457 are conserved in all three NOS isoforms they are not essential for cofactor or substrate binding or for enzymic activity of iNOS, and that Cys- 200 provides the proximal thiolate ligand for haem binding in human iNOS...|$|E

40|$|Membrane {{potential}} recordings, {{made from}} the circular smooth muscle layer of the gastric antrum taken from mutant mice which lacked the inositol trisphosphate (InsP 3) type 1 receptor, were compared with those obtained from the stomach of control (wild-type) mice. Immunostaining of gastric muscles indicated that the distribution and form of c-kit positive cells were similar in wild-type and mutant mice. Smooth muscles from wild-type mice generated slow waves that in turn initiated spike potentials, while those from mutant mice were either quiescent or generated irregular bursts of spike potentials. In the presence of nifedipine, slow waves with reduced amplitude were generated in wild-type mice, while all electrical activity was abolished in mutant mice. Acetylcholine depolarized and sodium nitroprusside hyperpolarized the membrane in muscles from both types of mice, being more effective in wild-type mice. Noradrenaline produced similar hyperpolarizations in both types of mice. Transmural nerve stimulation evoked inhibitory junction potentials (IJPs) in both wild-type and mutant mice. In wild-type mice, the IJPs were reduced in amplitude by <b>nitroarginine</b> and converted to a cholinergic excitatory junction potential (EJP) by apamin. In mutant mice, the IJPs were unaffected by <b>nitroarginine</b> or atropine but were abolished by apamin. It is concluded that in antral smooth muscle, the expression of InsP 3 type 1 receptors may be causally related to the generation of slow waves {{but not to the}} generation of action potentials.

40|$|Calcium {{responses}} {{induced by}} brief stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) were assessed from the fluorescence changes in fura- 2 loaded submucosal arterioles of the guinea-pig small intestine. Initially, 1 – 1. 5 h after loading with fura- 2 (fresh tissues), ACh increased [Ca 2 +]i in a concentration-dependent manner. This response diminished with time, and finally disappeared in 2 – 3 h (old tissues). Ba 2 + elevated [Ca 2 +]i {{to a similar}} extent in both fresh and old tissues. ACh further increased the Ba 2 +-elevated [Ca 2 +]i in fresh tissues, but reduced it in old tissues. Responses were not affected by either indomethacin or <b>nitroarginine.</b> In fresh mesenteric arteries, mechanical removal of endothelial cells abolished the ACh-induced increase in [Ca 2 +]i, with no alteration of [Ca 2 +]i at rest and during elevation with Ba 2 +. In the presence of indomethacin and <b>nitroarginine,</b> high-K+ solution elevated [Ca 2 +]i in both fresh and old tissues. Subsequent addition of ACh further increased [Ca 2 +]i in fresh tissues without changing it in old tissues. Proadifen, an inhibitor of the enzyme cytochrome P 450 mono-oxygenase, inhibited the ACh-induced changes in [Ca 2 +]i in both fresh and Ba 2 +-stimulated old tissues. It also inhibited the ACh-induced hyperpolarization. In fresh tissues, the ACh-induced Ca 2 + response was not changed by apamin, charybdotoxin (CTX), 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) or glibenclamide. In old tissues in which [Ca 2 +]i had previously been elevated with Ba 2 +, the ACh-induced Ca 2 + response was inhibited by CTX but not by apamin, 4 -AP or glibenclamide.

Prolonged muscle weakness is an important but poorly understood cause of morbidity and mortality of the poisoning. This study examined mitochondrial function and its modulation by nitric oxide in muscle weakness of rats exposed to an acute, oral (0. 8 LD 50) dose of monocrotophos. Muscle mitochondrial ATP synthase activity was inhibited in the rat in acute exposure to monocrotophos while respiration per se was not affected. This was accompanied by decreased mitochondrial uptake of calcium and increased levels of nitric oxide. Reactive cysteine groups of ATP synthase subunits were reduced in number, which may contribute to decreased enzyme activity. The decrease in ATP synthase activity and reactive cysteine groups of ATP synthase subunits was prevented by treatment of animals with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NG <b>Nitroarginine</b> methyl ester, at 12 mg/kg body weight for 9 days in drinking water, prior to monocrotophos exposure. This indicated a role for nitric oxide in the process.

Left ventricular (LV) contractility, cardiac output (CO), non-protein-bound iron (NPBI), ratio of reduced/oxidized ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, sulfhydryl groups and malondialdehyde were measured before and 15, 60 and 120 min after resuscitation. There was a significant decrease in CO in all 3 groups at 60 min post-HI (p < 0. 05). Reactive oxygen species production was also highest at 60 min post-HI (significantly increased NPBI and decrease in sulfhydryl groups in control lambs; p < 0. 05).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the toxicity of cyclosporine, a widely used immunosuppressant, toward vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Rat aortic rings in classical organ baths and perfused rabbit thoracic aortas were exposed to cyclosporine or solvent in vitro. Cyclosporine reduced the maximum endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and the ionophore A 23187, but not to SIN- 1, a metabolite of molsidomine that spontaneously releases nitric oxide (NO). L-Arginine, which is the precursor for the synthesis of NO from endothelial cells, relaxed rat aortic rings with or without endothelium that had been incubated for 8 h in physiological solution under O 2 and CO 2 at 37 -degrees-C. <b>Nitroarginine,</b> a potent inhibitor of NO synthesis from L-arginine. and methylene blue, an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, inhibited this relaxation in both types of rings, whereas cyclosporine did not.

40|$|Nitric oxide synthase-containing {{cells were}} visualized in the {{anterior}} pituitary gland by immunocytochemistry. Consequently, we began {{an evaluation of}} the possible role of NO in the control of anterior pituitary function. Prolactin is normally under inhibitory hypothalamic control, and in vitro the gland secretes large quantities of the hormone. When hemipituitaries were incubated for 30 min in the presence of sodium nitroprusside, a releaser of NO, prolactin release was inhibited. This suppression was completely blocked by the scavenger of NO, hemoglobin. Analogs of arginine, such as NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA, where NG is the terminal guanidino nitrogen) and <b>nitroarginine</b> methyl ester, inhibit NO synthase. Incubation of hemipituitaries with either of these compounds significantly increased prolactin release. Since in other tissues most of the actions of NO are mediated by activation of soluble guanylate cyclase with the formation of cyclic GMP, we evaluated the effects of cyclic GMP on prolactin release. Cyclic GMP (10 mM) produced an approximately 40 % reduction in prolactin release. Prolactin release in vivo and in vitro can be stimulated by several peptides, which include vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and substance P. Consequently, we evaluated the possible role of NO in these stimulations by incubating the glands in the presence of either of these peptides alone or in combination with NMMA. In the case of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, the significant stimulation of prolactin release was augmented by NMMA to give an additive effect. In the case of substance P, there was a smaller but significant release of prolactin that was not significantly augmented by NMMA. We conclude that NO has little effect on the stimulatory action of these two peptides on prolactin release. Dopamine (0. 1 microM), an inhibitor of prolactin release, reduced prolactin release, and this inhibitory action was significantly blocked by either hemoglobin (20 micrograms/ml) or NMMA and was completely blocked by 1 mM <b>nitroarginine</b> methyl ester. Atrial natriuretic factor at 1 microM also reduced prolactin release, and its action was completely blocked by NMMA. In contrast to these results with prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH) was measured in the same medium in which the effect of nitroprusside was tested on prolactin release, there was no effect of nitroprusside, hemoglobin, or the combination of nitroprusside and hemoglobin on luteinizing hormone release. Therefore, in contrast to its inhibitory action on prolactin release NO had no effect on luteinizing hormone release. Immunocytochemical studies by others have shown that NO synthase is present in the folliculostellate cells and also the gonadotrophs of the pituitary gland. We conclude that NO produced by either of these cell types may diffuse to the lactotropes, where it can inhibit prolactin release. NO appears to play little role in the prolactin-releasing action of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and substance P, but mediates the prolactin-inhibiting activity of dopamine and atrial natriuretic factor...|$|E

Relaxation of K+ contraction by acetylcholine 1 -mu-M {{was used to test}} the presence of functional endothelial cells: thereafter the preparations were preincubated during 1 h in the presence or in the absence of ET- 1 10 pM before being exposed to cumulative doses of Bay K 8644 ranging from 3 to 300 nM. Cumulative concentrations of Bay K 8644 evoked contractions in about 80 % of control rabbit jugular veins, with or without endothelium. In the presence of ET- 1 10 pM, the percentage of contractile responses was significantly decreased in intact rings and was significantly increased in endothelium denuded rings. The inhibition exerted by ET- 1 10 pM on Bay K 8644 contractile effect in preparations with intact endothelium was reversed to potentiation by methylene blue (3 -mu-M) and by <b>nitroarginine</b> (20 -mu-M for 30 min). We conclude that threshold concentrations of ET- 1 increase the direct action of Bay K 8644 in smooth muscle cells of rabbit jugular vein indicating an increase of the gating of voltage-operated calcium channels.

A novel scintillation proximity assay has been established for equilibrium and kinetic measurements of substrate, inhibitor and cofactor binding to a recombinant N-terminal haem-binding domain of rat neuronal NOS (nNOS). Apparent Kd values for nNOS haem-domain-binding of arginine and Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (<b>nitroarginine)</b> were measured as 1. 6 microM and 25 nM respectively. The kinetics of [3 H]nitroarginine binding and dissociation yielded an association rate constant of 1. 3 x 10 (4) s- 1. M- 1 and a dissociation rate constant of 1. 2 x 10 (- 4) s- 1. These values are comparable to literature values obtained for full-length nNOS, suggesting that many characteristics of the arginine binding site of NOS are conserved in the haem-binding domain.

We have observed recently that mice overexpressing active FRK (fyn-related kinase) /RAK (previously named GTK/Bsk/IYK, where GTK stands for gut tyrosine kinase, Bsk for β-cell Src-homology kinase and IYK for intestinal tyrosine kinase) in β-cells exhibit increased susceptibility to β-cell-toxic events, and therefore, we now {{attempt to find}} a more precise role for FRK/RAK in these processes. Phosphopeptide mapping of baculovirus-produced mouse FRK/RAK revealed an autophosphorylation pattern compatible with Tyr- 394 being the main site. No evidence for in vitro phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory sites Tyr- 497 and Tyr- 504 was obtained, nor was there any indication of in vitro regulation of FRK/RAK kinase activity. Screening a panel of known tyrosine kinase inhibitors {{for their ability to}} inhibit FRK/RAK revealed several compounds that inhibited FRK/RAK, with a potency similar to that reported for their ability to inhibit other tyrosine kinases. Cytokine-induced islet toxicity was reduced in islets isolated from FRK/RAK knockout mice and this occurred without effects on the production of nitric oxide. Addition of the nitric oxide inhibitor <b>nitroarginine</b> to FRK/RAK knockout islets exposed to cytokines decreased cell death to a basal level. In normal islets, cytokine-induced cell death was inhibited by the addition of two FRK/RAK inhibitors, SU 4984 and D- 65495, or by transfection with short interfering RNA against FRK/RAK.

Percoll-washed spermatozoa from healthy volunteers were incubated in Ham’s F-i 0 medium supplemented or not with the nitric oxide-releasing agents, diethylamine-NONOate or spermine-NONOate, in combination or not with superoxide dismutase or catalase (scavengers for the superoxide anion and for hydrogen peroxide, respectively), or with sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, or preincubated NONOates. Sperm hyperactivation, capacitation, and nitricoxide synthase activity were determined. High concentrations (0. 3 to 1 mM) of NONOates reduced sperm motility. However, a lower concentration (0. 1 mM) of the two NONOates had no effect on the percentage of sperm motility or of hyperactivation but resulted in a significant increase in sperm capacltation (24 % ± 4 %) when compared to that of control spermatozoa (Ham’s F-iD alone, 12 % ± 2 %). Nitric oxide released by the NONOates appeared responsible for this effect because sodium nitrate or nitrite or preincubated NONOates (to exhaust the formation of nitric oxide) had no influence on sperm capacitation. Catalase, but not superoxide dismutase, abolished the capacitating action of the NONOates. No nitric oxide synthase activity was detected in spermatozoa, whether they were in their basal state or already capacitated. Furthermore, the nitric oxide synthetase inhibitor L-N#{ 176 } <b>nitroarginine</b> methyl ester did not block sperm capacitation induced by fetal cord serum ultrafiltrate.

Indomethacin (5 × 10 − 6 [*]M) or diclofenac (10 − 6 [*]M), both inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, abolished only the slow hyperpolarization. The initial hyperpolarization was not inhibited by diclofenac nor by <b>nitroarginine,</b> an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. Both components of the ACh-induced hyperpolarization were abolished in the presence of atropine (10 − 6 [*]M) or high-K solution ([K+] 0 = 29. 4 [*]mM). The interval between ACh-stimulation required to generate an initial hyperpolarization of reproducible amplitude was 20 [*]min or greater, but it was reduced to less than 5 [*]min after inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity.

This may be due to EDRF directly regulating solute transport in the cortical collecting duct (CCD). To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of bradykinin (Bk) or acetylcholine (Ach) on short-circuit current (I,; a measure of active transport) in a CCD cell line (M- 1), in {{the presence or absence of}} cow pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells. 10 - 9 M Bk or i 0 ' M Ach had no effect on M- 1 ISC in which CPAE cells were absent.

On the other hand, when 10 - ' M Bk or 10 -i M Ach were added to M- 1 cells in the presence of CPAE cells, ISC decreased from 43 ± 4. 5 to 26 ± 4 and 64 ± 9 to 33 ± 4 MA/cm 2, respectively (P < 0. 001). <b>Nitroarginine</b> (N-Arg, 10 - 4 M), a competitive inhibi-tor of EDRF production, blocked the inhibition in M- 1 ISC due to both agonists. Since cGMP is the second messenger of EDRF in vascular smooth muscle, we measured the effects of Bk on cGMP production in M- 1 cells in the presence and ab-sence of CPAE cells. Bk increased cGMP content in M- 1 cells in the presence of CPAE cells from 33 ± 3. 4 to 132 ± 11. 7 fmol/ 106 M- 1 cells (P < 0. 001).

The fragments of Mr 90000 (haem region) and 80000 (reductase region, N-terminus Ala- 728) were produced by cleavage within the calmodulin-binding region. With more extensive trypsin treatment, these species were shown to be transient, and three smaller, highly stable fragments of Mr 14000 (N-terminus Leu- 744 within the calmodulin region), 60000 (N-terminus Gly- 221) and 63000 (N-terminus Lys- 856 within the FMN domain) were formed. The species of Mr approx. 60000 represents a domain retaining haem and <b>nitroarginine</b> binding. The two species of Mr 63000 and 14000 remain associated as a complex. This complex retains cytochrome c reductase activity, and thus is the complete reductase region, yet cleaved at Lys- 856. This cleavage occurs within a sequence insertion relative to the FMN domain present in inducible nitric oxide synthase. Prolonged proteolysis treatment led to the production of a protein of Mr approx. 53000 (N-terminus Ala- 953), corresponding to a cleavage between the FMN and FAD domains. The major products after chymotryptic digestion were similar to those with trypsin, although the pathway of intermediates differed. The haem domain was smaller, starting at residue 275, yet still retained the arginine binding site. These data have allowed us to identify stable domains representing both the arginine/haem-binding and the reductase regions...|$|E
40|$|Central to this {{investigation}} are several basic hypotheses {{that are designed}} to test the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the complex process of central regeneration and plasticity in a well established model system of the mammalian brain. We have employed histochemical techniques at the light and ultrastructural level coupled with correlative scanning electron microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, and in situ hybridization {{in order to determine the}} functional significance of the increased expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in neurons of the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei which accompanies regeneration of their axotomized neurites following hypophysectomy, The aim of {{this investigation}} was to determine the potential role and temporal up-regulation of NOS in this basic regenerative process and to establish the ultrastructural and neuroanatomical correlates during critical periods of regeneration and regrowth of SON and PVN axons following hypophysectomy in the endocrine hypothalamus of the rat. Our data support the hypothesis that NO may serve as a second messenger molecule that may act in some fashion to govern not only the process of central regeneration and regrowth of magnocellular (SON/PVN) axons into the median eminence, neural stem, and neural lobe (the neurohypophyseal system) but may also influence the regeneration of neurites into new neuroanatomical domains such as the adjacent lumen of the third cerebral ventricle. We have demonstrated a distinct temporal relationship between injury (axotomy) of SON/PVN axons and the establishment of new neurovascular zones following hypophysectomy with the up-regulation of NOS. This up-regulation appears to correlate well with successful regeneration in the mammalian neurohypophyseal system. We have also successfully inhibited axonal regeneration with the use of <b>nitroarginine,</b> a competitive antagonist of NO. NOS up-regulation attendant to regeneration of SON and PVN axons may have inestimable clinical implications, particularly with respect to closed head injury and cerebral contusion that involves the mechanical shearing of the infundibular stalk. In addition, this investigation has reaffirmed that large numbers of bona fide neurons migrate and emerge upon the floor of the adjacent third cerebral ventricle shortly following hypophysectomy (within 2 weeks). The origin and mechanisms of neuronal migration and plasticity following hypophysectomy are the subject of interpretation and discussion in this investigation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Release of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) -releasing hormone (LHRH), the {{hypothalamic}} peptide that controls release of LH from the adenohypophysis, {{is controlled by}} NO. There is a rich plexus of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) -containing neurons and fibers in the lateral median eminence, intermingled with terminals of the LHRH neurons. To study relations between NOS and LHRH in this brain region, we measured NOS activity in incubated medial basal hypothalamus (MBH). NOS converts [14 C]arginine to equimolar quantities of [14 C]citrulline plus NO, which rapidly decomposes. The [14 C]citrulline serves as an index of the NO produced. NOS basal activity was suppressed by incubation of the tissue with an inhibitor of NOS, <b>nitroarginine</b> methyl ester (NAME) (10 (- 5) M). Furthermore, incubation of MBH explants for 30 min with norepinephrine (NE) increased NOS activity and the increase was prevented by prazosine (10 (- 5) M), an alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor blocker; however, direct addition of NE to the tissue homogenate or to a preparation of MBH synaptosomes did not alter enzyme activity, which suggested that NE increased the content of NOS during incubation with the tissue. After purification of NOS, the increase in enzyme content induced by NE was still measurable. This indicates that within 30 min NE increased the synthesis of NOS in vitro. Incubation of MBH or the MBH homogenate with various concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (NP), a releaser of NO, reduced NOS activity at high concentrations (> or = 0. 9 mM), which were associated with either a reduction of stimulation or a plateau of LHRH release. Finally, incubation of either MBH or the homogenate with cGMP, a major mediatior of NO action, at concentrations that increased LHRH release also reduced NOS activity. These results indicate that NO at high concentrations can inactivate NOS and that cGMP can also inhibit the enzyme directly. Therefore, the increased NOS activity induced by activation of alpha 1 receptors by NE is inhibited by NO itself and a principal product of its activity, cGMP, providing negative feedback on NOS. In central nervous system (CNS) infections with high concentrations of inducible NOS produced by glial elements, the high concentrations of NO and cGMP produced may suppress LHRH release, resulting in decreased gonadotropin and gonadal steroid release...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{selective}} 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist sarpogrelate {{has been}} clinically used for treatment in atherosclerotic diseases. However, it remains unknown whether administration of sarpogrelate inhibits intimal hyperplasia seen in autologous vein grafts. Therefore, {{we sought to}} clarify this question using an experimental rabbit vein graft model. MethodsMale rabbits {{were divided into two}} groups: a control group and a sarpogrelate-treated group. The jugular vein was interposed in the carotid artery in reversed fashion for 4 weeks and intimal hyperplasia of the grafted vein was measured (n = 8, in each group). Acetylcholine (ACh) -induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was tested by precontraction with prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α, 5 μM) (n = 5, in each). endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and superoxide production of these veins were also assessed. ResultsThe suppression of intimal hyperplasia was significantly greater in the sarpogrelate-treated group than in the control group. ACh induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation in the sarpogrelate-treated group (but not in the control group). In endothelium-intact strips from the sarpogrelate-treated group, the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor <b>nitroarginine</b> enhanced the PGF 2 α-induced contraction and blocked the ACh-induced relaxation. Immunoreactive eNOS protein expression was similar between the two groups but superoxide production (estimated from ethidium fluorescence) in endothelial cells was significantly smaller in the sarpogrelate-treated group. ConclusionThe present results indicate that in vivo blockade of 5 -HT 2 A receptors leads to an inhibition of intimal hyperplasia in rabbit vein graft. It is suggested that an increased function of endothelium-derived NO through a reduction in endothelial superoxide production may be a possible underlying mechanism for this. These novel findings support the clinical usefulness of sarpogrelate for preventing intimal hyperplasia in vein graft after bypass grafting. Clinical RelevanceIntimal hyperplasia is a major obstacle to patency after vein grafting. Despite a diverse array of trials to prevent it, a satisfactory therapeutic strategy for clinical use has not been established. We report here the inhibitory effect of 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist, sarpogrelate hydrochloride on the development of vein graft intimal hyperplasia. In addition, we demonstrate that sarpogrelate showed endothelium-dependent relaxation through a reduction in endothelial superoxide production in vitro. Because the clinical benefits and safety of sarpogrelate have been established to a certain extent through long-term clinical usage, the study provides further evidence to support the clinical investigation of the role of sarpogrelate in prevention of intimal hyperplasia in venous bypass grafting...|$|E
