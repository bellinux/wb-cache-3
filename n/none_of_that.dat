His wife's and his father's shadows haunted his prospects. His efforts leading nowhere, in the spring of 1561 Dudley offered to leave England to seek military adventures abroad; Elizabeth would have <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> and everything remained as it was.|$|E
5|$|The Sermons of Swift have <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> thunder which appals, or that resistless {{and winning}} {{softness}} which melts, {{the hearts of}} an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} 1897, the {{railroad}} had {{been interested in}} alternatives to steam power, namely, internal-combustion engines. The railroad's shops in Aurora had built an unreliable three-horsepower distillate motor in that year, but it was hugely impractical (requiring a massive 6,000-pound flywheel) and had issues with overheating (even with the best metals of the day, its cylinder heads and liners would warp and melt {{in a matter of}} minutes) and was therefore impractical. Diesel engines of that era were obese, stationary monsters and were best suited for low-speed, continuous operation. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> would do in a railroad locomotive; however, there was no diesel engine suitable for that purpose then.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{transport}} {{made it impossible}} to supply a garrison west of El Agheila, the most favourable position for a defensive line and restricted the 2nd Armoured Division to movement between supply dumps, reducing its limited mobility further. In February, Lieutenant-General Philip Neame took over Cyrcom and predicted that the armoured division would lose many tanks through breakdowns if it had to move far. Neame asked for a proper armoured division, two infantry divisions and adequate air support to hold the area; he was told that there was little to send and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> before April. In early March, the 9th Australian Division began to relieve the 6th Australian Division (Major-General Iven Mackay) at Mersa Brega for shipment to Greece, which demonstrated the difficulty of tactical moves with insufficient transport and it was withdrawn to the area east of Benghazi.|$|E

500|$|Carter {{began work}} on a new series, Millennium. The genesis of this new project stemmed from [...] "Irresistible", a second-season episode of The X-Files which Carter had written, which focused on a sexually {{motivated}} serial killer with <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> series' usual supernatural trappings. Carter fleshed out {{the basis of the}} new show's protagonist, Frank Black, and travelled to Seattle for inspiration for a new setting. Influence was also drawn from the works of Nostradamus, and the increasing popular interest in eschatology ahead of the coming millennium. The central role of Black was eventually filled by Lance Henriksen, and the series began airing in the Friday timeslot formerly occupied by The X-Files. [...] "Pilot", the début episode, was heavily promoted by Fox, and brought in over a quarter of the total audience during its broadcast.|$|E

500|$|In early 1971, Corbally {{was offered}} the {{presidency}} of the University of Illinois system, which he readily accepted. The suddenness of his resignation at Syracuse led to speculation that he had been pressured to leave due to the tense events of 1970 or that he wanted to jump ship from a school still facing financial difficulties. However, John Robert Greene, in a 1998 book on the history of Syracuse, argues that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is true: Corbally handled the student protesters and football boycott admirably, despite criticism at the time from some alumni of the school, and he, along with his vice chancellor Ronald Brady, had improved the financial status of the school much {{in the two years since}} Corbally took office. According to Greene, the chancellor took the new job [...] "simply because he received a better job offer". Corbally was succeeded by his provost Melvin Eggers.|$|E

500|$|While {{the game}} has been praised for the {{addition}} of a deeper plot than the original Gears of War and being highly polished, reviewers noted that the multiplayer experience did not resemble the previous game especially in its quick pace and enjoyability. IGN noted that while the first four acts of the game were satisfying, in the final act [...] "the last boss is a complete joke and the ending feels just a tad too abrupt," [...] and that there were some bugs and lag in the online multiplayer. Overall, IGN stated that [...] " [...] has its flaws {{when it comes to the}} technical side of multiplayer and the last act of the campaign and the voice acting might turn some off. Still, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> comes close to holding back Gears of War 2 from its destiny: being one of the best games available on the Xbox 360."
