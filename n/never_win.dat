5|$|Taare Zameen Par was {{initially}} acclaimed as India's official entry for the 2009 Academy Awards Best Foreign Film, but after {{it failed to}} progress to the short list, a debate began in the Indian media as to why Indian films <b>never</b> <b>win</b> Academy Awards. Speculation for the reasons behind Taare Zameen Pars failed bid included Rediff.com's Arthur J. Pai's observation that it lacked mainstream media attention; AMPAS jury member Krishna Shah criticised its length and abundance of songs.|$|E

Dallas hosted the Heat for the season opener on December 25, 2011 of the 2011–2012 NBA lockout season that was {{shortened}} to 66 games. The Heat spoiled the Mavericks' championship banner-raising night, giving them a 105-94 blowout loss.|$|E
25|$|Tucker twice ran for U.S. Congress in the 4th District (17 {{southern}} Virginia counties including Greensville) against segregationist Watkins Abbitt, one of U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd's key allies—in 1964 as an Independent and in 1968 as a Republican. Though Tucker knew {{he would}} <b>never</b> <b>win</b> more than 30% of the vote against the powerful incumbent, he believed the battles important to register the protests as well as aspirations of black voters in the district.|$|E
25|$|Reardon won {{his fifth}} title {{the next year}} in Manchester, beating Alex Higgins 27–16. Earlier that year, he had won the Benson and Hedges Masters in London, his second snooker title after the World Championship. In this event Reardon {{defeated}} John Pulman in the quarter-final 4–1, in a match of such poor quality that the highest break was 22 (by Pulman). Reardon improved his form in the semi-final to defeat Eddie Charlton 5–4 and Graham Miles 7–3 in the final. Reardon would <b>never</b> <b>win</b> the event again but defeated Rex Williams 4–1 and Graham Miles 5–2 in the 1977 event only to lose 7–6 to Doug Mountjoy in the final.|$|E

25|$|The 2014/2015 {{season was}} a year of quarter-finals for Fu has he played in seven but could <b>never</b> <b>win</b> one. His first came in the opening ranking event, the Wuxi Classic, where he lost 5–4 to Barry Hawkins. He was knocked {{out in the first}} round of the Shanghai Masters, but saw off Liam Highfield, David Gilbert and Rod Lawler at the International Championship, before a ranking event quarter-final went the {{distance}} for the second time this season as Fu lost 6–5 to Robert Milkins. He was whitewashed 6–0 by Ronnie O'Sullivan in the last eight of the non-ranking Champion of Champions. Another quarter-final followed at the UK Championship after Fu came back from 5–3 down to eliminate Shaun Murphy 6–5, with both players criticising the condition of the table after the match. He was knocked out 6–4 by Stephen Maguire.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{they won}} only seven games, and after {{at one point}} looking like a {{surprise}} minor premiership in 1953 collapsed to <b>never</b> <b>win</b> more than six in a season from 1954 to 1959. Between 1952 and 1959 Canterbury were second last on five occasions (only Parramatta denying them the wooden spoon in four cases) but in 1960 under the coaching of club legend Burns they made the semis in an unparalleled four-way play-off. However their finals campaign only lasted one match as they lost to Easts 16–9 in the second semi-final. In the following seasons, they slipped back down the ladder quickly: after beating Easts on 6 July 1963 they did not win again until 25 July 1964. However, the emergence of skillful fullback Les Johns gave them hope, and despite finishing third last in 1966, the next year they made the Grand Final.|$|E
25|$|The Americans then {{struggled}} {{to make the playoffs}} only making it in 1936. Under the ownership of Red Dutton, the Americans made the playoffs in 1938 with a 19–18–11 record. Facing the Rangers for the second and final time, the Americans defeated the Rangers in three games with the help of veterans Ching Johnson and Hap Day. Once the United States joined World War II, both teams started to fade in terms of players; most American-born players went to fight in the war. The Americans folded in 1942 with the hope of coming back in 1946 after the war ended. However, the League reneged the promises made to the Amerks and cancelled the franchise. Owner Red Dutton was so furious at Madison Square Garden for not reinstating his team that he swore the Rangers would <b>never</b> <b>win</b> another Stanley Cup during his lifetime. This became true as the Rangers did not win the Stanley Cup again until 1994; Dutton died in 1987.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the strip}} {{did not have}} a lead {{character}} at the onset, it soon began to focus on Charlie Brown, a character developed from some of the painful experiences of Schulz' formative years. In early strips, Charlie Brown was depicted as distinctly younger than his cohorts Patty and Shermy. Charlie Brown's main characteristic is either self-defeating stubbornness or admirably determined persistence to try his best against all odds: he can <b>never</b> <b>win</b> a ballgame but continues playing baseball; he can never fly a kite successfully but continues trying to do so. Though his inferiority complex was evident from the start, in the earlier strips he also got in his own jabs when verbally sparring with Patty and Shermy. Some early strips also involved romantic attractions between Charlie Brown and Patty or Violet. On September 1, 1958, Charlie Brown's father was formally revealed to be a barber (after earlier instances in the strip that linked Charlie Brown to barbers by implication). In 1960, the now popular line of Charlie Brown greeting cards was introduced by Hallmark Cards. Charlie Brown and Snoopy reached new heights on May 18, 1969, as they became the names of the command module and lunar module, respectively, for Apollo 10.|$|E
500|$|Despite their 2010s failures, the Suns {{franchise}} has the NBA’s fourth-best all-time winning percentage, winning 54 {{percent of}} its games, as {{of the end of}} the 2015–16 season. [...] In their first forty-three seasons, the Suns made the playoffs 29 times, posted nineteen seasons with fifty or more wins, appeared nine times in the Western Conference Finals, and advanced to the NBA Finals in 1976 and 1993. As a result, based on their all-time winning percentage, the Suns are the most successful franchise to <b>never</b> <b>win</b> an NBA championship.|$|E
500|$|The curse {{was said}} to be placed on the team because of the Colonel's anger over {{treatment}} of one of his store-front statues, which was thrown into the Dōtonbori River by celebrating Hanshin fans following their team's victory in the 1985 Japan Championship Series. As is common with sports-related curses, the Curse of the Colonel was used to explain the team's subsequent 18-year losing streak. Some fans believed the team would <b>never</b> <b>win</b> another Japan Series until the statue had been recovered. They have appeared in the Japan Series three times since then, losing in 2003, 2005 and 2014.|$|E

500|$|The final {{showdown}} with the Lannisters seizing control from Eddard was much discussed, with many commentators criticizing Ned's ingenuity and his actions during the episode. In The Atlantic, Scott Meslow wrote that Eddard could <b>never</b> <b>win</b> the [...] "game of thrones" [...] {{because he is}} dedicated to playing by the rules. In his opinion, [...] "one can't afford to play fair" [...] when the only outcomes are [...] "win" [...] or [...] "die." [...] McNutt felt that the climax at the episode's end [...] "was really well handled by both the cast and the director (Dan Minahan)." ...|$|E
500|$|Carter openly wept in {{the locker}} room after the game and was {{affected}} so badly by the loss that he considered retirement. [...] "Walking off that field and losing like that," [...] Carter reflected, [...] "I didn't even know if I wanted to play football anymore. Because I just, I felt like that I would <b>never</b> <b>win</b> after that." [...] He went on to call the game, [...] "The most devastating loss that I've ever been a part of." [...] Both Carter and fellow Hall of Fame member Randle believed that the 1998 Vikings team was their best chance at winning a Super Bowl; neither player would ever reach the Super Bowl in their careers.|$|E
500|$|Dutton {{felt that}} the Rangers were {{responsible}} for the league's refusal to allow the Americans to resume operations, and in a fit of pique, swore that the Rangers would <b>never</b> <b>win</b> another Stanley Cup in his lifetime. His vow became known as [...] "Dutton's Curse". Additionally, he never set foot in an NHL arena again until 1980 when, as the last surviving Calgary Tiger, he was asked to drop the puck for the ceremonial faceoff prior to the first game in Calgary Flames' history. Dutton's 34-year separation from the NHL was attributed to the betrayal of the league's owners, but also because Dutton himself found the lure of the game too strong, and knew he had to step away in order to effectively manage his businesses.|$|E

500|$|Truman {{was torn}} two ways about China, where the Nationalists and Communists were {{fighting}} a large-scale civil war. On the one hand, the Nationalists had been major wartime allies and had large-scale popular {{support in the}} United States, along with a powerful lobby. General George Marshall spent most of 1946 in China trying to negotiate a compromise, but failed. He convinced Truman that the Nationalists would <b>never</b> <b>win</b> on their own, and that a very large-scale American intervention to stop the Communists would significantly weaken America's opposition to the Soviets in Europe. By 1949, the Communists under Mao Zedong had won the civil war, the United States had a new enemy in Asia, and Truman came under fire from conservatives for [...] "losing" [...] China.|$|E
500|$|Side two {{begins with}} Florence Kaye and Bernie Baum's [...] "Power of My Love". The song has a blues-based sound, with Presley {{backed by a}} brass section, drums and {{electric}} guitar and organ. The lyrics include double entendres ("Crush it, kick it / You can <b>never</b> <b>win</b> / I know baby you can't lick it/ I'll make you give in)", with groans by backing female singers emphasizing sexuality. The second track, a cover of John Hartford's [...] "Gentle on My Mind" [...] follows. The string-laden arrangement was inspired by Glen Campbell's 1967 Grammy-winning version of the song. The next song, Eddy Arnold's 1962 hit [...] "After Loving You", is arranged in a 12/8 tempo rhythm-and-blues style. This is followed by Dallas Frazier's [...] "True Love Travels on a Gravel Road" [...] and Chuck Jackson's 1962 hit, [...] "Any Day Now".|$|E
500|$|Uncuts and The Guardians reviews {{were less}} enthusiastic. Uncut {{commented that the}} album sounds dry and superficial, and the songs are too similar {{to each other and}} other Franz Ferdinand songs. The Guardian stated that [...] "if Franz's songwriting is broader than it was, it is still no deeper" [...] and that [...] "they'll keep trying to move your hips because they know they'll <b>never</b> <b>win</b> your heart." [...] This was echoed by the review in the Daily Mail, which {{described}} the album as [...] "a sterile, unwelcoming affair that fails to pack the band's usual punch." [...] Paste was similarly severe, stating that the vocals are [...] "leering", the production [...] "horrific", and that the lyrics [...] "seem to lack both heart and brain" [...] and conclude by writing that [...] "the layoff suggests that Franz is either too confused or too lazy to move forward".|$|E
