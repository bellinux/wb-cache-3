500|$|The {{event was}} held on the National Mall the next year on July 9, 2011. The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum {{assisted}} through opening its Public Observatory and outer landing area to the public. Hofstra University sponsored the event, and presented both live events and space observation through telescopes. Hofstra University program coordinator of astronomy public outreach, professor Donald Lubowich, helped organize the event. Lubowich commented: [...] "Bringing Hofstra's program to the National Mall gives us a very special opportunity to encourage children to pursue their interest and science and promote public understanding of science. Gazing at the rings of Saturn or the Moon's craters and mountains captures the imagination, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>old</b> you are." [...] The 2011 event included assistance from the Northern Virginia Astronomy Club, in addition to attendance from organizations including: the American Astronomical Society, the James Webb Space Telescope, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the Franklin Institute Science Museum.|$|E
500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent {{three hours a day}} at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is also said that he still fit into his pants from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality {{is a big part of}} it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>old</b> I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. ageism (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a guy gets to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have some fun with that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E
2500|$|In New Spain, the Jesuits had {{actively}} evangelized the Indians on {{the northern}} frontier. [...] But their main activity involved educating elite criollo (American-born Spanish) men, many of whom themselves became Jesuits. Of the 678 Jesuits expelled from Mexico, 75% were Mexican-born. In late June 1767, Spanish soldiers removed the Jesuits from their 16 missions and 32 stations in Mexico. No Jesuit, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>old</b> or ill, could be excepted from the king's decree. Many died on the trek along the cactus-studded trail to the Gulf Coast port of Veracruz, where ships awaited them to transport them to Italian exile.|$|E

60|$|Freda {{did not go}} to the {{graveyard}} the next day, although it was a holiday. But in the evening, when everybody had gone home, she crept over the hill and through the beech grove to see what had been done. The plots were all very neat and prettily set out with plants and bulbs. Some perennials were already in bud. The grave of Katie Morris' great-uncle, who had been dead for forty years, was covered with blossoming purple pansies. Every grave, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> small or <b>old,</b> had its share of promise--every grave except one. Freda came across it with a feeling of surprise. It was away down in the lower corner where there were no plots. It was shut off from the others by a growth of young poplars and was sunken and overgrown with blueberry shrubs. There was no headstone, and it looked dismally neglected. Freda felt a sympathy for it. She had no grave, and this grave had nobody to tend it or care for it.|$|R
2500|$|Also {{according}} to Scalia, Thomas is {{more willing to}} overrule constitutional cases than he was: [...] "If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say let's get it right. I wouldn't do that." [...] Law professor Michael Gerhardt, however, says that Scalia's characterization of Thomas may be incorrect, given that Thomas has supported leaving {{a broad spectrum of}} constitutional decisions intact. Thomas's belief in originalism is strong; he has said, [...] "When faced with a clash of constitutional principle and a line of unreasoned cases wholly divorced from the text, history, and structure of our founding document, we should not hesitate to resolve the tension in favor of the Constitution's original meaning." [...] Thomas believes that an erroneous decision can and should be overturned, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>old</b> it is.|$|E
2500|$|Reliance on old maxims {{and rigid}} {{adherence}} to precedent, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>old</b> or ill-considered, came under critical {{discussion in the}} late 19th century, starting in the United States. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in his famous article, [...] "The Path of the Law", commented, [...] "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down {{in the time of}} Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past." [...] Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for [...] "the man of the present," [...] but [...] "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics." [...] In an 1880 lecture at Harvard, he wrote: ...|$|E

40|$|Backward Classes (OBC). Those {{programs}} consist {{mainly in}} quotas in public employment, legislative assemblies, {{higher education institutions}} {{and a variety of}} other programs. However, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> widespread and <b>old</b> those programs are, they are still strongly debated. Particularly in education, in a context of intense competition among students to enter higher education institutions, affirmative action policies are heavily contested. Nonetheless, quite surprisingly, the effect of those policies on education has been under researched. In this study, I use a unique historical event taking place in the 1970 ’s to evaluate the effect of access to affirmative action program on school attainment. I show that while males see the number of years of schooling increase by up to 0. 8 years, females do not seem to benefit from affirmative action programs to prologue their studies. The Indian affirmative action policies in the education sector take many forms. Apart from quotas in higher education, the members of SC can have reduction in fees, dedicated hostels to facilitate the pursuit of education outside of the student’s hometown or village (hostels for girls in particular), scholarships, etc. Indeed, the various educational policies targeting the SC represent a large share of the expenditures directed at SC 1 DID AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICIES HAVE ANY EFFECT ON EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES? However, while the efforts devoted to the education of the SC is relatively large, measuring their impact i...|$|R

6000|$|In {{the course}} of this walk, we passed St. Mary's Church,--a very old church indeed, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>old,</b> but say, eight hundred or a {{thousand}} years. It has a very tall spire, and the spire is now undergoing repairs; and, seeing the door open, I went into the porch, but found no admission further. Then, walking around it, through the churchyard, we saw that all the venerable Gothic windows--one of them grand in size-- were set with stained glass, representing coats of arms and ancient armor, and kingly robes, and saints with glories about their heads, and Scriptural people; but all of these, as far as our actual perception was concerned, quite colorless, and with only a cold outline, dimly filled up. Yet, had we been within the church, and had the sunlight been streaming through, what a warm, rich, gorgeous, roseate, golden life would these figures have showed! ...|$|E
60|$|On another lake, years before, when {{hunting in}} the same way without a gun, I saw another curious bit of deer wisdom. It must be remembered that deer are born {{apparently}} without any fear of man. The fawns when found very young in the woods are generally full of playfulness and curiosity; and a fawn that has lost its mother will turn to a man quicker than to any other animal. When deer see you for the first time, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>old</b> or young they are, they approach cautiously, if you do not terrify them by sudden motions, and in twenty pretty ways {{try to find out what}} you are. Like most wild animals that have a keen sense of smell, and especially like the bear and caribou, they trust only their noses at first. When they scent man for the first time they generally run away, not because they know what it means but for precisely the opposite reason, namely, because there is in the air a strong scent that they do not know, and that they have not been taught by their mothers how to meet. When in doubt run away--that is the rule of nose which seems to be impressed by their mothers upon all timid wild things, though they act in almost the opposite way when sight or hearing is in question.|$|E
