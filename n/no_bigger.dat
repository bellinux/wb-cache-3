During the warmer summer months, an {{estimated}} 4–6 trillion brine shrimp inhabit the lake. Brine shrimp have no food value for humans, but are a staple for birds of the region.

25|$|Researchers at Princeton University have {{recently}} built a quantum well laser which is <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> than {{a grain of}} rice. The laser {{is powered by a}} single electron which passes through two quantum dots; a double quantum dot. The electron moves from a state of higher energy, to a state of lower energy whilst emitting photons in the microwave region. These photons bounce off mirrors to create a beam of light; the laser.|$|E
25|$|Unconditional Love was not {{released}} until 2002. Her performance {{was seen by}} Paul Haggis, who created the role of Emily Resnick for her on Family Law. Joining the cast in 2002, she continued with the series until its cancellation later that same year. She later had significant guest appearances on NYPD Blue, Dharma & Greg, , House and NCIS. She also appeared as herself in Standing Tall at Auschwitz, which was a History Channel documentary on the Ovitz family, and in <b>No</b> <b>Bigger</b> Than a Minute, an independent documentary on dwarfism which aired on the PBS program P.O.V.|$|E
25|$|The {{satellite}} {{was designed}} and constructed {{in less than a}} month. Sputnik 1 was a simple polished metal sphere <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> than a beach ball, containing batteries powering a transmitter using 4 external communication antennae. Korolev personally managed the assembly at a hectic pace; and the satellite was placed in orbit using a rocket that had successfully launched only once before. International response to the accomplishment was electrifying, and political ramifications continued for decades. Nikita Khrushchev was pleased with this success, and encouraged launch of a more sophisticated satellite less than a month later in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 3 November.|$|E

25|$|When enlisted, volunteers first {{go through}} a four-week basic {{military}} training at Korea Army Training Center under administration of Ministry of National Defense. The recruits are then {{handed over to the}} Ministry of Public Administration and Security for later administration, and are given a three-week police training before being deployed to various police units (that are each <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> than the size of a company) throughout the country. Depending on their assignment, the Auxiliary Policemen may assist the national police with a wide array of police works, such as riot policing, traffic control, crowd control, surveillance and patrol. Upon completion of their service, Auxiliary Policemen are discharged with a Sergeant rank in the ROK Army Reserve (except in cases of demotion).|$|E
25|$|These stars, {{known as}} neutron stars, are {{extremely}} small—on {{the order of}} radius 10km, <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> than {{the size of a}} large city—and are phenomenally dense. Their period of rotation shortens dramatically as the stars shrink (due to conservation of angular momentum); observed rotational periods of neutron stars range from about 1.5 milliseconds (over 600 revolutions per second) to several seconds. When these rapidly rotating stars' magnetic poles are aligned with the Earth, we detect a pulse of radiation each revolution. Such neutron stars are called pulsars, and were the first neutron stars to be discovered. Though electromagnetic radiation detected from pulsars is most often in the form of radio waves, pulsars have also been detected at visible, X-ray, and gamma ray wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|Though the Hulse–Taylor {{observations}} were very important, they give only indirect evidence for gravitational waves. A more conclusive observation {{would be a}} direct measurement {{of the effect of}} a passing gravitational wave, which could also provide more information about the system that generated it. Any such direct detection is complicated by the extraordinarily small effect the waves would produce on a detector. The amplitude of a spherical wave will fall off as the inverse of the distance from the source (the 1/R term in the formulas for h above). Thus, even waves from extreme systems like merging binary black holes die out to very small amplitudes by the time they reach the Earth. Astrophysicists expect that some gravitational waves passing the Earth may be as large as h ≈ 10−20, but generally <b>no</b> <b>bigger.</b>|$|E

500|$|Marrakesh has {{the largest}} {{traditional}} Berber market in Morocco {{and the image of}} the city is closely associated with its souks. Paul Sullivan cites the souks as the principal shopping attraction in the city: [...] "A honeycomb of intricately connected alleyways, this fundamental section of the old city is a micro-medina in itself, comprising a dizzying number of stalls and shops that range from itsy kiosks <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> than an elf's wardrobe to scruffy store-fronts that morph into glittering Aladdin's Caves once you're inside." [...] Historically the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalwork and pottery. These divisions still roughly exist but with significant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs, traditional Muslim attire, leather bags, and lanterns. Haggling is still {{a very important part of}} trade in the souks.|$|E
500|$|L.A. Woman was {{released}} on April 19, 1971. It reached number nine on the Billboard 200, remaining on the charts for 36 weeks, and reached number 28 in the UK, spending four weeks on the UK Albums Charts. The first cover pressing had a burgundy-colored, curved-corner cardboard cutout sleeve, framing a clear embossed cellophane insert, glued in from behind. Photography was credited to Wendell Hamick. According to Jac Holzman, {{chief executive officer of}} Elektra Records: [...] "I wasn't sure there would be another album ever, so I had Bill Harvey create a collector's cover. The Doors' faces were printed on clear film. The backing color of the inner sleeve could be changed and would affect the mood of the package.

Many of his sketches resemble cartoon strips where the pictures get bigger and more detailed. He would also do several versions of the same finished picture, such as one where the motif is depicted in a summer and winter scene. He did not observe the traditional hierarchy in the mediums or techniques at that time. He could make a complete work in pencil or charcoal just as well as a sketch in oil.|$|E

[...] IGN.com called it [...] "by-the-books, generic (and at times bland) pop/rock", although it did say Simpson's vocals showed maturity and promise. A writer for Stylus magazine commented that [...] "after spending more than forty minutes with Ashlee, I feel like I don’t know her any better than I did beforehand... for a record with the name Autobiography, it seems like <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> criticism could be leveled."
