One of the arguments was that documentation would enhance the ‘professional’ development of nursery teachers and make their daily work visible and recognized. Drawing on perspectives from Actor-Network-Theory this article analyses {{the way in which}} documentation is enacted as a network of heterogeneous elements within the individual pre-school. It is argued that documentation, rather than developing ‘professionalism’, enacts the nursery teacher in a particular ‘professional’ way. Thus, it is analyzed what ‘professionalism’ becomes, and what is excluded – produced as outside of ‘professional work’. <br /...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{the decision of}} licensing for nursery and school teachers. In Swedish society there has {{for a long time}} been discourse about professionalisation within various industries, including teaching. One strategy towards achieving professional status is official authorisation of a profession, which occurs when a profession obtains licensing. In February 2011, the Swedish government announced the decision that nursery and school teachers would be licensed. This means that only those with an education can be employed as a teacher and obtain that license. The Swedish school has a long tradition of both educated and uneducated personnel who can work as a teacher, so the introduction of licensing for teachers is a radical change and will affect all personnel within the school system. In this essay I aim to present previous research relevant to the study such as status, profession, background history regarding the preschool and its development. My interest lies in how licensing is perceived by preschool directors and what their perception is of <b>nursery</b> <b>teaching</b> as a profession. In my study, I chose to interview four nursery directors using a qualitative interview method, with a phenomenological and hermeneutic perspective. From the study emerge rich descriptions of the phenomenon, perceptions about both the licensing and profession of nursery teache...|$|E

The subjects were thirteen female college students enrolled in either Child Development or <b>Nursery</b> School <b>Teaching</b> programs. These students had all completed at least one course in Family Relations, one term in General Psychology, and two courses in Child Development. Participation in the study was on a voluntary basis. The data consisted of total scores on two primary types of observed teacher influences, dominative teacher behavior and socially integrative teacher behavior, and the total score on the Film Test for Understanding Behavior (FUB) in addition to the three subscale scores of this instrument, the knowledge, guidance, and sensitivity subscales. The statistical analysis consisted of the nonparametric statistical test of Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient. This test was employed to explore the null hypothesis that there would be no relationship between teacher behavior and understanding of children's behavior in beginning practicum nursery school student teacher aides. None of the correlations between the scores on the two instruments used to measure teacher behavior and behavioral understanding was significant. These findings indicate a need for further study of the relationship between teacher behavior and the understanding of children's behavior. The amount and nature of data gathered in this study would lend itself to further data analysis. For example, these data could be studied in relation to data collected on students at progressively higher levels of practicum participation.

40|$|Background: Oral {{language}} {{skills in the}} preschool and early school years are critical to educational success and provide the foundations for the later development of reading comprehension. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 180 children from 15 UK nursery schools (n = 12 from each setting; M age = 4; 0) were randomly allocated to receive a 30 -week oral language intervention or to a waiting control group. Children in the intervention group received 30 weeks of oral language intervention, beginning in nursery (preschool), in three group sessions per week, continuing with daily sessions on transition to Reception class (pre-Year 1). The intervention was delivered by <b>nursery</b> staff and <b>teaching</b> assistants trained {{and supported by the}} research team. Following screening, children were assessed preintervention, following completion of the intervention and after a 6 -month delay. Results: Children in the intervention group showed significantly better performance on measures of oral language and spoken narrative skills than children in the waiting control group immediately after the 30 week intervention and after a 6 month delay. Gains in word-level literacy skills were weaker, though clear improvements were observed on measures of phonological awareness. Importantly, improvements in oral {{language skills}} generalized to a standardized measure of reading comprehension at maintenance test. Conclusions: Early intervention for children with oral language difficulties is effective and can successfully support the skills, which underpin reading comprehension. © 2012 The Authors.

About one of every four of these children (6. 1 million) were below regular school age, and probably required some kind of care {{in the absence of}} their working mother. Secondly, one half of the intellectual potential of, a child is reached by the time the child is five years of age. Therefore, the teachers of tomorrow, for nursery school age children, must be trained {{in order to meet the}} needs of these children. Finally, research has shown that there are no handbooks available to guide in training student teachers of nursery school age children, therefore the researcher attempted to alleviate these problems by writing a <b>nursery</b> school student <b>teaching</b> handbook.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{illuminate}} children’s perceived notions of inclusion in their pedagogical activities in the Reception class. It also seeks to ascertain how practitioners (teachers, <b>nursery</b> nurses and <b>teaching</b> assistants) respond to children’s comments, and whether they can utilise children’s perceptions to inform their pedagogical practice. Empirical research was conducted using qualitative methodology. Reception classes in infant and primary schools in the North of England were selected. Extensive data were gathered with forty children and seven practitioners over a six week period in each of the schools. This included collecting field notes; undertaking observations of children in pedagogical activities; conducting group and individual interviews with children; and individual interviews with practitioners. Participative tools, including photographs and drawings, were used to engage with children’s voices, since this was central to the research aim. All data were systematically analysed and an overall understanding was gained of children’s perceived notions of inclusion. These resonate with two dimensions: belonging and relationships (with practitioner and/or child); and democratic pedagogies. Moreover, the research offers a new critique to child-centred pedagogies, which affords greater insight into younger children’s perceptions of inclusion, than have been presented in the literature thus far. Whilst acknowledging the small sample of practitioners, the study’s findings are of note when analysed alongside other empirical research. The findings reveal that practitioners involved in this study retain some resistance to responding to the views of young children. Moreover, the findings identify that there is limited evidence of practitioners’ serious reconsideration of planning regarding children’s perceived notions of inclusion, and that they require a shift in their reasoning. Furthermore, they signify the necessity for greater emphasis on the importance of engaging with children’s voices in the training of newly qualified teachers, and the ongoing professional development for all practitioners in early years...|$|R

But also we are dealing with the other people outside Arusha municipality. In some few villages we are giving them some assistance in agriculture in order to help themselves in their lives in the families. Laiser	In agricultural area how do you help these students or these youth? Lyaruu	Ok here, a part of these skills they are getting, we have got a garden here. We are teaching them how to take care of the garden especially to these vegetables so that maybe sometimes if they have got time from their skills then they can involve themselves to their area where they can get maybe vitamins and other things. But mostly we are doing this in order to have more than two things; they can do their skills and then in their part-time they can do gardening so that they can help their families. Laiser	Method, would you allow me to visit the garden? Lyaruu	Oh yes definitely it?s allowed, you can go and see it. Laiser	Method now I can see a very, very good garden here. Who is responsible in this garden? Lyaruu	We have got here Mama Makundi, she?s here. Makundi	I?m Mama Makundi, I?m teaching the girls how to plant a garden. So we have a garden here in our school. We have planted different kinds of vegetables and also herbs. We have planted herbs also which they can use in cooking, so here they learn about herbs and vegetables to help them in their own lives. They can employ themselves through gardening. Laiser	Do you do also in villages? Makundi	Yes they have to do the same in their home lives. So I try to make follow up if they are doing the same as we taught them or not. So some of them have already started their own garden. Laiser	Mr Method while we are standing on this garden I would like also to ask you about now what you are doing in the villages? Lyaruu	Ok we?ve got three villages at the start. In Likamba we have got these cover crops. We encourage them to put cover crops because there at Likamba they have got serious soil erosion. Then we have got Manyire in this Arumeru district also. We have got horticultural to nursery school kids. It is very interesting that we are <b>teaching</b> <b>nursery</b> school kids how to keep vegetables. And these kids are from 4 years to 6 years. We give to each a piece of garden and then we plant something there and we teach how to take care. Laiser	Can a 4 year old child learn how to take care of his own garden? Lyaruu	Yes, yes, yes according to what we have found in our research, she can or he can, watering the garden, he can make some weeding in the garden. Apart from this we have been helping them for more than 10 years for seeds, the whole village, these two villages. Laiser	You provide the seeds? Lyaruu	We provide the seeds to them. But this year we?ve decided to stop on giving them seeds always. What we have done, we have started a project which can help them to produce their own seeds. So we have given them foundation seeds so that they can grow and produce seeds themselves, so that they will stop coming and getting help always because our project is Help to Self-Help. You are to be helped, then you can help yourself. That is what we are doing. Now this year we have started this and we have seen a fruit because we are expecting to harvest more than 2000 kilograms of seeds from these two villages. End of track. The NGO Help to Self Help is assisting under-privileged children, orphans and rural communities to learn productive skills and achieve better food production.
