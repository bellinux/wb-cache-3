40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} principles of the Chicago Convention is the principle of <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft.</b> It is {{the means by which}} the Convention attaches most of the rights and obligations that it creates to aircraft and state of registry, irrespective of who owns or operates the aircraft. Yet the rules of the Convention on nationality and registration can give rise to serious practical problems when an aircraft registered in one state is cooperatively arranged to be operated by an operator belonging to another state. This thesis takes {{a closer look at the}} principle of <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> in international aviation law and gives an outline of the history of this concept. Further, it explains how nowadays this principle is applied to aircraft operated by international operating agencies, and to aircraft registered in one state and leased, chartered or inter-changed by operators belonging to other states. The concept of 'nationality of aircraft' should not be confused with the concept of 'nationality of airlines'. Another part of my thesis is dedicated to this concept of 'nationality of airlines', which is of major importance in aviation too. This part contains a general explanation on this concept as well as some examples of the ownership and control requirements in different national laws. Besides introducing the Community Air Carrier concept, it focusses on the question if the ownership and control clauses included in bilateral agreements are compatible with today's trend towards global carriers and international mergers.

So this convention has no effect on nationality laws.

50|$|The Caterpillar Club is an {{informal}} association {{of people who}} have successfully used a parachute to bail out <b>of</b> a disabled <b>aircraft.</b> After authentication by the parachute maker, applicants receive a membership certificate and a distinctive lapel pin. The <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the person saving their life by parachute and ownership <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft</b> are not factors in determining qualification for membership; anybody who has saved their life by using a parachute after bailing out <b>of</b> a disabled <b>aircraft</b> is eligible. The requirement that the aircraft is disabled naturally excludes parachuting enthusiasts in the normal course of a recreational jump, or those involved in military training jumps.|$|R
50|$|Article 4d {{provides}} that neither marriage nor {{dissolution of marriage}} shall automatically affect the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> either spouse, nor shall a change <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> by one spouse during marriage automatically affect the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> their spouse. Common practice among states {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century was that a woman was to have the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, and lose her previous nationality. Even after the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a married woman was no longer dependent on the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically naturalised married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses' original nationality, the spouse losing the right to consular assistance (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and becoming subject to military service obligations. Article 4d addresses this situation.|$|R
