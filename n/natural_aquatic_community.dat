40|$|We {{describe}} the general {{background and the}} recent advances in research on underwater photosynthesis of leaf segments, whole communities and plant dominated aquatic ecosystems and present contemporary methods tailor made to quantify photosynthesis and carbon fixation under water. The majority of studies of aquatic photosynthesis {{have been carried out}} with detached leaves or thalli and this selectiveness influences the perception of the regulation of aquatic photosynthesis. We thus recommend assessing the influence of inorganic carbon and temperature on <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>communities</b> of variable density in addition to studying detached leaves in the scenarios of rising CO 2 and temperature. Moreover, a growing number of researchers are interested in tolerance of terrestrial plants during flooding as torrential rains sometimes result in overland floods that inundate terrestrial plants. We propose to undertake studies to elucidate the importance of leaf acclimation of terrestrial plants to facilitate gas exchange and light utilisation under water as these acclimations influence underwater photosynthesis as well as internal aeration of plant tissues during submergence...|$|R
40|$|The trophic {{interactions}} between bacteria and their main predators, the heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), {{play a key}} role in the structuring and functioning of aquatic microbial food webs. Grazing regulation of bacterial communities, both of biomass and community structure, have been frequently reported. Additionally, bottom-up responses of the HNF at the population level (numerical responses) have also been extensively described. However, the functional response of HNF at the single cell level has not been well explored. In this study, we concurrently measured the physiological structure of bacterial communities and HNF single cell activities during re-growth cultures of <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>communities.</b> We found that changes in the abundance and proportion of the preferred, highly-active bacterial prey, caused by the feeding activity of their predators (HNF), induced a negative feedback effect on the single cell activity of these HNF. These shifts in the specific cellular activity of HNF occur at a much shorter time scale than population-level shifts in flagellate abundance, and offer a complementary mechanism to explain not only the tight coupling between bacteria and HNF, but also the relative constancy of bacterial abundance in aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{relevance}} of predation {{as a factor}} mediating the competitive interaction among ecologically very similar species is investigated by experimentally analyzing {{the effect of the}} copepod predator Diacyclops bicuspidatus odessanus on three sibling rotifer species belonging to the Brachionus plicatilis species complex. These rotifer species are similar in shape but show notable differences in body size. Predator and prey species co-occur in brackish waterbodies close to the Mediterranean coast of Spain. First, we characterized differential vulnerability of rotifers to predation. A consistent tendency of higher predation rates on smaller prey (i. e., smaller species and younger individuals) was observed. Analysis of predation showed that predator contact rate did not differ significantly among prey species, but that attack, capture probabilities, and handling time did. Second, we performed population dy-namics experiments with two prey species competing for a single resource at different levels of predation. Predation extended coexistence of the competing rotifers, whereas the inferior competitor was excluded {{in the absence of the}} predator. In some pairwise experiments, we found that the greater the predation level, the larger the relative increase in density of the inferior competitor. Our results suggest that predation can affect the dynamics of very similar competing species in <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>communities,</b> promoting coexistence.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{changes in}} biomass, biochemical fingerprints, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile and functional {{status of the}} <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> microbial <b>communities</b> upon impact of an Atradex pulse. The Atradex was applied to microcosm tanks at concentrations ranging from 24. 5 μg L− 1 to 245 mg L− 1. The biomass of all microbial communities declined to a minimum level on day 4 with the effect being more pronounced in treated groups. Similarity between microbial communities also decreased on day 4 with the greatest change occurring at a concentration of 245 mg L− 1 Atradex. After 8 days exposure to Atradex, microbial communities in all treated groups (except tanks spiked with 245 mg L− 1 Atradex) recovered and showed similar metabolic fingerprints and FAME profiles to those of controls. Our results indicate that exposure to an Atradex pulse at concentration above 245 mg L− 1, may irreversibly change the structure and functional status of <b>aquatic</b> microbial <b>communities.</b> Atradex at concentration above 245 mg L− 1 may irreversibly change the structure and functional status of <b>aquatic</b> microbial <b>communities...</b>|$|R

From a practical point of view, it should help to prevent future invasions and to mitigate the effects of recent invaders through early detection and prioritization of management measures. This study aims to identify the environmental determinants of fish invasions in Mediterranean-climate rivers and evaluate {{the relative importance of}} natural and human drivers. Fish communities were sampled in 182 undisturbed and 198 disturbed sites by human activities, belonging to 12 river types defined for continental Portugal within the implementation of the European Union’s Water Framework Directive. Pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus (L.), and mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki (Girard), were the most abundant non-native species (NNS) in the southern river types whereas the Iberian gudgeon, Gobio lozanoi Doadrio and Madeira, was the dominant NNS in the north/centre. Small northern mountain streams showed null or low frequency of occurrence and abundance of NNS, while southern lowland river types with medium and large drainage areas presented the highest values. The occurrence of NNS was significantly lower in undisturbed sites and the highest density of NNS was associated with high human pressure. Results from variance partitioning showed that natural environmental factors determine the distribution of the most abundant NNS while the increase in their abundance and success is explained mainly by human-induced disturbance factors.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{relationships}} between cell size and productivity is of key importance in microbial ecology to understand which members of <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>communities</b> {{are responsible for the}} overall activity and/or productivity. Flow sorting of microorganisms from different environmental samples was used to analyze the activity of bacterial cells depending on their biovolume. Bacterial cells from five different natural samples taken along the Mediterranean coast including fresh- and seawaters were incubated with tritiated leucine, then stained with SYTO 13 and sorted by flow cytometry according to their average side-angle-scattered (SSC) light. In all samples, a bell-shaped relationship was found between cell biovolume and activity, whereas activity of a given cell-size class varied between samples. In contrast, an inverse relationship was found between biovolumes and abundances. These results suggest that medium-sized cells with highest growth rates are probably submitted to intense grazing. For one sample, bacteria within five different size classes were sorted and the genetic diversity of cells within each sorted size class and that of the whole community were analyzed by the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method. The genetic diversity, as determined at the community level was highly represented into the pool of small cells, whereas only few species were present into larger cell subpopulations. The results suggest that only a few genotypes may be dominant within the largest and most productive cells. Furthermore, cell size polymorphism as well as heterogeneous cellular activities were found within some species. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The development of procedures that would enable us to track the wide range of organic compounds transformed by aquatic bacteria would greatly improve our understanding of material cycles. In this study, we examined the applicability of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy coupled with stable-isotope labeling to the investigation of metabolite transformation in a <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> bacterial <b>community.</b> The addition of a model substrate (13 C 6 –glucose) to a coastal seawater sample and subsequent incubation resulted in the detection of > 200 peaks and the assignment of 22 metabolites from various chemical classes, including amino acids, dipeptides, organic acids, nucleosides, nucleobases, and amino alcohols, which had been identified as transformed from the 13 C 6 –glucose. Additional experiments revealed large variability in metabolite transformation and the key compounds, showing the bacterial accumulation of glutamate over the incubation period, and that of 3 -hydroxybutyrate with increasing concentrations of 13 C 6 –glucose added. These results suggest the potential ability of our approach to track substrate transformation in <b>aquatic</b> bacterial <b>communities.</b> Further applications of this procedure may provide substantial insights into the metabolite dynamics in aquatic environments...|$|R

40|$|The {{adenosine}} triphosphate (ATP) assay, a proxy of living biomass (used by oceanographers {{for more than}} 50 years), was investigated for its potential as a ballast water compliance monitoring tool. Though some ATP assays are reliable for estimating living biomass in specific microbial communities, those assays may be less than optimal for others. For this project, an ATP assay was developed to quantify ATP concentration in most (if not all) aquatic microbial communities; it was also optimized for convenient and rapid assessment of ballast water compliance for persons without a scientific background (e. g., ship engineers, mates, ballast water inspectors). The newly developed ATP assay, called “the P-BAC ATP assay,” was tested against the traditional boiling Tris ATP assay and a 2 nd generation ATP assay. From this project, I concluded that the traditional Tris ATP assay underestimated ATP concentrations by 2 to 4 -fold in various <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> microbial <b>communities</b> compared to the P-BAC ATP assay. When compared to the 2 nd generation ATP kit, P-BAC extracted comparably at times and up to 3. 4 -fold more ATP.

40|$|The {{ecological}} insurance hypothesis {{predicts a}} positive effect of species richness on ecosystem functioning in a variable environment. This effect stems from temporal and spatial complementarity among species within metacommunities coupled with optimal levels of dispersal. Despite its importance {{in the context of}} global change by human activities, empirical evidence for ecological insurance remains scarce and controversial. Here we use <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> bacterial <b>communities</b> to explore some of the predictions of the spatial and temporal aspects of the ecological insurance hypothesis. Addressing ecological insurance with bacterioplankton is of strong relevance given their central role in fundamental ecosystem processes. Our experimental set up consisted of water and bacterioplankton communities from two contrasting coastal lagoons. In order to mimic environmental fluctuations, the bacterioplankton community from one lagoon was successively transferred between tanks containing water from each of the two lagoons. We manipulated initial bacterial diversity for experimental communities and immigration during the experiment. We found that the abundance and production of bacterioplankton communities was higher and more stable (lower temporal variance) for treatments with high initial bacterial diversity. Immigration was only marginally beneficial to bacterial communities, probably because microbial communities operate at different time scales compared to the frequency of perturbation selected in this study, and of their intrinsic high physiologic plasticity. Such local "physiological insurance" may have a strong significance for the maintenance of bacterial abundance and production in the face of environmental perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescently stained viruses {{were used}} as probes to label, identify, and enumerate {{specific}} strains of bacteria and cyanobacteria in mixed microbial assemblages. Several marine virus isolates were fluorescently stained with YOYO- 1 or POPO- 1 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and added to seawater samples that contained natural microbial communities. Cells to which the stained viruses adsorbed were easily distinguished from nonhost cells; typically, there was undetectable binding of stained viruses to natural microbial assemblages containing > 10 (sup 6) bacteria ml(sup- 1) but to which host cells were not added. Host cells that were added to natural seawater were quantified with 99 % (plusmn) 2 % (mean (plusmn) range) efficiency with fluorescently labeled virus probes (FLVPs). A marine bacterial isolate (strain PWH 3 a), tentatively identified as Vibrio natriegens, was introduced into natural microbial communities that were either supplemented with nutrients or untreated, {{and changes in the}} abundance of the isolate were monitored with FLVPs. Simultaneously, the concentrations of viruses that infected strain PWH 3 a were monitored by plaque assay. Following the addition of PWH 3 a, the concentration of viruses infecting this strain increased from undetectable levels (< 1 ml(sup- 1)) to 2. 9 x 10 (sup 7) and 8. 3 x 10 (sup 8) ml(sup- 1) for the untreated and nutrient-enriched samples, respectively. The increase in viruses was associated with a collapse in populations of strain PWH 3 a from ca. 30 to 2 % and 43 to 0. 01 % of the microbial communities in untreated and nutrient-enriched samples, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that FLVPs can be used to identify and quantify specific groups of bacteria in mixed microbial communities. The data show as well that viruses which are present at low abundances in <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> viral <b>communities</b> can control microbial community structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} effect that induction of lysogenic bacteria has on bacteriophage production and bacterial mortality in coastal waters was investigated, and we present {{estimates for the}} percentage of lysogenic cells in a <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> bacterial <b>community.</b> Various concentrations of mitomycin C and exposure times to UV C radiation (UV-C) (wavelength of 254 nm) were used to induce the lytic cycle in lysogenic cells of natural communities of marine bacteria. UV-C treatment occasionally resulted in phage production, but phage production induced by UV-C was always less than that caused {{by the addition of}} mitomycin C. There was no evidence that high growth rates of bacteria resulted in lysogenic phage production. The burst size of cells induced by mitomycin C was determined by transmission electron microscopy and ranged from 11 to 45. Dividing the induced phage production by the burst size provided an estimate of the number of lysogenic bacterial cells, which ranged from 0. 07 to 4. 4 % (average, 1. 5 %) of the total bacterial population. The percentages of lysogenic bacteria that were induced by mitomycin C were similar for samples collected nearshore from the pier of the Marine Science Institute (chlorophyll a, 1. 6 to 2. 9 (mu) g liter(sup- 1)) and in relatively oligotrophic water (chlorophyll a, 0. 2 to 0. 9 (mu) g liter(sup- 1)) collected 25 to 100 km offshore. By using a steady-state model, if all lysogenic bacteria were induced simultaneously, 0. 14 to 8. 8 % (average, 3. 0 %) of the total bacterial mortality would result from induction of lysogenic cells. If mitomycin C induces all or the majority of lysogenized cells, our results imply that lysogenic phage production is generally not an important source of phage production or bacterial mortality in the coastal waters of the western Gulf of Mexico...|$|R
40|$|Environmental conditions, biotic interactions, {{dispersal}} {{and history}} {{have been suggested}} to be important processes influencing the spatial distribution of organisms and thus to affect community assembly. Understanding how these processes influence community assembly is important, particularly because community diversity and composition are suggested to be relevant for ecosystem functioning. Moreover, bacteria are strongly contributing to nutrient and carbon cycle. Bacteria are highly abundant and ubiquitous, and thus it is relevant to study how they are assembled. This thesis aims to gain insight {{on the role of}} these processes on <b>aquatic</b> bacterial <b>community</b> assembly, diversity and functioning. The studies included in this thesis involve transplant and microcosm experiments performed in the lab as well as manipulation experiments and field surveys in a natural rock pool systems. Bacterial community composition was addressed by analysis of 16 S rRNA gene and community functioning by measuring bacterial production, community respiration and the ability to use different carbon substrates. This thesis highlights that species sorting is a very important assembly mechanism for bacterial communities, but also finds that other processes such as dispersal and history contribute to the patterns observed. Dispersal caused rescuing effects compensating for losses of diversity; {{at the same time it}} increased the similarity between communities. Moreover, bacteria have shown a high level of functional plasticity when colonizing a new locality. Interestingly, past environmental conditions explained the structure of bacterial communities better than present-day environmental conditions. Disturbances and biotic interactions are also important in the assembly of communities. Disturbance caused temporary shifts in bacterial function and changes in composition, the magnitude of which depended on the intensity and the frequency of the disturbance. However, <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> bacterial <b>communities</b> showed quite high resilience capacities. Competition can shift the proportion of generalists and specialists species whereas predation or trophic interactions have been found to decrease diversity and to modify the importance of stochasticity. Both caused alterations of community functioning. Finally, this thesis shows that the diversity-functioning relationship is context dependent. Further research should be directed to understanding the intensity and direction of changes in composition and how this affects the functionality of bacterial communitie...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This thesis {{reports a}} portion of a general {{ecological}} study of a stream under conditions of controlled flow and low levels of organic enrichment. It is concerned with the effects of experimental variations of light intensity and concentration of soluble organic enrichment imposed on seasonal variations of temperature and total light energy received upon the periphyton and benthic plants. Suitable enrichment was predicated on establishment and maintenance of an abundant growth of Sphaerotilus and involved the isolation and study of this organism in pure cultures, in laboratory streams {{as well as in the}} experimental stream. Abundant growth of Sphaerotilus was obtained in cultures at temperatures of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C while in the laboratory streams and the experimental stream, the organism produced abundant growths at a range of temperatures from 2 to 12 °C. A variety of carbon and nitrogen sources was investigated for maintenance of growth of Sphaerotilus. Abundant growth was produced when the enrichment included a specific nitrogen source combined with a specific carbon source. A carbon-nitrogen ratio of 8 to 1 proved satisfactory for maintaining Sphaerotilus in the stream. An investigation of the cropping effect of stream snails indicated that the presence of large numbers of snails decreased the standing crop of Sphaerotilus both in the laboratory streams and the experimental stream. A method was devised for determining the daily mean percentages of full sunlight reaching the four experimental sections of Berry Creek. Approximately 4 percent reached the shaded sections and 50 percent reached the light sections during the summer months. The range of mean saturating light intensities on the four experimental sections was from 250 to 950 footcandles. Methods designed to sample the plant communities in the experimental sections of the stream included: artificial substrates (microscope slides) used to observe the density and diversity of micro-algae; a system of grids used to record distribution of the plant biomass; and the removal of {{a portion of}} the stream substrate for the detailed examination of the benthic community. Both microscopic and macroscopic observations indicated that twice as many species and greater numbers of autotrophic organisms were present in the unenriched than in the enriched sections. Sub-samples of the harvested and homogenized materials scoured from the stream substrate, were used to determine biomass, organic matter, caloric content and pigment content. The biomasses from the enriched sections were greater than those from the unenriched sections, but contained large amounts of silt and were lower in organic matter and caloric content. The mean percentages of organic matter for the sections were: shaded, unenriched- 33; light, unenriched- 42; shaded, enriched- 19 and light, enriched- 19. The range of chlorophyll a from the four experimental sections was 0. 03 to 0. 28 g/m². The concentration of chlorophyll, when representing spatial and seasonal variations, is an acceptable measure of the productive ability of communities in shallow, rapidly flowing streams. A photosynthesis-respiration chamber was used to determine primary production and community respiration for each of the experimental sections. The range of rates of gross primary production expressed as mean O₂,g /m²/day for the unenriched sections was 0. 62 - 2. 47 and 0. 53 - 0. 59 for the enriched sections. Annual rates of gross primary production in glucose equivalents ranged from 0. 07 kg/m² for the enriched sections to 0. 30 for the unenriched. The stream communities were characterized as heterotrophic communities with production-respiration ratios ranging from 0. 47 - 0. 65 for the unenriched and 0. 16 - 0. 20 for the enriched sections. The efficiency of the fixation of light energy as organic matter was 1. 90 - 2. 23 for the unenriched and 0. 37 - 2. 70 for the enriched sections. The photosynthetic efficiencies of the communities on the experimental sections of Berry Creek were much lower than those reported for most laboratory communities, but were comparable to other <b>natural</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

The main {{aim was to}} gain fundamental knowledge of the drivers behind the processes of the denitrification (i. e. nitrogen removal) in constructed wetlands, hence, the structure and function of the denitrifying bacterial community as efficient nitrogen removal in wetlands will decrease the risk of eutrophication of freshwaters and oceans. Programmes for restoring and recreating wetlands in agricultural areas have been initiated throughout the world. Aquatic environments in these areas are also exposed to pollution from e. g. pesticides, in fact, wetland are also constructed {{with the purpose of}} reducing transport of pesticides. However, little is known whether the wetland may fulfil both purposes simultaneously. Hence, may constructed wetlands maintain a high denitrification efficiency even during pesticide exposure? Both structure and function of the eubacterial and the denitrifying bacterial communities were analysed, but focus has been put on the denitrifying bacteria. Structural endpoints of the bacterial communities, as diversity and heterogeneity were analysed using molecular fingerprinting. Potential denitrification and leucine incorporation (i. e. bacterial growth) were measured as functional endpoints, when assessing the effects of pesticide exposure on constructed wetland bacterial communities. These structural and functional endpoints were measured without any treatments as well as measured after pesticide exposure. The results showed that structural endpoints of eubacterial (16 S rRNA gene) and denitrifying bacterial community (nirK, nirS and nosZ) varied between the studied constructed wetlands, and their communities were influenced by environmental parameters. The enzyme gene nirS showed higher community heterogeneity than both nirK and nosZ, while the enzyme gene nirK had the highest diversity based on structure and richness. Exposure to environmental concentrations of pesticides affected structure (16 S rRNA gene but not nosZ) and function (potential denitrification rate) of the constructed wetland bacterial community, however there were few indications of direct toxic effects. Using leucine incorporation as an endpoint of bacterial activity and growth community was a quicker and more sensitive method to detect toxicity of fungicides exposure on bacterial communities than measuring potential denitrification, and clear concentration-response relationships were easily generated that could be standardized for community level risk assessments of pesticide exposure to aquatic environments...|$|R
