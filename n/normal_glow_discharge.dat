40|$|Abstract- The {{majority}} of industrial plasma processing is conducted with glow discharges at pressures below 10 torr.

It has long been recognized that glow discharges would play a much larger industrial role if they could be generated at one atmosphere, and in ambient air. The One Atmosphere Uniform Glow Discharge Plasma (OAUGDP) has these capabilities.

Voltage drop at the discharge gap has been calculated as a sum of incidences in the cathode sheath and on the positive column of a <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> {{as part of the}} semi-empirical approach.

The calculated voltage drop, depending on the pressure, has been compared with the results of another numerical discharge model based on the solutions of hydrodynamic equations for the particle densities in a two-dimensional case. Within these approximations, both models give satisfactory agreement between their results, which are strongly underestimated against the experiment corresponding to the <b>normal</b> highpressure <b>glow</b> <b>discharge.</b> The resulting discrepancy can be explained by an incompleteness of elementary processes taken into account in the simulation.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents the experimental and theoretical studies of nonthermal and stable atmospheric-pressure <b>glow</b> <b>discharges.</b> With the excitation frequency in the kilohertz range, a uniform and stable <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> has been successfully produced in atmospheric helium without the usually indispensable dielectric barrier. For this barrier-free cold atmospheric discharge, there are two discharge events occurring, respectively, in the voltage-rising and the voltage-falling phases, and in general they compete with each other. This distinct feature is illustrated through a detailed fluid simulation. For direct current atmospheric <b>glow</b> <b>discharges,</b> their cathode fall region is shown to depend critically on the discharge current density. For atmospheric <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> excited at 13. 56 MHz on the other hand, we present observations that after gas breakdown, the discharge evolves from the <b>normal</b> <b>glow</b> mode to the abnormal glow mode and then through the recovery mode back to the <b>normal</b> <b>glow</b> mode. The operation modes, namely the a mode and the y mode, in radio-frequency atmospheric <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> are investigated with a one-dimensional, self-consistent continuum model. This model is evaluated by comparing our numerical results with experimental data and other simulation results in literature. It is shown that gas ionization is volumetric in the a mode and localized in the boundary region between the sheath and the bulk plasma in the y mode. The stable operation regime in the a mode is {{found to have a}} positive differential conductivity, and can be expanded to higher discharge current density without compensating plasma reactivity by increasing the excitation frequency. Furthermore this plasma stability-reactivity balance is also studied for radio-frequency atmospheric glow microdischarges...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for {{measuring}} work function of practical fluorescent lamp electrodes with emissive oxides. The work function measurement is based on the matching between the zero-field thermionic emission currents and various dc lamp currents set in a <b>normal</b> <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> by means of a lamp voltage monitoring procedure with an electrode-heating device for thermionic emission measurement. Measuring the work function of practical fluorescent lamp electrodes is a promising approach because changes that occur in the work function of aged-lamp electrodes in some lighting systems will be helpful in evaluating the system. The paper points out the doubtful approach of taking a rather small value of the Richardson constant. To solve this issue, a temperature-dependent work function is introduced. In the first stage of the paper, the Richardson constant is taken as the theoretical value. As a result, work function φ[eV] of a fluorescent lamp electrode halfway through its lamp life was measured and given as : φ= 0. 80 + 1. 36 × 10 ^ T (computed from equation with T^ 2) where T was the electrode temperature [K].

Of the reported numerical studies of atmospheric glow discharges, most are based on the hydrodynamic approximation in which electrons are assumed to be in equilibrium with the local electric field. Spectroscopic and electrical measurements suggest however that the cathode fall region is fundamentally nonequilibrium. To this end we consider a hybrid model that treats the cathode fall region kinetically but retains a hydrodynamic description for the region between the thin cathode fall layer and the anode.

In this work two aspects of the Microscale Plasma Device development were investigated; (1) the microplasma properties and (2) the manufacturing of the MPD. To study the required plasma discharges and develop them to become better suited for the task at hand, Direct Current (DC) plasma discharge characteristics were investigated under pressures from atmospheric to 1. 65 MPa while varying current from 0. 1 mA to 4. 5 mA and gap length from 5 ?m up to 250 ?m. This testing was carried out in a high pressure test chamber fitted with a micrometer for variable electrode spacing and gas inlets and outlets for varying the working gas and pressure. Voltage and current measurements along with microscopic imaging and optical emission spectroscopy were taken for discharges in the varying gases to determine discharge V-I characteristics, sizes and temperatures. Data gathered was used to understand the microdischarge characteristics and tailor the plasma for application in the microtransistor. Discharges with diameters as small as 7 ?m have been achieved in Nitrogen and 16. 7 ?m in Helium by operating at low current, 0. 5 mA, and at pressures of 1. 65 MPa and 0. 34 MPa respectively. Paschen type, Pd, scaling is observed both in breakdown voltages, steady state voltage, and discharge size from 0. 1 MPa to 1. 65 MPa.

During device development small diameter metal wires, 25 ?m and 50 ?m, were used to carry out experiments on the microscale device to aid in electrode and substrate material selection. Robust electrode and substrate materials were required to withstand high discharge temperatures in order to prolong the device life time.

40|$|Polycrystalline {{tungsten}} {{was exposed}} to deuterium <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> followed by He, Ne or Ar <b>glow</b> <b>discharge.</b> The amount of retained deuterium in the tungsten was measured using residual gas analysis. The amount of desorbed deuterium during the inert gas <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> was also measured. The amount of retained deuterium was 2 - 3 times larger compared with a case of stainless steel. The ratios of desorbed amount of deuterium by He, Ne and Ar <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> were 4. 6, 3. 1 and 2. 9 %, respectively. These values were one order of magnitude smaller compared with the case of stainless steel. The inert gas <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> is not suitable to reduce the fuel hydrogen retention for tungsten walls. However, the wall baking with a temperature higher than 700 K is suitable to reduce the fuel hydrogen retention. It is also shown {{that the use of}} deuterium <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> is effective to reduce the in-vessel tritium inventory in fusion reactors through the hydrogen isotope exchange...|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} radiant {{output of}} an ordinary <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> plasma was increased by several factors through secondary inductively coupled RF excitation produced by an external coil and a 136. 2 MHz oscillator. The gain factor was determined at several <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> currents and voltages in copper alloys and cast iron samples. Improved linear calibration curves were obtained because the RF-boosted <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> source decreased the effect of self-absorption. © 1981. Articl...|$|R
40|$|A <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> {{has been}} {{experimentally}} investigated in air at atmospheric pressure using two different electrode configurations of a perforated aluminium sheet {{and stainless steel}} wire mesh. The observations of the Lissajous figure of voltage-electric charges {{is used as a}} method of distinguishing between the <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> produced by perforated aluminium sheet and stainless steel wire mesh. The perforated material shows a better <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> stabilization than that of stainless steel wire mesh...|$|R
