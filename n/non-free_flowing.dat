40|$|The actual {{tendency}} {{all over}} the world is to manufacture fuel bundles capable to resist high burn-up. The main factors affecting the burn-up increase are: the pellet-cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI), the oxidation and hydriding of the Zircaloy- 4 sheath, the increase of internal pressure, stress corrosion cracking, Zircaloy- 4 irradiation growth, fuel swelling. A way to increase fuel burn-up is to diminish the elements internal pressure by an adequate large grain UO 2 fuel pellet structure. In the large grain size UO 2 pellets, fission gas release rate decreases and the elements internal pressure increase slowly. One of the ways to increase pellets grain size without increasing sintering temperature and time is the addition of small quantities (< 1 % wt M/U) of sintering additives. By the addition of certain dopants in the UO 2 powder (TiO 2, Nb 2 O 5, Cr 2 O 3, CaO, V 2 O 5,) the grain size, the porosity and the mean free diffusion path are increased, whereas the grain boundary area is reduced. At the Institute for Nuclear Research (ICN) - Pitesti a project for obtaining large grains size UO 2 pellets using dopants was developed. Two UO 2 <b>non-free</b> <b>flowing</b> powders, manufactured by ADU and IDR routes, were mixed with dopants (TiO 2, Nb 2 O 5, Cr 2 O 3), content of metals being 0. 05 - 1 % wt M/U. The green pellets obtained by pressing UO 2 powders were directly sintered (4 hours at 1700 °C) in a sintering furnace...|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} recognition among travelers, transportation professionals, and decision {{makers of the}} importance of the reliability of transportation facilities. An important step towards improving system reliability is developing methods that can be used in practice to predict freeway travel times for the near future (e. g. 5 – 15 minutes). Reliable and accurate predictions of future travel times can be used by travelers to make better decisions and by system operators to engage in pre-active rather than reactive system management. Recent advances in wireless communications and the proliferation of personal devices that communicate wirelessly using the Bluetooth protocol have resulted in the development of a Bluetooth traffic monitoring system. This system is becoming increasingly popular for collecting vehicle travel time data in real-time, mainly because it has the following advantages over other technologies: (1) measuring travel time directly; (2) anonymous detection; (3) weatherproof; and (4) cost-effectiveness. The data collected from Bluetooth detectors are similar to data collected from Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) systems using dedicated transponders (e. g. such as electronic toll tags), and therefore using these data for travel time prediction faces some of the same challenges as using AVI measurements, namely: (1) determining the optimal spacing between detectors; (2) dynamic outlier detection and travel time estimation must be able to respond quickly to rapid travel time changes; and (3) a time lag exists between the time when vehicles enter the segment and the time that their travel time can be measured (i. e. when the vehicle exits the monitored segment). In this thesis, a generalized model was proposed to determine the optimal average spacing of Bluetooth detector deployments on urban freeways as a function of the length of the route for which travel times are to be estimated; a traffic flow filtering model was proposed to be applied as an enhancement to existing data-driven outlier detection algorithms as a mechanism to improve outlier detection performance; a short-term prediction model combining outlier filtering algorithm with Kalman filter was proposed for predicting near future freeway travel times using Bluetooth data with special attention to the time lag problem. The results of this thesis indicate that the optimal detector spacing ranges from 2 km for routes of 4 km in length to 5 km for routes of 20 km in length; the proposed filtering model is able to solve the problem of tracking sudden changes in travel times and enhance the performance of the data-driven outlier detection algorithms; the proposed short-term prediction model significantly improves the accuracy of travel time prediction for 5, 10 and 15 minutes prediction horizon under both free <b>flow</b> and <b>non-free</b> <b>flow</b> traffic states. The mean absolute relative errors (MARE) are improved by 8. 8 % to 30. 6 % under free flow traffic conditions, and 7. 5 % to 49. 9 % under <b>non-free</b> <b>flow</b> traffic conditions. The 90 th percentile errors and standard deviation of the prediction errors are also improved...|$|R
40|$|In {{road traffic}} noise issues, {{experimental}} measurements are a relevant element {{in order to}} understand the problem and to adjust models. Sometimes, when measurements are not possible or in the designing phase, prediction models are used to perform an estimation of the equivalent level produced by a road infrastructure. Usually models parameters are obtained by a statistical data fit and thus they are related to the area where measurements have been performed. These models are suitable for standard conditions, but they generally fail when vehicle speed distribution influence cannot be neglected, such as <b>non-free</b> <b>flow</b> traffic, traffic jams, etc. Thus, the possibility to perform a road traffic noise prediction by means of energy based stochastic approach represents a challenge in the noise control issues. The equivalent level, in fact, depends on the acoustical energy emitted by each vehicle, which may be directly connected to its speed by some experimental relations. In this paper, the authors present a new approach in which the speed of each vehicle is randomly generated according to specific speed distributions. The different distributions are chosen according to the contextual traffic situation (free flow, pulsed accelerated flow, intersection, mixed flow composition, etc.), resulting in a detailed microscopic description of the phenomenon, based on a stochastic core model. Once the speed is generated according to the given distribution, the global level is obtained collecting all the energies sent to the receiver by each source. The results of this procedure are compared with experimental measurements...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Accurate freeway {{travel time}} {{estimation}} is of increasing {{importance for the}} travelers’ information and route guidance system. A non-parametric statistical methodology known as regression trees is deployed in this research for dynamically and accurately estimating freeway travel times for the I 5 -I 205 loop in the Portland Metro area of Oregon using speed as a proxy. In the absence of historical travel time data on PORTAL (Portland Oregon Regional Transportation Archive Listing), which {{is the source of}} data collection in this research, regression tree models are built to predict speeds first and the predicted speeds are in turn used to estimate travel times by mid-point algorithm. The regression tree models in this research are built based on historical data sets, including not only the traffic flow data but also the incident related data, weather data and time of day. This ensures the models will maintain stable prediction ability under both free <b>flow</b> conditions and <b>non-free</b> <b>flow</b> conditions on freeways. Model construction and validation are implemented in the statistical software package S-PLUS. A full regression tree model is constructed on one test data set including 227 daily test data sets randomly selected from the total of 342 daily test data sets collected in the entire year of 2005. To determine what kind of regression tree model should be selected to predict speed or estimate travel time for a certain day under dynamic conditions, a characterization approach is deployed and four characterization standards are setup to track the characteristics of both test data sets and validation data sets. Two experimental designs are constructed to evaluate and compare the performances of eleven regression tree models ─ the full regression tree model and the ten characterization regression tree models. The results show that these eleven tree models possess the ability to accurately predict speeds or estimate travel times. In addition, meaningful results are obtained showing which of these eleven tree models are best to choose for dynamically estimating travel times for a future day...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{fluidization}} of three types of TiO 2 powders: Anatase (99 % TiO 2), Rutile 1 (95 % TiO 2 and 5 % Al) and Rutile 2 (96. 5 % TiO 2 and 3. 5 % Al and Si); the average diameters of the powders are 204 nm, 159 nm and 167 nm, respectively. These powders belong to group C of the Geldart classification and are characterized as cohesive powders with a <b>non-free</b> <b>flow</b> and a difficult fluidization. The fluidization of the powders {{was carried out in}} a glass column of 103 mm inner diameter and 1500 mm height. The experiments and analysis performed included measurements of the physical properties of the powders such as the particle size, density, specific surface area and the flow properties of the powders like the Hausner's index, the angle of repose, the angle of slide, consolidation and shearing (via shear cell testing). The results obtained with the nanometric TiO 2 powders show a more complex behavior than the micronic powders; with a low strength value (Hausner index, angle of repose and angle of slide), the TiO 2 powders have a free flow or intermediate-flow and a non-free-flow for higher strength intensities (consolidation and shearing). This behavior is related to the structure of the nanometric particles in the packed bed; the evolution of this structure is made up of individualized and spherical agglomerate shapes and is not perturbed by stresses of low intensities. Indeed, the latter seems to modify the structure of the powder (group C of Geldart classification) to acquire a behavior typical of group A, B or D in the Geldart classification. With high stress values, the individualized agglomerates are disintegrated and the powder is reduced to a more compact structure. The fluidization of TiO 2 powders seems to evolve in a more homogeneous way than the micronic powders. This behavior is related to the initial structure being made up of stable agglomerates. Thus, this fluidization is made by agglomerates with a gas velocity of 3 × 10 (6) to 4. 6 × 10 (6) times the gas velocity for fluidizing the primary particles. A numerical approach based on a force balance in agglomerating fluidized beds was developed in order to estimate the agglomerates sizes...|$|R
