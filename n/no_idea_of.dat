5|$|In 1986, Bernd Eichinger of Constantin Film {{acquired}} the film {{rights of the}} Fantastic Four from Marvel Comics. In 1992, Eichinger hired Roger Corman to produce a low-budget film {{in order to keep}} the rights. In 1994, the adaptation, titled The Fantastic Four, had its trailer released to theaters, and its cast and director went on a promotional tour, however the film was not officially released. The film was accused of being an ashcan copy, meaning it was only made to keep the license. Stan Lee and Eichinger stated that the actors had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the situation, instead believing they were creating a proper release. Marvel Comics paid in exchange for the film's negative, so 20th Century Fox could go ahead with the big-budget adaptation. While the film was never released to theaters and home-video, it was released by bootleg video distributors.|$|E
5|$|Shazly {{then went}} southward to 7th Division's {{bridgehead}} in Third Army's sector, where traffic was almost at a standstill. Shazly met with 7th division commander Brigadier General Badawy, who informed {{him of the}} bridge-laying problems experienced by 19th Division's engineers further south, leading all Third Army supplies and reinforcements to be sent over 7th Division's already congested bridges, creating a solid traffic jam. Despite Sunday's lull, the situation had not yet improved. This created complications, as soldiers and tank crews lost contact with their units and consequently had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> their designated positions. Many troops were low on supplies, and some even returned {{to the west bank}} of the canal to replenish their food and water supply.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{knew that}} Ott {{had no way}} out from Alessandria, but he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Melas's position. Following his meeting with the spy and fearing that the Austrian general might try to escape, Bonaparte spread his army out in a wide net by sending Louis Desaix with Divisional General Jean Boudet's {{division}} (6,000 men) south to Novi Ligure and Divisional General Jean François Cornu de La Poype (3,500 men) north on the other bank of the Po. Further north, from Vercelli to Lake Maggiore, were stationed the divisions of Antoine de Béthencourt and Joseph Chabran and, further to the rear, north of Piacenza, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge's division. Bonaparte's view was confirmed when General Claude Victor-Perrin, supported by Divisional General Joachim Murat’s cavalry, swiftly evicted FML Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough’s Austrian brigade from Marengo village that afternoon. Victor then deployed divisional generals Gaspard Amédée Gardanne and Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin's divisions along the Fontanone stream. Austrian headquarters debated building a bridge to the north to outflank the French, {{but the lack of}} pontoons and time forced the Austrians to cross the river Bormida and then launch a single, direct assault across the Fontanone bridge.|$|E

60|$|There {{is not a}} meaner {{occupation}} for {{the human}} mind than the imitation of the stains and striæ of marble and wood. When engaged in any easy and simple mechanical occupation, {{there is still some}} liberty for the mind to leave the literal work; and the clash of the loom or the activity of the fingers will not always prevent the thoughts from some happy expatiation in their own domains. But the grainer must think of what he is doing; and veritable attention and care, and occasionally considerable skill, are consumed in the doing of a more absolute nothing than I can name in any other department of painful idleness. I know not anything so humiliating as to see a human being, with arms and limbs complete, and apparently a head, and assuredly a soul, yet into the hands of which when you have put a brush and pallet, it cannot do anything with them but imitate a piece of wood. It cannot color, it has <b>no</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> color; it cannot draw, it has <b>no</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> form; it cannot caricature, it has <b>no</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> humor. It is incapable of anything beyond knots. All its achievement, the entire result of the daily application of its imagination and immortality, is to be such a piece of texture as the sun and dew are sucking up out of the muddy ground, and weaving together, far more finely, in millions of millions of growing branches, over every rood of waste woodland and shady hill.|$|R
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|The couple moved {{repeatedly}} {{over the}} following year – first to Laguna Beach, California, then to Santa Catalina Island, California, New York City, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard's first wife's home at South Colby, Washington. Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce {{on the grounds of}} desertion and non-support, and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Northrup, let alone that he had married her. The arrival of Hubbard and Northrup three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard's family, who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly. Northrup had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Hubbard's first marriage or why people were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her that his parents were still married. She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard caught up with her and convinced her to stay, saying {{that he was in the}} process of getting a divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Northrup was legal. The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947, where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines.|$|E
5|$|Both Task Forces {{needed to}} refuel, but TF 17 {{finished}} first and Fletcher took Yorktown and her consorts northward toward the Solomon Islands on 2 May. TF 11 {{was ordered to}} rendezvous with TF 17 and TF 44, the old ANZAC Squadron, further west into the Coral Sea on 4 May. The Japanese opened Operation Mo by occupying Tulagi on 3 May. Alerted by Allied reconnaissance aircraft, Fletcher decided to attack Japanese shipping there the following day. The air strike on Tulagi confirmed {{that at least one}} American carrier was in the vicinity, but the Japanese had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> its location. They launched a number of reconnaissance aircraft the following day to search for the Americans, but without result. One H6K flying boat spotted Yorktown, but was shot down by one of Yorktowns Wildcat fighters before she could radio a report. US Army Air Force (USAAF) aircraft spotted Shōhō southwest of Bougainville Island on 5 May, but she was too far north to be attacked by the American carriers, which were refueling. That day, Fletcher received Ultra intelligence that placed the three Japanese carriers known to be involved in Operation Mo near Bougainville Island, and predicted 10 May as the date of the invasion. It also predicted airstrikes by the Japanese carriers in support of the invasion several days before 10 May. Based on this information, Fletcher planned to complete refueling on 6 May and to move closer to the eastern tip of New Guinea {{to be in a position}} to locate and attack Japanese forces on 7 May.|$|E

25|$|This {{model of}} a secularist state protects the {{religious}} institutions from state interference, but with public religious expression to some extent frowned upon. This aims {{to protect the public}} power from the influences of religious institutions, especially in public office.

The above considerations are certainly highly speculative, but not so speculative as those contained in van Gulick’s paper in topochemistry [28], outlining applications currently not achievable at that time, but later demonstrated to be possible.|$|R

25|$|Series 1 {{featured}} Bodger and Badger {{working in}} Troff's Nosherama, a run-down café with pretensions {{to being a}} restaurant. While Bodger worked in the kitchens as a chef, both he and Badger made friends with the waitress, Mavis. Troff's Nosherama was run by Mr Troff who was very arrogant, tight-fisted and didn't like to admit when he was wrong. Troff had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Badger's presence {{until the end of}} the last episode in the series.|$|E

Stanley Cavell notes Regan's characteristic relish building upon and outdoing others' evils: [...] "She has <b>no</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> her own, her special vileness is always to increase the measure of pain that others are prepared to inflict; her mind itself is a lynch mob" [...] (291).|$|R

25|$|Robespierre visited Marie-Thérèse on 11 May, but no one, {{according}} to the legend, entered the dauphin's room for six months until Barras visited the prison after the 9th Thermidor (27 July 1794). Barras's account of the visit describes the child as suffering from extreme neglect, but conveys <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the alleged walling in. It is nevertheless certain that {{during the first half}} of 1794 Louis-Charles was very strictly secluded; he had no special guardian, but was under the charge of guards who changed from day to day.|$|E
25|$|Under cross examination, Montagnier {{stated that}} it is {{possible}} to preserve the virus and then reactivate it if it has been held in plasma. It could be kept active for several days, depending on how it is stored. He testified that he was not aware of the existence of the technical capacity in Libya for monitoring this kind of storage, either during the epidemic or currently. Montagnier testified that during his first visit, the health authorities in Libya and the management of the Benghazi hospital showed serious concern over the infection, and that at the time they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the cause of the epidemic's spread.|$|E
25|$|Robertson told ministers (30 May) that “Haig had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{any attempt}} {{to break through the}} German lines. It would only be a move to (rescue) the French”, {{although}} he was probably not aware of Haig’s insistence, overruling Rawlinson’s earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and “fighting the enemy in the open”. Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig “does not mean to knock his head against a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition he means to stop and consolidate and try somewhere else”.|$|E
60|$|I {{have all}} along, hitherto, in the warfare of life, been bred to arms among the light horse--the piquet-guards of fancy; {{a kind of}} hussars and Highlanders of the brain; but I am firmly {{resolved}} to sell out of these giddy battalions, who have <b>no</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> a battle but fighting the foe, or of a siege but storming the town.

25|$|The main {{theological}} {{issue in}} these texts {{is that of}} the consequences of the Fall of Man, of which sickness and death are mentioned. Other themes include the exaltation of Adam in the Garden, the fall of Satan, the anointing with the oil of the Tree of Life, and a combination of majesty and anthropomorphism in the figure of God, involving numerous merkabahs and other details that show a relationship with 2 Enoch. While the idea of resurrection of the dead is present, there is <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Messianism, a fact that lends strong support to the theory of a Jewish origin. The Life of Adam and Eve is also important {{in the study of the}} early Seth traditions.|$|E
25|$|Soult marched {{south on}} 30 January 1809, aiming for Portugal. After being {{repelled}} in his initial attempt {{to cross the}} Minho River in mid-February, his forces marched to Ourense and crossed the bridge there. Soult's cavalry crushed a Spanish brigade at La Trepa on 6 March and the II Corps entered Portugal on the 9th. At the Battle of Braga on 20 March, the French routed a Portuguese army consisting of a few regulars and 22,000 militia. The First Battle of Porto on the 29th was another lopsided French victory marked by terrible Portuguese loss of life. But despite being established in Porto, Soult found his communications cut by regular and irregular Portuguese forces under General Francisco Silveira and he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the whereabouts of Lapisse.|$|E
25|$|Nolte {{argued that}} the vast {{majority}} of Germans had no knowledge of the 'Holocaust while it was happening Nolte claimed that the genocide of the Jews was Hitler’s personal pet project, and that the Holocaust was the work of only a few Germans who were entirely unrepresentative of German society Contradicting the American historian Raul Hilberg, who claimed that hundreds of thousands of Germans were complicit in the Holocaust, from high-ranking bureaucrats to railway clerks and locomotive conductors, Nolte {{argued that the}} functional division of labour in modern society meant that most people in Germany had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how they were assisting in genocide. In support of this, Nolte cited the voluminous memoirs of German generals and Nazi leaders, such as Albert Speer, who claimed to have no idea that their country was engaging in genocide during World War II.|$|E

60|$|Suppose {{that there}} were no such things as {{impressions}} of sight and touch anywhere in the universe, what idea could we have even of a straight line, much less of a triangle and of the relations between its sides?

But what we mean by the universe is the sum of our actual and possible impressions.|$|R
