40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{gelation}} properties of liquid whey protein concentrates (LWPC) produced by ultrafiltration (UF) as raw material for thermally induced gels intended for food applications. LWPC thermal gelation was performed using different types of LWPC (<b>non-defatted,</b> defatted and diafiltered) of different protein mass fractions and pH. Most of the produced gels showed viscoelastic behaviour. <b>Non-defatted</b> LWPC gave stronger heat-induced gels with a more cohesive microstructure, a higher water holding capacity and also higher elastic modulus (G’) and viscous modulus (G’’). Gel properties were not improved in products with lower content of non-protein compounds. As expected, the increase in protein mass fraction positively influences protein interactions. However, the pH {{is responsible for the}} equilibrium between attraction and repulsion forces in the gel components that influence gel hardness and water holding capacity...|$|E

Seeds of flax are the richest source of alpha-linolenic acid, lignans and other nutritional components. Flaxseed oil contains interesting bioactive compounds other than the fats [2]. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the total polyphenol content (TPC), free radical scavenging activity, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in extracts from defatted and <b>non-defatted</b> flax seeds.

40|$|The {{versatility}} of ICP-MS {{in marine}} analytical chemistry is illustrated with applications to the multielement trace analysis of two recently released marine reference materials, the coastal seawater CASS- 2 and the <b>non-defatted</b> lobster hepatopancreas tissue LUTS- 1, {{and to the}} determination of tributyltin and dibutyltin in the harbour sediment reference material PACS- 1 by HPLC-ICP-MS. Seawater analyses were performed after separation of the trace elements either by adsorption on immobilized 8 -hydroxy-quinoline or by reductive coprecipitation with iron and palladium. Simultaneous determination of seven trace elements in LUTS- 1, including mercury, by isotope dilution ICP-MS, was achieved after dissolution by microwave digestion with nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Butyltin species in PACS- 1 were separated by cation exchange HPLC of an extract of the sediment; method detection limits for tributyltin and dibutyltin in sediment samples {{are estimated to be}} 5 ng Sn/g and 12 ng Sn/g, respectively. © 1990 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Results from {{different}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) {{for the detection}} of peanut protein in food lack of comparability due to different measurands, extraction procedures, antibodies, detection systems, and calibrants. Therefore, a feasibility study on suitable quality control material (QCM) was conducted. A peanut powder and a <b>non-defatted</b> peanut homogenate were produced, and the materials properties including homogeneity and stability were assessed. Additionally, the influence of the extraction buffer on the protein yield and composition was investigated. A set of methods was applied including two ELISAs, SDS-PAGE, a "total soluble protein" assay, a "total fat" method, and a photometric assay to detect fat oxidation. Both preparations were sufficiently homogeneous for the intended use, and storage at 40 °C for up to 3 months did not reveal any material degradation. The extraction buffer influences the protein yield, but not the composition of the extracted proteins. The results constitute an important step towards the development op a peanut protein QCM. JRC.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of certified rapeseed reference {{materials and the}} steps taken to establish the certified values for total glucosinolate contents are described. Details are given of the studies to demonstrate the homogeneity and stability of the material. The results of the certification exercise for total glucosinolate content, which involved European laboratories who applied {{a variety of methods}} (high-pressure liquid chromatography, gas liquid chromatography, determination of enzymatically released glucose and sulphate), are presented and discussed. The certified values for the glucosinolate content (mumol/g of <b>non-defatted</b> whole seeds) and the 95 % confidence level are the following: CRM 366 (12. 1 +/- 0. 8 mumol/g), CRM 190 (25. 5 +/- 0. 9 mumol/g) and CRM 367 (102. 4 +/- 3 mumol/g) (CRM = certified reference material).

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of drugs bind to human serum albumin (HSA) at its two {{principal}} sites, namely site I and site II. A number of reports indicate that drug binding to these two binding sites are not completely independent, and that interactions between ligands of these two discrete sites can play a role. In this study, {{the effect of the}} binding of long-chain fatty acids on the interactive binding between dansyl-L-asparagine (DNSA; site I ligand) and ibuprofen (site II ligand) at pH 6. 5 was examined. Binding experiments showed that the binding of sodium oleate (Ole) to HSA induces conformational changes in the molecule, which, in turn, changes the individual binding of DNSA and ibuprofen, as well as the mode of interaction between these two ligands from a 'competitive-like' allosteric interaction {{in the case of the}} defatted HSA conformer to a 'nearly independent' binding in the case of <b>non-defatted</b> HSA conformer. Circular dichroism measurements indicated that ibuprofen and Ole are likely to modify the spatial orientation of DNSA at its binding site. Docking simulations suggest that the long-distance electric repulsion between DNSA and ibuprofen on defatted HSA contributes to a 'competitive-like' allosteric interaction, whereas extending the distance between ligands and/or increasing the flexibility or size of the DNSA binding site in fatted HSA evokes a change in the interaction mode to 'nearly independent' binding. The present findings provide further insights into the structural dynamics of HSA upon the binding of fatty acids, and its effects on drug binding and drug-drug interactions that occur on HSA...|$|E
40|$|Identification and {{characterization}} of {{both black and}} white sesame seed proteins were investigated using biochemical and IgE-binding techniques. Extracts were made from both <b>non-defatted</b> and defatted seeds using both phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7. 4) and deionized water (D-H 2 O). Extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by IgE-immunoblotting, and radioallergosorbent assay (RAST) with sera from sesame seed-allergic subjects. The SDS-PAGE results revealed differences in the extractable proteins obtained from each extract. Sesame seed extracts contained several proteins (13 – 26) with molecular weights in the range of 6. 5 – 151 kD. Immunoblotting studies demonstrated the presence of several IgE-binding proteins with estimated molecular weights in the range of 6. 5 to 87 kD, and IgE-binding patterns and RAST results differed between extracts for each sesame seed-allergic subject. ^ Polyclonal antibodies against the mixture of one part black and three parts of white sesame seeds were produced in goats, sheep, rabbits, and chickens. Antibodies were purified from the animal antisera and egg yolk. The immune response of each animal was monitored using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The sheep, goats, and chickens generated good immune responses to the sesame seed immunogen, while rabbits gave a weaker immune response to the immunogen. ^ A sandwich ELISA was developed using the goat serum and chicken egg yolk antibodies for quantification of sesame seed residues in foods with a detection limit of 2 ppm sesame seed flour. Goat IgG and chicken egg yolk IgY antibodies were used as capture and detector antibodies, respectively. Binding was visualized by addition of commercial goat anti-chicken IgY-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and subsequent substrate addition. Validation of the assay included testing pasta containing different known amounts of sesame seed flour (0 - 100 ppm), positive and negative samples, and cross-reactivity assessment. Minimal cross-reactivity was observed with allspice and kidney beans. A limited retail survey and positive samples demonstrated that the assay produced statistically consistent results (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to observe the impact of adding 30 % of flour from soya bean to the wheat flour T 650 on the quality of {{immediately}} baked products and products stored one, three and six months in a freezer at the temperature of - 18 ° and then baked. Rheological properties of wheat and composite flour by means of Farinograph, Extensograph, and Amylograph were also evaluated. Based on the farinograph evaluation of composite flour (70 % of wheat flour + 30 % soybean flour) it was found that the formed mixture was hydrated more slowly than the pure wheat flour, time of dough development was about 6. 5 minutes longer than that for pure wheat flour, and a value of water binding was higher by 12. 4 % compared with wheat flour. Created dough could be characterized as strong, holding long enough optimum of its rheological properties. By means of extensographic evaluation of composite flour it was found that it has lower extensographic energy, less resistance and lower tensibility compared to wheat dough, which led to insufficient volume of products. By amylogram it was found that composite flour has higher enzymatic activity compared to wheat flour, nevertheless both flours could be characterized as suitable for leavened bakery products. Addition of gross <b>non-defatted</b> soy flour at 30 % had a significant impact on technological quality of loaves baked during the baking experiments. Compared with loaves of wheat flour, the lower bread volume, specific volume and volume yield, and less satisfactory cambering was found. The effect of freezing on dough in the case of wheat flour showed the gradual reduction of the quality parameters of the loaves baked from such dough after freezing time lasting for 1, 3 and 6 months. In the case of the composite flour, the decrease of quality was found only after freezing lasting 3 and 6 months. One-month freeze did not cause the declination of quality, to the contrary, even a slight increase of loaf volume was observed...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation {{of novel}} and genetically {{modified}} (GM) foods for consumption {{is critical to}} regulatory review processes globally for potential risks of food allergy or toxicity {{as well as for}} marked changes in nutrients. So far the current evaluation process has proven to be adequate in identifying potential risk. However, assessing safety may be difficult in the future as complex genetically engineered products are continually produced. There are also very few methods available for fully evaluating whole foods. It is therefore necessary to consider improved methodologies and strategies to ensure that the present level of safety of GM-derived and novel foods are maintained. The goal {{of this study was to}} employ various techniques suggested in the risk assessment protocol to assess the safety of foods. Different heme (six) and Rubisco (four) proteins intended to be used in a GM food product were evaluated for potential risks of toxicity and allergenicity. Bioinformatics analyses comparing amino acid sequences of these proteins to known allergens and toxins on well curated databases such as AllergenOnline. org and the IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Database revealed that the proteins had low sequence identities to known allergens and toxins suggesting there is no evidence for their safety concern. ^ Further by using, a murine model of sensitization and elicitation together with a basophil mediator release assay, we assessed whether the food matrix (lipids) as well as processing may have an effect on peanut allergenicity. No significant differences were observed when defatted and <b>non-defatted</b> raw or roasted peanut extracts were used to sensitize and elicit an allergic immune response in the mouse model. Also, the different processing methods, boiling, dry roasting and Ghana roasting compared to raw peanuts did not show a significant effect on peanut allergenicity in the mouse model. Thus, this study was not able to explain the differences in prevalence rates of peanut allergy in different parts of the world where different forms of processed peanuts are consumed. The mouse model and mediator release assays showed similar results suggesting that additional proteins and foods may need to be tested in the mouse model and compared to human studies. ...|$|E
40|$|Electrostatic {{separation}} was {{studied in}} a city fractionation diagram to obtain beta-glucan-enriched fractions from oat bran preparations. Ultra-fine grinding at ambient or cryogenic temperature was needed to achieve good dissociation between the macronutrients of oat bran particles. Particles rich in beta-glucan and starch were by electrostatic separation separated from particles rich in arabinoxylan. beta-Glucan was only little enriched in the <b>non-defatted</b> bran fractions from 19. 6 to 25. 0 %. In contrast preliminary defatting by super critical carbon dioxide significantly improved the dissociation of particles during grinding and allowed enrichment of beta-glucan to 42. 2 or 48. 4 % after one or two successive electrostatic separation steps. The twice separated positive fraction, containing 48. 4 % beta-glucan, was further fractionated {{by a combination of}} jet-milling and air classification, yielding up to 56. 2 % beta-glucan concentration. The results point out the good potential of using electrostatic separation as a bran-fractionation method to produce nutritionally interesting food ingredients. Industrial relevance: Oat beta-glucan has a widely accepted health claim related to cholesterol lowering, and has a great industrial applicability in functional foods and nutraceuticals. The high concentrations of beta-glucan obtained with defatted material are of major interest from an industrial point of view, since this kind of ingredients can be used in applications where normal oat bran preparations cannot provide beta-glucan at high enough concentration. In addition, the obtained beta-glucan fractions retained their original molecular weight The high beta-glucan fractions had an appealing white colour and were well solubilised in hot water and in 0. 1 M NaOH compared to their low beta-glucan counter-fractions. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction is a relatively costly method due to the long processing time (several hours per batch), but there are existing factories offering contract manufacturing. Lipid extraction and fractionation process can be economically feasible, especially when the fractions obtained are used in high-value applications. Ultra-fine grinding and electrostatic separation are energy intensive methods, but they enable enrichment of components without any liquids or solvents. These methods can be used to produce unique fractions which are not possible to obtain with conventional fractionation methods such as sieving and air classification...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{based on}} the application of pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) was employed to recover the major Amaranthus spp. flavonoid glycoside rutin from dried ground plant leaves. A central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize rutin extraction; three factors were considered: extraction solvent (water/ethanol ratio, from 0 / 100 to 100 / 0), extraction time (from 5 to 20 min) and extraction temperature (from 50 to 200 °C). Optimization of the three extraction parameters revealed that water/ethanol ratio in the solvent mixture was the most-significant factor influencing rutin yield, followed by extraction temperature. The total rutin recovery varied from 6. 95 to 14. 03 g/kg dry matter (DM) depending on the experimental conditions tested. The optimum extraction conditions for the highest rutin content were 70 / 30 (v/v) water/ethanol ratio, at 188 °C and 20 min as static extraction time. In this case rutin recovery from the leaves (14. 30 g/kg DM) was 4 -times higher compared to that attainable using conventional ultrasound assisted extraction (3. 62 g/kg DM) with methanol:ethanol mixture (90 : 10) as solvent. Rutin recovery from defatted and <b>non-defatted</b> seeds of amaranth under optimum PLE conditions was 35. 3 and 41. 1 mg/kg DM, respectively, whereas using ultrasound assisted extraction 19. 7 and 34. 6 mg/kg DM were obtained, respectively. Extracts obtained under optimum conditions were further fractionated by using supercritical antisolvent fractionation (SAF). Extracts of amaranth leaves containing 70 % water were mixed with supercritical CO 2 and separated into two fractions according to the molecular mass and solubility of the contained compounds. A central composite experimental design was applied for {{the determination of the}} best fractionation conditions to maximize rutin enrichment. Maximum rutin concentration in raffinate (22. 57 g/kg) was recovered at 15 MPa using a feed mixture flow rate of 0. 3 mL/min.

40|$|Vários complexos de ródio Rh 2 (L) 4 (L = acetato, propionato, butirato, trifluoroaceta-to e trifluoroacetamidato) ligam-se à albumina de soro humana (HSA) em relações mola-res de aproximadamente 8 : 1. Medidas de dicroísmo {{circular}} mostraram que os carboxila-tos mais lipossolúveis (butirato e trifluoroacetato) provocaram as maiores alterações na estrutura secundária da HSA. As constantes de Stern-Volmer para a supressão de fluo-rescência da HSA por esses complexos também foram maiores para os compostos mais lipofílicos. O amidato lipossolúvel, Rh 2 (tfc) 4, apresentou supressão intermediária e não provocou alterações estruturais. Isto mostra que é possível projetar metalofármacos anti-tumorais que se ligam a proteínas de transporte em grande quantidade, sem provocar al-terações estruturais importantes. Esses complexos tiveram também suas afinidades em relação à HSA determinadas por espectrofotometria, observando-se no caso dos alquil-carboxilatos uma correlação inversa com suas lipossolubilidades, o que sugere uma com-petição entre coordenação axial ao metal e interação hidrofóbica do ligante. A difusão dos complexos livres ou ligados à proteína para células de Ehrlich {{in vitro}} parece primordial-mente governada pelo caráter hidrofóbico do complexo. O complexo Rh 2 (tfc) 4 apresentou afinidade pela proteína (K = 214, 1), além de partição celular tanto em ausência (32, 1 %) como na presença (48, 6 %) de HSA. Desta forma, o composto HSA:Rh 2 (tfc) 4 teve sua a-ção antitumoral investigada em camundongos Balb-c portadores de ascite de Ehrlich, mostrando que a HSA pode ser um reservatório para o complexo de ródio. Various divalent rhodium complexes Rh 2 (L) 4 (L = acetate, propionate, butyrate, tri-fluoroacetate and trifluoroacetamidate) {{have been found}} to bind to <b>non-defatted</b> human serum albumin (HSA) at molar ratios about 8 : 1. The circular dichroism measurements showed that the more liposoluble carboxylates butyrate and trifluoroacetate caused the major alterations of the secondary structure of HSA. Stern-Volmer constants for the fluo-rescence quenching by these complexes were also higher for the lipophilic metal com-pounds. In the case of the rhodium carboxylates it was observed that their denaturating and quenching properties could be explained in terms of their liposolubilities: the higher their lipophilic characters, the higher their abilities to penetrate inside the protein frame-work leading to structural alterations, and the closer they could get to the Trp 214 residue causing fluorescence quenching. The liposoluble amidate complex Rh 2 (tfc) 4, presented an intermediate quenching and did not cause structural alterations in the protein, presumably not penetrating inside the peptidic backbone. This shows {{that it is possible to}} design new antitumor metal complexes which bind to a large extent to a transporter protein causing little structural damage. The affinities for human albumin of these five rhodium(II) comple-xes were determined by spectrophotometry. In the case of the alkylcarboxylates, an inver-se correlation of affinity with their liposolubilities was observed. Diffusion of the free or pro-tein-bound complexes into Ehrlich cells in vitro seems to be primarily governed by the hy-drophobic character of the complex. The complex Rh 2 (tfc) 4 exhibited considerable affinity towards the protein (K = 214. 1) as well as cell partition both in the absence (32. 1 %) and presence (48. 6 %) of HSA. The compound HSA:Rh 2 (tfc) 4 has had its antitumoral action in tumor-bearing Balb-c mice investigated, showing that HSA can be a drug reservoir for the rhodium complex...|$|E
40|$|African Walnut (Tetracarpidium conophorum- Mull. Arg) is a {{perennial}} climbing shrub which grows {{mainly in the}} Western region of Africa. It is found mainly in Nigeria, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon as well. The nuts are encased in pods which may contain between 2 to 5 nuts. The seed is enclosed in a hard shell-like case. The nuts are commonly processed by boiling or roasting and consumed as a snack or used as soup thickener. In ethnobotanical medicine, the nut extract is extensively used in decoctions for treatment and/or management of common and chronic ailments such as malaria, dysentery, high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer. The nuts are generally exposed to high temperatures (25 – 37 °C) and relative humidity (RH) which increases susceptibility to fungal contamination and nutrient degradation, hence, raising concerns over product quality and safety. Experiment simulating the common retail postharvest storage and processing practices was conducted to: (i) determine the effects on the fatty acid profile; (ii) assess {{the impact on the}} fungal population contaminating the nut shells at different maturity stages, and potential mycotoxigenic implications; (iii) evaluate the cytotoxicity of four extract of the nut on lung cancer (A 549) cells; and finally (iv) assay the total phenolic content and profile potential individual phenolic components of the nut. Results indicated the presence of essential and non-essential fatty acids namely; palmitate, oleate, stearate, linoleate, arachidate and α-linolineate with α-linolineate being the most abundant (1. 1 – 8. 2 mg/g freeze-dry weight). Boiling and roasting generally improved the concentration of the fatty acids best when nuts are cold stored at 5 °C for maximum of 10 days. Potential mycotoxigenic species - Aspergillus section Nigri, Aspergillus flavus/Parasiticus, Fusarium spp. and Penicillium spp. - were frequently isolated from cultured shell pieces of stored nuts. When compared with unprocessed nuts, roasting completely prevented fungal contamination in shell pieces from nuts in the non-stored (NSN) group at early maturity stage, while boiling significantly reduced the level of contamination to about 58 % (P < 0. 05). Simulating open market conditions caused 100 % fungal contamination in all boiled samples and roasted samples at early maturity. Mycotoxin analysis using Yeast Extract agar (YES) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) - Fluorescence detector (FLD) showed that Aflatoxins - G 1 (AFG 1), B 1 (AFB 1), G 2 (AFG 2), and B 2 (AFB 2) were produced by 20 isolates with both AFG 1 and AFB 1 being predominant at concentration ranges 4 – 32, 200 and 4 – 22, 700 ng/g plug weight, respectively. No Ochratoxin A (OTA) was detected. Phenolic component analysis indicated unprocessed (20. 79 ± 1. 0 mg gallic acid equivalent per gram freeze-dry weight – GAE/g FDW) samples showed the highest value for total phenolics while both boiling (9. 90 ± 1. 8 mg GAE/g FDW), and roasting (9. 32 ± 2. 7 mg GAE/g FDW) reduced the amount by more than 50 % when compared with unprocessed. Potential individual phenolic compounds were unambiguously separated using high performance liquid chromatography – diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). There were no differences between chromatograms of defatted and <b>non-defatted</b> unprocessed, roasted and boiled samples. Cytotoxicity evaluation showed no decrease in cell densities in plates treated with extracts from unprocessed nuts at all concentrations. Diethyl ether-ethyl acetate (10 µg/mL) and n-butanol (1000 and 500 µg/mL) extracts of roasted nuts as well as dichloromethane and water (1, 10 µg/mL) of boiled nuts caused a non-significant decrease of < 10 % in cell densities when compared with the phosphate buffered saline-media control. However, all extracts showed no cytotoxic effect on the A 549 cells African walnut is basically produced at subsistence level in Nigeria, but considering the presence of desirable fatty acid profile and phenolic compounds, need for increased industrial scale production is herein recommended. Although fungal attack and potential mycotoxin risk on the nut may be high, retail processing by roasting has prospects to greatly accentuate the risk. Cold storage of the nut may help to improve the shelf life although it may not be cost effective for local farmers in Nigeria and Africa, however, it provides opportunity for export business. Although the nut extracts showed no cytotoxic effect on A 549 lung cancer cell lines, there is need to investigate further to confirm it non-cytotoxicity activity on other cancer lines and normal cell lines...|$|E
