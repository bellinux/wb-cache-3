He devised a plan of extorting movie studios; he would take over local labor unions (the Screen Extras Guild and the Los Angeles Teamsters) and stage strikes to force studios to pay him off, so that unions would start working again. He borrowed money from celebrities and didn't pay them back, knowing that they would <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> him for the money. During {{his first year in}} Hollywood, he received more than $400,000 in loans from movie stars.|$|E
500|$|Fourteen-year-old {{country music}} singer Virginia [...] "Ginny" [...] Hensley, {{who later became}} Patsy Cline, began her career by making her {{broadcast}} debut on WINC in 1948. Hensley asked [...] "Joltin'" [...] Jim McCoy, {{the leader of a}} [...] "hillbilly band" [...] called [...] "The Melody Playboys", about to perform on the station, for a chance to sing with them. She told the band leader, [...] "If you just {{give me a chance to}} sing with you, I'll <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> for pay." [...] Cline continued to perform regularly on Saturday mornings on WINC. [...] In 1948 and 1949, respectively, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope visited WINC, where they were interviewed on-the-air. Crosby and Hope were each in town for the city's annual Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{also notes}} that Mara's {{surprising}} naivete is a welcome respite {{against a backdrop of}} a [...] "terminally jaded" [...] cast. As the show begins, aspiring journalist Zoe Barnes is desperate to rise from covering the [...] "Fairfax County Council" [...] beat to covering [...] "'what's behind the veil' of power in the Capitol hallways." [...] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes {{that by the end of}} the first episode, Mara's Barnes is among the cadre of Frank's accomplices. After she pleads for a relationship with him by promising to earn his trust and not [...] "ask any questions", Frank uses her fiendishly. However, Ashley Parker of The New York Times considers her unfathomably aggressive and too overt, transactional and sexual. Parker points out that Barnes' statement [...] "I protect your identity, I print what you tell me, and I'll <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> any questions" [...] almost discredits itself.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] is {{described}} as an uptempo dance song. It begins with a conversation {{with one of her}} friends, who asks Jackson the title question. Lyrically, it involves the singer asking why her lover was not as attentive as he once was. He was not treating her as well as he used to, and she calls him a [...] "loser" [...] in response. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> for more than I deserve, you know it's the truth. You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth. I'm telling you no way", Jackson sings. Veda A. McCoy in the book Lifepower: Six Winning Strategies to a Life of Purpose, Passion & Power expressed that the song reminded that [...] "life is about more than just what you say. Life is also about what you do". Vibe noted that with [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", Jackson stands up for men. New York magazine's Chris Smith called the song's chorus [...] "fully belligerent". In a Billboard publication, Nelson George noted its [...] "tauting, tigerish" [...] beat. Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine commented, [...] "Nothing sends me into a trembling, corner-cowering stupor than a giggly, under-enunciated Janet Jackson jam." ...|$|E
500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil. [...] The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its [...] "seemingly horrid mortality," [...] with the belief in a benevolent God. [...] Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: [...] "Evolution", the narrator states, [...] "loves death more than it loves you or me." [...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." [...] While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, [...] "I had thought to live {{by the side of the}} creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. [...] But I seem to have reached a point where I must draw the line. It looks as though the creek is not buoying me up but dragging me down." ...|$|E

The result, according to Spurlock, was a diet with twice the calories recommended by the USDA. Further, Spurlock attempted to curtail his physical activity to better match the exercise habits of the average American (he previously walked about 3 miles a day, whereas the average American walks 1.5 miles).|$|E

2500|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Linda Drane Burdick in {{the prosecution}} rebuttal told the jurors {{that she and her}} colleagues backed up every claim they made in their opening statement six weeks ago, and implied that the defense never directly backed up their own opening-statement claims. [...] "My biggest fear is that common sense will be lost in all the rhetoric of the case," [...] she said, insisting that she would <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> the jury to make their decision based on emotion but rather the evidence. [...] "Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable," [...] she stated. [...] "What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong." [...] She suggested that the garbage bag in the trunk of the car was a [...] "decoy" [...] put there to keep people from getting suspicious about the smell of the car when she left it abandoned in a parking stall directly beside a dumpster in an Amscot parking lot. [...] "Whose life was better without Caylee?" [...] she asked, stressing how George and Cindy Anthony were wondering where their daughter and granddaughter were in June and July 2008, the same time Casey was staying at her boyfriend's apartment while Caylee's body was decomposing in the woods. [...] "That's the only question you need to answer in considering why Caylee Marie Anthony was left {{on the side of the}} road dead." [...] Burdick then showed the jury a split-screen with a photo of Casey partying at a night club on one side and a close-up of the [...] "Bella Vita" [...] (meaning [...] "Beautiful Life") tattoo that she got weeks after Caylee died on the other.|$|E

6000|$|... (1) IT was {{faithfully}} kept {{during three}} hundred and sixty years and more; then the over-confident octogenarian's prophecy failed. During the tumult of the French Revolution the promise was forgotten and the grace withdrawn. It has remained in disuse ever since. Joan <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> to be remembered, but France has remembered her with an inextinguishable love and reverence; Joan <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for a statue, but France has lavished them upon her; Joan <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for a church for Domremy, but France is building one; Joan <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for saintship, but even that is impending. Everything which Joan of Arc {{did not ask for}} has been given her, and with a noble profusion; but the one humble little thing which she did ask for and get has been taken away from her. There is something infinitely pathetic about this. France owes Domremy a hundred years of taxes, and could hardly find a citizen within her borders who would vote against the payment of the debt. -- NOTE BY THE TRANSLATOR.|$|R
