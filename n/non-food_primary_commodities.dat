In this paper we study if this relationship also applies to “non-commodity currencies”, currencies of countries with a small share of <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> export. We perform both in-sample and out-of-sample analysis of exchange rates’ forecasting power on country-specific commodity price indices and world commodity price indices.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{virtually all}} developing countries were heavily dependent upon exports of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities.</b> Globally, this {{gave rise to}} three severe problems. First, because commodity prices are highly volatile, countries {{had to cope with}} large shocks, both positive and negative. Evidence suggests that the largest of these shocks were poorly managed, with negative shocks causing substantial contractions in output. Second, for various reasons, the rents generated by primary commodites have been associated with poor governance. Third, <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> dependence is associated with a substantially higher risk of civil war. Given these problems, diversification seems desirable, and indeed on average {{over the past two decades}} developing countries have massively diversified their exports so that such dependence is a thing of the past.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the persistence of}} shocks to world commodity prices, using monthly IMF data on <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> between 1957 – 98. We find that shocks to commodity prices are typically long-lasting and the variability of the persistence of price shocks is quite wide. The paper also discusses {{the implications of these}} findings for national and international schemes to stabilize earnings from commodity exports and finds that if price shocks are long-lived, then the cost of stabilization schemes will likely exceed any associated smoothing benefits. [JEL C 22, O 13, O 19, Q 11, Q 17] This paper examines a key characteristic of the behavior of commodity prices— the persistence of shocks to the prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities.</b> This is a topic of great importance, given that about 25 percent of world merchandise trade consists of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities,</b> and both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> prices are key determinants of developments in the world economy.

40|$|In 2007, Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (HHR) {{demonstrated}} that export specialization patterns {{have important implications}} for economic growth. The authors developed an indicator of income level linked to the country's exports they called EXPY and showed that higher values of the indicator lead to higher subsequent economic growth. The present paper tests whether HHR's conclusions are valid even in times of economic crisis and rising prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities,</b> using data from 2004 - 2013. We show that, in the aggregate, higher values of EXPY are connected with faster economic growth. However, the relationship is much more statistically significant in countries that focus heavily on exporting <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> than in other countries. This implies that the rising prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> in the last decade have altered the traditional link between export sophistication and economic growth. As a result, we argue that EXPY is not a good predictor of future economic performance when the prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> are unstable. Policy makers must be aware that, while what countries export is important, it is equally important when they export it: in times of stable prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities,</b> a focus on the export of sophisticated goods generates higher economic growth in the future.

2500|$|A high {{proportion}} of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> in national exports significantly {{increases the risk of}} a conflict. A country at [...] "peak danger", with commodities comprising 32% of gross domestic product, has a 22% risk of falling into civil war in a given five-year period, while a country with no <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> exports has a 1% risk. When disaggregated, only petroleum and non-petroleum groupings showed different results: a country with relatively low levels of dependence on petroleum exports is at slightly less risk, while a high level of dependence on oil as an export results in slightly more risk of a civil war than national dependence on another <b>primary</b> <b>commodity.</b> The authors of the study interpreted this as being the result of the ease by which <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> may be extorted or captured compared to other forms of wealth; for example, it is easy to capture and control the output of a gold mine or oil field compared to a sector of garment manufacturing or hospitality services.|$|R
40|$|Several authors, notably Prebisch (1950) and Singer (1950), {{have argued}} {{that there is a}} secular {{tendency}} for the terms of trade for <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> to deteriorate over time. The confirmation of such a tendency through historical data is of course problematical. Since such data also include those for years characterized by unusual occurrences, like World Wars and breakdowns of currency regimes (as happened to the Bretton Woods system in 1971), which have the effect of suddenly pushing up <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> prices, any tendency towards secular deterioration gets obscured by these sudden occasional boosts. For long stretches of time, both before and after such sudden boosts however, a secular deterioration in the <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> terms of trade is clearly discernible. In particular, the fact that these terms of trade have moved against <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> {{over the last couple of}} decades, precisely when the contemporary phenomenon of globalization is claimed to have manifested itself, is undeniable. Explanations for such a secular tendency for the terms of trade to move against <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> have invariably focussed on the behaviour of goods markets.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> on {{development}} indicators {{in a sample of}} 86 countries over the period 1965 - 2005. To this purpose we employ a system of equations. We use interactive terms to estimate separate slope coefficients for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, Central African countries, and rest of the world. The main results of our exercise can be summarised as follows: (i) a higher dependence on <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> reduces economic growth, increases income inequality, and slows down the rate of human capital accumulation; (ii) the negative effects of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> on growth, inequality and human capital appear to be statistically stronger in Central Africa and SSA than {{in the rest of the}} world; (iii) in the case of growth and inequality, the negative effect of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> and the differences of the slope coefficients across groups of countries persist after controlling for the quality of institutions; on the contrary (iv) in the case of human capital, the negative effect of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> as well as the differences across groups of countries vanish once institutional development is controlled for. Two main policy recommendations stem from our analysis. First, the degree of dependence on <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> must be reduced through the diversification of productive structure in order to foster development. Second, a dynamic private sector is a key driver of diversification. Countries must therefore improve the business environment and strengthen financial intermediation to assist the expansion of the private sector.

40|$|Acutely {{volatile}} {{movements in}} <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> prices have drawn considerable interest from empirical researchers.

The traditional demand-based framework was unable to explain the marked deterioration in these prices during the 1980 s. This paper tries to ascertain the role played by real oil prices in explaining the extremely volatile movements in real prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> by taking into account oil price shocks over the period 1973 - 1996, using monthly data. Real <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> prices and real oil prices are cointegrated.

40|$|In {{the distant}} past prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> had shown a {{tendency}} of decrease and their increase was recorded only during the First and Second World Wars. Since 1950 s there had been recorded a slight decrease in global price indices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities,</b> while in early 1970 s they grew to a considerable extent. After that and up to 2001 the global nominal price indices and particularly real price indices of non-energy primary products drastically fell reaching the lowest level in their history. This applied to prices of all <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> as a whole {{as well as to}} all groupings of these products. On the other hand, prices of industrial products exported by developed countries to underdeveloped and medium-developed ones, dynamically grew {{in the second half of}} the previous century. Thus, the terms of trade substantially aggravated for underdeveloped countries whose exports structure is still dominated by non-energy <b>primary</b> <b>commodities.</b> Therefore, the negative correlation was clearly manifested between a very high share of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> in the structure of commodity exports and a very low per capita income in a number of developing countries. The drastic fall in prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> and the simultaneous dynamic growth in prices of industrial products caused to a great extent reduction of the share of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> in the world commodity trade - from 57 per cent recorded in 1950 to only over 20 per cent recorded in late 20 th and early 21 st centuries. Among numerous factors that have brought about a drastic fall in prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> the most prominent are: technical and technological progress in their production, production of their substitutes, in traffic and other sectors as well. Apart from this, the decrease in prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> has been considerably caused by change in exchange rate at par to US dollar, agricultural policies of developed countries, privatisation of companies that produce commodities and particularly by too excessive production and purchase in relation to demand and spending that in recent years have been under the impact of recession that has emerged in developed economies and a number of newly industrialised and developing countries, as well as a very slow revival of economies in transition. By all this, a drastic fall in prices of a number of particular products from this group has also resulted from the impact exerted by some specific factors. Taking into consideration the fact that the impact of the most important factors that have brought about the drastic fall in prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> is of permanent character and that it will be exerted to a greater or lesser extent in the next dozen of years the experts of the World Bank forecasted in late 2002 that, taken as a whole, the real prices of <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> would slightly increase by 2015, but they would still be at a lower level than in 1990.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{suggests}} that the substantial terms of trade uctuations faced by developing countries is in large {{part due to the}} volatility of the prices of the <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> that they export. We combine data on national terms of trade and price indices for internationally traded <b>primary</b> <b>commodities</b> to provide a concrete assessment of this statement. Our ndings are summarized as follows. First, at least 50 % of the annual variation in national terms of trade of a typical developing country can be accounted for by variation in the international prices of three or fewer <b>primary</b> <b>commodity</b> exports. Second, the persistence of the terms of trade and commodity price changes {{suggests that}} these shocks would induce considerable volatility into consumption growth in the absence of complete risk sharing. Third, while the existing national patterns of specialization provide some reduction in terms of trade variation relative to complete specialization in a single <b>primary</b> <b>commodity,</b> much more could be accomplished by pooling over all <b>primary</b> <b>commodities,</b> or across all developing countries.
