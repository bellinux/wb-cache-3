40|$|In this master thesis the {{structural}} modeling of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> {{has been done}} using finite element software (ABAQUS). The model was built corresponding to the <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> experiment performed by SINTEF Fisheries and Aquaculture. The construction of the model was done by using Timoshenko beam element (B 31) and performing static analysis. The current forces from the experiment (2. 63 N, 6. 9 N, 11. 9 N, 17. 99 N and 25. 6 N) were simulated using line loads completely distributed over the <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> model. In addition, big challenges were found when constructed the vertical bar due to the complex geometry of PET net, for that reason the model was simplified in the vertical bar. The displacements of the model were bigger with increasing the applied load, same reaction as the experiments. While comparing the results with the experiment {{it was found that}} the ABAQUS model had a good matching at bigger loads. However it is was concluded that the model can structurally simulate in a good grade the behavior of the <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> from the experiment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Biofouling {{is the one}} of {{the main}} {{problems}} in marine finfish aquaculture. Biofouling occludes the nets and incurs major costs to fish farmers in the form of copper containing anti fouling paints used on the net surfaces, cleaning and changing of nets. Copper containing anti fouling paints is the major protective method in use by the fish farmers, but given the toxicity of the copper towards the marine invertebrates and its ability to accumulate in the food chain, it may face a ban in marine aquaculture. So, {{there is a need to}} develop better anti fouling methods which will be as effective as copper, have least impact on the environment and cost effective to use. To design these, better understanding of the process of biofouling is needed. There is little data available about the biofouling in marine aquaculture. In this regard, I studied biofouling in a marine cage aquaculture farm (ACE/Tristeinen), located in mid-Norwegian coastal waters. In this study, knot less nylon <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> and Micanti <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> were used to compare different aspects of biofouling and to test the effectiveness of the Micanti nets. Zooplankton samples were collected and analyzed with a focus on the larval stages of the fouling organisms, to relate the plakntonic stages of the foulers in the zooplankton sample to the foulers present on the <b>net</b> <b>panels.</b> Sea lice larval stages presence in the zooplankton samples was also detected to study the movement of sea lice larval stages. Analysis of the <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> and zooplankton samples together showed a trend between the larvae of foulers found in the zooplankton samples and foulers present on the <b>net</b> <b>panels.</b> On <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> hydroids, mussels, algae, amphipods and nudibranchs accounted for the major proportion of the fouling. On nylon <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> hydroids were more compared to mussels and on Micanti <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> mussels were more compared to hydroids. Nets occlusion and net fouling wet weight was slightly less on the micanti <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> compared to nylon <b>net</b> <b>panels.</b> Few sea lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis larval stages were found in the zooplankton samples. Micanti did not work as expected, as it having problems with strength, length and density of the fibers flocked on the net. Improving these would help to improve the functionality of the Micanti nets as a better non-toxic antifouling technology...|$|R

Settlement assays showed that actinulae settled significantly less on white (67. 0 ± 5. 4 %) than on black surfaces (87. 0 ± 2. 6 %), whereas {{there were no significant differences}} between the remaining colours yellow, red and blue. However, when given a choice between (1) white and black, (2) red and black, and (3) red and white surfaces, actinulae did not preferentially settle on any colour. A field experiment at a salmon farm in Mid-Norway tested the effects of colour (red and white) and the presence of copper (with and without cuprous oxide) in the coating of <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> on the accumulation of fouling. After 10 weeks of immersion, the only macro-fouling species on the nets was E. larynx. The presence of cuprous oxide significantly reduced the wet weight of fouling, while colour did not have a significant effect. The mean wet weights of fouling on <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> with cuprous oxide coatings (347 ± 25 g m− 2 and 330 ± 19 g m− 2 for red and white nets, respectively) were approximately half of the mean wet weights of fouling on the <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> without cuprous oxide (695 ± 43 g m− 2 and 695 ± 45 g m− 2 for red and white nets, respectively).

Two kinds of ASD were designed: a fluttering <b>net</b> <b>panel,</b> i. e., a free-end flag-like <b>net</b> <b>panel,</b> and a double conical rope array. Escape responses of juvenile bastard halibut were observed in a circulating water channel using two model cod ends, one made with diamond-shaped 43 -mm-mesh-size polyethylene (PE) as a high-contrast cod end {{and the other with}} polyamid (PA) mono-ply as a low-contrast cod end. Retention rate was significantly lower with the double conical rope-array ASD in the PE cod end than with conventional PE cod ends only or the fluttering net-panel ASD inside the PE cod end. Mean retention rate with the low-contrast PA cod end was also significantly lower than that with the high-contrast PE conventional cod end. Therefore, active fluttering devices using a double conical rope array together with less visible low-contrast netting in the cod end could help to reduce the bycatch of juvenile flatfish by weakening their optomotor response and actively driving fish to the side <b>net</b> <b>panel...</b>|$|E
40|$|An active {{stimulating}} device (ASD) {{consisting of}} a <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> or ropes fluttering in the turbulence inside the cod end was effective in driving fish near the cod end to reduce juvenile by-catch. The fluttering characteristics of the rope and <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> were examined by video observations and analyzed for fluttering amplitude and period in a water channel and in field experiments with a bottom trawl. The amplitude ratio of the fluttering ropes or nets in the tank test increased with the fluttering index as {{the diameter of the}} twine, mesh size, flexibility, and flow velocity changed, whereas the period decreased with the above factors. In bottom trawl experiments, the range of mean depth difference in the fluttering <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> was 12 - 17 % of the length of the fluttering net, and the period of depth difference or three-dimensional (3 D) tilt was revealed, with shorter ones ranging from 2 to 6 s. The amplitude as depth difference and period from field measurements were similar to those of nets in tank experiments and also to the period of 3 D flow velocity inside the cod end.

40|$|The bag of a trawlnet is {{considered}} as an elliptical cone, its wings as merely forward extensions of this cone. The {{dimensions of the}} cone are derived from the measured wingend spread and the headline height (gape) of the net and from its specification drawings. From these operational and constructional dimensions the mean angle of attack of the <b>netting</b> <b>panels</b> and the mean setting angle of the meshes are derived. All operational dimensions change with towing speed. Formulae are then given which with further inputs of twine diameter bar length and developed area of each <b>netting</b> <b>panel</b> allow {{an estimate of the}} drag area of the netting cone. The codend {{in the form of a}} tube, the net appendages and the ground friction are eachconsidered separately. Thus a total drag area is derived; multiplication by the hydrodynamic pressure and addition of the friction give the total geometrically derived drag of the trawlnet. This is compared with the measured drag over a range of speeds for 3 very different bottom drawls and two substantially different midwater trawls. Examples of the comparisons are presented.

40|$|Abstract The flow {{characteristics}} through and around a <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> {{have been investigated}} through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and measurements. A finite volume approach was used for solving the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations combined with a k–ε turbulence model for describing the flow. For computational efficiency, the net was modeled as a sheet of porous media rather than {{a large number of}} cylinders connected by knots. The model resistance coefficients needed for the porous media equations were found by optimizing the fit between computed lift and drag forces on the <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> and lift and drag measured in tow tank experiments. Lift and drag acting on a flat panel of knotless nylon net (2. 8 mm twine thickness and 29 mm mesh size) stretched on a frame were measured at different speeds and angles of attack, and fluid velocity was recorded in the region behind the net. The optimization process used to obtain the best fit porous media coefficients was simplified through the use of an analytical model. Final comparisons between CFD predictions and measurements of lift and drag coefficients and velocity reduction behind the <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> were made for two of the speeds and angles of attack.

In an attempt to address the possible impacts, the rate of E. larynx growth on aquaculture nets over a net-cleaning cycle was assessed and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts were exposed to hydroid-biofouled nets under experimental challenge. After only 1 week of immersion, there was a high settlement of E. larynx on <b>net</b> <b>panels,</b> with the maximum growth observed after 3 week of immersion.

40|$|A {{modified}} Morison {{model is}} presented for calculation of hydrodynamic forces on aquaculture net cages. The model {{is based on}} a simple method for conversion of "screen model force coefficients" to approximate equivalent directional dependent Morison coefficients.

Based on the screen model force coefficients defined by Løland's formulas, the method is implemented in the nonlinear finite element program USFOS. Analyses with the modified Morison model are performed, investigating the viscous forces on a <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> for different inflow angles. The numerical results are benchmarked against Løland's original screen model, showing good agreement for all inflow angles.

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of net barriers, which are flexible, as opposed to rigid, devices for intercepting falling rocks {{has led to the}} need for rigorous design criteria based on safe and sound theoretical methods. Consistently with current practice, full-scale experimental tests are necessary in order to assess the reliability of any such barrier. Here, a new simulation approach based on numerical methods is presented: the analysis of a complete typical falling-rock event has been performed, to study the response of these interceptive devices. A commercial finite element code featuring explicit dynamic capabilities, particularly useful when modelling high-speed phenomena has been used. The simplifying assumptions along with the model geometrical and mechanical data are discussed. Both single <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> and complete barrier simulations are presented.

Growth rates of juvenile P. margaritifera cultured in the open reef systems of the Solomon Islands compared favorably with those reported from the established pearl culture operations in French Polynesia and the Cook Islands. Initial experiments showed that survival of oysters in lantern nets in shallow reef areas was poor as a result of predation by fish and invertebrates. Siting of culture systems in deeper water decreased mortality by fish, although predation by invertebrates that recruited from plankton was still a potential problem. In general, {{there were no significant differences}} in growth or survival between juveniles held in lantern <b>nets</b> and <b>panel</b> nets; however, lantern nets were more difficult to clean and inspect for predators. Juvenile {{growth and survival}} did not differ significantly (p >. 05) between <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> and trays after 5 months, although the rigid trays were easier to clean of fouling organisms. Juveniles placed loosely into trays tended to aggregate, and rates of growth and survival of oysters glued separately into trays were significantly greater (p <. 05) than those for oysters placed loosely into trays. There was no significant difference in growth between oysters glued into trays and those glued onto ropes and enclosed behind plastic mesh.

Oysters were either 'ear-hung or housed in <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> before being transported to low (Nawi) and high (Raviravi) current sites. The quantity of new byssus produced by oysters in the two culture apparatus at the two sites was counted 5, 10, 15 and 20 days after deployment. At the end of the experiment, the thicknesses and tensile strengths of randomly selected byssal threads from ear-hung oysters and oysters held in <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> were determined. Ten days after deployment, there was no significant difference in the quantity of byssus produced by oysters in the two culture apparatuses at both sites. An average of around two threads per byssus secreting oyster was recorded by the tenth day. However, after 15 and 20 days, ear-hung oysters had produced significantly more byssus (p < 0. 01) than those housed in <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> at the high current site. On the twentieth day, ear-hung oysters had an average of six byssal threads while those housed in <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> had an average of around three per oyster at the Raviravi site.

The pearls produced were compared in terms of size, shape, lustre, colour, surface perfection and overall quality. The highest proportion of pearls produced in all treatments was in the 10 – 11 mm size category (37 – 54 %) but culture method did not significantly (p = 0. 211) influence the size of pearls produced. Oysters held on chaplets produced more pearls with concentric surface grooves or ‘circles’ (47 – 60 %) compared to oysters in held <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> (43 – 45 %) at all three culture sites. Oysters held in <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> produced higher proportions of pearls in the more desirable ‘round’ and ‘semi-round’ shape categories (6 % and 25 %, respectively) than oysters held on chaplets (5 % and 15 %, respectively) at all three culture sites, and culture method had a significant impact (p = 0. 031) on pearl shape overall. Higher proportions of pearls in the ‘very high’ and ‘high’ lustre categories (8 % and 40 %, respectively) were produced by oysters held in <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> compared to those on chaplets (3 % and 16 %, respectively) at each of the three culture sites. However, the overall impact of culture methods on pearl lustre was not significant (p = 0. 100). At all three culture sites, higher proportions of pearls assigned to grades ‘A’ (6 %) and ‘B’ (46 %) were produced by oysters in <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> compared to those held on chaplets where 3 % and 29 % of pearls were assigned to grade ‘A’ and grade ‘B’, respectively.

40|$|Because {{of scale}} effects and {{inappropriate}} hydrodynamic models, the nonlinear hydroelastic response of net cages used for fish farming cannot be analyzed precisely with traditional model testing or combinations of FEMs (finite element methods) and load models. In this study, an innovative hybrid method is proposed {{to determine the}} hydroelastic response of full-scale floater-and-net systems more accurately. In this method, the net for the fish cage was vertically and peripherally divided into similar interconnected sections with different hydrodynamic parameters, which were assumed to be uniformly distributed over each section. A model of a typical section was subjected to various towing velocities, oscillation periods and amplitudes in a towing tank to simulate the potential motions of all sections in the net under various currents, waves and floater movements. By analyzing the measured hydrodynamic force from this test section, a hydrodynamic force database for a typical net section under various currents, waves and floater motions was built. Finally, based on an FEM, the modified Morison equation and the hydrodynamic force database, the hydroelastic behavior of the full-scale fish cage was calculated with an iterative scheme. It is demonstrated that this hybrid method is able to produce correct hydroelastic response for both steady and oscillatory flows.

40|$|Marine {{fish farming}} is an {{important}} and growing industry. Fouling organisms that grow on the net cages and other structural components of the fish farms are a substantial problem for the industry. The overall {{aim of this study}} is to increase the understanding of how the bio fouling influence the hydrodynamic forces on the nets. More specifically the focus is on hydroid growth, and the use of models of net twine with artificial hydroid fouling. The models that were used ar made of two 1. 5 mm steel rods that are twisted together, with short pieces of 0. 32 mm multifilament fishing line fixed between them, similar to a test tube brush. The twisted steel rods were replicating a 3 mm twine, with the fishing lines acting as evenly distributed hydroid growth. Previously drag tests had been done with one and two of these models, with two parallel twines with variyng distance, and also a cross configuration. In the present study the goal was to investigate possible interaction effects between twines, by using various configurations with a higher number of twines; and also make small net sections and estimate the drag increase due to bio fouling. 16 twine models were made, and tests were done with a single twine; and 2, 4, 6 and 8 parallel twines; and also crossing twines, with the same numbers of twines in each direction. In total 18 different configurations were tested, with twine spacings of 12 mm and 24 mm. The experiments were done in a towing tank, with the twine models fixed in a frame, orthogonally to the direction of travel. The drag force was measured on the frame, and the contribution from the frame itself was subtracted from the total force to find the drag on the twine models. Then the drag coefficients were calculated and plotted in various diagrams to visualise any trends. All the configurations were tested at a range of velocities from 0. 05 m/s to 1. 4 m/s. Most of the results were consistent, except for the two lowest velocities (0. 05 m/s and 0. 1 m/s) were the precision error was significant. It was found that the drag coefficient for the fouled twine models were decreasing with increasing current velocity. At 0. 1 m/s (Re = 300) the drag coefficients were between 3. 5 and 4. 0, while for 1. 4 m/s (Re = 4200) they were approximately 3. 0. This is probably either because of deflection of the hydroids at higher velocities, or because the hydroids themselves have a smaller diameter, and hence are in a lower Reynolds number range (from Re = 32 to Re = 448), where the drag coefficient is dependent on the velocity. The variations in drag coefficients between the different model configurations were small, there were some consistent trends, but the magnitude were insignificant. This means that the interaction effects between the twines are relatively small, and it is likely that data from tests with few twines can be extrapolated to <b>net</b> <b>panel</b> applications. The drag coefficients for the net sections in the middle of the cruciform configurations were calculated. For the net sections with 12 mm spacing the results were inconclusive, while for 24 mm spacing the net drag coefficient varied between 0. 66 and 0. 59 for different velocities. This is twice as high as empirical data for a similar clean net. Several possibilities for further work were identified during the work with the thesis. One is to do more similar experiments, both with equivalent models to verify the results, and with either more or less hydroids, to study the influence of the amount of fouling. Another is to try to quantify the bending stiffness of real hydroids compared to the stiffness of the hydroid models (fishing line). The mechanical properties of real hydroids and the hydroid replicas have only been compared qualitatively in previous studies, so quantifying these would be useful both for validation of the models, and for improving them. Further investigations of the drag coefficient of the hydroid stems independently, with regards to the Reynolds number dependency of the drag coefficients of the whole models, would also be interesting...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} based on blacklip pearl oyster (Pinctada margaritifera) juveniles, that were hatchery-reared and 8 months old. They were held for 5 months in {{suspended}} culture using five culture techniques: in 24 -pocket juvenile <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> (PN 24); enclosed within 5 -mm plastic mesh 'inserts' placed {{in the pockets of}} eight-pocket adult <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> (PN 8); in 5 -mm plastic mesh inserts without being placed into <b>panel</b> <b>nets</b> (INSERT); in plastic mesh trays (55 × 30 × 10 cm) with lids (TRAY); and by 'ear' hanging (EAR). Survival was high during the experiment and ranged from 100 % in PN 24 and PN 8 to 90. 6 % for the INSERT treatment. Juveniles held in 24 -pocket nets (PN 24) and ear-hung juveniles showed the greatest growth during the experiment, and had significantly greater dorso-ventral height (DVH) and wet weight (WW) than oysters in all other treatments (P EAR>TRAY>PN 8 >INSERT...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} water flow, fish feed and cage {{position}} on net biofouling was examined in a floating cage fish farm. Fouling of 16 mm mesh <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> suspended {{inside and outside}} net cages and exposed to different treatments were monitored weekly until net apertures were completely occluded by the fouling organisms (8 weeks). Results indicate a dramatic reduction in water flow velocity throughout the fish farm due to the cage units themselves and net biofouling. The reduced water flow (25 cm s- 1) kept the net fouling organisms at bay. Although fish rearing in net cages with inputs of commercial pellet feed increased sessile biofouling (222 % higher than outside the net cages) and non-sessile biofouling (570 % higher), the type of fish feed used did not significantly affect biofouling development. The study recommends that the geometry of serially arranged net cages, as commonly deployed in tropical tidal estuaries, be reconfigured to improve flow through {{in order to minimize}} the impact of fouling...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{reports on}} energy {{efficiency}} optimization regarding bottom trawls. Efficient fishing gear uses up {{only a small}} amount of energy per fish caught. Drag and mouth area during trawling operations affect energy efficiency. Drag causes the energy consumption and the trawl mouth area impacts the quantity of fish caught, hence an energy efficient gear has a low ratio drag on the mouth area. A novel numerical optimization technique using spatial fish distribution is presented in this work. The tool is based on a FEM mechanical model for trawls which consist mostly of <b>netting</b> <b>panels</b> sewn together. This tool is adapted to minimize an objective function namely the drag-to-mouth area ratio. This technique consists in modifying the design of all the panels of the trawl. In this paper the modifications are constant and quantified in terms of mesh number. Moreover the trawl mouth area takes into account the presence of fish within a given depth with respect to sea bottom and the value of the depth is adapted to the fish species of interest. Trawl design optimization with two uniform fish distributions at a given depth (6 m and 3 m above the sea bed) and one linear distribution at 6 m above the sea bed are compared. The application of this tool when designing a bottom trawl for research vessels leads to an energy economy ranging from 16 % to 52 % under certain assumptions...|$|R
40|$|Aim of this study, was firstly {{to assess}} the seabed {{deposition}} of a fish farming facility located in the Alghero Bay (Western Mediterranean) by using the MERAMOD® particulate waste dispersion model, and evaluate actual scenario and a forthcoming situation represented by an enlargement of the fish farming area. The impact seabed surfaces forecasted by the model increased from 5. 6 ha in the actual scenario up to 7. 3 ha in the supposed potential condition. The {{second part of the}} study aimed to describe the settlement and development of biofouling organisms on cage nets at the above–mentioned farming facility. This was done by investigating different developmental phases of the biofouling communities on <b>net</b> <b>panels</b> inside cages containing big and small gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) specimens. The rapid increase of biofouling on all the experimental panels positioned inside fish cages suggests that caged mariculture activities have the potential to provided an enhanced food supply to epibiotic communities. Lastly, the objective of the third part study was to improve the knowledge of the ethological traits of different–sized gilthead sea bream specimens reared in floating cages. With this aim, the most common behavioural patterns of this species were observed during different times of the day and in {{the presence or absence of}} food. The results acquired show that the behaviour of fish reared offshore in the Alghero Bay is dramatically affected by the feeding rhythms in captivity...|$|R
