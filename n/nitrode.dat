The fast <b>nitriding</b> process is based upon the different solubility and diffuse rate of nitrogen atoms in austenite and in ferrite of steel respectively. First, the <b>nitriding</b> samples were heated above the eutectoid temperature for a few minutes to dissolve a large amount of nitrogen and form a nitrogen-rich layer {{on the surface of the}} <b>nitrided</b> samples. Then, the <b>nitriding</b> temperature was decreased below the eutectoid temperature and kept the temperature for a long time to make the dissolved nitrogen in the nitrogen-rich layer diffuse into ferrite. The two different <b>nitriding</b> processes were carried on alternately. Experimental results indicate that the fast <b>nitriding</b> process not only enhances the <b>nitriding</b> speed remarkably, but also keeps the high hardness of the <b>nitrided</b> layer.
