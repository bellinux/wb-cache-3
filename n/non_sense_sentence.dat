In this paper we describe 12 IRIDA patients belonging to 7 unrelated families and identify 10 (9 novel) TMPRSS 6 mutations spread along the gene sequence: 5 missense, 1 <b>non</b> <b>sense</b> and 4 frameshift. The frameshift and <b>non</b> <b>sense</b> mutations are predict to result in truncated protein lacking the catalytic domain. The causal role of missense mutations (Y 141 C, I 212 T, R 271 Q, S 304 L and C 510 S) is demonstrated by in silico analysis, their absence in 100 control chromosomes and the high conservation of the involved residues. The C 510 S mutation in the LDLRA domain in silico model causes an intra-molecular structural imbalance that impairs matriptase- 2 activation. We also assessed the in vitro effect on hepcidin promoter and the proteolytic activity of I 212 T and R 271 Q demonstrating a reduced inhibitory effect for the former mutation, but surprisingly a normal function for R 271 Q which appears silent in vitro. Based on mRNA expression studies I 212 T could also decrease {{the total amount of}} protein produced, likely interfering with mRNA stability. Collectively, our results extend the pattern of TMPRSS 6 mutations associated with IRIDA and propose a model of causality for some of the novel missense mutations...|$|R

50|$|Investigations {{into how}} {{language}} {{interacts with the}} world are called theories of reference. Gottlob Frege was an advocate of a mediated reference theory. Frege divided the semantic content of every expression, including sentences, into two components:sense and meaning. The <b>sense</b> of a <b>sentence</b> is the thought that it expresses. Such a thought is abstract, universal and objective. The sense of any sub-sentential expression consists in its contribution to the thought that its embedding <b>sentence</b> expresses. <b>Senses</b> determine reference and are also the modes of presentation of the objects to which expressions refer. Referents are the objects {{in the world that}} words pick out. The <b>senses</b> of <b>sentences</b> are thoughts, while their referents are truth values (true or false). The referents of sentences embedded in propositional attitude ascriptions and other opaque contexts are their usual senses.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Q-WordNet, a lexical resource {{consisting of}} WordNet senses automatically annotated by {{positive and negative}} polarity. Polarity classification amounts to decide whether a text (<b>sense,</b> <b>sentence,</b> etc.) may be associated to positive or negative connotations. Polarity classification is becoming important for applications such as Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis, which facilitates the extraction and analysis of opinions about commercial products, on companies reputation management, brand monitoring, or to track attitudes by mining online forums, blogs, etc. Inspired by work on classification of word senses by polarity (e. g., SentiWordNet), and taking WordNet as a starting point, we build Q-WordNet. Instead of applying external tools such as supervised classifiers to annotated WordNet synsets by polarity, we try to effectively maximize the linguistic information contained in WordNet, thereby {{taking advantage of the}} human effort put by lexicographers and annotators. The resulting resource is a subset of WordNet senses classified as positive or negative. In this approach, neutral polarity is seen as the absence of positive or negative polarity. The evaluation of Q-WordNet shows an improvement with respect to previous approaches. We believe that Q-WordNet {{can be used as a}} starting point for data-driven approaches in sentiment analysis. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObjective and Hypothesis: Vocal {{effort in}} loud voice is {{produced}} with increased subglottal pressure during vowels and increased supraglottal pressure during consonants. In the paper, our main {{objective is to}} check whether it {{was supported by a}} parallel increase in the airflow resistance of the laryngeal articulator and of the supralaryngeal articulator, here the lips. Study Design and Method: For this comparison, our choice fell on the fricative consonants, as their production allows perfectly synchronous air pressure and airflow measurements. Also, the calculation of the real instantaneous aerodynamic resistance is possible with fricatives-as it is with vowels-whereas it is not possible with plosives. The present feasibility study on a healthy subject is based on direct subglottal and intraoral pressures and airflow measured for /f/ or /v/ and from the contiguous vowel produced in VCVCV <b>non</b> <b>sense</b> words at different levels of intensity. Results and Conclusion: The results support that the airflow resistances at the lips and that at the larynx are quite parallel. The airflow resistance at the lips during labial fricative production could provide a good picture of the laryngeal resistance during the production of continuous speech. This suggests clinical applications using both non invasive inferred measurements of subglottal pressure variation and direct non inferred airflow measurements from more natural speech production tasks...|$|R

The scientific use of linear measurements can contribute decisively in the selective process of many breeds, by identifying the higher morphologically individuals and excluding from reproduction those that are not closed to desirable. The present study objected to evaluate and compare, the linear measures from stallions and gelded horses registered in ABCCCampolina’s CP 6 and CP 8 books, and to determinate the existing correlations. In order to reach so, 15 linear measures from 4. 837 stallions and 1. 371 gelded were evaluated from descriptive statistic, Pearson’s correlation and analysis of variance. Generally, higher values of correlations were observed for stallions than to gelded ones. To stallions, most of the measures were significantly influenced (P< 0, 01) by the year of birth, state of birth and coat color, while to gelded ones the coat color showed lower influence (P< 0, 01) upon the measures. It’s important to notice that castration did not committed the animal’s final growth, however the breeders <b>non</b> <b>sense</b> the lack of appropriated criteria during the selection process and personal preferences can contribute towards stablishing breed characters rather than functionals.

Obviously, one may object that the United States are missing from the picture.

The {{aim of this}} thesis was to analyse Brazilian media’s articles and speeches related {{to the theme of}} religious terrorism and bring the findings more accessible to Finland and Europe. I collected several articles from Brazilian Internet news websites as well as few articles from foreign websites and analysed those articles using a mixed method of qualitative discourse analysis and content analysis. Discrepancies were found between Brazilian government’s official position of Brazil being a terrorist free country while Wikileaks revealed that there are individuals acting and behaving like terrorists in Brazil. When arrested, those individuals were charged with other charges than terrorism, possibly to not attract media’s attention to them. The articles written in Informal style varied from non emotional to strong emotional connoted, figures of speech such as metaphors metonymies, accismus were richly used. Towards the end, Arab culture in Brazil as well as fundamentalism and extremism religion movements in Islam were used as background to why Brazilian press portrays such image of terrorism.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} takes {{a functional}} view {{of language and}} applies its perspective to literary discourse, both poetry and prose. Following the performative hypothesis by Ross (1970), which argues that a declarative sentence consists of the performative part and the proposition, I assume that a literary discourse also has these two parts: the performative level which consists of the author-reader level (speech act of narration) and the textual proposition. I argue that the propositional text is made of what I term 'discourse theme', 'discourse rheme' and 'the mediating function', which transforms the first into the second one in a communicative and dynamic way. The propositional content of this variety of discourse is best viewed in terms of Halliday's extended concept of the 'text-forming' functional-semantic component based on the Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP) of the Prague School linguists - the concepts of theme, rheme, transition, and Communicative Dynamism -, or, what I term 'discourse theme', 'discourse rheme' and 't 4 e mediating function'. I also argue that the. coherence scope of Jakobson's (1960 : 358) 'equivaleI!ce' in the micro-structural arrangement's of verbal elements in a literary text,' whether sound or <b>sense,</b> <b>sentence</b> or episode, depends upon the functional theme-rheme structures.
