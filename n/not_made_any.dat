5|$|Jon Coghill (born 26 August 1971) is an Australian drummer {{best known}} for his work with Australian rock band, Powderfinger, {{although}} he has also toured with Regurgitator. Coghill replaced Powderfinger's original drummer Steven Bishop in 1991 when Bishop wanted to pursue further studies. At this time, Powderfinger had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> recordings, and as such, Coghill has been the group's drummer for all of their releases.|$|E
5|$|SNCF {{claims to}} own 62% {{of the shares}} of Eurostar Group Ltd. Hartmut Mehdorn, then CEO of Deutsche Bahn, {{confirmed}} DB's interest but insisted {{in a letter to}} Pépy that DB had only informally requested information and <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> official requests to Britain's Department for Transport.|$|E
5|$|Earp improbably testified {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral that he and Behan had made a deal. If Earp withdrew his application to the legislature, Behan agreed to appoint Earp as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but did not keep {{his end of the}} bargain, and instead chose Harry Woods, a prominent Democrat, as undersheriff. Behan testified at first that he had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> deal with Earp, although he later admitted he had lied. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment.|$|E

50|$|If a {{partnership}} has accumulated red threes, but has <b>not</b> yet <b>made</b> <b>any</b> melds when the opposition team goes out, then {{the total value}} of all the cards left in the player/team's hand(s) as well as the bonus value of melded red threes are subtracted from that team's previous score. That is, if a team has three red threes but had <b>not</b> yet <b>made</b> <b>any</b> melds, {{at the end of that}} hand the team will suffer a penalty of 300 points rather than gaining a 300-point bonus.|$|R

5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} attempts {{to break through}} the defensive line and reach Lechaeum, Antigonus' force failed and suffered considerable losses. These defeats took such a toll on Antigonus that he considered abandoning his attack of the palisade and moving his army to Sicyon. However, Aratus was visited one evening by some friends from Argos who invited Antigonus to come to their city. The Argives were ready to revolt under the command of Aristoteles, as they were irritated that Cleomenes had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> reforms in the city. Antigonus sent 1,500 men under the command of Aratus to sail to Epidaurus and, from there, march to Argos. At the same time the Achaean strategos for the year, Timoxenos, advanced with more men from Sicyon. When the Achaean reinforcements arrived, the entire city except for the citadel was {{in the hands of the}} Argives.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{continued}} {{to work as a}} schoolteacher after he broke into international cricket, {{but at the end of}} 1934, after missing more than six months of the year in England, he resigned from his government post, reasoning that his career could not progress if he was going to be overseas so often. However, he had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> plans for his future employment. Soon after, O'Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store David Jones with sporting leave entitlements. The Premier of New South Wales, Bertram Stevens, tried to coax O'Reilly into staying in the government education system, offering him a post at Sydney Boys High School if he returned to STC to complete the Bachelor of Arts that he had abandoned a decade before.|$|E

5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become something akin to an Ustaše version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime saw this as a more effective way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing the children outright. However, the NDH regime had <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to do something for the children. NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea that the children were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E
5|$|Winger Simon Russell {{signed for}} the club from Kidderminster Harriers. York drew 2–2 away to Northwich Victoria, which saw the team fight back on two {{occasions}} after twice being a goal down, with Brodie scoring his first goal of the season. He then scored in the third minute against Barrow, who equalised seven minutes later through Lee Hunt, in a home match that finished a 1–1 home draw. Beadle was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Whitby Town for a month, having <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> appearances in 2008–09. Sodje scored with a late volley after coming off the bench to give York a 1–1 draw away to Torquay United to maintain the team's unbeaten record, which looked under threat after Danny Stevens gave Torquay the lead on 65 minutes. Sodje's goal against Torquay won the first Conference Premier Goal of the Month competition, for August 2008.|$|E
5|$|Rankine {{missed an}} 87th-minute penalty for York away to Kettering, with Reed scoring the team's goal in a 1–1 draw. Jonathan Smith {{scored in the}} first half for York at home to league-leaders Crawley, who {{equalised}} in the second half, with the match finishing a 1–1 draw. Racchi was released from his contract with immediate effect after requesting a transfer, having failed to establish himself in the team. York beat Newport 2–1 at home, with Rankine opening the scoring before assisting Reed for the second goal. McGurk picked up an ankle ligament injury in this match, which ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season. York suffered their first defeat at home since December 2010 after losing 2–1 to Tamworth, in which Constantine scored a consolation goal in the 89th minute. Having <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> appearances for the club, Chippendale was recalled by Huddersfield. Reed scored the only goal to give York a 1–0 victory at home to Luton. Young was recalled from his loan at Altrincham after Parslow suffered a head injury during the match against Luton.|$|E

5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in sunny and hot weather conditions Michael Schumacher clinched the first pole position of the season and the 24th of his career, with a time of 1:20.974 on his second run. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen who set a lap 0.076 seconds slower in the closing seconds of qualifying. Barrichello qualified third, and felt that his car did not feel good having <b>not</b> <b>made</b> <b>any</b> changes. Coulthard secured fourth position, despite losing time early in qualifying because of a fuel pressure problem. He decided against taking his team's spare car set up for Häkkinen because he believed it would take up time and had to run more fuel throughout the remainder of the session. Ralf Schumacher qualified fifth and he was suffering from excessive oversteer which prevented him from setting a quicker lap time but was delighted with his starting position. Villeneuve secured sixth position and said he achieved the best from his car. Both Jordan drivers lined up the fourth row of the grid (with Trulli ahead of Frentzen) and believed they could have a better starting position because of windy conditions. de la Rosa and Irvine rounded out the top ten fastest drivers, with de la Rosa confident of finishing in a higher position in his home country. Later on Saturday afternoon, a fuel sample from de la Rosa's car was analysed and declared illegal by the FIA and Arrows announced that it would appeal the decision, allowing de la Rosa to retain his starting position. Button, eleventh, reported his car felt unstable due to the windy conditions. He was ahead of Verstappen in the slower of the two Arrows, Salo in the faster Sauber, and Fisichella. Herbert, fifteenth, lost his front wing mounted camera after hitting a kerb {{in the early part of}} qualifying and made a minor mistake which prevented him from starting higher up the field. Diniz had excessive oversteer and managed sixteenth place. Ricardo Zonta managed seventeenth after he was unable to find a set-up which suited him and his fastest time was nine-tenths of a second slower than teammate Villeneuve. Alesi qualified eighteenth, ahead of Wurz in nineteenth. Heidfeld had engine problems and had to use the spare Prost monocoque and took 20th position. The two Minardi drivers Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane qualified at the rear of the field in positions 21 and 22.|$|E
