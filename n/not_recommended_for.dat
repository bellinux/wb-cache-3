5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium is <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> muscular paralysis {{as it may}} {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis. Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii {{mushrooms}} can {{be recognized}} by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the stipe, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury. Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the amber-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the mushrooms are considered edible, they are generally <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E.frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology.|$|E

5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or big red, is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> consumption.|$|E
5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for {{no longer than}} three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with the}} development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing antibiotic resistance. Dapsone is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{treatment}} for some symptoms may be required. One {{of the most}} important treatments is the control of agitation due to the extreme possibility of injury to the person themselves or caregivers, benzodiazepines should be administered at first sign of this. Physical restraints are <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> agitation or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing isometric muscle contractions that are associated with severe lactic acidosis and hyperthermia. If physical restraints are necessary for severe agitation they must be rapidly replaced with pharmacological sedation. The agitation can cause a large amount of muscle breakdown. This breakdown can cause severe damage to the kidneys through a condition called rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|The mushroom's {{common names}} {{refer to the}} {{gastrointestinal}} distress they cause when consumed raw. The flesh is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, can be removed by parboiling or pickling. Although {{it used to be}} widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries, it is generally <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> consumption. There are many similar Russula species that have a red cap with white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished from R.emetica only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> use together.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E

5|$|Boletellus ananas, {{commonly}} known as the pineapple bolete, is a mushroom in the family Boletaceae, and the type species of the genus Boletellus. It is distributed in southeastern North America, northeastern South America, Asia, and New Zealand, where it grows scattered or in groups on the ground, often at the base of oak and pine trees. The fruit body is characterized by the reddish-pink (or pinkish-tan to yellowish if an older specimen) scales on the cap that are often found hanging from the edge. The pore surface {{on the underside of the}} cap is made of irregular or angular pores up to 2mm wide that bruise a blue color. It is yellow when young but ages to a deep olive-brown color. Microscopically, B.ananas is distinguished by large spores with cross striae on the ridges and spirally encrusted hyphae in the marginal appendiculae and flesh of the stem. Previously known as Boletus ananas and Boletus coccinea (among other synonyms), the species was given its current name by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909. Two varieties of Boletellus ananas have been described. Although the mushroom may be considered edible, it is <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> consumption.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
