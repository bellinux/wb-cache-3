40|$|Sweden {{has only}} one {{indigenous}} species of crayfish, the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Astacus astacus, Fabricius). There has been a steady decline of <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> populations in Sweden since 1907, mainly due to the crayfish plague. To substitute the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> fishery lost, the Swedish government launched a large-scale introduction of the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus Dana). Today, the signal crayfish {{is regarded as a}} chronic carrier of the crayfish plague, and an expansion of the species may seriously threaten the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish.</b> This paper examines the decrease of <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> populations, and the concurrent expansion of signal crayfish in running waters. Data from the Swedish Electrofishing RegiSter (SERS) was used. We found that in 1980 – 1984 the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> occurred in 4. 5 % of the studied river sections.

We studied the number of stocking permits for signal crayfish introductions, and the available signal crayfish population from the open fishery in Lake Vättern, as possible causes of this expansion. A negative correlation between stocking permits and increased occurrence in streams, and a positive correlation between the availability of crayfish in Lake Vättern and the occurrence in streams was found.

Narrow-clawed crayfish has also been present {{at least since the}} beginning of the 20 th century. In total there are current information on crayfish from 258 localities in Latvia. Most of these localities are lakes (175), but many crayfish populations are also found in river and streams (66). A few populations are found in reservoirs, ponds and gravel-pits. The <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Astacus astacus) is the dominant crayfish species and widely distributed in all regions of Latvia. 220 out of 258 crayfish localities contain only <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish.</b> The situation is much the same as in the 1960 s, the most obvious change being that more <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> populations are established in the area south of Riga. The narrowclawed crayfish has expanded its distribution since the 1960 s when it was reported in 13 localities.

40|$|Crayfish {{trapping}} {{and activities}} related to crayfishing have traditionally been lucrative businesses in rural Finland. The catch itself, varying in the 1990 ’s from 2 to 4 millions crayfish annually, is worth 4 to 8 millions euros.

The catch has so far been mainly <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Astacus astacus) but stockings with signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) during the past 15 years have started to produce commercial scale catches in Southern Finland. This has had a strong impact on commercial markets and has encouraged stocking of signal crayfish to an increasing number of water bodies, both legally and illegally. <b>Noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> stocks, on the other hand, have suffered from crayfish plague (Aphanomyces astaci) and watercourse construction. Up to 10 commercially productive <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> stocks have been infected with crayfish plague annually.

40|$|Since 1907, {{coinciding with}} the arrival of the {{crayfish}} plague, the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Astacus astacus) has steadily declined in Sweden. To substitute the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> fishery lost, mainly due to the plague, and since the species is highly susceptible to the disease, the Swedish government started a large-scale introduction of the American signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in the end of the 1960 ’s. The signal crayfish is a chronic carrier of crayfish plague (Aphanomyces astaci), and it is likely that the introduction of this species has had an effect on the spread of the disease to the remaining <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> populations. 6, 961 crayfish plague outbreaks were recorded between the years 1907 - 2004. 65 % of the recorded outbreaks (4, 531 records) occurred after 1969. The legislation for giving licenses to stock signal crayfish has gone from being restrictive in the end of the 1960 ’s, to becoming quite liberal in the 1980 ’s, and to becoming more restrictive again starting in 1994. From 1983 - 1994 the number of licenses increased with over 500 % (from 536 to 3, 000). This coincides with the largest number of recorded crayfish plague outbreaks ever. To assess the relationship between the large-scale introduction of signal crayfish, the spread of crayfish plague, and the steady decline of <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> populations in Swedish waters, we compared the number of outbreaks between two 20 -year periods, before and after the introduction of the signal crayfish.

40|$|Crayfish plague is {{a severe}} disease of European {{crayfish}} species and has rendered the indigenous crayfish populations vulnerable, endangered or even extinct {{in the most}} of Europe. Crayfish plague is caused by an oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, a fungal-like water mould that lives its vegetative life in the cuticle of crayfish and infects other crayfish by producing zoospores. Zoospores swim around {{for a few days}} in search of crayfish, and when they find one they attach onto its surface, encyst and germinate to start a new growth cycle as new growing hyphae penetrate the crayfish tissues. Unrestricted growth of A. astaci leads to the death of the infected animal in just a few weeks. Crayfish plague induced mortalities started in Italy around 1860. Although the disease was known about since 1860 its cause remained unknown for several decades. Little was done {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease. A lively crayfish trade probably facilitated the spread of the crayfish plague, which reached Finland in 1893. The crayfish plague has remained the most important disease problem of the Finnish <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> Astacus astacus, since then. The consensus was that the disease killed all infected animals in a short time, and it appeared almost impossible to restore the flourishing crayfish populations to the levels that existed before. Following the example of neighbouring Sweden, a North American crayfish species, the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus that appeared resistant to crayfish plague was introduced to Finland in 1960 s. As expected, the signal crayfish slowly started to replace the lost populations of the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> to become an important part of the crayfish fisheries. The introduction of the signal crayfish significantly added to the management problems of the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> stocks left. Signal crayfish appeared to be a chronic carrier of the crayfish plague agent, and spread the disease to the dwindling vulnerable <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> populations. Later research showed that the crayfish plague agent is a parasite of North American crayfish that in normal circumstances does not harm the host animal. Intriguingly, the crayfish plague agent carried by the signal crayfish, genotype Ps 1, is different from the pathogen originally introduced into Europe, genotype As. The diagnosis of crayfish plague especially when based on the isolation of the pathogen is challenging and accordingly the genotype difference was mostly unrecognized until recently. In this study we determined the genotype of the causative agent from most of the detected Finnish crayfish plague cases between 1996 - 2006. It appeared that most of the epidemics in the immediate vicinity of signal crayfish populations were caused by genotype Ps 1, whereas genotype As was more prevalent in the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> areas. Interestingly, a difference was seen in the outcome of the infection. The Ps 1 infection was always associated with acute mortalities, while As infections were also frequently found in existing but weak populations. The persistent nature of an As infection could be verified in <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> from a small lake in southern Finland. This finding explained why many of the efforts to introduce a new <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> population into a water body after a crayfish plague induced mortality were futile. The main conclusion from the field study data of this research was the difference in virulence between the Ps 1 and As genotype strains. This was also verified in a challenge trial with <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish.</b> While the Ps 1 strains did not show much variation in their growth behaviour or virulence, there was much more variation in the As strains. The As genotype arrived in Finland more than 100 years ago, and since that date it seems to have adapted to the novel host, the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish,</b> to some extent. In order to gain insight into a possible vector of this genotype, we studied another North American crayfish species present in Europe, the spiny-cheek crayfish Orconectes limosus from a Czech pond. This crayfish species appeared to carry a novel genotype of A. astaci, named Orconectes genotype, designated “Or”. It seems possible that many of the North American crayfish species carry their own type of crayfish plague agent, with variable features such as virulence. These differences should be further tested in the future. The results of this study alleviate the necessity to study the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> mortalities for the verification of crayfish plague, including the study for the genotype of the A. astaci strain. Crayfish fisheries and conservation management decisions should not be made without a prior control of the donating population and the receiving water body for the eventual presence of a low-virulent A. astaci...|$|E
40|$|The {{crayfish}} plague pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci, {{is one of}} the most serious threats to European indigenous crayfish species, e. g., the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Astacus astacus). The only way to protect susceptible crayfish species from the disease is to prevent the dispersion of the pathogen to their populations. One of the most important sources of the {{crayfish plague}} pathogen in Central Europe is the spiny-cheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus), a species of North American origin, which can carry the parasite in its cuticle for years. Some literature sources claimed that the pathogen dispersion from the American vectors is restricted to periods of moulting or to the time before and after the crayfish death. However, experimental evidence for such hypotheses was lacking. The main aim of my thesis was to test these predictions, and the alternative scenario that the crayfish plague pathogen can be transmitted from the infected spiny-cheek crayfish also in other periods. For this purpose, experiments were set up to investigate A. astaci transmission from infected spiny-cheek crayfish to non-infected spiny-cheek or <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish.</b> As expected, the pathogen was transmitted to <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> much more easily than to the uninfected American host.

Chara seems to be particularly vulnerable since it is preferred by crayfish and the genus contains {{a large number of}} rare species. The occurrence of signal crayfish thus harbors a higher risk of reduction or even extinction of submersed plants than that of the native and less voracious <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> [22].|$|E
40|$|One central goal of {{conservation}} biology is to conserve the genetic diversity of species {{in order to}} protect their adaptive potential. The main objective {{of this study was to}} identify management units (MUs) for the threatened <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Astacus astacus) in Western Europe by utilizing sequence and microsatellite analysis to determine populations in need of focused conservation programs. With the analysis of <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> from 31 sampling sites from Belgium, France, The Netherlands and Germany, and further comparison of this data with a European-wide dataset, we propose four distinct MUs: the French Meuse (MU 1), the French Rhine (MU 2), the Belgian Scheldt and Meuse (MU 3) as well as populations from the French Seine (MU 4). This knowledge enables advanced A. astacus conservation management practises in these catchments by distinguishing between outbreeding and inbreeding populations and by preserving the maximum genetic diversity. When required, a high genetic diversity can be conserved by strengthen existing populations via stocking with populations that either bear the most common haplotype or population-specific private haplotypes in order to maintain recent and regional adaptions. Above all, stocking with populations that exhibit haplotypes from outside Western Europe should be avoided in these catchments. This study supports the preservation of the genetic diversity of <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> in Western Europe and provides thus a proposition for advanced conservation management. </p...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been carried out to {{understand}} reproductive biology of invasive crayfish. Many researchers have described how invasive species establish their population in new habitats, interactions between native and invasive species, their fast spreading, changing of behavior and biology especially reproductive behavior and even genetics. But it seems that there are still lots of questions and gaps which need to be addressed in case of invasive crayfish species. This thesis tried to focus on different aspects of reproduction biology of invasive crayfish. Generally, the normal crayfish reproduction mode is gonochorism. But, it has been showed in the literature that a few species such as Cherax quadricarinatus, Samastacus spinifrons, Parastacus virilastacus and Pacifastacus leniusculus may have different reproduction modes such as hermaphroditism or intersex. Parthenogenesis has been found in Procambarus fallax f. virginalis. Also, apomictic parthenogenesis has been reported in Orconectes limosus. Moreover, there have been several manipulations which directly affect reproduction biology of crayfish under lab conditions. Additionally, hybridization can be expected between Astacus astacus and Astacus leptodactylus, Orconectes rusticus and Orconectes propinquus under natural conditions. Some studies supposed that chemical factors also one of the reasons which could lead to some changes in reproductive system of crayfish. The objective of the Chapter 2 was to report first evidence of intersex in the signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana, 1852). That specimen appeared morphologically male but with both male and female genital openings, as well. Spermophores were obtained from vas defertia of this speciemen. Histological study was carried out and it has shown that both spermatophores and oocytes were present. The gonadosomatic index showed that intersex male had a GSI three times more higher than normal males. The ultrastructure of spermatozoa in three cambarid species Cambarus robustus, Orconectes propinquus, Orconectes rusticus were described and compered with eight previously studied species from family of Astacidae, Cambaridae and Parastacidae. In the studied cambarids, the crest-like protrusions in the anterior part of the acrosome {{is one of the most}} remarkable differences in case of morphological feature in spermatozoa and can be used for distinguishing the members of Cambaridae. The results of biometrical data showed that the smallest and biggest acrosome sizes in the studied species were in Parastacidae and Astacidae, respectively. The duration of post-mating spermatophore storage as well as the timing and temperature of spawning in two crayfish species (Pacifastacus leniusculus and Astacus astacus) were investigated in the Chapter 4. Seventy-one pairs of adult signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and thirty six pairs of <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Astacus astacus) were used for experiment. The results indicated that there was a significant difference (P< 0. 05) between <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> and signal crayfish in average duration of the post-mating spermatophore storage. The duration of the post-mating spermatophore storage is longer in the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> with 34. 6 ? 1. 7 days than the signal crayfish with 3. 9 ? 0. 5 days. There were also differences in the timing of mating and egg laying between the signal crayfish and <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish.</b> In the population of signal crayfish both mating and egg laying overlapped, but in the population of <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> there was at least two weeks gap between last mating and first egg laying individuals. Water temperature was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher during mating and egg laying in the signal crayfish than the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish.</b> The average temperatures for mating in both species were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than the temperatures that they utilized for egg laying. As a conclusion more research is needed for better understand of the reproduction strategies in invasive crayfish...|$|E
40|$|Summary The <b>Noble</b> <b>{{crayfish}},</b> Astacus astacus (also {{called the}} European crayfish or the broad-fingered crayfish) {{used to be}} the most common crayfish species in Sweden and Europe. It is susceptible to the crayfish plague, Aphanomyces astaci, and since 1907, when the first outbreak of crayfish plague was noted in Sweden, the Swedish <b>Noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> population has decreased with 97 %. The pattern is the same in all of Europe. To compensate for the diminishing <b>Noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> populations, Signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus was introduced into Europe (in Sweden in 1960). However, despite its resistance to crayfish plague, it still acts as a carrier of the disease. Thus, the introduction of the Signal crayfish may have accelerated the extinction rate of native crayfish populations. In Europe, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species classifies the <b>Noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> as vulnerable. In Sweden the prospects for the crayfish are even worse, and the Official Swedish Red List classifies the <b>Noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> as Critical Endangered (based on the IUCN Red List criteria), facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future. The Swedish island of Gotland, situated in the Baltic Sea, is the first protected area in Sweden for the <b>Noble</b> <b>crayfish.</b> No known outbreaks of crayfish plague have been confirmed on Gotland, and Gotland {{is considered one of the}} very few areas left in Sweden that are not exposed to the crayfish plague. However, on Gotland there are three confirmed water bodies where Signal crayfish has been illegally introduced. The County Administrative Board on Gotland was given the formal commission to exterminate any occurring populations of the Signal crayfish, as they can be carriers of the crayfish plague. This report contains of the actions taken to eliminate the Signal crayfish populations on Gotland during the years 2007 – 2009. The three localities where Signal crayfish occurs, including the ponds and the surrounding environment, was firmly investigated concerning the physical property and the composition of the ecosystem. The ponds where then treated with a pesticide containing the active substance deltamethrin, with the aim of extinguishing all Signal crayfish. Deltamethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, widely used on crops, as it is stable, less volatile and environmentally compatible. The toxicity on mammals, including humans, and bird is relatively low as compared to other pesticides, while it has been shown to be lethal to arthropods in very low concentrations. The ponds were treated with a dose aimed to reach a concentration of 0. 5 μg deltamethrin/l to obtain lethal doses. The outcome of the extermination of the signal crayfish in the three localities on Gotland was successful so far. No live crayfish was found after the treatment, and all crayfish that were placed in cages in the ponds to control for the effectiveness of the pesticide treatment died. The concentration of deltamethrin declined rapidly and reached values below 0. 1 μg/l, the European Union drinking water limit, within one or a couple of weeks. The final succes of these actions is still uncertain as surviving individuals may take several years to detect. Inspections at all sites during the following years need to be carried out in order to determine if the Signal crayfish was completely exterminated from Gotland. ...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{literature}} review and new studies in Brandenburg, northeast Germany, the status and the genetic structure of the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> Astacus astacus (L.) in Germany are described. The present situation is characterized by a patchy distribution comprising at least 719 stocks, documented after 1990. Stocks are rnainly confined to the uppermost stretches of small streams or to small lakes without connection to other surface waters. As is typical of Europe, geographical isolation, inbreeding and genetic drift may {{play an important role in}} the population structure of the <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> in Germany. By means of RAPD-PCR, stocks in Brandenburg (Br 1, Br 2 and Br 3), Schleswig-Holstein (SH) and Bavaria (B 1 and B 2) were analysed for their genetic structure. RAPD markers show high ability to separate significantly all investigated stocks as single populations. Mean non-dimensional distances were 5. 8, 5. 6 and 4. 2 for SH-B, SH-Br and B-Br between-region cornparisons, respectively. Values for within-region comparisons were 3. 1 and 1. 3 for B-B and Br-Br, respectively. However, even the three different lakes located in Brandenburg, which are only about 20 km apart from each other, contained significantly distinguishable populations. So far it is not possible to judge whether the distinct populations result frorn isolation of stocks or indicate local adaptations to the specific environmental conditions. The answer to this question is important with respect to conservational management and the design of restocking programmes. A decision tree for the inventory and monitoring of <b>noble</b> <b>crayfish</b> stocks is suggested, since some areas in the northeast of Germany rnay still contain rnany unknown stocks, which are of considerable importance for conservation...|$|E
