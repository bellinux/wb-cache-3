40|$|A {{new series}} of {{physical}} model tests were conducted to analyse the behaviour of a breakwater core when it becomes exposed to wave attack. The emphasis {{of this research was}} on the measured influence of a wide stone grading on both the deformation of a breakwater trunk and the occurring longshore transport. This behaviour was investigated for both head-on and oblique waves using two different wave loads. The findings were compared to the currently available formulas and the validity of these formulas for the tested range of parameters was (re) checked. In general a clear distinction was found in the processes between tests with <b>narrow</b> <b>grading</b> and wide grading. It turned out that both the parameters describing the two-dimensional deformation and the longshore transport show an increase for wider grading.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of unsaturated soil mechanics into engineering practice is dependent, {{to a large}} extent, upon the ability to estimate unsaturated soil property functions. The soil-water characteristic curve {{is the basis for}} estimating the permeability function for an unsaturated soil. The negative pore pressure measurement is costly, time consuming, insufficiently reliable and needs highly accurate techniques to be measured. However, a theoretical model can introduce a perfect solution to understand the behavior of unsaturated soil when testing is difficult. A theoretical model based on the microscopic forces is presented in this paper. The model describes the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) and how the water is held within a porous material with a relatively low degree of saturation. Experimental measurements of capillarity and negative pore water pressure were obtained for the columns of glass beads and soil within a <b>narrow</b> <b>grading</b> range. An estimated curve for the degree of saturation versus matrix suction is obtained and compared to a predicted theoretical curve using the model proposed in this study. The proposed method seems to provide a reasonable predictive tool...|$|E
40|$|In a {{glasshouse}} experiment it {{was examined}} whether <b>narrow</b> <b>grading</b> and selection from a commercial soybean seed lot cultivar ‘IAS- 5 ’, could improve the uniformity of the seed crop grown {{from it and}} thereby enhance yield, quality and uniformity of seeds produced. The classes created were: Control (original seed lot); Size-graded seeds (projected area measured by image analysis 37 – 46 mm 2); Non-cracked seeds; Yellow seeds; Size-graded sound seeds (size-graded, non-cracked, yellow, non-wrinkled, non-etched). Compared to the control, percentage of emergence, survival and number of yielding plants were enhanced in crops from non-cracked, yellow or size-graded sound seeds. Differences in plant numbers {{did not result in}} differences in crop yield. The different seed lots also did not differ in crop uniformity: time interval between stages of plant development, plant height 20 days after sowing, yield components, physical or physiological quality attributes of seeds produced, and respective coefficients of variation were similar. Fewer plants survived in crops showing a larger variation in plant height 20 days after sowing, thus reducing differences in initial plant-to-plant variation. Creating more uniform crops by additional grading or selection of commercial seed lots may therefore not be promising...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{behaviour}} of a falling apron made from 'poorly sorted' material. It is a follow-up of a report, which was made by a Dutch student, Marc van der Hoeven, with the title: "The behaviour of a falling apron". In {{the end of the}} last century a complex river training work had to be done in con- nection with the construction of the Jamuna Bridge in Bangladesh crossing one of the largest rivers of the world. The Jamuna River has a strong changing character and the morphological behaviour is difficult to predict. By means of two banana-formed guide bunds the span of the bridge could be reduced from 15 km to 5 km. The constriction forced to an additional protection of the guide bunds. At the toe loose rock material was dumped, which 'fall' down' and covers the slope when erosion occurs. This is the reason why this kind of exibel protection is called 'falling apron'. In the previous study from Marc van der Hoeven only 'well sorted' material was used for the experiments, material with a <b>narrow</b> <b>grading.</b> In reality these falling aprons are made from material with a wide grading, called 'poorly sorted' material. For this reason a further study was demanded from the contractor Ballast-Ham-Dredging from the Netherlands. The experiments in a flume were mainly done with the aim to get information about the setting process of a falling apron, to determine the angle of the slope and the thickness of the protective layer after a ow attack. In two experiments it was found that the developing slope angle was approximately 1 : 2 and the setting process was evenly spread over the entire slope. A layer with an average thickness of the characteristic stone diameter of D 50 protected the emerging slope. This single layer does not stop the erosion, but it slows down the scour development and this even better in comparison to the 'well sorted' material. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|During the {{construction}} of breakwaters contractors often encounter undesired reshaping of exposed core material. This reshaping {{is comparable to the}} deformation process of berm breakwaters in which the outer profile reshapes into a more stable s-curve. In the case of oblique waves this deformation is enhanced by a longshore transport of stones leading to even more loss of material and damage. Throughout the years few formulas were derived for both processes which describe the behaviour of berm breakwaters as well as gravel beaches reasonably well. These formulas however turned out to be inadequate when it comes to describing the behaviour of core material. In particular the influence of the wide grading of quarry run, commonly used as core material, is to a large extent unknown and generally not described in the available relations. To investigate this influence of the stone grading on both the two-dimensional deformation and longshore transport new physical model tests were carried out in the wave basin at Delft University of Technology. In total 12 tests were executed in which two different gradings, three different angles of wave attack and two different wave spectra were tested. Data collected from the tests included wave and profile measurements together with the displacements of stones, originating from two colour beams which were applied {{in the middle of the}} trunk. These data along with visual observations eventually led to a conceptual model describing stone movements in both transverse and longshore direction. Using Matlab three-dimensional profile and erosion models were generated from which the different profile parameters were determined. With respect to the distance from origin, for each test an exponential relation was derived to describe the stone displacements. After determination of the area of uniform transport these exponential relations were used to calculate the total longshore transport by means of extrapolation and multiple integrations. Subsequently all parameters found were compared to the formulas currently available for both processes. Regarding the deformation parameters the test results produced the best fit with the formulas derived in [MERLI 2009]. Still on several occasions a deviant relation was found concerning the influence of wave obliquity. In addition, the formulas became less accurate for the <b>narrow</b> <b>grading</b> used in the tests, which fell outside the range tested by Merli. However, for the crest height of the deformed profile test results deviated completely from the available formula as no influence was found whatsoever for all tested parameters. Here the deviation was contributed to a higher instability of the part above the initial deformation, partly due to the steepness of the slope. On the subject of the longshore transport clear trends were found describing the influence of the varying parameters. Both a higher wave load and wider grading lead to an increase of the longshore transport. For the wider grading, however, this increase gave a rather distorted image, as not all fractions in the mixture were transported evenly. Due to segregation the coarsest fractions were mostly transported in the transverse direction while the finer fractions were transported further away in the longitudinal direction. Alternatively, computation of the longshore volume transport proved to be more representative. Regarding the effect of wave obliquity an increase in angle of wave attack of 30 to 45 degrees was accompanied by a decrease in longshore transport; though this decrease was less than already available formulas indicated. However despite the fact that it describes a completely different trend concerning this particular influence, the best fit was found after multiplying the relation derived by [ALIKHANI 1996] with a factor 100.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To compare {{radiographic}} reading {{procedures and}} evaluate {{their impact on}} sample size in hip osteoarthritis (OA) longitudinal studies.  METHODS—Pelvic radiographs performed twice, three years apart, in 104  patients with hip OA were read by a single reader using the Kellgren and Lawrence system, joint space narrowing scale, and joint space width (JSW). Reading procedures were (a) films read as single radiographs, (b) films grouped by patient but read in random order, (c) films grouped by patient and chronologically ordered, all with landmarks for JSW measurements, (d) films read as single radiographs, without landmarks for JSW measurements. JSW was measured at the narrowest point with a 0. 1  mm graduated magnifying glass.  RESULTS— More Kellgren and Lawrence or joint space <b>narrowing</b> <b>grades</b> were modified respectively with the single (42 % and 37 %) than with the paired (32 % and 23 %) or chronologically ordered (34 % and 29 %) reading procedures. Variability of JSW progression was principally related to mean progression (88. 3 %) and landmarks (almost 10 %). Standardised response means were − 0. 71 with the paired reading procedure with landmarks, − 0. 68 with the single reading procedure with landmarks, − 0. 65 with the single reading procedure without landmarks. With landmarks, 10 % more patients would be needed using single than paired reading. Using single reading, 10 % more patients would be needed without landmarks than with landmarks.  CONCLUSION—Kellgren and Lawrence grading seems {{to be influenced by}} the reading procedure, as is joint space <b>narrowing</b> <b>grading,</b> for assessing hip OA.

40|$|Purpose A {{possible}} cause of hip pain {{is the presence}} of radiating pain from the higher lumbar spine. Identification of factors associated with hip pain arising from the lumbar spine would aid the physician. The first step in identifying possible factors {{is to look at the}} association between hip pain and osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine. Methods In an open population based study of people 55 years and older (Rotterdam study), 2, 819 lumbar radiographs were scored for the presence and severity of individual radiographic features of disk degeneration. Hip osteoarthritis was scored on anteroposterior pelvic radiographs, and questionnaires including self-reported hip pain were taken. Logistic regression adjusted for possible confounders was used to determine the association between self-reported hip pain and the individual radiographic features of lumbar disk degeneration. Results The presence of dis space <b>narrowing</b> <b>grade</b> C 1 at level L 1 /L 2 was significantly associated with hip pain in the last month (men OR = 2. 0; 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 8 and women OR = 1. 7; 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 5). The presence of disk space <b>narrowing</b> <b>grade</b> C 1 at level L 2 /L 3 was only significantly associated with hip pain in women. The strength of the associations increased for self-reported chronic hip pain, especially in men (L 1 /L 2 OR = 2. 5; 95 % CI 1. 3 - 5. 0). The presence of disk space narrowing at the lower levels (L 3 /L 4 /L 5 /S 1) was not significantly associated with hip pain. Conclusion Our data provide evidence for an association between hip pain and disk space narrowing at disk level L 1 /L 2 and L 2 /L 3. In case of uncertainty of the cause of hip pain, evaluation of lumbar radiographs may help to identify those hip pain patients who might have pain arising from the lumbar spine...|$|R

We present experimental results of the deposition limit velocity collected during a comprehensive experimental campaign testing slurry flows composed of solids of different fractions in the GIW Hydraulic Laboratory in 2016. Four <b>narrow</b> <b>graded</b> fractions (carrier fluid, pseudo-homogeneous, heterogeneous, and stratified) were tested in permutations from the individual components to the complete mixture at various concentrations.

The experimental results show that interactions among components affect the resulting deposition limit velocity in flows of broadly graded settling slurries. The effect of particle size distribution on the deposition limit velocity is not benign.

To assess {{the effects of}} radiographic osteoarthritis (OA), gender and age on these outcomes in patients with meniscectomy. DESIGN: 159 subjects (35 women), mean age 53 years, were examined 19 (17 - 22) years after open meniscectomy. Self-reported symptoms and function were assessed, performance tests were carried out and radiographs were taken. Sixty-eight age- and gender-matched controls were examined likewise. The data was analysed in two steps. First, subjects with meniscectomy were compared to the controls, and subgroup analyses were carried out with regard to radiographic OA, gender and age.

The radiographs were graded for joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and sclerosis and the joint space width was measured by a digitised image analyser. Serum COMP and BSP were quantified by immunoassays.  RESULTS—The COMP concentrations at baseline correlated with the joint space width at entry and with its yearly mean narrowing (r =  0. 38, p =  0. 002) but not with joint space <b>narrowing</b> <b>grade</b> progression. The concentrations were higher in patients with bilateral hip OA (p =  0. 03). The serum BSP concentrations at baseline were unrelated to OA progression but correlated inversely to the osteophyte grade (r = − 0. 36, p =  0. 004) and sclerosis grade (r = − 0. 42, p =  0. 0004).  CONCLUSION—Serum COMP {{seems to be a}} surrogate marker of OA and may be of interest for the detection of patients at risk of rapidly progressing disease in hip OA.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the level, degree and shape of obstruction of the upper airway in patients with OSAS by sleep endoscopy and their relation to OSAS severity. Patients and methods: Fifty consecutive patients with OSAS were prospectively enrolled in this cross sectional analytic study. All patients underwent history, a full night-attended polysomnography and sleep endoscopy. The degree of pharyngeal <b>narrowing</b> (<b>grades</b> I–IV) was evaluated at retropalatal, retroglossal and hypopharyngeal levels. Shape of pharyngeal collapse was classified into circular, lateral or antero-posterior at retropalatal and retroglossal levels. Shape of the epiglottis was also observed. Results: All patients showed multisegmental levels of obstruction. Moderate OSAS had a higher percentage of grade II obstruction but a lower percentage of grade I at hypopharyngeal level compared to mild OSAS (P <  0. 05). Also, in moderate OSAS, tongue base obstruction was 47. 4 % which was significantly higher comparing to mild OSAS (16. 7 %) (P <  0. 05). There was no significant difference between different grades of obstruction at all anatomical levels in polysomnographic parameters. Omega shaped epiglottis was associated with the highest apnea hypopnea index, desaturation index, lowest average and minimum O 2 level.

However, in most subjects, MRI revealed osteophytes and cartilage and bone marrow lesions in both knees, and using ROC analysis, no individual structural feature discriminated well between painful and nonpainful knees. The best-performing MRI feature (synovitis/effusion) was not significantly more informative than K/L grade ≥ 2 (P = 0. 42). CONCLUSION: In persons with unilateral knee pain, MRI and radiographic features were associated with knee pain, confirming that structural abnormalities in the knee have {{an important role in the}} etiology of pain. However, no single MRI or radiographic finding performed well in discriminating between painful and nonpainful knees. Further work is needed to examine how structural and nonstructural factors influence knee pain...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between luminal stenosis measured by coronary CT angiography (CCTA) {{and severity of}} stress-induced ischemia seen on single photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) is not clearly defined. We sought to evaluate the {{relationship between}} stenosis severity assessed by CCTA and ischemia on SPECT-MPI. ECG-gated CCTA (64 slice dual source CT) and SPECT-MPI were performed within 6  months in 292 patients (ages 26 - 91, 73 % male) with no prior history of coronary artery disease. Maximal coronary luminal <b>narrowing,</b> <b>graded</b> as 0, ≥ 25 %, 50 %, 70 %, or 90 % visual diameter reduction, was consensually assessed by two expert readers. Perfusion defect on SPECT-MPI was assessed by computer-assisted visual interpretation by an expert reader using the standard 17 segment, 5 point-scoring model (stress perfusion defect of ≥ 5 % = abnormal). By SPECT-MPI, abnormal perfusion was seen in 46 / 292 patients. With increasing stenosis severity, positive predictive value (PPV) increased (42 %, 51 %, and 74 %, P = . 01) and negative predictive value was relatively unchanged (97 %, 95 %, and 91 %) in detecting perfusion abnormalities on SPECT-MPI. In a receiver operator curve analysis, stenosis of 50 % and 70 % were equally effective in differentiating between the presence and absence of ischemia. In a multivariate analysis that included stenosis severity, multivessel disease, plaque composition, and presence of serial stenoses in a coronary artery, the strongest predictors of ischemia were stenosis of 50 - 89 %, odds ratio (OR) 7. 31, P = . 001, stenosis ≥ 90 %, OR 34. 05, P = . 0001, and serial stenosis ≥ 50 % OR of 3. 55, P = . 006. The PPV of CCTA for ischemia by SPECT-MPI rises as stenosis severity increases. Luminal stenosis ≥ 90 % on CCTA strongly predicts ischemia, while < 50 % stenosis strongly predicts the absence of ischemia. Serial stenosis of ≥ 50 % in a vessel may offer incremental value in addition to stenosis severity in predicting ischemia...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{explore the}} {{association}} between S 100 A 8 /A 9 serum levels with clinical and structural characteristics of patients with established knee, hip, or hand osteoarthritis (OA). METHOD: A cross-sectional exploratory {{study was conducted with}} 162 OA patients. Measures for pain, stiffness, and function included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) questionnaire or the Australian Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand (AUSCAN) Index and for structural abnormalities, osteophytes and joint space <b>narrowing</b> <b>grades.</b> The association between S 100 A 8 /A 9 and clinical or structural characteristics was analysed using linear regression or logistic regression where appropriate. RESULTS: The mean age of the OA patients was 56 years, 71 % were female, and 61 % had a Kellgren and Lawrence (K&L) score >/= 2. The serum S 100 A 8 /A 9 level did not differ between knee, hip, and hand OA patients and no association was found between serum S 100 A 8 /A 9 and clinical characteristics. The serum S 100 A 8 /A 9 level was negatively associated with the sum score of osteophytes after adjusting for sex and body mass index (BMI) [adjusted beta - 0. 015, 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 030 to 0. 001, p = 0. 062] and positively associated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) > 12 mm/h (adjusted OR 1. 002, 95 % CI 1. 000 - 1. 004 p = 0. 049) for each increase in S 100 A 8 /A 9 of 1 ng/mL. For hand OA patients, a negative association of S 100 A 8 /A 9 with sum score of joint space narrowing was found (adjusted beta - 0. 007, 95 % CI - 0. 016 to 0. 001, p = 0. 099). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this cross-sectional exploratory study do not support an important role for serum S 100 A 8 /A 9 levels as a biomarker for clinical and structural characteristics in established knee, hip, and hand OA patients. The inverse association with structural abnormalities and the positive association with ESR may reflect inflammatory synovial processes in patients with OA before structural abnormalities occur...|$|R
30|$|This {{study and}} the {{corresponding}} inferences should also be interpreted in light of its limitations. Both the LS and QR models are estimated considering variables at student level, hence the multilevel structure of data (i.e. pupils within classes/school) is not taken into account. In fact, future avenues could be to assess how class and school level variables might affect pupils’ performance according to the different levels of ability by adopting a quantile multilevel regression perspective. Furthermore, this study is based on cross-sectional data. Future researches might investigate inequalities in their emerging, widening or <b>narrowing</b> from early <b>grades</b> {{to the end of}} primary school through a longitudinal study design.|$|R
40|$|Introduction To be able {{to predict}} which {{patients}} {{are more likely to}} have a positive treatment outcome, the purpose of this study is 1 : To compare outcomes after intra-articular corticosteroid knee injections with the Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) 5 and 3 grading systems for knee osteoarthritis, the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) grading system and actual joint space measurements; and 2 : To compare the reliability of these grading systems. Materials and Methods Knee radiographs of 117 patients who received intra-articular corticosteroid injections were independently evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the outcome. Evaluation included the KL 5, KL 3, OARSI systems and actual joint space widths. The numerical rating scale for pain was collected at baseline and along with the Patient's Global Impression of Change on day 1, in week 1 and in month 1. The number of 'improved' patients was compared between the OA grades using the Chi-square test. Logistic regression determined which findings were predictive for improvement. Agreement was assessed using Kappa statistics and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Patients with OARSI grade 2 reported the highest rates of 'improvement' at all time points, which was significant on day 1 (p =  0. 004). No relationship with improvement was found with KL 5, KL 3 or actual joint space measurements. Patients with OARSI grade 2 were 8 times more likely to report improvement on day 1 (p =  0. 024). Reliability was best for joint space measurements (ICC =  0. 812  -  0. 882), followed by the OARSI. Conclusion The OARSI for joint space <b>narrowing</b> <b>grade</b> 2  (34  -  66  % narrowing) was linked with a better outcome on day 1 with trends in week 1 and month 1. The reliability of the OARSI was better than the KL 5 or KL 3 systems. Key Points  · OARSI grading of OA had better reliability than KL 3 or KL 5 [...] · OARSI grade 2 was related to a better treatment outcome [...] · Neither KL grades nor joint space measurements were related to improvement [...] Citation Format · Miletic I, Agten C, Sutter R et al.
