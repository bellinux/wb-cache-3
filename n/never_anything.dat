500|$|The deriding {{reactions}} {{of the members of}} the upper class watching Robin and his colleagues' performance would have been familiar to even the more professional actors in Shakespeare's day. Some scholars have seen in Theseus' words about the performance a note of sympathy and pleading the cause of the actor: [...] "For <b>never</b> <b>anything</b> can be amiss / when simpleness and duty tender it..." ...|$|E
500|$|The Coens, however, {{have denied}} any intent {{to create a}} {{systematic}} unity from symbols in the film. [...] "We never, ever go into our films with anything like that in mind", Joel said in a 1998 interview. [...] "There's <b>never</b> <b>anything</b> approaching that kind of specific intellectual breakdown. It's always a bunch of instinctive things that feel right, for whatever reason". The Coens have noted their comfort with unresolved ambiguity. Ethan said in 1991: [...] "Barton Fink does end up telling you what's going on {{to the extent that}} it's important to know... What isn't crystal clear isn't intended to become crystal clear, and it's fine to leave it at that." [...] Regarding fantasies and dream sequences, he said: ...|$|E
500|$|Rick Kogan, {{television}} critic {{with the}} Chicago Tribune, called the show [...] "wholly original" [...] and {{an example of}} how good television entertainment can be. He praised the ensemble cast and interesting characters, and said the show would be renewed [...] "if there's any justice in TV". Ray Richmond of the Los Angeles Daily News praised NBC for giving Homicide a second chance, comparing it to the days when NBC stuck with the comedy series Cheers even though it ranked last in the ratings during its first season. Richmond said of Homicide: [...] "This {{is also one of the}} final opportunities to see a television network stick with a struggling show for no better reason than it deserves to be stuck with. In the bottom line-driven 1990s, that's become as rare as quality itself. [...] " [...] Steven Cole Smith with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said of the evaluation period during Homicides second season: [...] "If you don't watch it, you may lose your right to complain that there's <b>never</b> <b>anything</b> good on TV." [...] He called it [...] "a gritty, atmospheric police series" [...] and complimented it for showing not only gratuitous violence but the consequences of it.|$|E

500|$|John Ford {{reportedly}} once commented in {{a letter}} that O'Hara was the finest actress in Hollywood, but he rarely praised her in person. Bertrand Tavernier, on the contrary, professed that O'Hara {{was one of the}} actresses he most detested. [...] Though she was quite proud of her own versatility as an actress, saying [...] "I played every kind of role. I was never petite or cute so there was <b>never</b> <b>anything</b> about me which would go out of style", critics found fault with her range. Malone wrote that she [...] "seemed to struggle in comedic roles but proved her mettle in films that called on her to take charge of situations or find courage in the face of adversity". One critic remarked that it took a director like John Ford to bring out a good performance from her. [...] The Irish critic Philip Moloy thought the opposite, saying [...] "It is not something that she would accept herself, but Maureen O'Hara's career probably suffered from its long-term association with John Ford. John Ford's view of Ireland, and things Irish, tended to be broad, sentimental and sociologically distorted, and his characters were often cliched representatives of their nationality". In the 1960s, O'Hara ventured into maturer roles as she aged.|$|E

Dr. Spitzka had stated that it was clear [...] "Guiteau is not only now insane, {{but that he was}} <b>never</b> <b>anything</b> else." [...] While on the stand, Spitzka testified that he had [...] "no doubt" [...] that Guiteau was both insane and [...] "a moral monstrosity". Spitzka came to the {{conclusion}} that Guiteau had [...] "the insane manner" [...] he had so often observed in asylums, adding that Guiteau was a [...] "morbid egotist" [...] with [...] "a tendency to misinterpret the real affairs of life".

Entire families perished and the death rate is extremely high. This is unacceptable, terrible and very grave. Once upon a time Tibet lived through a dark age of barbaric feudalism, but there were never any such shortages of food, especially after the rise of Buddhism. In the Tibetan regions, the masses are living in such poverty that the elderly and children are dying of starvation or are so weak that {{they are unable to}} fight off diseases and they die. <b>Never</b> <b>anything</b> like this has ever happened before in the entire history of Tibet. No one could imagine such terrible famines, not even in your worst dreams. In some areas, if someone gets a cold, they inevitably contaminate hundreds of other people and the majority die." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{working with}} Dwan, Buckland created the castle for Douglas Fairbanks' Robin Hood. [...] The castle {{was one of}} the largest sets ever built to that date. [...] At the time of the film's release, the Los Angeles Times said of the set:"Castle a Marvel. [...] Greatest of all the {{settings}} is, of course, the castle which for months has been a sort of landmark of cinema enterprise on Santa Monica Boulevard. [...] The vastness of this feudal domain is the most astonishing of the picture's startling features. [...] One looks through waves upon waves of light and shadow to the stone walls which mark the background. [...] Fairytale heights of tower and turret are suggested. ... Yet there is <b>never</b> <b>anything</b> of grotesquerie in this, only and always a legendary magnificence such as is suggested by the Maxfield Parrish paintings of the Moyen Age. [...] Artistry is at its height in these Medieval scenes." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the passing}} of the years, Alfred and Maria grew apart. They had little in common other than a shared {{interest}} in music and their children. He was reserved, taciturn, moody, ill-tempered, and a heavy drinker. By the mid 1880s he was an alcoholic. The Duke was described as [...] "rude, touchy, willful, unscrupulous, improvident, and unfaithful." [...] The Duchess resented her husband's attitude, but kept her marriage going, hiding her troubled married life from her children, providing a happy environment for them. She later confessed to one of her daughters that she felt she was <b>never</b> <b>anything</b> more than her husband's [...] "legitimate mistress". Arguments over their children added to the couple's marital problems. The Duke hoped that their eldest daughter, Marie, would marry his nephew, the future King George V. The Duchess, however, was determined that her daughter should avoid her mistake, and married her instead to Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania on 10 January 1893.|$|E

2500|$|Knightley {{grew up in}} {{a modest}} {{household}} in Richmond, London, where she attended Stanley Junior School and Teddington School. At the age of six, she was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia but {{by the time she was}} eleven, with her parents' support and much tuition, Knightley said: [...] "they deemed me to have got over dyslexia sufficiently". She is still a slow reader and cannot sight-read. Knightley has noted that she was [...] "single-minded about acting" [...] during her childhood. Speaking of her fascination with acting, she has said: [...] "There was <b>never</b> <b>anything</b> else, I wanted to be a part of my parents' world, even though I knew there are times when you're unemployed". Knightley performed in a number of local amateur productions, which included After Juliet, written by her mother, and United States, written by her drama teacher, Ian McShane. She focused on art, history, and English literature while studying at the Esher College, but left after a year to pursue a full-time acting career.|$|E
2500|$|Den of Geek gave an {{overwhelmingly}} positive {{review of the}} series giving it four stars out of five saying, [...] "It is the most consistent of the new series so far (in fact, of the show’s 45 year history)". They praised the special effects as never being better citing [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", [...] "Planet of the Ood" [...] and the finale as [...] "the epitome of what The Mill can do". They praised the acting talents of David Tennant and Catherine Tate saying, [...] "never have we had it so good...she [...] displayed such a fine grasp of character that even David Tennant was left slightly in the shade by her energetic, thoughtful, hopeful and achingly sorrowful (not to mention damn funny to boot) performance". However they criticised the familiarity of the Sontaran two-parter and the hollowness of [...] "Voyage of the Damned". Overall they said, [...] "series four was <b>never</b> <b>anything</b> less than stunning, there were no ‘lows’ it was all ‘highs’," [...] and praised Russell T. Davies. They summed up the series as [...] "astonishing".|$|E

There's still something missing, though - {{a reason to}} explore the open world." [...] GameSpot awarded the game 8.5 out of ten and said [...] "This fast-paced racer keeps you glued to the TV and {{on the edge of}} your seat regardless of which side of the law you're playing on." [...] Official Xbox Magazine gave the Xbox 360 version 7 out of 10, and said [...] "Hot Pursuit feels a little too safe for its subject matter, limited by pedestrian road design that doesn't express all the playfulness that we'd expect in car combat." [...] However, the UK edition of the magazine gave the game a 9 out of 10, and said [...] "It pays respect to the classic NFS games, borrows the best bits from Burnout and is a technical masterpiece. The chase to reclaim NFSs once legendary chart topping form is well and truly on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2013, a Soaplife {{reporter}} said, [...] "Last year's Kat Mystery Lover storyline {{had to be}} one of {{the most}} ill-conceived and worst mysteries ever" [...] and opined that the lack of mystery, as [...] "the lover could [...] have been anyone other than Derek", was [...] "painful" [...] and they had [...] "endure over half a year of waiting for a reveal that was <b>never</b> <b>anything</b> but blatantly obvious". They also said that storyline had damaged Kat's character as it had turned her from [...] "the tart with a heart that we had loved to an out-and-out-tart with the morals of an alley [...] left Kat not just without a heart and without Alfie but without much love". They went on to say that Kat needed to be [...] "saved" [...] but that [...] "turning [...] from sinner to saint will be a miracle". In April 2017, Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy listed the storyline as one of nine [...] "soap plots that went a bit too far". Dainty called the storyline [...] "distasteful" [...] and said that not only were viewers not surprised with the reveal but they did not care, and criticised the show for not explaining why Kat had the affair.|$|E
