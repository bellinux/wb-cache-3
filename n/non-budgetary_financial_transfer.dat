40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> between parents and their adult children affects the provision of help and care. These intergenerational <b>transfers</b> such as <b>financial</b> <b>transfers,</b> help and care differ between welfare regimes and are strongly dependent on the co-residency of children. What remains to be examined is how these relationships vary among welfare regimes and the co-residency of children. Using data from the fourth wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), this article shows that the relationships between <b>financial</b> <b>transfers,</b> help and care have different aims and meanings across different welfare regimes and for children {{inside and outside the}} household. In Mediterranean regimes where parents support their children mainly through co-residence and less so trough <b>financial</b> <b>transfers,</b> parents receive less <b>financial</b> <b>transfers,</b> help and care than in Scandinavian, Continental and hybrid welfare regimes. However, parents are less likely to receive help and care from co-resident children. Co-residency moderates the relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> provided and help and care received. No relationships are found between the help given by parents to their adult children and <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> received for both co-resident and non-co-resident children across all welfare regimes...|$|R
40|$|Why do parents {{give their}} adult {{children}} money? What child and parental characteristics influence monetary transfers? Does {{the effect of}} these characteristics differ across low, medium, and high transfer dollar amounts? What is the parent 2 ̆ 7 s motive behind providing their adult child with a <b>financial</b> <b>transfer?</b> Is it based on the child 2 ̆ 7 s income or a life event experienced by the child (i. e., altruism or contingent exchange) ? This research examines the relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> and characteristics of the adult child. The data used are the 1992 – 1994 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which contains a nationally representative sample of adults born between 1931 and 1941. At baseline, <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> to 18, 463 adult children living independently from their parent 2 ̆ 7 s household (N = 6, 001) are examined. Cross-sectional and longitudinal models are specified to determine the relationship between the <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> and characteristics of the adult child, controlling characteristics of the parental household across transfer levels. The motive behind the <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> behavior is tested using two competing theories, altruism and contingent exchange. Lastly, the relationship between race and the <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> as a percent of total household income is examined. Two variables consistently have the greatest effect on the amount of the <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> the adult child receives: whether or not the child is currently in school and the total number of children from the parental household. These variables consistently have the greatest effects across: (1) all adult children and sub-samples based on <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> amounts, and (2) cross-sectional models specified by either logistic or tobit regression and the longitudinal change models. The motivation behind the <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> behavior is clearly identified by the contingent exchange perspective within the longitudinal models. Support for this perspective differed according {{to the level of the}} <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> given and the critical life event. There were instances in which neither altruism nor contingent exchange explained the transfer behavior. No support was observed for altruism. Finally, race was observed to have a negative effect on the <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> as a percent of household income: black households provided a <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> of a lower percent of household income compared to white households. ...|$|R

Using data from the 2013 Panel Study of Income Dynamics Rosters and Transfers Module, this study investigates two questions: how parental <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> for education have changed over time, and what the relationship is between these transfers and adult socioeconomic outcomes. Results suggest that transfers for education have increased, have become more commonplace, and have become more dependent on parental wealth over time. Holding constant several individual and parental measures, the relationship between parental transfers for school and adult socioeconomic attainment is positive. This relationship holds when using three-stage least squares models to account for potential endogeneity of <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> for school.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to examine the {{influence}} of parent-to-child <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> and economic resources on <b>financial</b> <b>transfers,</b> coresidence, caregiving, and time-help as multiple, interdependent transfers from middle-aged adult children to their elderly parents. Analyzing data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, which provides long-term observations of financial reciprocity and recent reports about elder care, the current study finds strong positive effects of prior parent-to-child <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> in the models of caregiving and time-help, which indicates the importance of reciprocity. Coresidence is positively related to past parent-to-child financial transfers; however, the effect becomes weak when other control variables are added.;In terms of determinants of resource transfers, the results of multivariate logistic regression analyses suggest that the economic resources of parents and adult children are strong determinants of child-to-parent <b>financial</b> resource <b>transfer</b> when parent-to-child <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> and the sociodemographic characteristics of parents and adult children are controlled for. Controlling for child-to-parent <b>financial</b> <b>transfers,</b> economic resources of the parents and adult children, and other characteristics of the parents and children, adult children 2 ̆ 7 s decisions of coresidence are responsive to the parents 2 ̆ 7 needs (surviving status, age, and health) and several characteristics of adult children (marital status, employment status, and the number of living siblings).;Parent-to-child <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> are a strong determinant of caregiving and time-help to elderly parents after controlling for economic resources and sociodemographic characteristics of parents and adult children.

Interdependence between child-to-parent <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> and caregiving or time-help was not found to be statistically significant when controlling for other predictor variables.

Research on intergenerational <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> has been sparse, and {{little is known about}} the perceptions of older people themselves related to such transfers. Survey data from a convenience sample of older Canadians was analyzed to determine the type of financial assistance older persons provide to their adult children and grandchildren, what motivates them to provide this assistance, and the meanings such transfers hold for the older persons themselves. Findings from the study are discussed within a life course perspective. An overarching theme that emerges from this study reflects the desire of older parents to help their children and grandchildren 'build or rebuild secure lives and futures'. Other reasons for providing such financial assistance are discussed under the themes: family love or commitment; "they need it and I can help"; family history of assistance; and passing on an early inheritance. <b>financial</b> <b>transfers,</b> intergenerational support...|$|R
