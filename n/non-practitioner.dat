OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess quality of life, muscle strength, balance and physical capacity among elderly practitioners and <b>non-practitioners</b> of physical activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study was carried out involving 74 elderly individuals in the city of Santos (state of São Paulo, Brazil), divided into two groups: practitioners and <b>non-practitioners</b> of physical activity. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used for the classification of the participants. The generic SF- 36 questionnaire was used to assess quality of life. The Berg scale was used for the analysis of balance. Dynamometry was used for the muscle strength test. The six-minute walk test was used for the assessment of physical capacity. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between elderly practitioners and <b>non-practitioners</b> of physical activity regarding quality of life (p = 0. 001), muscle strength (p = 0. 001), balance (p = 0. 001) and physical capacity (p = 0. 001). The data also showed that aspects of quality of life were strongly correlated with physical capacity among the <b>non-practitioners</b> of physical activity (r = 0. 741). CONCLUSION: Elderly individuals in the city of Santos (Brazil) who practice physical activity have better quality of life, muscle strength, physical capacity and balance in comparison to those who do not practice physical activity...|$|R
40|$|Citizens of Greensburg, Kansas say {{opportunity}} [1] {{emerged from}} tragedy when a May 2007 tornado leveled {{ninety-five percent of}} their rural community. The "opportunity" {{was to have a}} community-driven document that reflects rebuilding priorities expressed by the citizens, a Long Term Community Recovery Plan, LTCRP. The LTCRP priorities are laden with the term "sustainability," and encourage "a concentration of LEED® Platinum buildings" (FEMA, 2007, p. 17). However, neither the LEED® rating system credits required to reach Platinum Certification nor associated costs are explained in the LTCRP. This presentation of a research-guided design project reviews the process and product of a multi-disciplinary academic studio that provided design conceptualizations based upon Greensburg's LTCRP. All student designers addressed issues of ecological ethics as they pursued conceptualizations based on ecologically sustainable building practices. The studio produced visually-rich design conceptualizations intended to help a <b>non-practitioner</b> begin to understand the jargon of LEED®. This work was shared with Greensburg citizens through a grant from the KSU Center for Engagement and Community Development. First, the presentation introduces the context to which the student work responds: citizen input and the setting of post-tornado Greensburg. Second, the research and design processes which caused students to consider ecological ethics are reviewed. There were several instances where students felt ethically inclined to pursue standards beyond the LEED® rating system. Third, the presentation reviews the products of the academic studio. Because the citizens mandated LEED® Platinum ratings, the products of the academic studio are visually-rich design conceptualizations intended to help a <b>non-practitioner</b> begin to understand the jargon of LEED®. These studio products were intended to serve as catalysts for conversation as Greensburg pursues the next stages of physical planning and design. Finally, the presentation concludes with reflections on the design products, lessons learned and additional conversations that might have been addressed.

High temperatures (T~Tc~!D~ 100 K, where Tc is superconducting critical temperature and !D is the Debye temperature) induce phonon-phonon scattering in ordered materials, which is sensitive to impurities and disorder. Experimental results suggest the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Bi 2 SrCa 2 Cu 2 O 8 is incoherent ion vibration caused by disorder, which is observed from ~ 100 K down to 4 K. Phonons are not well-defined in BSSCO and its coherence length is comparable to the dimension of its unit cell (~ 1 nm), as for other oxides. Sr 2 CuO 3 +d (Tc= 95 K) has a crystal structure that enables experimental demonstration that disorder of apical oxygen atoms has a strong affect on Tc. Disorder in sold oxides on an atomic scale and the temperature dependence of phonons at high temperatures (T~!D) probably {{must be taken into account}} to understand HTS.

Cooperative learning should become a common instructional method in Malaysian classfboms, since the current Malaysian teaching philosophy advocates a more student-centred teaching practices compared to the previous curriculum which rely heavily on traditional teacher-centred teaching approach. These factors and the limited number of studies which focus on the teachers as practitioners of cooperative learning in second language learning environment in Malaysia have prompted this study to be carried out. Subsequently, the objectives of this study were to examine English teachers' and their current cooperative learning in the teaching of English, their perceptions in using the method in class and the motivational variables that affect the application of cooperative learning. Samples were taken from five selected secondary schools in the district of Kuala Selangor, Selangor. The data were elicited through questionnaires which were distributed to 55 English teachers in the schools and interviews with five teachers who were selected at random. The findings showed that eighty percent of the respondents were practitioners of cooperative learning and they were generally positive in integrating cooperative learning in teaching and have an adequate grasp of the approach. However, the other twenty percent of the teachers were not keen in applying the method in their teaching by citing reasons such as lack of support from the school management and lack of confidence. The study also discovered that in relation to motivational variables, the teachers perceived value of cooperative learning play a role in their decision in becoming a practitioner or a <b>non-practitioner</b> of the method. It is recommended that in-service and trainee teachers are given a more intensive course on cooperative learning so that they would have a good understanding of its principles and benefits to increase both their confidence level in using the method as well as their perceived value on the method in the effort to encourage them to adopt it in the teaching and learning of English...|$|E

O objetivo deste estudo foi examinar a associação entre o nível de atividade física e a aptidão cardiorrespiratória em mulheres idosas. Foram avaliadas 960 mulheres com idade {{superior}} a 60 anos, não institucionalizadas, divididas em cinco faixas etárias: F 1 (60 - 64 anos; n = 286), F 2 (65 - 69 anos; n = 295), F 3 (70 - 74 anos; n = 207), F 4 (75 - 79 anos; n = 120) e F 5 (> 80 anos; n = 52). O nível de atividade física foi determinado a partir do questionário Modified Baecke Questionnaire for Older Adults, constituído pelas atividades domésticas, esportivas e recreativas, em que o nível de atividade física total foi classificado pela soma desses três componentes. A aptidão cardiorrespiratória foi mensurada com o teste de caminhada de seis minutos. A aptidão cardiorrespiratória declinou em média 24, 5 % e o nível de atividade física, 18, 0 %, neste estudo. Ao examinar as influências dos tercis do nível de atividade física em relação à aptidão cardiorrespiratória, a análise de variância demonstrou que o tercil superior do nível de atividade física total foi o que apresentou menor declínio na aptidão cardiorrespiratória, de 16, 7 %. Entretanto, a categoria esportiva do nível de atividade física demonstrou valores diferenciados na redução da aptidão cardiorrespiratória, em que o subgrupo não-praticante de exercícios físicos apresentou o maior declínio, de 18, 6 %, enquanto que o subgrupo praticante moderado declinou 16, 3 %, revelando a influência positiva da prática de exercícios físicos moderados sobre a aptidão cardiorrespiratória (p As age progresses, {{a decrease}} of daily activities and reduction of functionality where the cardiorespiratory capacity may be {{considered one of the}} most affected components, is faced. The aim of this study was to examine the association between level of physical activity and cardiorespiratory capacity in older women. Nine hundred and sixty women age above 60 years, non-institutionalized, divided in five age groups were evaluated: F 1 (60 - 64 years; n = 286); F 2 (65 - 69 years; n = 295); F 3 (70 - 74 years; n = 207); F 4 (75 - 79 years; n = 120) and F 5 (> 80 years; n = 52). The level of physical activity was determined from the Modified Baecke Questionnaire for Older Adults, consisting of domestic, sports and recreational activities, in which the level of total physical activity was classified by the sum of these three components. The cardiorespiratory capacity was measured with the Six-Minute Gait Test. The cardiorespiratory capacity decreased an average of 24. 5 % and the level of physical activity 18. 0 % in this study. When examining the influences of the terciles of the level of physical activity concerning the cardiorespiratory capacity, the analysis of variance demonstrated that the superior tercile of the total physical activity level was the one which presented the lowest decrease in the cardiorespiratory capacity of 16. 7 %. However, the sports category of the physical activity level demonstrated differentiated values in the reduction of the cardiorespiratory capacity, where the <b>non-practitioner</b> of physical exercises sub-group presented the highest decrease of 18. 6 %, while the moderate practitioner sub-group decreased 16. 3 %, revealing hence the positive influence of moderate physical exercises practice over the cardiorespiratory capacity (p < 0. 05). Higher physical activity, especially higher sports physical activity, may attenuate the decrease of cardiorespiratory capacity in older women, since women practitioners of moderate physical activities presented lower reduction of such capacity. Increase of physical activities is recommended, especially regular physical exercises, in order to attenuate the decrease of cardiorespiratory capacity, consequently aiding the maintenance of an independent life...|$|E

Results revealed that VT practitioners had lower LOS maximum excursion scores in the backward direction (17. 6 % lower, p = 0. 020), and lower directional control scores in both the backward direction (8. 6 % lower, p = 0. 042) {{and to the right}} side (7. 7 % lower, p = 0. 043) compared to the controls. No significant between-group differences in other outcome variables were found (p > 0. 05). VT practitioners showed inferior LOS balance performance in standing compared to <b>non-practitioners</b> in general, except that they seemed to have better maximum excursion in the forward direction (effect size = 0. 951). Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results. Department of Rehabilitation Sciences 2016 - 2017 > Academic research: refereed > Publication in refereed journalbcm...|$|R

" He {{noted that}} though {{psychodrama}} {{is known to}} shorten the length of in-patient stays it is little recognized by <b>non-practitioners</b> of psychodrama and this is most painfully apparent in the lack of articles on it outside of the organs of the Society.

Taekwondo is a combat sport {{emphasizing}} on kicking techniques and dynamic footwork. Specialized balance ability {{is crucial for}} Taekwondo practitioners. This study aimed to compare (1) the postural stability during turning, and (2) the forward lunge distance between adolescent TKD practitioners and <b>non-practitioners.</b> Nineteen TKD practitioners (12 males, 7 females; Mean age ± SD: 15. 58 ± 1. 07 years) and nineteen control participants (13 males, 6 females; Mean age ± SD: 16. 21 ± 0. 98 years) were recruited in the study. Balance performance was assessed by the Forward Lunge Test and Step/Quick Turn Test with the NeuroCom Balance Master system. Forward lunge distance, turn time and turn sway were measured. TKD practitioners were found to turn faster by 35. 37 % (p= 0. 004) and sway less during turning by 15. 23 % (p= 0. 034) than <b>non-practitioners.</b> The forward lunge distance in TKD practitioners was 5. 67 % shorter than that in control participants (p= 0. 046). This study shows that TKD practitioners might have sport-specific balance ability. The {{findings of this study}} inspire the exploration of the longitudinal training effect of TKD so as to develop the evidence base for this exercise option to improve the postural control of adolescents with balance problems. © Faculty of Education.
