25|$|Any {{surface is}} birational to a <b>non-singular</b> surface, so for most {{purposes}} {{it is enough}} to classify the <b>non-singular</b> surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The Fisher {{information}} matrix is <b>non-singular.</b>|$|E
25|$|A matrix is invertible, or <b>non-singular,</b> if {{and only}} if the linear map {{represented}} by the matrix is an isomorphism.|$|E
25|$|Elliptic curves can {{be defined}} over any field K; the formal {{definition}} of an elliptic curve is a <b>non-singular</b> projective algebraic curve over K with genus 1 with a given point defined over K.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Araki, it is more {{appropriate}} to discuss ‘personal markers’ (rather than ‘pronouns’). There are seven morphosyntactic person markings: first, second, third, and in {{the case of}} <b>non-singular</b> first person, there is an inclusive/exclusive distinction.|$|E
25|$|The plane {{may also}} {{be viewed as an}} affine space, whose isomorphisms are {{combinations}} of translations and <b>non-singular</b> linear maps. From this viewpoint there are no distances, but collinearity and ratios of distances on any line are preserved.|$|E
25|$|The (real) graph of a <b>non-singular</b> curve has two {{components}} if its discriminant is positive, and one component {{if it is}} negative. For example, in the graphs shown in figure to the right, the discriminant {{in the first case}} is 64, and in the second case is −368.|$|E
25|$|In {{this section}} {{we assume that}} the vector space V is finite-dimensional and that the {{bilinear}} form of Q is <b>non-singular.</b> A central simple algebra over K is a matrix algebra over a (finite-dimensional) division algebra with center K. For example, the central simple algebras over the reals are matrix algebras over either the reals or the quaternions.|$|E
25|$|The {{singularities}} of a projective variety V are canonical if {{the variety}} is normal, some {{power of the}} canonical line bundle of the <b>non-singular</b> part of V extends to a line bundle on V, and V has the same plurigenera as any resolution of its singularities. V has canonical singularities {{if and only if}} it is a relative canonical model.|$|E
25|$|When V is a <b>non-singular</b> {{algebraic}} {{curve of}} genus g, H1 {{is a free}} Zℓ-module of rank 2g, dual to the Tate module of the Jacobian variety of V. Since the first Betti number of a Riemann surface of genus g is 2g, this is isomorphic to the usual singular cohomology with Zℓ coefficients for complex algebraic curves. It also shows {{one reason why the}} condition ℓ≠p is required: when ℓ=p the rank of the Tate module is at most g.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{suppose a}} matrix A is {{diagonal}}izable. Let P be a <b>non-singular</b> square matrix such that P−1AP is some diagonal matrix D. Left multiplying both by P, AP = PD. Each column of P {{must therefore be}} an eigenvector of A whose eigenvalue is the corresponding diagonal element of D. Since the columns of P must be linearly independent for P to be invertible, there exist n linearly independent eigenvectors of A. It then follows that the eigenvectors of A form a basis {{if and only if}} A is diagonalizable.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic {{varieties}} and schemes: <b>Non-singular</b> algebraic varieties over the real or complex numbers are manifolds. One generalizes this first by allowing singularities, secondly by allowing different fields, and thirdly by emulating the patching construction of manifolds: {{just as a}} manifold is glued together from open subsets of Euclidean space, an algebraic variety is glued together from affine algebraic varieties, which are zero sets of polynomials over algebraically closed fields. Schemes are likewise glued together from affine schemes, which are a generalization of algebraic varieties. Both are related to manifolds, but are constructed algebraically using sheaves instead of atlases.|$|E
25|$|In {{coherent}} sheaf theory, {{pushing to}} the limit {{of what could be}} done with Serre duality without the assumption of a <b>non-singular</b> scheme, the need to take a whole complex of sheaves in place of a single dualizing sheaf became apparent. In fact the Cohen–Macaulay ring condition, a weakening of non-singularity, corresponds to the existence of a single dualizing sheaf; and this is far from the general case. From the top-down intellectual position, always assumed by Grothendieck, this signified a need to reformulate. With it came the idea that the 'real' tensor product and Hom functors would be those existing on the derived level; with respect to those, Tor and Ext become more like computational devices.|$|E
25|$|These demonstratives (as stem forms) {{can have}} masculine, {{feminine}} and <b>non-singular</b> forms (and as such are pronominal) {{as well as}} case forms. Í- 'here, this' and se/si- 'there, that (not too far away)' take the gender/number morphemes as suffixes, and the other demonstratives take them as prefixes. Note that ka- 'non-specifically here' and kai- 'there in the distance in a non-specific position' cannot appear with the gender/number morphemes, as these latter are specific by their nature. Í- and se/si- also take an article forming affix -bi to become demonstrative articles (e.g. KLY senuubi kaazi, KKY senaubi kaz 'that boy', KLY senaabi kaazi, KKY senabi kaz 'that girl', KLY sepalab kaazi, KKY sepalbi kaz 'those two children', sethabi kœzil 'those children').|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the Hodge {{conjecture}} {{is a major}} unsolved {{problem in}} the field of algebraic geometry that relates the algebraic topology of a <b>non-singular</b> complex algebraic variety and the subvarieties of that variety. More specifically, the conjecture says that certain de Rham cohomology classes are algebraic, that is, they are sums of Poincaré duals of the homology classes of subvarieties. It was formulated by the Scottish mathematician William Vallance Douglas Hodge {{as a result of a}} work in between 1930 and 1940 to enrich the description of de Rham cohomology to include extra structure that is present in the case of complex algebraic varieties. It received little attention before Hodge presented it in an address during the 1950 International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. The Hodge conjecture is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millennium Prize Problems, with a prize of $1,000,000 for whoever can prove or disprove the Hodge conjecture.|$|E

2500|$|Every surface X is birational to {{a minimal}} <b>non-singular</b> surface, and this minimal <b>non-singular</b> surface is unique if X has Kodaira {{dimension}} at least 0 {{or is not}} algebraic. Algebraic surfaces of Kodaira dimension [...] may be birational {{to more than one}} minimal <b>non-singular</b> surface, but it is easy to describe the relation between these minimal surfaces.

Complete intersections are all simply connected. A special case are hypersurfaces: for example, in P3, <b>non-singular</b> surfaces of degree at least 5 are of general type (<b>Non-singular</b> hypersurfaces of degree 4 are K3 surfaces, {{and those of}} degree less than 4 are rational).|$|E

2500|$|Given {{any point}} on a surface, we can {{form a new}} surface by blowing up this point, which means roughly that we replace it by {{a copy of the}} {{projective}} line. For the purpose of this article, a <b>non-singular</b> surface X is called minimal if it cannot be obtained from another <b>non-singular</b> surface by blowing up a point. By Castelnuovo's contraction theorem, this is equivalent to saying that X has no (−1)-curves (smooth rational curves with self-intersection number −1). (In the more modern terminology of the minimal model program, a smooth projective surface X would be called minimal if its canonical line bundle KX is nef. A smooth projective surface has a minimal model in that stronger sense if and only if its Kodaira dimension is nonnegative.) ...|$|E
