500|$|As Travolta did {{not attend}} to collect his trophies, an action figure of Terl, his character, {{accepted}} them in his place. Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me {{whose job it is}} to <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really good about it. Here I was taking big chances, breaking a new genre." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after writing}} these letters, Prince Albert died on 14 December 1861. His death helped Ernest repair his {{relationship}} with his sister-in-law, as Victoria had been becoming increasingly angrier over Ernest's objections to the Danish match. The two brothers had always been close, whatever their disagreements, and Albert's death left Ernest [...] "wretched", noted Victoria in a letter to her eldest daughter. The death did not solve their argument however; seeing that his direct involvement had failed to persuade Victoria, Ernest tried a new tactic. He began to spread gossip about Alexandra and her family, in which her mother Princess Louise [...] "had had illegitimate children and Alexandra had had flirtations with young officers"; he also wrote to Louise herself, warning that Bertie would be an unfortunate choice for a husband. Additionally, Ernest met with his nephew at Thebes, most likely attempting to discourage him from the match in person. In an 11 April letter, Victoria unhappily noted to her eldest daughter [...] "You did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that Bertie had met Uncle Ernest at Thebes...I am always alarmed when I think of Uncle Ernest and Bertie being together as I know the former will do all he can to set Bertie against the marriage with Princess Alix". Despite Ernest's disapproval, Bertie was duly married to Alexandra on 10 March 1863.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in the Genesis narrative demonstrate that adultery was understood to be a natural phenomenon. [...] These occur in the times of the Patriarchs over a span of about 200 years, the last one occurring more than 400 years before the giving of the law through Moses. In Genesis 12, Abram’s wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh’s palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts “serious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.” Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram’s wife and tells him, [...] "What is this you have done to me? Why did you <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that she was your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{there was}} a famine, so the {{residents}} in Luo Tong's hometown and other travellers taking shelter there suffered from hunger. Luo Tong was very worried about this and his appetite decreased. His elder sister, who was widowed and had no children, was known for being very kind. She saw that her brother looked very upset, so she asked him why. Luo Tong said, [...] "I feel bad when I can fill my own stomach while those people don't have enough to eat." [...] His sister replied, [...] "You're right. Why do you suffer in silence and <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about this?" [...] She then took grain from her personal stores {{and gave it to}} Luo Tong, and also informed their mother about it. Luo Tong's mother agreed with what they were doing, and she distributed grain to the people. Luo Tong became famous after this incident.|$|E
2500|$|... "Don't Tell Me" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Joe Henry, with the former two also {{producing}} it. Ahmadzaï also provided programming, acoustic guitars and keyboards, while Michel Colombier arranged strings. It was composed using common time in the key of D major, with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals range from the lower octave of G3 to the higher note of A4. Sonically, [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] was considered [...] "a country meets dance" [...] track with trip hop beats infused with an acoustic [...] "folksy" [...] riff. During an interview for Interview Magazine, in March 2001, Madonna discussed the lyrics, stating, [...] "To me it is a romantic song. Just, you know, rip my skin off, do <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> who I should love, or how I should love. Don’t tell me to give up. To me, in a way it’s like that Frank Sinatra song, 'If I can make it there, I’ll make it anywhere'." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the pyramid}} it is {{declared}} in Egyptian writing {{how much was}} spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen, and if I remember correctly what the interpreter said while reading this inscription for me, a sum of 1600 silver talents was spent. Kheops moreover came to such a pitch of evilness, that being in want of money he sent his own daughter to a brothel and ordered her to obtain from those who came {{a certain amount of}} money (how much it was they did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me).</b> But she not only obtained the sum that was appointed by her father, but she also formed a design for herself privately to leave behind her a memorial: She requested each man who came in to her to give her one stone for her building project. And of these stones, they told me, the pyramid was built which stands in front of the great pyramid in the middle of the three, each side being 150feet in length." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In one {{championship}} with Crispa, walo lang kami (there {{were only}} eight of us), some were even fetched from the hospital. In those days, when your team only had seven players, you automatically lose by default. That {{was the fifth}} game, against Toyota. I didn't play the previous game but that night, I was a starter. In my entire basketball career, I never practiced as a point guard. Even in that particular game, Baby (Dalupan) did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that I was starting as a point guard. He just sent me out there. In the previous game, I noticed that Hubalde was playing forward. When he attracted a double-team, he'd swing the ball but {{the man at the}} top of the key couldn't deliver. Atoy Co couldn't get the ball because he was also well-covered. So the next game, the whole evening I was the point guard. We won the championship. I dominated the game. It was my show the whole evening. That's the kind of talent Baby has. Baby has some moves that would just change the face or the tempo of the game. I don't know where he got those ideas. Whoever thought I would be playing as a point guard?" ...|$|E
