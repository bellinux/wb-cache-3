5|$|Because of its {{distinctive}} course, the Brabant Revolution had been extensively used in historical comparisons with the French Revolution.

5|$|Political {{sociology}} {{has also}} moved beyond methodological nationalism and analysed {{the role of}} non-governmental organizations, the diffusion of the <b>nation-state</b> throughout the Earth as a social construct, {{and the role of}} stateless entities in the modern world society.

50|$|An {{international}} incident usually arises {{during a}} time of relative peace between <b>nation-states,</b> and in general is, on the surface, an unexpected event. Conflicts that grow out of a series of escalating skirmishes between <b>nation-states</b> generally are not considered international incidents; however, terrorist actions can and often do become international incidents. However, historical views of past international incidents often reveal the incident was the flashpoint of a simmering conflict between <b>nation-states,</b> or organizations opposing <b>nation-states.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only a small {{fraction}} of the world's national groups have associated <b>nation-states.</b> The proportion was estimated to be 3 percent by Minahan. The rest are distributed in one or more states. Of the 192 member states of the United Nations in 2006, fewer than 20 are <b>nation-states.</b> Thus <b>nation-states</b> are not as common as often assumed, and stateless nations are the overwhelming majority of nations in the world.|$|R
50|$|Because global {{capitalism}} {{is the driving}} force for much of the inequaliites that transnational feminists are preoccupied with, and <b>nation-states</b> produce and reproduce structures of {{global capitalism}}, <b>nation-states</b> are important to look at in transnational feminist practices.|$|R
5|$|Nepotism is {{a common}} feature {{in the history of}} governance, {{particularly}} in cultures where identity and loyalty are determined more {{at the level of the}} family than that of the <b>nation-state.</b> The use of nephews, rather than direct descendants, is a product of the tradition of clerical celibacy within the Catholic Church, although hereditary descent from uncles to nephews is also seen in the patriarchate of the Assyrian Church of the East.|$|E
5|$|The Constitutional Convention convened by the Articles of Confederation Congress in 1787 {{provided}} for a ratification {{process in the}} states that was duly transmitted by Congress to each state. As Virginians {{went to the polls}} to elect delegates to its state convention, six states had ratified including the two other largest states of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. But Virginia bisected the new nation from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River; its admission into the prospective union was critical if the United States as a <b>nation-state</b> were to have contiguous continental territory.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of the <b>nation-state</b> is the {{creation}} of a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.|$|E
50|$|Territorial {{integrity}} {{is the principle}} under international law that <b>nation-states</b> should not attempt to promote secessionist movements or to promote border changes in other <b>nation-states.</b> Conversely it states that imposition by force of a border change {{is an act of}} aggression.|$|R
50|$|Lawfare, or {{political}} action through transnational or non-governmental organizations can effect a policy change {{that would be}} impossible otherwise.

5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish <b>nation-state</b> and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings {{in a number of}} towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the Polish-Soviet War served to heighten anti-Jewish sentiment.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, {{the three major}} allied powers ratified the colossal westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its new territory between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line. Following {{the destruction of the}} Polish-Jewish population in the Holocaust, the flight and expulsion of Germans in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the repatriation of Poles from Kresy, Poland became {{for the first time in}} its history an ethnically homogeneous <b>nation-state</b> without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power over the next two years, while the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar Soviet sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 1978, Kenyatta {{died in the}} State House, Mombasa. As {{a result}} of the UK's longstanding {{experience}} in state funerals, the Kenyan government requested British assistance in organising Kenyatta's. McKenzie was employed as a go-between, and the structure of the funeral was orchestrated to deliberately imitate that of deceased British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In doing so, senior Kenyans sought to project an image of their country as a modern <b>nation-state</b> rather than one incumbent on tradition. The funeral took place at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, six days after Kenyatta's death. Britain's first heir to the throne, Charles, Prince of Wales, attended the event, a symbol of the value that the British government perceived in its relationship with Kenya.|$|E

5|$|The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis is a 2010 non-fiction {{book written}} by Jeremy Rifkin. It connects the {{evolution}} of communication and energy development in civilizations with psychological and economic development in humans. Rifkin considers the latest phase of communication and energy regimes—that of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction—as bringing people together on the <b>nation-state</b> level based on democratic capitalism, {{but at the same}} time creating global problems, like climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation. Rifkin extrapolates the observed trend into the future, predicting that Internet and mobile technology along with small-scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage the new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} both iron and blood soon became apparent. By 1862, when Bismarck made his speech, {{the idea of}} a German <b>nation-state</b> in the {{peaceful}} spirit of Pan-Germanism had shifted from the liberal and democratic character of 1848 to accommodate Bismarck's more conservative Realpolitik. Ever the pragmatist, Bismarck understood the possibilities, obstacles, and advantages of a unified state. He also understood the importance of linking that state to the Hohenzollern dynasty, which for some historians remains one of Bismarck's primary contributions {{to the creation of the}} German Empire in 1871. While the conditions of the treaties binding the various German states to one another prohibited Bismarck from taking unilateral action, the politician and diplomat in him realized the impracticality of such an action. In order to get the German states to unify, Bismarck needed a single, outside enemy that would declare war on one of the German states first, thus providing a casus belli to rally all Germans behind. This opportunity arose with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Historians have long debated Bismarck's role in the events leading up to the war. The traditional view, promulgated in large part by late 19th and early 20th century pro-Prussian historians, maintains that Bismarck's intent was always German unification. Post-1945 historians, however, see more short-term opportunism and cynicism in Bismarck's manipulation of the circumstances to create a war, rather than a grand scheme to unify a <b>nation-state.</b> Regardless, Bismarck was neither villain nor saint: by manipulating events of 1866 and 1870, he demonstrated the political and diplomatic skill that had caused Wilhelm to turn to him in 1862.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, Thutob Namgyal, the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, {{shifted the}} capital from Tumlong to Gangtok, {{increasing}} the city's importance. A new grand palace {{along with other}} state buildings {{was built in the}} new capital. Following India's independence in 1947, Sikkim became a <b>nation-state</b> with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the Chogyal and the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the Nathula and Jelepla passes, offshoots of the ancient Silk Road near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the Sino-Indian War in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business. The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.|$|E

5|$|The end of Austrian {{dominance}} of the German states shifted Austria's attention to the Balkans. In 1867, the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph accepted a settlement (the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867) in which he gave his Hungarian holdings equal status with his Austrian domains, creating the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The Peace of Prague (1866) offered lenient terms to Austria, in which Austria's relationship with the new <b>nation-state</b> of Italy underwent major restructuring; although the Austrians were far more successful in the military field against Italian troops, the monarchy lost the important province of Venetia. The Habsburgs ceded Venetia to France, which then formally transferred control to Italy. The French public resented the Prussian victory and demanded Revanche pour Sadová ("Revenge for Sadova"), illustrating anti-Prussian sentiment in France—a problem that would accelerate {{in the months leading}} up to the Franco-Prussian War. The Austro-Prussian War also damaged relations with the French government. At a meeting in Biarritz in September 1865 with Napoleon III, Bismarck had let it be understood (or Napoleon had thought he understood) that France might annex parts of Belgium and Luxembourg in exchange for its neutrality in the war. These annexations did not happen, resulting in animosity from Napoleon towards Bismarck.|$|E
5|$|Bolívar, {{learning}} about {{the collapse of the}} Cádiz expedition, spent the year 1820 preparing a liberating campaign in Venezuela. Bolívar was aided by Spain's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents, which Morillo implemented, renouncing to the command in chief, and returning to Spain. Although Bolívar rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution, the two sides established a six-month truce and the regularization of the rules of engagement under the law of nations on November 25 and 26. The truce did not last six months. It was apparent to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements. Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers. On January 28, 1821, the ayuntamiento of Maracaibo declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new <b>nation-state</b> of Gran Colombia. Miguel de la Torre, who had replaced Morillo as head of the army, took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed when Bolívar returned there in April leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Bolívar could now concentrate on Gran Colombia's claims to southern New Granada and Quito.|$|E
