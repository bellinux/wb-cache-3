500|$|At {{the age of}} 17 {{she played}} her first leading role, in the early Metro two-color Technicolor movie The Toll of the Sea. Written by Frances Marion, the story was based loosely on Madama Butterfly. Variety {{magazine}} singled Wong out for praise, noting her [...] "extraordinarily fine" [...] acting. The New York Times [...] commented, [...] "Miss Wong stirs in the spectator all the sympathy her part calls for and she never repels one by an excess of theatrical 'feeling'. She has a difficult role, a role that is botched <b>nine</b> <b>times</b> <b>out</b> of ten, but hers is the tenth performance. Completely unconscious of the camera, with a fine sense of proportion and remarkable pantomimic accuracy... She should be seen again and often on the screen." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee {{was born}} in Marylebone, London on 26 October 1890, the eldest of three boys, all of whom progressed to play {{first-class}} cricket. His father was a greengrocer and a coal merchant who followed cricket closely in the London evening papers. During Lee's youth, he developed his cricket by playing against lamp-posts, and reflected in his autobiography that: [...] "If a bowler can clean bowl a man <b>nine</b> <b>times</b> <b>out</b> of ten against a lamp-post, he will not miss a full-sized wicket when he gets the chance." [...] His cricketing talent was encouraged at school; he first attended Barrett Street School and then St. Thomas's School in Portman Square. Both schools had headmasters who were sports enthusiasts, and at St. Thomas's the headmaster, Mr. Despicht, offered a penny to any schoolboy who could bowl him out, a feat Lee achieved regularly. Mr. Despicht also taught Lee to concentrate on bowling a good length, and Lee played primarily as a bowler during his school years. During his final year at St. Thomas's, the school reached {{the final of the}} local Church School's League Shield, and Lee earned victory for his school with six wickets. When Lee left school, he worked with his father as a greengrocer, a job he liked, but not enough to stop him writing a letter to the Marylebone Cricket Club, asking for a job on the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground.|$|E

2500|$|His baserunning was legendary {{in other}} ways as well. His arguably most {{frequent}} brilliant play was always legitimate—a feetfirst hook slide to avoid being tagged.

[...] Also, [...] "Kelly is not a sprinter, but can get a great start, and this counts more than a fine slide, as a catcher is likely to be hurried when he sees the runner well on his way to a base." ...|$|E

Mashonaland, essentially a representative Harare side has historically been the strongest team in the country since the late 1960s, and between 1993 and 2005 they won the tournament <b>nine</b> <b>times</b> <b>out</b> of twelve. The competition was not played in the 2005–06 season, due to [...] "internal strife", both within Zimbabwean cricket, and the political set-up of the country. Upon the competition's return in 2006–07 it was relaunched with teams representing new areas, rather than the traditional provinces. Kenya were also invited {{to compete in the}} competition during 2006–07, but finished last despite showing promise.|$|E

25|$|The tour {{opened on}} 14 May with, curiously, a twelve-a-side match that is {{nevertheless}} adjudged first-class by CricketArchive. The opposition was L. G.
