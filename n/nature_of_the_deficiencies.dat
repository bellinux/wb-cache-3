40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} elements {{used in the}} binder system for the injection moulding of titanium metal powders will change the final composition when not adequately controlled. Excess levels of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen adversly effect the mechanical properties by embrittlement. Before sintering debinding is done to remove the maximum possible amount binder thereby ensuring residual carbon levels are minimal. Testing the mechanical properties of samples can acknowledge deficiencies in the final part however, identification of the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficiencies</b> is not so simple. In this work titanium-based metal parts were made using the metal injection moulding process and the microstructure was inspected. The investigation used scanning electron microscopy imaging, electron dispersion spectroscopy point and area mapping, LECO trace analysis and X-ray diffraction elemental mapping. Following this samples were ground and polished before immersing their surfaces in an etching solution to further expose the microstructure. Although the data collected from debinding indicated the binder had been removed prior to sintering contamination was still evident. This result showed that the traditional means of reporting binder levels in proportion to part mass after debinding is inaccurate. Subsequently laser induced breakdown spectroscopy was trialed as a method by which to determine the binder levels for parts in the green, grey, brown and sintered form. Interstitial carbon is a known alpha stabiliser however excess carbon on particle surfaces may impinge on particle coalesence limiting density levels. Comparison of the part mass method of binder determination with the laser induced breakdown spectroscopy {{results showed that the}} mass determination method was more accurate for the green and grey parts but the laser induced breakdown spectroscopy results were able to detect the residual binder more accurately for brown and sintered parts...|$|E

40|$|Hereditary nonpolyposis {{colorectal}} cancer (HNPCC) {{is associated with}} defects in DNA mismatch repair. Mutations in either hMSH 2 or hMLH 1 underlie <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> HNPCC cases. Approximately 25 % of annotated hMSH 2 disease alleles are missense mutations, resulting in a single change out of 934 amino acids. We engineered 54 missense mutations in the cognate positions in yeast MSH 2 and tested for function. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> human alleles, 55 % conferred strong defects, 8 % displayed intermediate defects, and 38 % showed no defects in mismatch repair assays. Fifty percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defective alleles resulted in decreased steady-state levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variant Msh 2 protein, and 49 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Msh 2 variants lost crucial protein–protein interactions.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} and analyse the study design and manuscript deficiencies in original research articles submitted to Emergency Medicine. Methods: This was a retrospective, analytical study. Articles were enrolled if {{the reports of}} the Section Editor and two reviewers were available. Data were extracted from these reports only. Outcome measures were the mean number and <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and the mean reviewers’ assessment score. Results: Fifty-seven articles were evaluated (28 accepted for publication, 19 rejected, 10 pending revision). The mean (± SD) number of deficiencies was 18. 1 ± 6. 9, 16. 4 ± 6. 5 and 18. 4 ± 6. 7 for all articles, articles accepted for publication and articles rejected, respectively (P = 0. 31 between accepted and rejected articles). The mean assessment scores (0 – 10) were 5. 5 ± 1. 5, 5. 9 ± 1. 5 and 4. 7 ± 1. 4 for all articles, articles accepted for publication and articles rejected, respectively. Accepted articles had a significantly higher assessment score than rejected articles (P = 0. 006). For each group, there was a negative correlation {{between the number of}} deficiencies and the mean assessment score (P > 0. 05). Significantly more rejected articles ‘… did not further our knowledge’ (P = 0. 0014) and ‘… did not describe background information adequately’ (P = 0. 049). Many rejected articles had ‘… findings that were not clinically or socially significant’ (P = 0. 07). Common deficiencies among all articles included ambiguity of the methods (77 %) and results (68 %), conclusions not warranted by the data (72 %), poor referencing (56 %), inadequate study design description (51 %), unclear tables (49 %), an overly long discussion (49 %), limitations of the study not described (51 %), inadequate definition of terms (49 %) and subject selection bias (40 %). Conclusions: Researchers should undertake studies that are likely to further our knowledge and be clinically or socially significant. Deficiencies in manuscript preparation are more frequent than mistakes in study design and execution. Specific training or assistance in manuscript preparation is indicated...|$|E

In 39  cases, second-line surgery was performed (posteromedial release, n= 33; and muscle transfer, n= 26). Outcomes were evaluated clinically. ResultsSeparating the cases into two groups, based on whether muscle transfer was performed, showed a statistically significant difference: muscle transfer intended to restore eversion and/or dorsal flexion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot was associated with significantly better functional outcomes.

40|$|Genetic {{controls}} of immune responses to natural and synthetic antigens are expressed by quantitative, autosomal traits (1).

Although two genetic loci {{have been shown to}} be linked to histocompatibility regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouse genome (12, 14, 15), little is known concerning the genetic mechanisms responsible for <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> immunity.

40|$|Transposable recombinational {{switches}} {{may play}} {{important roles in}} <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> bacterial populations by increasing flexibility in <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> expression of particular genes and thereby maintaining heterogeneity in clones of cells growing in a uniform environment. Experiments reported here show that Tn 5 - 112, a deletion derivative of kanamycin-resistance transposon Tn 5, can function as such a mobile recombinational switch. The internal deletion in Tn 5 - 112 removes transcription termination signals and permits transcription initiated within the element to continue into nearby bacterial genes. Consequently, in one orientation Tn 5 - 112 stimulates distal gene expression, whereas in the other orientation the normal polarity imposed by wild-type Tn 5 intervenes and distal gene expression is not stimulated. Because Tn 5 - 112 contains terminal inverted repeats, intramolecular recombination can invert the Tn 5 - 112 element and alter gene expression. Tn 5 - 112 is transposition deficient. Its mobility derives from <b>the</b> recessive <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transposition <b>deficiency</b> and, in this study, from <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> homologous recombination which permits its placement in either orientation at any site occupied by nother Tn 5 element...|$|R

In this work, the E. coli gene ispF and its Bacillus subtilis orthologue, yacN, were deleted and conditionally complemented by expression of these genes from distant loci in the respective organisms. In E. coli, complementation was achieved through integration <b>of</b> ispF at <b>the</b> araBAD locus with control from the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter, while in B. subtilis, yacN was placed at amyE under control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> xylose-inducible xylA promoter.

E. coli cells depleted of MEC synthase revealed a filamentous phenotype.

By measuring PCC activity directly in extracts of fused cells or indirectly in intact cells by [1 - 14 C]propionate utilization, we confirmed <b>the</b> nonlinear <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PCC <b>deficiency</b> complementation map described by Gravel et al. [1]. When we studied <b>the</b> kinetics <b>of</b> complementation, we detected three distinct patterns using the [1 - 14 C]propionate utilization assay.

In pcc A x pcc C crosses or in pcc A x pcc B crosses, however, complementation was much slower. In fusions between pcc B and pcc C cells, a third pattern was elicited; complementation was incomplete, maximum restoration of PCC activity begin less than 20 % of that observed in other complementing crosses. From these data and previous biochemical evidence, we suggest (1) that the bio and pcc mutations affect different genes; (2) that complementation between pcc A and either pcc B, pcc C, or pcc BC lines is intergenic and involves subunit exchange and synthesis of new PCC molecules; and (3) that complementation between pcc B and pcc C mutants is interallelic...|$|R
40|$|Rhizobium meliloti Rm 1021 {{must be able}} to {{synthesize}} succinoglycan in order to invade successfully the nodules which it elicits on alfalfa and to establish an effective nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. Using R. meliloti cells that express green fluorescent protein (GFP), we have examined <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symbiotic <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> exo mutants that are defective or altered in succinoglycan production. Our observations indicate that an exoY mutant, which does not produce succinoglycan, is symbiotically defective because it cannot initiate <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> infection threads. An exoZ mutant, which produces succinoglycan without the acetyl modification, forms nitrogen-fixing nodules on plants, but it exhibits a reduced efficiency in the initiation and elongation of infection threads. An exoH mutant, which produces symbiotically nonfunctional high-molecular-weight succinoglycan that lacks the succinyl modification, cannot form extended infection threads. Infection threads initiate at a reduced rate and then abort before they reach <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root hairs. Overproduction <b>of</b> succinoglycan by <b>the</b> exoS 96 ::Tn 5 mutant does not reduce <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> infection thread initiation and elongation, but it does significantly reduce <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> this mutant to colonize the curled root hairs, which is <b>the</b> first step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invasion process. The exoR 95 ::Tn 5 mutant, which overproduces succinoglycan to an even greater extent than the exoS 96 ::Tn 5 mutant, has completely lost its ability to colonize the curled root hairs.

We also reported our conclusions on FDIC's compliance with selected provisions of laws and regulations. During our 2009 financial audit, we identified several control deficiencies over FDIC's process for deriving and reporting estimates <b>of</b> losses to <b>the</b> DIF from financial institution resolution transactions involving loss-sharing agreements. These deficiencies led to misstatements in the draft DIF financial statements, which were ultimately corrected through adjustments to achieve fair presentation in the final financial statements. Although the net adjustments were not material to the DIF's financial statements, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control <b>deficiencies</b> we identified were such that a reasonable possibility existed that a material misstatement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DIF's financial statements would not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Thus, these control deficiencies collectively represented a material weakness in FDIC's internal control over financial reporting related to estimated losses from loss-sharing agreements. During our 2009 financial audit, we also identified control deficiencies with respect to FDIC's information-systems security that increased <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> unauthorized modification and disclosure of financial and other sensitive information, and disruption of critical operations. These control deficiencies, which collectively represented a significant deficiency, reduced FDIC's ability to ensure that authorized users only had the access needed to perform their assigned duties and that its systems were sufficiently protected from unauthorized access. We are issuing a separate report on the issues affecting FDIC's information systems identified during our 2009 audit, along with associated recommendations. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this report is to discuss in more detail <b>the</b> control <b>deficiencies</b> that collectively represented the material weakness in FDIC's internal control over financial reporting related to its loss-share estimation process and to discuss other internal control issues identified during our 2009 audit for which {{we did not have}} previous recommendations.

40|$|Literature of Diminishment redefines {{regionalism}} as {{a philosophical}} approach that prefers a partial view of oneself and of others, whether human or nonhuman, {{rather than the}} comprehensive view pursued by nineteenth-century science. I show how American regionalist writings from the 1820 s to 1910 s adapt scientific techniques <b>of</b> observation to <b>the</b> aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regionalist sketch. Their "sketchy" view <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> highlights <b>the</b> <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> knowing and nonetheless opens out to a view of biological processes and succession in which life cedes to life through its casualties. Regionalist literature is, then, less a literature of particular cultural or geographical regions {{as it is a}} literature whose principles of diminishment might insist on the roughness and limits of a regional setting. <b>The</b> archive <b>of</b> works I draw upon extends from environmental literature—the <b>nature</b> writings <b>of</b> John James Audubon, Henry David Thoreau, and Celia Thaxter—to less conventionally regionalist texts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{nineteenth and early twentieth centuries}} such as works by Emily Dickinson, Herman Melville, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Gertrude Stein. In regionalist formulations, diminishment is a mode of seeing that relies on imprecise and partial specifications rather than strict definitions. Understanding art and science as approaches that both connote ways of seeing and being in the world, I show how writers like Thoreau, Dickinson, Melville, Thaxter, and Sarah Orne Jewett experiment with partial ways of seeing through concomitantly aesthetic and scientific uses of views, optics, and visual technology. Setting the frame with Thoreau's vista from <b>the</b> eroding shores <b>of</b> Cape Cod, I consider how these writers' engagement with natural history's empirical methods attends to their own perceptual diminishment, and also, critically, to <b>the</b> diminishment <b>of</b> their object of study—Nature, or, more generally, life. The final chapters examine the practice and politics of seeing human races as "species," that is, as part <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> through what I consider "snapshots" of black workers. Du Bois's and Stein's literary-photographic studies view and review the racialist natural history that pictures African-Americans, as Du Bois writes, "somewhere between men and cattle.

40|$|Mitochondria are network-like organelles {{present in}} most {{mammalian}} cells. They contain the respiratory chain (RC) that produces <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy {{needed in the}} cell, in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> ATP. RC deficiency can arise due to mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. A number of distinct genetic mitochondrial disease syndromes are known and impairment of RC function has also been implicated in <b>the</b> pathophysiology <b>of</b> several age-associated diseases, such as neurodegeneration, diabetes mellitus II and heart failure, {{as well as in}} aging. <b>The</b> pathology <b>of</b> mitochondrial diseases has been studied in numerous patients and it is often presumed that decreased ATP production and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation are critical links between the RC dysfunction and the observed pathology. There are currently no efficient treatments available for mitochondrial diseases and development of novel therapies will require in depth understanding of key pathophysiological events. We have therefore created and characterized mouse models with RC dysfunction. <b>The</b> general aim <b>of</b> this thesis was to investigate how cells respond to RC dysfunction in mitochondrial disease and aging, with focus on RC <b>deficiency</b> occurring in <b>the</b> mouse heart. We selectively disrupted the nuclear gene encoding mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in heart and skeletal muscle. The TFAM protein is imported into mitochondria where it is essential for maintenance and transcription of mtDNA. Critical components of t he RC are encoded by mtDNA and loss of TFAM therefore results in a severe RC <b>deficiency.</b> <b>The</b> tissue-specific Tfam knockout mice developed severe dilated cardiomyopathy and had a maximal life span of ~ 12 weeks. <b>The</b> progressive <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RC <b>deficiency</b> allowed us to follow temporal changes in gene expression at different stages of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. Microarray analyses revealed substantial changes in <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> nuclear genes in the RC deficient mouse heart. We observed a coordinated reduction of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation in parallel with an increase of some transcripts encoding glycolytic enzymes at a very early disease stage. This metabolic switch in cardiac energy metabolism is unlikely to be beneficial for the RCdeficient heart and may instead accelerate the pathology. Cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling was altered in Tfam knockout cardiomyocytes. Transcripts encoding proteins involved in E-C coupling were reduced in RC deficient hearts and smaller and faster Ca 2 + transients and reduced Ca 2 + storage capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sarcoplasmic reticulum was found in isolated Tfam knockout cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, beta-adrenergic stimulation induced an irregular Ca 2 + release pattern that predisposed to severe arrhythmias. These findings may be important when considering treatment strategies for patients with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. The mtDNA mutator mouse expresses an altered form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mitochondrial DNA polymerase with impaired proofreading capacity. These knockin mice have elevated levels of somatic point mutations of mtDNA, which cause a progressive RC dysfunction, premature aging symptoms and reduced lifespan. We found no or minor changes of ROS production, expression of ROS scavenging enzymes and oxidative damage in cell lines and tissues from mtDNA mutator mice. These findings contradict the previous dogma that mutations of mtDNA. will lead not only to impaired RC enzyme activities but also to a high production of ROS, which, in turn, further will damage the mtDNA and proteins in the mitochondria and thereby elicit a vicious circle. In summary, RC dysfunction causes distinct changes in Ca 2 + handling as well as a metabolic switch in respiratory chain deficient mouse hearts. In addition, our results do not support the hypothesis that increased ROS production and oxidative damage are critical for creating the premature aging phenotypes associated with increased levels of somatic mtDNA mutations...|$|R
