5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to <b>natural</b> <b>processes</b> there arises a problem: <b>natural</b> <b>processes</b> are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be <b>natural</b> <b>processes?</b> The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

5|$|Photons are emitted in many <b>natural</b> <b>processes.</b> For example, when {{a charge}} is {{accelerated}} it emits synchrotron radiation. During a molecular, atomic or nuclear {{transition to a}} lower energy level, photons of various energy will be emitted, ranging from radio waves to gamma rays. Photons can also be emitted when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle are annihilated (for example, electronâ€“positron annihilation).|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{isotopes}} fractionate substantially {{during a}} wide variety of <b>natural</b> <b>processes,</b> including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.|$|E
5|$|The Jurassic Coast {{is subject}} to severe weather {{conditions}} at times. Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the cliffs and caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns. The coast is largely an eroding landscape {{and management of the}} site aims to allow the <b>natural</b> <b>processes</b> of erosion to continue while protecting people and property. Coastal defences have been put in place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but in other places, where the coastline remains in a natural state, the management policy is to take no action and allow erosion to take its course.|$|E

5|$|The philosopher Aristotle was {{the most}} {{influential}} scholar of the living world from classical antiquity. Though his early work in natural philosophy was speculative, Aristotle's later biological writings were more empirical, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes {{of plants and animals}} in the world around him, which he devoted considerable attention to categorizing. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, formal causes, guided all <b>natural</b> <b>processes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash's {{primary use}} {{is that of}} a soil enricher. Once the {{minerals}} in ash are washed into the soil by rain or other <b>natural</b> <b>processes,</b> it mixes with the soil to create an andisol layer. This layer is highly rich in nutrients and is very good for agricultural use; the presence of lush forests on volcanic islands is often as a result of trees growing and flourishing in the phosphorus and nitrogen-rich andisol.|$|E
5|$|Whether from <b>natural</b> <b>processes</b> or the {{activities}} of man, landscapes and their associated habitats change over time. There are the slow geomorphological changes associated with the geologic processes that cause tectonic uplift and subsidence, and the more rapid changes associated with earthquakes, landslides, storms, flooding, wildfires, coastal erosion, deforestation and changes in land use. Then there are the changes in habitats brought on by alterations in farming practices, tourism, pollution, fragmentation and climate change.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and <b>natural</b> <b>processes</b> would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E
5|$|In July 1545, the French {{carried out}} a raid at nearby Seaford, and the castle may have seen action against the French fleet. Soon, however, silt began to block the {{entrance}} to the Camber, threatening its use as an anchorage. Complaints were made to Parliament about the situation in 1548, and the authorities in Rye expressed fears in 1573 that the Camber was damaged beyond repair. By the end of the century, the reclamation of the surrounding marshes and the dumping of ballast by passing ships had accelerated the <b>natural</b> <b>processes</b> and the anchorage was ruined. The surrounding region was also less strategically important than it had once been: towns like Winchelsea and Rye were in decline, peace had been made with France in 1558 and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the Garibaldi Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. This {{is partly because}} the field {{is located in a}} remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other <b>natural</b> <b>processes,</b> including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge {{on the state of the}} Garibaldi volcanoes. This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{acceptance}} from major religious hierarchies, early religious objections to Darwin's theory are still used {{in opposition to}} evolution. The ideas that species change over time through <b>natural</b> <b>processes</b> and that different species share common ancestors seemed to contradict the Genesis account of Creation. Believers in Biblical infallibility attacked Darwinism as heretical. The natural theology of the early 19th century was typified by William Paley's watchmaker analogy, an argument from design still used by the creationist movement. Natural theology included a range of ideas and arguments from the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of theistic evolution were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a non-specified role in guiding evolution and creating humans. This position has been adopted by denominations of Christianity and Judaism in line with modernist theology which views the Bible and Torah as allegorical, thus removing the conflict between evolution and religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{biological}} and geological future of Earth can be extrapolated {{based upon the}} estimated effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at Earth's surface, the rate of cooling of the planet's interior, the gravitational interactions with other objects in the Solar System, and a steady increase in the Sun's luminosity. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans, such as climate engineering, which could cause significant changes to the planet. The current Holocene extinction is being caused by technology and the effects may last {{for up to five}} million years. In turn, technology may result in the extinction of humanity, leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term <b>natural</b> <b>processes.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although {{eutrophication}} {{is commonly}} caused by human activities, {{it can also}} be a <b>natural</b> <b>process,</b> particularly in lakes. Eutrophy occurs in many lakes in temperate grasslands, for instance. Paleolimnologists now recognise that climate change, geology, and other external influences are critical in regulating the natural productivity of lakes. Some lakes also demonstrate the reverse process (meiotrophication), becoming less nutrient rich with time. The main difference between natural and anthropogenic eutrophication is that the <b>natural</b> <b>process</b> is very slow, occurring on geological time scales.|$|R
