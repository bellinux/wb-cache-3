2500|$|In The Rights Revolution, Ignatieff {{identifies}} {{three aspects}} of Canada's approach {{to human rights}} that give the country its distinctive culture: 1) On moral issues, Canadian law is secular and liberal, approximating European standards more closely than American ones; 2) Canadian political culture is social democratic, and Canadians {{take it for granted}} that citizens have the right to free health care and public assistance; 3) Canadians place a particular emphasis on group rights, expressed in Quebec's language laws and in treaty agreements that recognize collective aboriginal rights.
