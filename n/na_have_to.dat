40|$|While live {{attenuated}} {{influenza vaccines}} (LAIVs) {{have been shown}} to be efficacious and have been licensed for human use, the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (<b>NA)</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be updated for optimal protective efficacy. Little is known about the effect of different HA and NA proteins on the immunogenicity of LAIVs developed using the same backbone. A panel of LAIVs that share the internal protein genes, with unique HA and NA gene segments from different influenza subtypes, was rescued by reverse genetics, and a comparative study of immune responses induced by these vaccines was conducted in mice. The results suggest that the magnitude of lung immunity, including pulmonary IgA antibody and memory CD 8 + T lymphocytes, induced by the vaccines depends on the replication efficiency of the LAIVs, as well as the induction of cytokines/chemokines in the lungs. However, these factors are not important in determining systemic immunity such as serum antibody titers and memory CD 8 + T cells in the spleen. A qualitative analysis of immune responses induced by a single dose of an H 5 N 1 LAIV revealed that the vaccine induced robust systemic and mucosal immunity in mice. In addition, antibodies and memory lymphocytes established in the lungs following vaccination were required for protection against lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous H 5 N 1 viruses. Our results highlight the different requirements for inducing systemic and lung immunity that can be explored for the development of pulmonary immunity for protection against respiratory pathogens...|$|E
40|$|The thesis work {{presented}} here emphasizes {{important aspects of}} crystal growth and the influence of chemical substitution in Fe-As superconductors. High temperature solution growth technique is one of most powerful and widely used technique to grow single crystals of various materials. The biggest advantage of high temperature solution growth technique is the, possibility of growing single crystals from both congruently and incongruently melting materials. Solution growth technique has the potential to control high vapour pressures, given the fact that, in Fe-based superconductors elements with high vapour pressure like As, K, Li and <b>Na</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be handled during the crystal growth procedure. In this scenario high temperature solution growth is the best suitable growth technique to synthesize sizable homogeneous single crystals. Using self-flux high temperature solution growth technique, large centimeter-sized high quality single crystals of BaFe 2 As 2 were grown. This pristine compound BaFe 2 As 2 undergoes structural and magnetic transition at TS/N= 137 K. By suppressing this magnetic transition and stabilizing tetragonal phase with chemical substitution, like Co-doping and Na-doping, bulk superconductivity is achieved. Superconducting transitions of as high as Tc = 34 K with Na substitution and Tc = 25 K with Co-doping were obtained. A combined electronic phase diagram has been achieved for both electron doping with Co and hole doping with Na in BaFe 2 As 2. Single crystals of LiFe 1 −xCoxAs with x = 0, 0. 025, 0. 05 and 0. 075 were grown by a self-flux high temperature solution growth technique. The charge doping in LiFeAs is achieved with the Co-doping in Fe atoms. The superconducting properties investigated by means of temperature dependent magnetization and resistivity revealed that superconductivity is shifted to lower temperatures and with higher amount of charge carriers superconductivity is killed. Single crystals of KFe 2 As 2 were grown with two different fluxes, namely, FeAs-flux and KAs-flux. The superconducting transition is found to be at 3. 8 K in both the crystals. The influence of doping with selected elements like Na, Rh, Co and Cr has been investigated systematically in KFe 2 As 2 single crystals. With Na-doping at the K-site, yield (K 1 −xNax) Fe 2 As 2; superconductivity is suppressed to lower temperatures. Substitution of Co and Cr at Fe site, yield K(Fe 0. 95 Co 0. 05) 2 As 2, K(Fe 0. 95 Cr 0. 05) 2 As 2 superconductivity is rapidly killed. Single crystals of (Ba 0. 6 Eu 0. 4) (Fe 1 −xCox) 2 As 2 with x = 0, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 15 and 0. 2 were grown with solution growth technique using Fe-As flux and investigated with several physical measurements. The growth conditions are highly optimized to grow flux free large single crystals especially in case of BaFe 2 As 2 family. The high quality of the crystals were revealed by several physical properties, for e. g. single crystals of Ba(Fe 1 −xCox) 2 As 2 are of the highest quality which was confirmed by the magnetic ac susceptibility which showed a very sharp superconducting transition...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical and {{experimental}} {{data indicate that}} early failure of intraportally grafted islets is mediated by inflammation. Although nicotinamide (<b>NA)</b> <b>has</b> the potential <b>to</b> protect rodent islets it is unknown whether large mammalian islets can be protected in an inflammatory environment. Therefore, we investigated NA-mediated protection of pig islets intraportally transplanted into diabetic nude rats characterized by involvement of NO in intrahepatic graft failure. METHODS: Nonfasting serum glucose levels were evaluated after intraportal transplantation (TX) of 4000 pig islets or intraportal sham-TX in diabetic nude rats infused for 7 days with saline (0 mg), 500 mg, or 1000 mg NA/kg/day. The nitrate/nitrite serum levels were colorimetrically quantified 0, 24, and 48 hr posttransplant. RESULTS: Graft survival after 21 days was not improved (2 / 13) by 500 mg NA compared to 0 mg NA (1 / 22) and 500 mg sham-TX (0 / 7). A total of 1000 mg NA promoted sustained normoglycemia in transplanted rats (10 / 18, P< 0. 001 vs. 0 mg NA, P< 0. 05 vs. 500 mg NA) but deteriorated hyperglycemia in 1000 mg NA sham-TX (P< 0. 01 vs. 0 mg sham-TX). Regeneration of endogenous islets determined as pancreatic insulin content was only measured in islet recipients receiving 1000 mg NA (P< 0. 001). Posttransplant NO levels were not affected by NA and increased in all recipients two-fold (P< 0. 05 vs. day 0). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with efficient administration in syngeneic rodent models <b>NA</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be applied in significant higher doses for protection of xenografted pig islets implying that protection of islets from large mammalians after transplantation into a proinflammatory organ seems feasible. In contrast to other observations graft survival was not mediated by interference of NA with hepatic NO generation...|$|R

5000|$|After her {{graduation}} from Jinmyeong Girls' High School in 1913, Na majored in Western oil painting at Tokyo Arts College. As a student, Na wrote several essays critiquing the standard [...] "good wife, good mother" [...] Korean archetype, saying {{she wanted a}} career as an artist. In April 1915, Na became the main organizer of the Association of Korean Women Students in Japan. It was around this time that {{she fell in love}} with Ch'oe Sung-gu, a student at Keio University and the then editor and publisher of the magazine Hakchigwang. The relationship between Na and Ch'oe was highly publicized among Korean students in Japan, as was Na's close literary and personal association with Yi Kwang-su. In the spring of 1915, Na's father summoned her back home and pressured her to accept a marriage proposal from a well-established family; Na was able to escape this by finding a teaching position in a primary school, according to her later account. After a year of teaching and saving money for her tuition, Na returned to Tokyo toward the end of 1915 to resume her studies.

5000|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of The Firm, future members and affiliates of the group were at transitional stages of their careers. Following the acclaim of his landmark debut album Illmatic (1994), Queensbridge-based emcee Nas decided to concentrate his efforts in a mainstream direction. Despite its significant impact on hip hop at the time, Illmatic did not experience the larger sales of most major releases of the day, due in part to Nas' shy personality and withdrawal from promoting the record. Nas began to make appearances on other artists' work, including [...] "Fast Life" [...] on Kool G Rap's [...] "4,5,6" [...] and [...] "Verbal Intercourse" [...] on Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... (1995), which made him the first non Wu-Tang member to appear on one of their recordings. Nas began to dub himself as Nas Escobar on these guest appearances. Meanwhile, his excessive spending habits had left him with little money, as <b>Nas</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ask for a loan to purchase clothes to wear to the 1995 Source Awards. The success of fellow East Coast act The Notorious B.I.G. at the awards show sent a message to Nas to change his commercial approach, resulting in his hiring of Steve [...] "The Commissioner" [...] Stoute as manager. While Illmatic attained gold status, Stoute convinced Nas to aim his efforts in a more commercial direction for his second album, after which Nas enlisted production team the Trackmasters, who were known for their mainstream success at the time.|$|R
