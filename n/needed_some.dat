5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez. Before leaving England, he {{returned}} to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He said he did this because he had left his keys in London and <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> papers from the house for the trip to France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Due to financial cuts in the health care system, there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is <b>needed.</b> <b>Some</b> of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E
5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force {{to be able to}} bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E

5|$|Captain Arthur Stopford was {{appointed}} as the ship's commanding officer in February 1923 {{and the ship}} began her sea trials in August. After fitting-out, Hermes was commissioned on 19 February 1924 and later assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She conducted flying trials with the Fairey IIID reconnaissance biplanes {{for the next several}} months. Hermes participated in the fleet review conducted by King George V on 26 July in Spithead. Afterwards she was refitted until November and then transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. She arrived at Malta on 22 November and <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> repairs to fix storm damage suffered en route. At this time the ship embarked No. 403 Flight with Fairey Flycatcher fighters and 441 Flight with Fairey IIIDs. Hermes conducted flying exercises with Eagle {{and the rest of the}} Mediterranean Fleet in early 1925 before she began a seven-week refit in Malta on 27 March, then sailed for Portsmouth where she arrived on 29 May after her aircraft had flown ashore.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, Singh {{was called}} for an {{audition}} by Shanoo Sharma, {{the head of the}} casting division for Yash Raj Films. They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning. Aditya Chopra, {{the vice president of the}} company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film. However, the director Maneesh Sharma <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> more convincing and he {{was called for}} a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber. After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead.|$|E

25|$|Wheat {{crops in}} all of Queensland and all but the Riverina in NSW, which had <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> fine weather to finish, were almost {{completely}} destroyed by the excessive rainfall. Many farmers had no crop at all because of rust and many other crops were fed to cattle as their quality as grain was extremely poor.|$|E

25|$|Herbert Sutcliffe <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> getting out. He {{was a great}} battler for England and for Yorkshire. He {{never gave}} his wicket away unless he was {{satisfied}} he had made enough already. With Percy Holmes he formed just about the finest opening partnership I bowled against. I got him out cheaply a few times, but he scored a few hundreds against my bowling, so I reckon we ended up just about square.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to forgive}} is widely {{recognized}} by the public, but they are often {{at a loss for}} ways to accomplish it. For example, in a large representative sampling of American people on various religious topics in 1988, the Gallup Organization found that 94% said it was important to forgive, but 85% said they <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> outside help to be able to forgive. However, not even regular prayer was found to be effective.|$|E

Reducing the phenomena of being illiterate; rejecting the tyranny and being participated of all people in all affairs and refinement of souls.|$|E

25|$|The Studies and Observation Group (as {{the unit}} was {{initially}} titled) {{was in fact}} controlled by the Special Assistant for Counterinsurgency and Special Activities (SACSA) and his staff at the Pentagon. This arrangement was necessary since SOG <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> listing in the MACV table of organization {{and the fact that}} MACV's commander, General William Westmoreland, had no authority to conduct operations outside territorial South Vietnam. This command arrangement through SACSA also allowed tight control (up to the presidential level) of the scope and scale of the organization's operations.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, The Fluke DJs was formed, a live-show {{pairing of}} Fugler and Hugh Bryder. Bryder was a DJ who had {{assisted}} Fluke in their live performances since 1993 {{as well as}} working with other DJs such as Seb Fontaine while holding a DJ residency at MTV's special event parties. This seemed to indicate further rifts within the band as this DJ combination included neither Bryant nor Tournier. However, Fugler denied these rumours shortly after they surfaced claiming that the band merely <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> time {{away from each other}} after their intense work on Risotto.|$|E
25|$|A {{power grid}} failure {{paired with a}} newly rewritten city {{constitution}} – put into place to keep political power away from a single entity such as the railroad – created a standstill {{in the ability to}} further the local economy. Local businesses were affected as the sudden stop of loans limited progression of expansion and renewal funds for maintenance, leading to foreclosures. Families across the city experienced the fallout of economic depression as breadwinners sought to provide for their families. Shanty-town politics began to develop as the destitute <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> form of leadership to keep the peace.|$|E

In October 2007, the VVD party board gave her the option of either giving up her parliamentary seat, or face exclusion procedures from the party. Verdonk announced that she would leave the party but stay in Parliament. After further consideration, she announced {{the creation of a}} new political movement, Proud of the Netherlands (Trots op NL), which she launched in April 2008.|$|E
