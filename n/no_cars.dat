5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the race: {{the first was}} held on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon. Both sessions lasted 90minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. All three sessions were affected by rain, with only the second giving teams any chance to run dry-weather tyres. Adrian Sutil was quickest {{with a time of}} 1:32.842 in the first session, more than half a second quicker than the next fastest drivers Rubens Barrichello and Giancarlo Fisichella. Timo Glock was the next quickest, almost fourseconds behind Sutil. Conditions were so poor that sixdrivers, including both McLarens, failed to set times. The session was stopped fourminutes early, though by that time <b>no</b> <b>cars</b> had entered the track for at least tenminutes. The track dried out in the second session; Räikkönen adapted best to the changed conditions with a lap of 1:23.861, significantly quicker than his morning time. Kubica was the next fastest, with his BMW teammate Heidfeld in third. Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Massa rounded out the top six. Glock was fastest in the final session with a time of 1:35.464, followed by Sebastian Vettel, Rosberg, Jarno Trulli, Kazuki Nakajima and Heidfeld. Hamilton only completed eightlaps, and finished last with a time almost 11seconds behind Glock.|$|E

Despite initial {{plans to start}} at Daytona's PowerShares QQQ 300, Villeneuve announced the team would make its debut two weeks later at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. However, the 27 team did not show in Las Vegas and did not enter a race in 2016. There are claims that the organization was never legitimate because <b>no</b> <b>cars</b> were ever prepared.|$|E
25|$|The {{race was}} divided into three {{segments}} (30 laps, 25 laps, 20-laps), with online fan voting deciding {{certain aspects of the}} race specifics (lengths of the segments, requirements for mandatory pit stops, number of drivers eliminated, etc.) The total race distance was 75 laps (187.5 miles). For 2013, the vote resulted in a mandatory four-tire pit stop, and <b>no</b> <b>cars</b> were eliminated. For 2014, voting set the starting lineup per final practice speeds and required mandatory pit stops after the second segment.|$|E

50|$|Although over 100 {{cities were}} {{participating}} in <b>No</b> <b>Car</b> Day, it wasn't making an impact everywhere. Beijing, {{the capital of}} China, had {{cars on the road}} {{as if it was a}} normal day. There were even some roads that weren't going along with <b>no</b> <b>car</b> day. During the span of <b>no</b> <b>car</b> day citizenswere encouraged to walk, take public transit or ride a bike. Driving automobiles in China has become a status symbol for many residents. Bikers were being judged and being victims of prejudiced just because they chose to ride a bike instead of a car. The people of China were not interested in undoing all that they've accomplished in it being more acceptable to drive cars. Before the 1980s, having a car for personal use was illegal and bikes packed city streets.|$|R
25|$|Increased {{investment}} in public transportation, however, {{has not changed}} the fact that San Juan is an automobile-reliant city and its fast growth has sparked urban sprawl. As of mid-2010, the government has approved plans for a redesign of this Puerto Rican city, featuring a new mass transit system, new roads and intersections, and more beach-access points. <b>No</b> <b>cars</b> will be allowed inside the oldest part of city (Old San Juan). The plans hope to remedy previous poor urban planning in the oldest section of the city, the Isleta, while curbing reliance on motor vehicles. The plans for redevelopment also hope to make the city more appealing {{in order to attract}} new residents, as San Juan has suffered from a shrinking population over the past 60 years.|$|E
25|$|The final {{practice}} session {{got under way}} with <b>no</b> <b>cars</b> posting a time for {{the best part of}} 15 minutes. With the first session of the weekend not being red-flagged it was Lewis Hamilton who finished top of the time sheets. Sebastian Vettel finished second trying {{to make the most of}} this Red Bull car as his teammate Mark Webber struggled for pace finishing down in thirteenth. The Williams of Nico Rosberg came third with Hamilton's teammate Heikki Kovalainen in fourth. Rubens Barrichello finished in sixth behind the two BMW's of Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld. Rubens's teammate and championship leader Jenson Button struggled and only managed fourteenth. The two Force India drivers didn't look quick at all as the high down-force circuit of Singapore didn't seem to suit the car. They ended the session P16 and 17. Giancarlo Fisichella seemed to be struggling a lot being 1.2s behind teammate Räikkönen and 2.4s behind Lewis Hamilton.|$|E
25|$|Bristol {{races are}} often {{the scene of the}} highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the NASCAR season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the Beneficiary Rule was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the {{unpredictable}} nature of the racing meant that {{this was one of the}} few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled pit stop for reasons such as a cut tire will result in the driver going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible to get anything done to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning a free pass under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race their way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of their laps back, unless there are <b>no</b> <b>cars</b> one lap behind.|$|E

500|$|The first city {{ordinances}} banning all motorized vehicles {{from the}} island were passed on July 6, 1898, with similar state park rules coming in 1901.

As such, other {{than a handful of}} emergency and utility vehicles as well as others by special, limited-time permit, <b>no</b> <b>cars</b> or trucks are allowed on the island and no motorized vehicles appear on M-185.
