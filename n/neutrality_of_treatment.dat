40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the Securities Regulation Code on Takeovers and Mergers ("the Code") was to achieve <b>neutrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> of minority shareholders in takeover situations irrespective of the method employed to effect the takeover. This objective has not yet been achieved despite the inclusion of Rule 29 in the Code. Different levels of minority protection apply depending on the method used to effect a takeover. Asset takeovers are also excluded from the ambit of the Code. It is suggested that capital reductions and security conversions be prohibited to effect a takeover unless the Code is applicable to the transaction. The scheme of arrangement procedure, with certain suggested amendments, should be retained as a takeover method. It is further suggested that section 228 of the Companies Act be amended to ensure greater minority shareholder protection but that asset takeovers not be included within the ambit of the Code at this stage.

50|$|Michel Foucault (1926-1984) {{maintained}} a similar scepticism about absolutes, such as right and wrong, sane and insane, and human nature. His method {{was not to}} deny such notions, but to historicize them, examining what in the supposedly necessary may be contingent, and demonstrating the relationships between knowledge and politics, power and knowledge. His main fields of investigation were psychiatry, medicine and disciplinary institutions. Foucault was anti-Hegelian and anti-teleological in his historical excavations. Through his examinations of psychiatry in Madness and Civilization, he showed {{that the development of}} psychiatry was not an obvious improvement on previous <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> the insane, and that furthermore, the apparent scientific <b>neutrality</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric <b>treatments</b> hides {{the fact that they are}} a form of controlling defiance of bourgeois society.|$|R
40|$|Energy <b>neutrality</b> <b>of</b> {{wastewater}} <b>treatment</b> {{plants is}} possible with constant and consistent optimization {{and implementation of}} new technologies. In recent years new process called deammonification has been discovered and implemented in <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> side streams rich in nitrogen. With its implementation on wastewater treatment plants {{it is possible to}} remove nearly all nitrogen from side stream (even 30 % of overall nitrogen load) in less energy consuming way. Additionally, thanks to lower nitrogen load to main stream reactors it is possible to optimize them to further lower energy consumption. This article presents simulation studies of deammonification implementation and main stream reactor optimization in case of medium Polish WWTP (115 000 p. e.). With removal of 20 % of nitrogen in side stream via deammonification and subsequent main line optimization it is possible to save 5000 euro/year by lowering sludge retention time, oxygen concentration in main stream reactors. When additional COD is precipitated in primary clarifiers with iron coagulants, 55 000 euro/year can be saved in case of energy costs which states for most of the energy costs. However, when coagulant and disposal costs are included savings are on the level of 25 000 euro/year...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} neutral money {{occupies}} a notable place in monetary theory, from neoclassical literature to the present. This paper reconsiders the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>neutrality</b> <b>of</b> {{money and the}} nature of the conditions that make for such neutrality. The author first focuses on Knut Wicksell’s pathbreaking formulation <b>of</b> the <b>neutrality</b> <b>of</b> the interest rate in a monetary economy. The subsequent expositions <b>of</b> the <b>neutrality</b> <b>of</b> money are considered with special reference to their recent analysis by Friedrich A. Lutz. The author finds that the <b>neutrality</b> <b>of</b> money is conceptually contradictory, and that the specification of conditions under which money would be neutral is inherently misleading.   JEL: E 43, B 31, E 40 </p...|$|R
