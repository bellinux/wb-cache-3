5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, molecular <b>nitrogen</b> condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) {{into the}} beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) <b>nitrogen</b> assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid <b>nitrogen,</b> a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid <b>nitrogen</b> at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid <b>nitrogen</b> has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid <b>nitrogen</b> it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into <b>nitrogen</b> frost. It is very weak and flows {{in the form of}} glaciers and on Triton geysers of <b>nitrogen</b> gas come from the polar ice cap region.|$|E
5|$|Atomic <b>nitrogen,</b> {{also known}} as active <b>nitrogen,</b> is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free <b>nitrogen</b> atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free <b>nitrogen</b> atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic <b>nitrogen</b> is prepared by passing an electric discharge through <b>nitrogen</b> gas at 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic <b>nitrogen</b> along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.|$|E
40|$|Several polymethylene tetraamines {{related to}} methoctramine (1) were {{prepared}} and evaluated for their blocking activity on M- 2 muscarinic receptors in guinea pig atria and ileum. It {{turned out that}} antimuscarinic potency depends on the following parameters: (a) nature of the substituent on both inner and outer <b>nitrogens</b> and (b) carbon chain length separating the inner <b>nitrogens</b> {{as well as the}} inner and outer <b>nitrogens.</b> Optimum activity at cardiac M- 2 muscarinic receptors was associated with the chain lengths present in 1, that is, eight methylenes between the inner <b>nitrogens</b> and six methylenes between the inner and outer <b>nitrogens.</b> With regard to the substitueats, replacement of the benzylic moiety of 1 by a 2 -fury 1 or a 5 -methyl- 2 -fury 1 nucleus resulted in enhanced potency toward cardiac M- 2 muscarinic receptors. In fact, furtramine (18) and mefurtramine (19) proved to be more potent and more selective than 1. Moreover, N-methylation of the four <b>nitrogens</b> of 1 gave different effects: methylation of the outer <b>nitrogens,</b> giving 22, caused a significant decrease in activity whereas methylation of the inner <b>nitrogens,</b> yielding 23, resulted in an increase in activity in both atria and ileum...|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{interaction}} of Ni(II) and Co (II) ions with the following polypeptides: poly-(L) -lysine), poly-(L-ornithine), poly-(L-diaminobutyric acid) and poly-(L-histidine). It is shown that complexes involving amino <b>nitrogens</b> or deprotonated peptide <b>nitrogens</b> as ligands are formed at several pH values. Deprotonated peptide <b>nitrogens</b> participate in complex formation even in the case of physiological pH values, when a stable chelate system may be formed. When deprotonated peptide <b>nitrogens</b> in matrix backbones are involved in complex formation, no ordered structures is preserved in the complexes regions of a polypeptide.

5|$|Liquid <b>nitrogen</b> readily evaporates to form gaseous <b>nitrogen,</b> {{and hence}} the {{precautions}} associated with gaseous <b>nitrogen</b> also apply to liquid <b>nitrogen.</b> For example, oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid <b>nitrogen</b> to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). <b>Nitrogen</b> gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered <b>nitrogen.</b> Commercial <b>nitrogen</b> is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free <b>nitrogen).</b> Commercial-grade <b>nitrogen</b> already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of methane and possibly <b>nitrogen</b> suggests that Makemake {{could have a}} transient atmosphere {{similar to that of}} Pluto near its perihelion. <b>Nitrogen,</b> if present, will be the dominant component of it. The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the <b>nitrogen</b> depletion: because the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that of Pluto, Eris and Triton, a large amount of <b>nitrogen</b> was probably lost via atmospheric escape; methane is lighter than <b>nitrogen,</b> but has significantly lower vapor pressure at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (32–36K), which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance of methane. However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by New Horizons suggest that methane, not <b>nitrogen,</b> is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of <b>nitrogen</b> may be more complicated.|$|E
40|$|The 15 N {{chemical}} {{shifts of}} eight aliphatic tripeptides have been {{measured at the}} natural-abundance level. For a given tripeptide, the resonances of the COOH-terminal and NH 2 -terminal amino acids can be identified by measurements at low or high pH. The shifts of the NH 2 -terminal amino acid <b>nitrogens</b> are essentially independent of the amino acids {{in the rest of}} the peptide. The shifts of the other <b>nitrogens</b> are characteristic of the amino acids themselves and of the immediately preceding amino acid toward the NH 2 terminus. Nonterminal amide <b>nitrogens</b> have shifts of about 6 ppm upfield of COOH-terminal amide <b>nitrogens</b> at the isoelectric point of measurement. 15 N chemical shifts appear to have considerable potential value for peptide sequencing. ...|$|R

5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} <b>nitrogen</b> fixation {{by making}} molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes. Thus, in Earth's ancient history, after oxygen arrived {{in large quantities}} in Earth's air and water, organisms that continued to fix <b>nitrogen</b> in aerobic conditions isolated and protected their nitrogen-fixing enzymes from too much oxygen in heterocysts or equivalent structures. This structural isolation of <b>nitrogen</b> fixation reactions in aerobic organisms continues to the present.|$|E

5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of <b>nitrogen</b> per gram of glucose consumed. <b>Nitrogen</b> {{fixation}} requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric <b>nitrogen</b> is not fixed, the source of <b>nitrogen</b> can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and <b>nitrogen</b> fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E

As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E

5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} <b>nitrogen</b> {{compounds}} were limited.

At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial <b>nitrogen</b> fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E
