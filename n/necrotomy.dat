25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, the {{influence}} of American and Swedish death metal bands was quickly evident. Many of the thrash bands of the 1980s had disbanded and heavier groups were beginning to fill the void, such as <b>Necrotomy,</b> Acheron, Disembowlment, Corpse Molestation, Damnatory, Hecatomb, Damaged, Anatomy and Blood Duster in Melbourne, Dreamkillers, Obfuscate Mass, Misery and Mausoleum in Brisbane, Aftermath, Apostasy and Cruciform from Sydney and Psychrist and Alchemist from Canberra. Perhaps due to magazines like Hot Metal and the occasional exposure to extreme metal on some community radio programs, bands like these were appearing at a high rate. Shock Records, the Melbourne independent label, commissioned a compilation album to highlight some of these new acts. Come to Daddy was released in 1992 and compiled by Hot Metal writer Ian McFarlane; it contained 14 tracks from bands like <b>Necrotomy,</b> Mausoleum, Mystic Insight, Deracination, Obfuscate Mass, Misery, Discarnated, Entasis, iNFeCTeD, Open Festering Wounds, and Persecution. When McFarlane went to Roadrunner Records' Australian office the following year, he put together another compilation, Redrum, collecting tracks from another group of completely different bands like Alchemist, Sadistik Exekution, Frozen Doberman, Allegiance and Hecatomb.|$|E

In 1992 Abbott left, he was temporarily replaced by Jason Kells (of Australian doom band, diSEMBOWELMENT) who, in turn, was replaced by Mark Schuliga, bass player for the similarly aligned <b>Necrotomy,</b> In November 1993 Acheron supported United Kingdom extreme metallers, Carcass, on the Australian leg of that group's Heartwork Tour: Supreme Blitz to Downunder. They also supported tours by Morbid Angel and Pungent Stench. Bailey left in 1993 and was replaced by Euan Heriot.The group had found that an American black metal band also had the name, Acheron. Hence, inspired by The Book of Abramelin, which concerns a 14th-century alchemist-mage, the group took up their new name.|$|E
40|$|By {{the study}} of bibliography, of Greek and Foreigner scientists, that were used at the {{elaboration}} of the present thesis, it was realised that the offer of the Byzantine medicine, at first consists in the maintenance of her ancient heritage and in the bequest to the western medicine. The Byzantine medicine {{was based on the}} spirit of Hippocrates and Galinos, although it engaged dogmatic character under the domination of Christianity. More specifically, at the early Byzantine period was developed indubitably the special knowledge in the pathology and were maintained in high level the chirurgical techniques, despite that the general doctrines of diseases remained limited in the limits of antiquity and according to the older historians, existed complete stagnation of anatomicophysiological research. This last element should be disputed, according to the newer research because evidences resulted that prove that <b>necrotomies</b> were done on persons in the Byzantine empire, even if rather in limited extent. It appears however that the orthodoxe church did not prohibit the <b>necrotomies</b> of human corpses, showing liberal spirit, perhaps superior of catholic. Main characteristics of Byzantine medicine are the establishment of significance of closed nursing care with the foundation of the first hospitals, the hospices, the gynaecological clinics and the leper hospitals, the application of metres of Social Security, mainly with the foundation of charitable establishments (nursing homes, poorhouses, orphanages) and the enrichment of pharmacology with the import of new medicines from the East and their distribution in the West, mainly at the medium and later period. The growth of hospitals, which then influenced the westerner nursing, should be considered particularly glorious page of the Byzantine medicine. The chirurgical practice reached to a large extent of independence, in which obviously contributed the freedom of dissections for educational reasons, unknown in the west up to the 13 th century (before Mondino execution of <b>necrotomies</b> had only forensic aims). After such a picture it is undeniable that the Byzantium had nothing to envy in the medical sector from modern west, but also that the Eastern Medievalism has nothing in common with the picture of obscurantism that offer the other countries of Europe in the medium years. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a previously healthy, 22 -year-old man who, after a closed fracture of the femur and subsequent operation, developed chronic osteomyelitis. Within a few days, infected bone fragments, bone, and wound drainage repeatedly yielded three different filamentous fungi: Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Chalara ellisii. Histologic {{examination of the}} bone revealed septate hyphae. After sequential <b>necrotomies</b> of the femur and irrigation-suction drainage with added antimycotic therapy, the infection ceased and the fracture healed. This case is unique {{in that it is}} the only known instance in which a long bone was affected in an immunocompetent individual, with no evidence of any systemic infection, by a mixed population of two different Aspergillus spp. and the rare filamentous fungus C. ellisii. Environmental factors that could potentiate the infection include blood and edema fluid resulting from the surgical procedure and the presence of the osteosynthetic plate...|$|R
5000|$|In May 2011 he {{was listed}} as #25 {{on the list of}} The Top 25 Modern Metal Guitarists. In Origin, Ryan employs a high pitched growled/shrieked vocal {{technique}} on each of the band's albums, as well as during live performances. In the recording of Origin's fifth studio enstallment, Entity, the absence of a lead vocalist led Ryan and bassist Mike Flores to take over vocals. On Entity, Ryan can be heard performing low guttural growls and gurgles usually done by former lead singer James Lee. It is unknown whether he will keep this role in the future. Prior to the band Origin, Ryan played in bands in relative obscurity outside of his hometown of Topeka, Kansas. <b>Necrotomy</b> in 1991 & Abomination 1992-1993 ...|$|E
5000|$|Disembowelment, often styled as diSEMBOWELMENT, was an Australian death/doom {{band that}} formed in Melbourne in November 1989 {{out of the}} ashes of a two-piece grind band Bacteria, {{featuring}} Renato Gallina on guitar and vocals, and Paul Mazziotta on drums. With the help of Dean Ruprich from Melbourne death/grind band <b>Necrotomy</b> providing session bass guitar, the band released its first demo, [...] "Mourning September" [...] in September 1990. Disembowelment played a very slow form of doom - with occasional bursts of great speed - that relied equally on the atmospheric effects of droning guitars and constant riffing. The band was known for its atmospheric chanting, slow riffs and spiritual dark elements present in their symphonic, heavily distorted style. They are often credited with spawning the funeral doom movement that developed years later.|$|E
40|$|A 55 -year-old woman {{underwent}} radiosurgery for a left {{cerebral hemisphere}} arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and developed radiation-induced necrosis causing a massive edema {{in the surrounding}} brain tissues. Despite various therapies, the edema expanded to the ipsilateral hemisphere and induced neurological symptoms. The radiation-induced necrotic lesion was surgically removed 4 years after radiosurgery. While the preoperative FDG PET revealed severe hypometabolism in the left cerebrum, the <b>necrotomy</b> significantly ameliorated the brain edema, glucose metabolism (postoperative FDG PET), and symptoms. This case indicates that radiation necrosis-induced neurological deficits {{may be associated with}} brain edema and hypometabolism, which could be reversed by appropriate <b>necrotomy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Axillary {{block is}} {{beneficial}} {{when applied to}} a forearm operation. A 28 -year-old female patient diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic renal failure, hepatic cirrhosis and heart failure, was planned for <b>necrotomy</b> debridement operation of the forearm in Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital-Bandung in March 2012. An axillary block anesthesia was done with Sonosite M Turbo ultrasound guidance that used high frequency linear probe, 50 mm stimulating needle, and nerve stimulator containing bupivacaine 0. 5 % and epinephrine adjuvant 1 : 200, 000. The operation can be initiated after the block was achieved and the duration of operation was 1 hour. In conclusions, axillary block with ultrasound guidance gives satisfying result with higher success rate. Peripheral nerve block (regional anesthesia) is more beneficial to this patient than general anesthesia due to multiple complications...|$|E
40|$|Embolization of the maxillary artery (MA) is {{a common}} {{treatment}} modality for refractory epistaxis. Tissue necrosis after embolization of the MA is a rare complication. Here, we reported the first case {{of the development of}} necrosis of soft tissue and alveolar bone in the periodontium after embolization. A 48 -year-old man with poor oral hygiene and a heavy smoking habit was referred to our clinic due to intractable epistaxis. After treatment with anterior-posterior nasal packing (AP nasal packing), the epistaxis relapsed. Therefore, he underwent embolization of the MA. Although he did not experience epistaxis after embolization, periodontal necrosis developed gradually. The wound healed with <b>necrotomy,</b> administration of antibiotics and prostaglandin, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. We speculated that the periodontal necrosis was provoked by reduction of blood supply due to embolization and AP nasal packing based on this preexisting morbid state in the periodontium. Poor condition of the oral cavity and smoking may increase the risk of periodontal necrosis after embolization...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of acute fulminant amoebic colitis that {{resulted}} {{in the development of a}} perianal ulcer in a 29 -year-old Japanese homosexual man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The patient was admitted to our hospital with a persistent perianal abscess that was refractory to antibiotic therapy administered at another hospital. On admission, we observed a giant ulcer in the perianal region. At first, cytomegalovirus colitis was suspected by blood investigations. Ganciclovir therapy was initiated; however, the patient developed necrosis of the skin around the anus during therapy. We only performed end-sigmoidostomy and <b>necrotomy</b> to avoid excessive surgical invasion. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed the presence of trophozoite amoebae, indicating a final diagnosis of acute fulminant amoebic colitis. The patient&#x 2019;s postoperative course was favorable, and proctectomy of the residual rectum was performed 11 mo later. Amoebic colitis is one of the most severe complications affecting patients with AIDS. Particularly, acute fulminant amoebic colitis may result in a poor prognosis; therefore, staged surgical therapy as a less invasive procedure should be considered as one of the treatment options for these patients...|$|E
40|$|Peculiarities {{of nursing}} {{care for a}} child under 6 years old with burns Current status This thesis deals with the peculiarities of nursing care for a child under 6 years old with burns. Children belong {{to one of the}} groups at risk of thermal injury. Treatment of burns is long and painful, because it {{involves}} surgical procedures, such as necrectomy, <b>necrotomy</b> and autotransplantation. After burns treatment scars are formed, which can harm a child physically and emotionally. Subsequent rehabilitation requires patience and consistency. The theoretical part is devoted to children burns. It deals with factors affecting the severity of the burn trauma. These factors include the mechanism of injury, location, extent, depth of injury and age of the individual. The work is further focused on the first aid for a burned area of a child and describes the necessary measures to safeguard children's condition. Treatment of burns is divided into conservative and surgical parts. Work aims and research questions To achieve the goals four research questions were created. Question 1 : What are the peculiarities of nursing care for children with burns? Question 2 : How a follow-up care with burns is done? Question 3 : What are the main needs to be satisfied in terms of children with burns? Question 4 : What are the problems in meeting higher needs of children with burns? Methodology of work In this work a research qualitative method was carried out, using semi-structured interviews and participant observation. Before undertaking the survey, the principal and head nurse were asked for permission to carry out the survey and they agreed. Interviews were conducted with six nurses who have experience with treating children with burns. The interviews were held separately with each nurse and were recorded in writing. For the purpose of the interview 29 key questions were made (see Appendix 3), and others were added during the interviews, depending on the answers of the nurses. Four nurses were observed at the intensive care unit department. Before the observation an observation sheet was compiled (see Appendix 6) and nurses were observed during their daily services. Results The research showed that the nursing care of children with burns has its own specifics. The selected nurses stated in the interviews that under nutrition having enough proteins and fluids is very important. Regarding the excretion the nurses indicated that when genitalia are burned, they introduce, as prescribed by a doctor, the permanent urinary catheter (hereinafter PUC). Other specifics has the pain treatment. All nurses reported that pain is checked regularly. Apart from analgesics they talked about alternative methods of pain treatment. Another area was sleeping. All nurses reported that they inquire sleep rituals from parents to put their children easier to sleep. Questions about the children needs, nurses had problems with accurate requirements listing. They were unable to identify needs. The results of the observation confirmed that nurses respect the principles of nursing care for a child with burns, as reported in the interviews. Nurses abided by aseptic approach and increased genital hygiene in terms of PUC Conclusion The survey revealed that nurses working at the burns clinic are fully qualified in the field of nursing care for burned children. Nurses know the specifics of nursing care, nutrition, excretion, hygiene, sleep and needs of children. They are aware that in terms of burns it is essential to follow aseptic approach, which means to use sterile disposable equipment and protective clothing. During the interviews with the nurses it was difficult to obtain information about the children needs and their satisfaction. From the interviews and observations emerged that nurses tried to satisfy the children needs as much as possible within the bou...|$|E
