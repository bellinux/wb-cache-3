25|$|Once {{a devoted}} and bright faerie, she {{questioned}} the King {{as to why}} a faerie like herself was not permitted to visit him as often and freely as Oran. The King responds by saying that she and Oran are different by birth, and faery as lowly as Seraphina can not possibly compare herself with Oran. This left Seraphina jealous and determine to best Oran, {{no matter what it}} took, and constantly strove towards what ever goal Oran was headed to. She tricks Oran into staying on Earth by ordering Goodfellow to lead Sindo to the bathing spring, then altering the barrier that was supposed to hide them from humans so that Oran's gown was exposed for stealing. Seraphina uses the opportunity to achieve her ambitions and become the Queen of Avalon. Unfortunately, she is rejected again and again by the King, who constantly reminds Seraphina that <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> she works, even after she becomes a 1st class faerie, she will never compare to Oran because Seraphina simply tries too hard to be something Oran comes by naturally. When Pain and Fanta arrive in Avalon, Seraphina appears again to eliminate Pain only to find that he is powerful enough to detect her spells with ease. Oreadia eventually masterminds Seraphina's downfall by using Fanta, Pain, and Syndra; Seraphina is punished for her attempt to get rid of Oreadia and reborn as a human on earth who would remember her heavenly origins only when she turned fifteen.|$|E

The style of {{leadership}} is seen as the highest level of management development and thinking. Collins (2005) argues that the key ingredient that allows a company to become great is having a Level 5 leader: an executive in whom genuine personal humility blends with intense professional will. He describes “Level 5 Leadership” as the starting point in the process to becoming great. Level 5 leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company. It is not that Level 5 leaders who have no ego or self-interest. Indeed they are incredibly ambitious – but their ambition is first and foremost for the institution, not themselves. Level 5 leaders are fanatically driven, infected with an incurable need to produce sustained results.

40|$|We analyze a {{data set}} {{comprised}} of academic records of undergraduates at the University of Oregon from 2000 - 2004. We find correlations of roughly 0. 35 to 0. 5 between SAT scores and upper division, in-major GPA (henceforth, GPA). Interestingly, low SAT scores do not preclude high performance in most majors. That is, {{the distribution of}} SAT scores after conditioning on high GPA (e. g., 3. 5 or even 4. 0) typically extends below 1000 (the average among test takers). We hypothesize that "overachievers" overcome cognitive deficits through hard work, and discuss to what extent they can be identified from high school records. Only a few majors seem to exhibit a "cognitive threshold" [...] such that high GPA (mastery of the subject matter) is very unlikely below a certain SAT threshold (i. e., <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> dedicated or <b>hard</b> working the student). Our results suggest that almost any student admitted to university can achieve academic success, if they work hard enough. In addition to our primary result, {{we find that the}} best predictor of GPA is a roughly equally weighted sum of SAT and high school GPA, measured in standard deviation units. Using a sub-population of honors college students, we can estimate how students at elite universities would fare at a typical state university, allowing us to comment on issues such as grade inflation. Finally, we observe that 1) SAT scores fluctuate little on retest (very high reliability), 2) SAT and GRE scores (where available) correlate at roughly 0. 75 (consistent with the notion that both tests measure a stable general cognitive ability) and 3) the SAT distribution of students that obtained a degree does not differ substantially from that of the entering class.

500|$|Shakespeare {{constantly}} {{reflects on}} the problem of synecdoche in his plays, a rhetorical term meaning [...] "the part representing the whole". For example, in Henry V, Shakespeare's has the Prologue beg forgiveness of the audience for attempting to portray an entire army with a few men, and for portraying so great a man as the King with a feeble actor. Shakespeare explores these same problems through Robin Starveling. The Mechanicals' decision to use Robin as moonlight in place of actual moonlight delves into the problem of synecdoche, of trying to represent something greater than yourself. Robin's standing there, attempting to be moonshine, does not make him so, even if he is holding a lantern to represent at least a part of the Moon. Similarly, Shakespeare seems to be arguing that no representation of anything in a play can really be completely real or truthful, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> its players may try. Rather than begging forgiveness of the viewer, he is exaggerating the problem for their entertainment.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, writing: [...] "I give the movie a {{negative}} review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying {{us what we}} more or less deserve from a Batman story. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> you try, superheroes and film noir don't go together; {{the very essence of}} noir is that there are no more heroes." [...] He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that [...] "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum called DeVito [...] "a pale substitute for Jack Nicholson from the first film" [...] and felt that [...] "there's no suspense in Batman Returns whatsoever". Batman comic book writer/artist Matt Wagner was quoted as saying: [...] "I hated how Batman Returns made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked." [...] Ty Burr in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-; he wrote that [...] "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by Batman Returns: Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film." ...|$|E
500|$|Captain Jack {{has gone}} on to become a {{recognisable}} figure in the British public consciousness, and has attracted some parody. These parodies frequently echo criticisms both of the character and of Barrowman's portrayal. The character of Jack Harkness has been parodied several times on the satirical impressionist television show Dead Ringers. Played by Jon Culshaw, the show pokes fun at his bisexuality and apparent campness, as well his melodramatic personality in Torchwood. In one sketch, he walks bizarrely towards the camera, kissing a policeman as he passes him. In another sketch, he can be seen having a threesome with two Cybermen, a race of cyborgs from Doctor Who. Satirical technology columnist Verity Stob wrote a parody of Torchwood Season One in the style of Dylan Thomas's radio play Under Milk Wood, called Under Torch Wood. This parody described Captain Jack as [...] "the insomniac bicon; snug as a hobbit, pretty as a choirboy, immortal as carbon dioxide, wooden as a horse." [...] Barrowman's ubiquity, however, has even provoked criticism of the character. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror, in his review of Children of Earth, said [...] "Unlike David Tennant's Doctor, Barrowman's endless appearances on friendly drivel like Tonight's the Night, The Kids Are All Right and Any Dream Will Do, is so over-exposed, 'Captain Jack' is about as intriguing or alien as a Weetabix and twice as irritating. Unlike Tennant, as an actor he is just not good enough." [...] Television journalist Charlie Brooker, in his Screenwipe review of 2009 criticised Barrowman, with focus on his acting. [...] "Harkness is of course a man of mystery. You can't tell what he's thinking just by looking at his face... <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> Barrowman tries." ...|$|E
40|$|Late in {{the nineteenth}} century, Native Americans of the Plains attempted, through a sacred dance, to bring back a time before the bison all but vanished, before whites came with diseases, greed, and guns, before {{treaties}} evicted Indians from ancestral lands. When John B. Wright alludes to the Ghost Dance in his collection of essays, he knows his readers will make connections with that earlier, desperate attempt to restore the past. In Wright 2 ̆ 7 s version, however, that past would be before mining companies stripped mountains and polluted rivers and streams, before loggers denuded forests, and before developers converted wilderness to condominium communities. And although Wright focuses on Montana in these 2 ̆ 2 lessons on land and life, 2 ̆ 2 the problems he addresses are not exclusive to that state. The Great Plains may {{be referred to as}} 2 ̆ 2 The Big Empty, 2 ̆ 2 but there have been and still are-collisions aplenty in all that space: disagreements over water rights, land use, indeed over the very history and spirit of the region. Wright 2 ̆ 7 s essays are not exercises in nostalgia, however. He knows that things probably never were the way things used to be. One of the strongest pieces in the collection is 2 ̆ 2 Myths, 2 ̆ 2 in which Wright takes up a number of fervently held beliefs about the past and the present, among them that the western landscape was once 2 ̆ 2 pristine, 2 ̆ 2 that so much space exists in the region that it can easily absorb any increase in population, that life is safe and cheap in the West. In place of these and other myths, he substitutes truths about the region 2 ̆ 7 s economy, its population density, even its climate. Wright frequently begins an essay with a tight, personal focus. He recalls, for example, when he first came to Montana to work as a land use planner, a job that in those less enlightened times required that he do little more than 2 ̆ 2 make sure the septic tanks worked and the roads were built to county specs. 2 ̆ 2 Or he visits an old friend, and the two reminisce about Missoula in the 1960 s. In each case, Wright gradually moves outward to a larger environmental concern-the diversion of waterways, the preservation of family ranchland, the reintroduction of wildlife species to Yellowstone. The technique is especially effective because it provides illustration after illustration of how geopolitical issues affect individuals. Throughout the collection, Wright manages to strike a number of difficult balances. He comes across as opinionated and reasonable, authoritative and affable, idealistic and practical, hopeful and realistic. He can, as in his essay on elk, use the language of both the scientist and the poet. It is a testament to his skill as a writer that the collection provides considerable pleasure, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> many <b>hard</b> truths it may contain...|$|R

500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> they try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just {{to get used to the}} crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E
