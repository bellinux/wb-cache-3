Actions taken in 2008 by the Government of China have reduced the practice of adulteration, {{with the goal of}} eliminating it. Court trials began in December 2008 for six people linked to the scandal and ended in January 2009 with two of the convicts being sentenced to death and executed.|$|E
500|$|As Alien vs. Predator is {{a sequel}} to the Predator films and prequel to the Alien series, Anderson was {{cautious}} of contradicting continuity in the franchises. He chose to set the film on the remote Norwegian Antarctic island of Bouvet commenting, [...] "It's definitely the most hostile environment on Earth and probably the closest to an Alien surface you can get." [...] Anderson thought that setting the film in an urban environment like New York City would break continuity with the Alien series as the protagonist, Ellen Ripley, had no knowledge the creatures existed. [...] "You can't have an Alien running around the city <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would've been written up and everyone will know about it. So there's nothing in this movie that contradicts anything that already exists." ...|$|E

Traditionally boats were built [...] of wood, but wood is not often used <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> has higher maintenance costs and lower durability. Fibreglass is used increasingly in smaller fishing vessels up to 25 metres (100 tons), while steel is usually used on vessels above 25 metres.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} a Modernist will to {{aesthetic}} isolation and of the broad theme {{of the separation of}} culture and society, it is actually Cubism after 1914 that emerges as most important to the history of Modernism, and especially... Cubism between around 1916 and around 1924... Only after 1914 did Cubism come almost exclusively to be identified with a single-minded insistence on the isolation of the art-object in a special category with its own laws and its own experience to offer, a category considered above life. It is Cubism in this later period that has most to tell anyone concerned with the problems of Modernism and post-modernism <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was only then that issues emerged with real clarity in and around Cubism which are closely comparable with those that emerged in and around Anglo-American Modernism in the sixties and after.

2500|$|Whitehead was {{particularly}} noted for {{the invention of}} two surgical procedures, both of which bear his name. The first related to the surgical removal of haemorrhoids and was described in the BMJ in 1882, with a further study of 300 patients being published in 1887. The technique is rarely used <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> usually left a deformity, which also bore his name, but this is because those performing the operation misunderstood his description of it. The second procedure, which {{was a form of}} glossectomy and earned him international repute, is also not much used today. It concerned removal of carcinoma from the mobile tongue and was described by him in an 1891 paper titled A Hundred Cases Of Entire Excision Of The Tongue. There is a story that this latter procedure was devised when he was irritable due to a hangover and declined the choice of surgical instruments offered to him with the words [...] "for God's sake give me a pair of scissors". Twenty of the patients described in the 1891 paper died post-operatively; he said that he believed all 300 patients documented his 1887 paper had been [...] "completely and permanently cured".|$|E
