40|$|ABSTRACT A yellow-bodied male {{appeared}} spontaneously in an isofemale line of Drosophila <b>nappae</b> established from a wild-caught female {{collected at}} the Forest Reserve of the Instituto de Biociências da Universidade de São Paulo, Cidade Universitária "Armando de Salles Oliveira", São Paulo city, state of São Paulo, Brazil. This is the first mutation found in D. <b>nappae,</b> a species belonging to the tripunctata group. The yellow male was isolated and individually crossed to two wild-type (brown-colored) virgin females from the same generation, yielding numerous offspring. All F 1 individuals were wild-type, but the phenotypes yielded in the F 2 generation were wild-type females, and both wild-type and yellow-bodied males. The latter yellow male mutants backcrossed with virgin wild-type F 1 females yielded four phenotypes (brown-colored and yellow-colored flies of both sexes), indicating an inheritance pattern of X-linked recessive. Chi-square goodness of fit tests (α = 5 %) detected no significant differences among the number of flies per phenotype. The new mutation is hereby named yellow, due to its probable homology to a similar mutation with an identical inheritance pattern found in Drosophila melanogaster...|$|R
40|$|Drosophila <b>nappae</b> sp. nov., {{belonging}} to the subgroup I of the Drosophila tripunctata species group of the subgenus Drosophila, is described from flies of one strain established from several females collected from July 1994 through April 1995 at Morro Santana, Porto Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. This species has been misidentified during {{the past fifty years}} as Drosophila angustibucca (sensu Frota-Pessoa, 1954; non Duda, 1925, described from Costa Rica).

25|$|The chrome outline on {{the grill}} was added to give the style more of a relaxed luxury appearance. The Senator has {{specially}} designed 10 spoke alloys. For the interior special suede leather come as an optional extra. The Senator Signature name has now been {{dropped out of the}} line up, in the price department it matches the Clubsport approximately. <b>Nappa</b> leather is standard for the Senator. The 6.0-litre Gen5 (LS2) V8 engine was taken off the C6 Chevrolet. The brakes are upgraded and feature Bosche 8.0 ABS which provides EBD. The new LS2 V8 made it the quickest Australian made production car at the time.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the main}} options {{included}} the sunroof $2390, satellite navigation $3800, rear-seat DVD players $3900, Xenon headlights $1800, tyre pressure monitoring system $1395. Inside it features <b>Nappa</b> leather on the seats. The braking system on the Senator comes with ABS with twin-piston front callipers and grooved discs. The specially designed rear suspension has a self-levelling feature, so if the Senator was towing a trailer, instead of the weight forcing the back down and causing {{the front of the}} car to go up, the rear suspension would harden itself and therefore keeping the car levelled and aerodynamic. This feature is also on the current E-series Senator Signature and has been optioned on Holden models as far back as WH Caprice in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{features}} for the WL series HSV Grange included 19-inch alloy wheels, a 430-watt Blaupunkt sound system with twelve speakers and a six-stack CD player, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, <b>Nappa</b> leather seats, eight-way power adjustable front seats, driver's seat and mirror memory settings, cruise control with speed alert, front fog lamps, a {{front and rear}} parking sensors, DVD player with twin seven-inch rear seat LCD screens and remote control, leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel, remote central locking, power windows and heated mirrors, automatically dipping mirrors when reversing, a height and reach adjustable steering wheel, an electrochromatic rear vision mirror, tyre pressure sensors, a trip computer and an immobiliser. As standard, the Grange was also fitted with a limited slip rear differential as well as larger diameter front and rear sway bars, performance brakes and an exclusive body kit consisting of more aggressive front bumper, side skirts, rear bumper and deck lid spoiler.|$|E
40|$|The taxonomic {{history of}} the rhinotragine genera Phygopoda Thomson, 1864 and Pseudophygopoda Tavakilian and Peñaherrera-Leiva, 2007 (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Cerambycinae) are discussed, and {{evidence}} is presented to suggest that some recent taxonomic changes made by Carelli and Monné (2015) were unjustified. Consequently, Phygopoda nigritarsis Gounelle, 1911 is moved to the genus Neophygopoda Melzer, 1933, creating the new combination Neophygopoda nigritarsis, the genera Panamapoda Clarke, 2014 and Paraphygopoda Clarke, 2014 are revalidated, and the species Paraphygopoda viridimicans (Fisher, 1952) and Paraphygopoda <b>nappae</b> Clarke, 2014 are also revalidated...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{new species}} of Drosophilidae from Uruguay are {{described}} and illustrated: Drosophila montevidensis sp. nov. (Holotype male in MZSP: Facultad de Agronomía, Universidad de la República, Montevideo city, Department of Montevideo), and Scaptomyza pipinna sp. nov. (Holotype male in MZSP: Sarandí del Consejo, near north shore of Laguna de Castillos, Department of Rocha). The former species belongs to the D. tripunctata group and is sibling to Drosophila <b>nappae</b> Vilela, Valente & Basso-da-Silva, 2004, differing mainly in characters of the aedeagus. The latter {{is closely related to}} Scaptomyza striaticeps Wheeler & Takada, 1966, from which it can be distinguished by color and terminalia characters. The new Drosophila species was successfully cultured in a modified banana-agar medium which is provided.

5000|$|Deb Aoki from About.com {{considered}} the series as the Best Continuing Shōnen Manga of 2007, along with Eyeshield 21, praising the [...] "compelling stories, dazzling action sequences and great character development". She also placed the title on her list of [...] "Top 10 Shōnen Manga Must-Reads". The artwork {{and the character}} designs received positive response by IGN's A.E. Sparrow. He also commented on the series' ability to handle multiple minor character plotlines at the same time, which he considered a point of appeal, in response to fans' claims about a [...] "lack of a story" [...] in Bleach. Leroy Douresseaux from ComicBookBin agreed with Sparrow {{in the number of}} storylines, but also praised the fighting scenes finding them comparable to the ones of popular films. On the other hand, Mania reviewer Jarred Pine criticized the series as being plagued with stereotypes from the genre. He felt it was a rough start for the series with unimpressive battles, overused gags, and a bad introduction for central character Ichigo that causes him to come across [...] "as a frowning punk" [...] whose one good trait is his desire to protect. Despite this, Pine notes that he loves the series, particularly its quirky, lovable characters. Jason Thompson said he was no longer able to take Bleach seriously after it introduced villains Ulquiorra and Yammy in a scene precisely mirroring Vegeta and <b>Nappa's</b> arrival in Dragon Ball Z, but acknowledged it was likely intended as a deliberate homage. He also said Kubo was able to avoid the worst artistic failings typical in series which indulge in superpowered combat, but that the battle scenes were still sometimes difficult to follow.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} species {{richness}} and abundance of Drosophila Fallén, 1823 attracted to dung and carrion baited pitfall traps in natural areas with heterogeneous habitats at the Sierra de Minas, Eastern Serranías, southeastern Uruguay. Collecting {{was carried out}} {{on a monthly basis}} (May 2002 through April 2003). Drosophilids accounted for 0. 84 % (n = 131) and 3. 61 % (n = 158) of the Diptera collected from dung (n = 15, 630) and carrion (n = 4, 382) pitfall traps, respectively. A total of 12 species were identified, 11 of which belong to the subgenus Drosophila (the richest) and one to the subgenus Sophophora Sturtevant, 1939. Over 90 % of the Drosophila specimens collected belong to five species of the subgenus Drosophila, namely D. gaucha Jaeger & Salzano, 1953, D. immigrans Sturtevant, 1921, D. mediovittata Frota-Pessoa, 1954, D. aff. <b>nappae</b> Vilela, Valente & Basso-da-Silva, 2004, and D. ornatifrons Duda, 1927. Drosophila cardini Sturtevant, 1916 is recorded for the first time from Uruguay. Drosophila abundance and species richness in the four habitats sampled in the Uruguayan Eastern Serranías, namely woodlands sierra, riparian forest, pine plantation and grazing grassland, were considered to be a function of habitat conservation. Diversity indices were low in all habitats. Different habitats supported particular coprophilous and necrophilous Drosophila species. The woodland sierra represents the most preserved habitat, and contributed with the highest species richness observed. Drosophila ornatifrons was the dominant species, with a restricted habitat distribution. On the other hand, grazed grassland, an environment modified by livestock management, had the lowest species richness: only a few specimens of D. repleta Wollaston, 1858. Regarding species composition, significant differences were found in some pairwise comparisons of groups of Drosophila species that included D. ornatifrons. Fly attraction to dung can be exploited as an alternative and/or complementary collecting method in ecological studies of Drosophila assemblages in natural areas...|$|R

2500|$|With {{production}} of the Z8 completed by November 2002, for 2003 the Z8 production {{was replaced by the}} Alpina V8 Roadster. The Alpina was a departure from the hard-edged sporting focus of the original car, and elements of the new grand touring intent were evident throughout this final edition. Instead of the original six-speed manual and 4.9L (S62) engine featured in earlier Z8's, the Alpina came only as an automatic, using a five-speed BMW Steptronic transmission mated to a downgraded 4.8L Alpina-tuned V8 motor from the Alpina E39 B10 V8 S (M62). In order to complete the car's transition from sports car to boulevardier, relaxed suspension tuning was used. The standard Z8's run-flat tires on [...] wheels were discarded in favor of conventional tires with softer sidewalls, on [...] wheels. A new, softer grade of <b>Nappa</b> leather replaced the Z8's less supple specification, and special Alpina gauges were featured on the dash cluster. An Alpina steering wheel with three solid spokes replaced the original, which could not be retrofitted with shift paddles for the automatic. Gear selection was displayed in an Alpina-specific display mounted in front of the wheel.|$|E
