25|$|The major uses of phenol, {{consuming}} {{two thirds}} of its production, involve its conversion to precursors for plastics. Condensation with acetone gives bisphenol-A, a key precursor to polycarbonates and epoxide resins. Condensation of phenol, alkylphenols, or diphenols with formaldehyde gives phenolic resins, a famous example of which is Bakelite. Partial hydrogenation of phenol gives cyclohexanone, a precursor to nylon. Nonionic detergents are produced by alkylation of phenol to give the alkylphenols, e.g., <b>nonylphenol,</b> which are then subjected to ethoxylation.|$|E

2500|$|The slime glands {{themselves}} are {{deep inside the}} body cavity, each {{at the end of}} a tube more than half the length of the body. The tube both conducts the fluid and stores it until it is required. The distance that the animal can propel the slime varies; usually it squirts it about a centimetre, but the maximal range has variously been reported to be ten centimetres, or even nearly a foot, although accuracy drops with range. It is not clear to what extent the range varies with the species and other factors. One squirt usually suffices to snare a prey item, although larger prey may be further immobilised by smaller squirts targeted at the limbs; additionally, the fangs of spiders are sometimes targeted. The slime, which can account for up to 11% of the organism's dry weight, is 90% water; its dry residue consists mainly of proteins — primarily a collagen-type protein. 1.3% of the slime's dry weight consists of sugars, mainly galactosamine. The slime also contains lipids and the surfactant <b>nonylphenol.</b> Onychophora are the only organisms known to produce this latter substance. It tastes [...] "slightly bitter and at the same time somewhat astringent". The proteinaceous composition accounts for the slime's high tensile strength and stretchiness. Upon ejection, it forms a net of threads about twenty microns in diameter, with evenly spaced droplets of viscous adhesive fluid along their length. It subsequently dries, shrinking, losing its stickiness, and becoming brittle. Onychophora eat their dried slime when they can, which is appropriate, because it takes an onychophoran about 24 days to replenish an exhausted slime repository. The lipid and <b>nonylphenol</b> constituents may serve one of two purposes. They may line the ejection channel, stopping the slime from sticking to the organism when it is secreted; or they may slow the drying process long enough for the slime to reach its target.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nonylphenol</b> is {{considered}} to be an endocrine disruptor due to its ability to mimic estrogen and in turn disrupt the natural balance of hormones in affected organisms. The effect is weak because nonylphenols are not very close structural mimics of estradiol, but the levels of <b>nonylphenol</b> can be sufficiently high to compensate.The effects of <b>nonylphenol</b> in the environment are most applicable to aquatic species. <b>Nonylphenol</b> can cause endocrine disruption in fish by interacting with estrogen receptors and androgen receptors. Studies report that <b>nonylphenol</b> competitively displaces estrogen from its receptor site in rainbow trout. It has a stronger affinity to the E2 receptor than estrogen. <b>Nonylphenol</b> causes the feminization of aquatic organisms, decreases male fertility, and decreases survival in young fish. Studies show that male fish exposed to <b>nonylphenol</b> have lower testicular weight. <b>Nonylphenol</b> can disrupt steroidogenesis in the liver. One function of endogenous estrogen in fish is to stimulate the liver to make vitellogenin, which is a phospholipoprotein. Vitellogenin is released by the maturing female and sequestered by developing oocytes to produce the egg yolk. Males do not normally produce vitellogenin, but when exposed to <b>nonylphenol</b> they produce similar levels of vitellogenin to females. The concentration needed to induce vitellogenin production in fish is 10 ug/L for NP in water. <b>Nonylphenol</b> can also interfere with the level of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) being released from the pituitary gland. Concentrations of NP that inhibit reproductive development and function in fish also damages kidneys, decreases body weight, and induces stressed behavior.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nonylphenol</b> {{has been}} shown to act as an obesity {{enhancing}} chemical or obesogen, though it has paradoxically been shown to have anti-obesity properties. Growing embryos and newborns are particularly vulnerable when exposed to <b>nonylphenol</b> because low-doses can disrupt sensitive processes that occur during these important developmental periods. Prenatal and perinatal exposure to <b>nonylphenol</b> has been linked with developmental abnormalities in adipose tissue and therefore in metabolic hormone synthesis and release (Merrill 2011). Specifically, by acting as an estrogen mimic, <b>nonylphenol</b> has generally been shown to interfere with hypothalamic appetite control. The hypothalamus responds to the hormone leptin, which signals the feeling of fullness after eating, and <b>nonylphenol</b> {{has been shown}} to both increase and decrease eating behavior by interfering with leptin signaling in the midbrain. <b>Nonylphenol</b> has been shown mimic the action of leptin on neuropeptide Y and anorectic POMC neurons, which has an anti-obesity effect by decreasing eating behavior. This was seen when estrogen or estrogen mimics were injected into the ventromedial hypothalamus. On the other hand, <b>nonylphenol</b> {{has been shown to}} increase food intake and have obesity enhancing properties by lowering the expression of these anorexigenic neurons in the brain. Additionally, <b>nonylphenol</b> affects the expression of ghrelin: an enzyme produced by the stomach that stimulates appetite. Ghrelin expression is positively regulated by estrogen signaling in the stomach, and it is also important in guiding the differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes (fat cells). Thus, acting as an estrogen mimic, prenatal and perinatal exposure to <b>nonylphenol</b> has been shown to increase appetite and encourage the body to store fat later in life. Finally, long-term exposure to <b>nonylphenol</b> has been shown to affect insulin signaling in the liver of adult male rats.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} of LPO state of white rats in {{conditions of the}} long-term influence of oxyethylized <b>nonylphenols</b> and their derivatives was carried out.

The latter, because of a high reactogenic capability, probably, {{plays the role of}} a basic link limiting stability of an organism to the long-term influence of the studied compounds due to change of physicochemical properties of cellular membranes, activity of membrane-localized and lipid-depending enzymes, reactivity of neuroendocrine, immune and other systems of an organism.

Due to their reported hazardous properties, it is of great interest to identify effective best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the release of these substances to recipient waters. The stormwater-quality model SEWSYS was used to identify sources and quantify loads of phthalates and <b>nonylphenols</b> in two urban catchment areas. Based on the modelling results, BMPs were proposed, and their efficiencies evaluated. The SEWSYS simulations showed that discharges of phthalates and <b>nonylphenols</b> depend on catchment area characteristics: pollutants in a residential area originate mainly from building materials, whereas vehicles are the dominant source in a high-density traffic area. By replacing traditional building materials by phthalate and nonylphenol-free alternatives and by implementing congestion taxes to reduce traffic, the simulated pollutant loads could be reduced by more than 20 % in the high-density traffic area. However, discharges from many diffuse sources cannot entirely be stopped, and a structural BMP, e. g. a sedimentation pond, is essential to further decrease pollutant loads in urban runoff.
