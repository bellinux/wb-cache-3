5|$|In 1975, {{the mall}} {{underwent}} some cosmetic renovation and was renamed from simply The Mall to University Mall, probably to diversify {{it from the}} new McCain Mall Simon was planning for North Little Rock. The mall's reopening was held in March of that year. <b>News</b> <b>accounts</b> say that special {{emphasis was placed on}} a security program.

In June 1913, Amalfi escorted King Victor Emmanuel III and his wife, Queen Elena, on the royal yacht Trinacria to the annual regatta at Kiel, Germany.

Since Poole's symptoms were intermittent, Triton continued south, {{although there was}} a detour to the Golfo Nuevo region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact. Contemporary <b>news</b> <b>accounts</b> reported the Argentine Navy had been encountering numerous unknown submarine contacts in the Golfo Nuevo during early 1960, but Tritons contact {{turned out to be a}} school of fish.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, Aruban police {{detained}} Nick John and Abraham Jones, former {{security guards}} {{from the nearby}} Allegro Hotel (which was then closed for renovation) on suspicion of murder and kidnapping.

At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Tubantia was returning from South America with £500,000 in gold destined for banks in London, {{a large portion of}} which was intended for the German Bank of London.

There, the German reservists were taken off Tubantia by Royal Marines; the gold was confiscated and removed from the ship. Although <b>news</b> <b>accounts</b> do not report when it occurred, Tubantia was released from Plymouth and allowed to resume her Royal Holland Lloyd service.|$|E
5|$|West Avenal {{departed}} Norfolk on {{a voyage}} to Leith, Scotland on 9 April 1919, but {{was forced to}} return to port after suffering an engine breakdown. Following repairs, she made several voyages between the East Coast of the United States and various destinations in South America, Spain, France and England. A few mentions of the ship crop up in contemporary <b>news</b> <b>accounts.</b> In August 1919, for example, The New York Times shows West Avenal slated for departure to Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 12 August. The following January, the newspaper reported that West Avenal was rammed by the British Leyland Line cargo ship Lacastrian. Departing New York in a dense fog {{on the morning of}} 9 January 1920 for Antwerp, Lacastrian rammed into the port side of West Avenal, which was inbound with a load of onions from Valencia, Spain. The damage was severe enough that West Avenals captain ordered her grounded to avoid sinking in New York Harbor. More than two weeks later, The Washington Post printed a photograph of West Avenal, still grounded off the Red Hook flats. Another report in the Times a year later showed her arrival in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 13 August 1920.|$|E
25|$|In early <b>news</b> <b>accounts,</b> pure fission {{weapons were}} called atomic bombs or A-bombs, a misnomer since the energy comes {{only from the}} nucleus of the atom. Weapons {{involving}} fusion were called hydrogen bombs or H-bombs, also a misnomer since their energy comes mostly from fission. Practitioners favored the terms nuclear and thermonuclear, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Though {{little is}} {{available}} regarding West Avenals civilian career, she is known from contemporary <b>news</b> <b>account</b> to have visited ports in Spain, Italy, France, Brazil and Uruguay {{in the early}} 1920s.

25|$|With his underlings {{attending}} to the seizure of Vientiane, Thao Ma commandeered an AT-28 fighter-bomber. Accounts disagree {{on the number of}} sorties flown by Thao Ma and his wingmen. While contemporary <b>news</b> <b>accounts</b> state Thao Ma flew at least three times, historians note only that he was accompanied by six loyal pilots. It is agreed that his principal target was a fellow general whom he hated, Kouprasith Abhay. Both Kouprasith's home and office were bombed by the AT-28s, but missed him. As Royalist troops began to rally against the coup, American colonel Al Degroote drove to the home of the commanding general of the Air Force. General Sourith Don Sasorith refused to come out of hiding, and lurked in his house with a blue and white scarf handy.|$|E

25|$|The early {{efforts at}} news sheets and {{periodicals}} were spotty. Roger L'Estrange produced both The News and City Mercury, {{but neither of}} them was a sustained effort. Henry Muddiman was the first to succeed in a regular news paper with the London Gazette. In 1665, Muddiman produced the Oxford Gazette as a digest of news of the royal court, which was in Oxford to avoid the plague in London. When the court moved back to Whitehall later in the year, the title London Gazette was adopted (and is still in use today). Muddiman had begun as a journalist in the Interregnum and had been the official journalist of the Long Parliament (in the form of The Parliamentary Intelligencer). Although Muddiman's productions are the first regular <b>news</b> <b>accounts,</b> they are still not the first modern newspaper, as the work was sent in manuscript by post to subscribers and was not a printed sheet for general sale to the public. That had to wait for The Athenian Mercury.|$|E

He also told Lake that he had hunted buffalo during 1871 and 1872, but Earp was arrested {{three times in the}} Peoria area during that period for [...] "Keeping and being found in a house of ill-fame."
