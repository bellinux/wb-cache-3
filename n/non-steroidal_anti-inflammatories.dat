50|$|The {{first line}} of {{treatment}} is often to treat the patients pain with neuropathic drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants. The second lines of drugs to treat pain are <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatories,</b> tramadol, and opioids. Other techniques used to facilitate healing of the nerve and pain are either static or dynamic splinting that can both help protect the injured part as well as improve function. Sometimes surgery is an option, although the prognosis is still very poor of regaining function of the affected nerve. The goal of surgery is to join healthy nerve to unhealthy nerve. The most common surgical techniques include external neurolysis, end-to-end repair, nerve grafting, and nerve transfer from somewhere else in the body.|$|E

40|$|<b>Non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> {{drugs are}} drugs of choice for chronic pain, which is most common in chronic conditions, {{rheumatism}} in particular. According to  current recommendations, these medications {{should be used}} continuously or intermittently, and their choice should be tailored to each patient. Unfortunately, <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs have multiple adverse effects ranging from the most insignificant dyspepsia to severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, gastroscopy and, in the case of confirmed Helicobacter pylori infection, eradication is advisable for planned long-term treatment with these agents. Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors is recommended in rheumatic patients chronically receiving non-selective <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs, while celecoxib (a selective COX- 2 inhibitor) combined with proton pump inhibitor should be administered in patients at high risk of gastrointestinal complications. In rheumatic patients, the type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and the route of its administration should be tailored to each patient in terms of strength and duration of drug action, the type of disease and comorbidities as well as contraindications. Adverse gastrointestinal effects are due to the mechanism of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and therefore independent of the route of administration. The use of proton pump inhibitors with cardioprotective doses of aspirin should be limited to patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal complications. High <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drug doses are limited to gout attack, acute pain and axial spondyloarthropathy showing high clinical activity. In other cases, the lowest effective <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drug dose is recommended. Advancing age is characterised by impairment in the function of all organs, therefore elderly patients should receive lower <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drug doses. Concomitant use of two or more <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs in rheumatic diseases is not recommended.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the profile of}} risk of upper gastrointestinal toxicity during continuous treatment with, and after cessation of, <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs. DESIGN: Cohort study with a prospectively constructed, population based, record linkage database containing details of exposure to all community dispensed <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs and also all admissions to hospital for upper gastrointestinal diagnoses. SETTING: The population of Tayside, Scotland. SUBJECTS: 52, 293 subjects aged 50 and over who received one or more <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> between 1 January 1989 and 31 December 1991 and 73, 792 subjects who did not receive one {{during the same period}} (controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Admission to hospital for upper gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation, and admission for other upper gastrointestinal diagnoses. RESULTS: About 2 % of the <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> cohort were admitted with an upper gastrointestinal event during the study period compared with 1. 4 % of controls. The risk of admission for upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and perforation was constant during continuous <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> exposure and carried over after the end of exposure. The results were similar for admissions for all upper gastrointestinal events. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> toxicity persists with continuous exposure. There seems to be carryover toxicity after the end of prescribing. These findings have implications for the management of patients requiring <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies using}} small bowel {{endoscopy}} revealed that <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs including low-dose aspirin, can often induce small bowel injury. <b>Non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs-induced small bowel mucosal injury involves various {{factors such as}} enterobacteria, cytokines, and bile. Experimental studies demonstrate that both mitochondrial disorders and inhibition of cyclooxygenases are required for development of <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs-induced small bowel injury. Mitochondrion is an organelle playing a central role in energy production in organisms. Many <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs directly cause mitochondrial disorders, which are attributable to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation induced by opening of the mega channel called mitochondrial permeability transition pore on the mitochondrial membrane by <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs. Bile acids and tumor necrosis factor-α also can open the permeability transition pore. The permeability transition pore opening induces the release of cytochrome c from mitochondrial matrix into the cytosol, which triggers a cascade of events that will lead to cell death. Therefore these mitochondrial disorders may cause disturbance of the mucosal barrier function and elevation of the small bowel permeability, and play particularly important roles in early processes of <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs-induced small bowel injury. Although no valid means of preventing or treating <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs-induced small bowel injury has been established, advances in mitochondrial studies may bring about innovation in the prevention and treatment of this kind of injury...|$|R

30|$|Pain likely {{also has}} an impact on the loading {{environment}} at the knee in those with OA. During gait, both pain intensity and the knee adduction moment (KAM), a measure representing the distribution of medial versus lateral loading at the knee joint, change in response to administration of oral or injectable pain medication (Schnitzer et al. 1993; De et al. 2000). Use of <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatories</b> concurrently reduced pain and increased the adduction and quadriceps moments, suggesting that pain may be a mechanism by which people with knee OA modify their gait in an effort to decrease the KAM (Schnitzer et al. 1993). This relationship between pain and KAM may be influenced by an increase in gait velocity (Robbins and Maly 2009). A positive relationship between peak KAM and walking velocity, and a negative relationship between pain and walking velocity, were observed in people with moderate to severe radiographic knee OA (Henriksen et al. 2012). Exploring these variables during static weight-bearing exercises may provide clarity into whether pain and KAM relate, without the influence of speed of movement.|$|E
