40|$|Nitrosamine {{analyses}} using a {{gas chromatograph}} (GC) interfaced to a thermal energy analyzer (TEA) showed "nitrosamine-like " signals for extracts of shampoo, conditioner, and antiperspirant/deodorant products. In several instances these "nitrosamine-like " responses {{could not be}} distinguished from the re-tention time of N-nitroso-N-methyl dodecylamine (NMDDA); however, the levels appeared unrealistically high (ppm instead of ppb) and the reproducibility was poor. Re-examination of these samples by gas chromatography/mass pectrometry (GC/MS) disproved the presence of NMDDA and identified the com-pound producing the GC/TEA signal (i. e., the false positive) as a <b>nitromusk</b> compound, musk xylol, present in the product fragrances. Other "nitrosamine-like " GC/TEA signals have also been linked to other <b>nitromusk</b> perfume raw materials (PRM) including moskene and musk ketone. Nitromusks are perfume components in numerous cosmetic products and can interfere with the GC/TEA analysis of nitrosamines. Confirmatory experiments uch as GC/MS, wet chemical procedures, or UV-photolysis hould be run in conjunction with any GC/TEA determination of nitrosamines. An example of a false positive in a shampoo extract is presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} focused on the {{determination}} of musk compounds in various components of the environment. Synthetic musk compounds are organic substances commonly used as fragrant constituents of detergents, perfumes, cosmetics and other personal care products (PCPs). These compounds contaminate the aquatic environment through municipal wastewater from sewage treatment plants. The result is accumulation of these analytes in the environment and their occurrence in food chain. Synthetic fragrances are commonly detected also in human body; these substances generally belong among relatively new persistent organic pollutants (POPs) because of their persistence, bioaccumulation, and potential toxicity. The aim of this work was to optimize the methods for the determination of selected synthetic fragrances in wastewater (municipal, industrial) and in fish muscle. These analytes were determined in wastewater [the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Brno – Modřice, cosmetic manufacturing plant] and in fish Squalius cephalus that had been caught in the river Svratka. The selected analytes (14 substances) originate from the group of <b>nitromusk,</b> polycyclic musk and linear musk compounds. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) [for wastewater samples] and pressurized solvent extraction (PSE) [for fish samples] were used for isolation of analytes from real samples. The identification and quantification of analytes were carried out by high resolution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). The results show that galaxolide (g. L- 1) and tonalide (tenths of g. L- 1) were polycyclic musk compounds which were found at the highest concentration level in influent and also in effluent samples from the WWTP Brno – Modřice. The most extended <b>nitromusk</b> compound was musk ketone (hundredths of g. L- 1). Linear musk compounds were detected in all influent samples (g. L- 1). The overall removal efficiency of synthetic musk compounds from wastewater in the WWTP varies within the following ranges: <b>nitromusk</b> compounds 34. 4 % – 85. 4 %, polycyclic musk compounds 36. 7 % – 53. 3 % and linear musk compounds 90. 5 % – 99. 9 %. On the basis of the results it can be stated that wastewater (effluent from the WWTP) is the primary source of musk compounds, especially of the polycyclic ones in the environment. It has been also shown that ultrafiltration used in a cosmetic plant is a highly efficient technology for removing <b>nitromusk</b> and polycyclic musk compounds from industry wastewater. The results from evaluation of the fish contamination by musk compounds show that galaxolide was the substance which reached the highest concentration levels (tens of g. kg- 1 l. w.). The results corroborate ubiquitous occurrence of musk compounds in the environment and reduction of using of <b>nitromusk</b> compounds due to their potential toxic properties. It has been shown that the insufficiency of the purifying procedures used in the WWTP Brno – Modřice has a significant influence on the concentration level of polycyclic musk compounds (tonalide, galaxolide) in fish caught from the river Svratka...|$|E
40|$|Nitroaromatic musks, {{including}} {{musk ketone}} (MK; 2, 6 -dimethyl- 3, 5 -dinitro- 4 -f-butylacetophenone), are chemicals used as perfume ingredients in household products, cosmetics, and toiletries. Musk xylene (MX; l, 3, 5 -trinitro- 2 -r-butylxylene), another <b>nitromusk,</b> is not genotoxic {{but has been}} reported to produce mouse liver tumors in a chronic bioassay. In addition, MX has been shown to both induce and inhibit mouse liver cytochrome P 450 2 B (CYP 2 B) isozymes. The ability of MX to inhibit CYP 2 B enzyme activity is attributable to inactivation of the enzyme by a specific amine metabolite. MK is structurally similar to MX, but lacks the nitro substitution that is reduced to the inactivating amine metabolite. Therefore, we hypothe-sized that MK would induce, but not inhibit, CYP 2 B isozymes. To test this hypothesis, and to evaluate the effects of MK on mouse liver cytochrome P 450 enzymes, two sets of experiments were performed. To evaluate the ability of MK to induce cytochromes P 450, mic...|$|E
50|$|Synthetic musks are {{lipophilic}} {{and tend}} to deposit and persist in fat tissue {{for a very long}} time. <b>Nitromusks</b> and polycyclic musks - having been used for 100 years - have low biodegradability and accumulate in the environment.

40|$|Synthetic musk compounds, {{widely used}} as {{fragrances}} in consumer products, {{have been detected}} in human tissue and, surprisingly, in aquatic organisms such as fish and mollusks. Although their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate are of concern, the toxicity and environmental risks of these chemicals are generally regarded as low. Here, however, we show that <b>nitromusks</b> and polycyclic musks inhibit the activity of multidrug efflux transporters responsible for multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) in gills of the marine mussel Mytilus californianus. The IC 10 (concentration that inhibits 10 %) values for the different classes of musks were {{in the range of}} 0. 09 – 0. 39 µM, and IC 50 values were 0. 74 – 2. 56 µM. The immediate consequence of inhibition of efflux transporters is that normally excluded xenobiotics will now be able to enter the cell. Remarkably, the inhibitory effects of a brief 2 -hr exposure to musks were only partially reversed after a 24 - to 48 -hr recovery period in clean seawater. This unexpected consequence of synthetic musks—a long-term loss of efflux transport activity—will result in continued accumulation of normally excluded toxicants even after direct exposure to the musk has ended. These findings also point to the need to determine whether other environmental chemicals have similar long-term effects on these transporters. The results are relevant to human health because they raise the possibility that exposure to common xenobiotics and pharmaceuticals could cause similar long-term inhibition of these transporters and lead to increased exposure to normally excluded toxicants.

40|$|This study reports {{comprehensive}} two-dimensional {{gas chromatography}} hyphenated to time-of-flight mass spectrometry detection (GC × GC/TOFMS) for characterisation and identification of components generated by four {{different types of}} powdered incense headspace (H/S) and incense smoke. GC × GC/TOFMS allowed simultaneous separation and identification of compounds emitted into the atmosphere {{as a result of}} combustion of incense powder. The smoke stream comprised compounds originating from the incense powder, and combustion products such as saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, essential oil type compounds, <b>nitromusks,</b> fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, which possibly include oxygenated and nitrated PAH), N-heterocyclics, pyrans and furans, which were detected and tentatively identified by GC × GC/TOFMS. GC × GC-electron capture detector/nitrogen phosphorous detector (ECD/NPD) potentially offers the prospect of providing selective chemical compositional information of incense powder and smoke, such as nitrogen-containing (N-containing) and halogenated compounds. Results of GC×GC-ECD/NPD showed that both incense powder and smoke generated emission of N-containing and halogenated compounds. A significant number of halogenated and N-containing compounds were emitted during the incomplete combustion of incense. However, one further objective {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the capacity of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to specific and/or selective detectors such as those used in this study (GC × GC-ECD/NPD) for the detection of particular classes of compounds such as N-containing and halogenated compounds at trace level concentrations in complex smoke samples...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{interactions}} of <b>nitromusk</b> compounds musk ketone and musk xylene and polycyclic musks Galaxolidee (HHCB), Celestolidee (ADBI), Tetralidee (AHTN), and Traseolidee (AITI) with multixenobiotic resistance (mxr) transporters in gill tissue {{of the marine}} mussel Mytilus californianus (Conrad, 1837). A competitive substrate transport test with rhodamine B was used to assay modulation of transport activity by musks. All tested musks inhibited the transport activity in the low lm range as indicated by increased accumulation of rhodamine B in the tissue. Compared to known substrates of mxr transporters, the effective concentration range was similar to quinidine and about 100 times higher than verapamil. Musk ketone and musk xylene also inhibited efflux of rhodamine B from gill tissue which was loaded with the dye and subsequently incubated with these compounds. Synthetic musk compounds are persistent environmental pollutants in aquatic environments with a high potential to bioaccumulate. As potent inhibitors of mxr transporters they may {{also play a role}} as chemosensitizers that enable toxic mxr substrates to accumulate in cells of aquatic organisms...|$|E
40|$|Musk xylene (MX), {{musk ketone}} (MK) and musk moskene (MM) are {{synthetic}} nitro-containing fragrances. Due to their inherent lipophilicity and environmental persistence, they are frequently detected in environmental samples {{and especially in}} aquatic ecosystems. Despite this, the current environmental toxicity database of nitromusks is limited. Although nitromusks {{have been shown to}} accumulate in aquatic organisms, little is known about their potential developmental effects in the respective aquatic species. To investigate the developmental toxicity of these compounds to amphibians and fish, early lifestages of xenopus (Xenopus lae 6 is) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to three nitromusks for 96 h to examine the developmental effects of these compounds in the two species. <b>Nitromusk</b> body concentration measurements were carried out in parallel for correlation with potential developmen-tal effects. No increased mortality, malformation or growth inhibition was observed in either species following 96 -h exposure to 400 mg:l MX, MK and MM. However, an approximately 20 % reduced viability was observed in xenopus larvae when exposed to 400 mg:l MX, MK and MM for 11 days. Xenopus and zebrafish exposed to 10, 153, 871 and 1637 mg:l 14 C-MX for 96 h resulted in whole-body concentrations of 0. 790. 1, 11. 191. 1, 38. 791. 9 and 76. 3918. 3 mg:g, and 4. 390. 6, 73. 3911. 8, 440. 0972. 7 and 664. 0947. 7 mg:g wet body weight, respectively.
