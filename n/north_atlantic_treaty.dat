Construction of primary {{airports}} in Norway {{started in the}} 1950s based on building joint military and civilian airport with funding from the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Organization (NATO). The alliance considered constructing an airport at Søndre Herøy in Herøy, an archipelago near Sandnesssjøen, but funding was never allocated to the project.|$|E
50|$|Military {{officials}} {{began calling}} for {{the introduction of a}} new defense legislation in 1947, arguing that depleted inventories of surplus World War II-vintage armaments, piecemeal planning of new armaments and restrictions on presidential authority threatened current and future efforts to arm allied nations. New legislation became a necessity by mid-1948 with the negotiation of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> defense <b>treaty</b> and the necessity to provide military aid to strengthen the connectional defenses, having in mind a global resistance to Communist expansion of the signatories.|$|R
500|$|The members {{agreed that}} an armed attack against {{any one of}} them in Europe or North America would be {{considered}} an attack against them all. Consequently, they agreed that, if an armed attack occurred, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence, would assist the member being attacked, taking such action as it deemed necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> area. The <b>treaty</b> does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor. Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so. This differs from ArticleIV of the Treaty of Brussels, which clearly states that the response will be military in nature. It is nonetheless assumed that NATO members will aid the attacked member militarily. The treaty was later clarified to include both the member's territory and their [...] "vessels, forces or aircraft" [...] above the Tropic of Cancer, including some overseas departments of France.|$|R

Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Organization (NATO) in June 1952, General Matthew Ridgway of the United Nations Command was transferred from Korea to Europe as Eisenhower's replacement. The United States Army appointed General Mark Wayne Clark, commander of the US Fifth Army during World War II, to overall command on the Korean Peninsula {{as a replacement for}} Ridgway.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{construction}} of airports in Norway {{started in the}} 1950s, largely funded by the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Organization (NATO). Bergen Airport, Flesland opened in 1955, followed by Ålesund Airport, Vigra in 1958. The first plans for an airport in Sunnfjord were launched by Engineer Arne Bengtsen, who proposed building an airfield in Florø and having Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap operate to it using the Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer. Construction started in 1956, but was halted after the airline could not guarantee operations during winter.|$|E
5|$|Like any alliance, NATO is {{ultimately}} governed by its 29 member states. However, the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> and other agreements outline how decisions {{are to be}} made within NATO. Each of the 29 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. The senior permanent member of each delegation {{is known as the}} Permanent Representative and is generally a senior civil servant or an experienced ambassador (and holding that diplomatic rank). Several countries have diplomatic missions to NATO through embassies in Belgium.|$|E

40|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} climate models {{is the large}} sea surface {{salinity}} (SSS) biases in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> In this study, we describe the influences of correcting these SSS biases on the circulation of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> {{as well as on}} <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector mean climate and decadal to multidecadal variability. We performed integrations of the Kiel Climate Model (KCM) with and without applying a freshwater flux correction over the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> The quality of simulating the mean circulation of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector mean climate and decadal variability is greatly enhanced in the freshwater flux-corrected integration which, by definition, depicts relatively small <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SSS biases. In particular, a large reduction in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> cold sea surface temperature bias is observed and a more realistic Atlantic Multidecadal Variability simulated. Improvements relative to the non-flux corrected integration also comprise a more realistic representation of deep convection sites, sea ice, gyre circulation and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The results suggest that simulations of <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector mean climate and decadal variability could strongly benefit from alleviating sea surface salinity biases in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> which may enhance the skill of decadal predictions in that region...|$|R
5|$|Operation Deny Flight was a <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Organization (NATO) {{operation}} that began on 12 April 1993 as {{the enforcement of}} a United Nations (UN) no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United Nations and NATO later expanded {{the mission of the}} operation to include providing close air support for UN troops in Bosnia and carrying out coercive air strikes against targets in Bosnia. Twelve NATO members contributed forces to the operation and, by its end on 20 December 1995, NATO pilots had flown 100,420 sorties.|$|E
5|$|The book {{explains}} the covert {{groups within the}} Soviet Union tasked with disrupting government activities of the countries belonging to the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Organization, and the U.S., through injection of Communist propaganda. The authors place the Soviet policy of active measures within a broader strategy of Russian military deception in favor of domestic national security. They focus their discussion on disinformation conducted by the Soviet intelligence between the period of 1960–1980.|$|E
5|$|After the {{experience}} of World War II, Belgium abandoned its neutral stance in international politics, in favour of military, political and economic integration. In 1949, Belgium joined the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Organization and deployed troops to fight alongside other United Nations forces in the Korean War in 1950. Belgium was also {{a key player in}} the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s. Belgium was assigned a sector of the British zone in West Germany, around the city of Cologne, which it occupied from 1945. Belgian soldiers remained in Germany until their final withdrawal in 2002.|$|E

40|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is the {{dominant}} mode of winter climate variability in the Northern hemisphere. It is a complex 'see-saw' between two pressure systems located over Greenland {{and a group of}} Islands known as the Azores. The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is most pronounced during the winter season and accounts for more than one third of the total variance in sea level pressure. The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is closely related to the position of the storm track. During a positive phase of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation the average storm track moves across the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> in a <b>North</b> Easterly direction towards Europe and the United Kingdom, During a negative phase of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation, the storm track moves in a West to East direction towards Southern Europe. Another track associated with the negative phase of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation moves in a Northerly direction along the coast of North America. The frequency and intensity of storms crossing the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> is also related to the phase of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation, but to a lesser degree (the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation accoimting for approximately 20 % of their variation). The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation has been experiencing an upward frend over the last thirty years becoming predominantly positive. In can be said that the upward trend is partially attributed to increasing greenhouse gas emissions; including the anthropogenic and human influences on sea level pressvire, however this must be proved by model simulations and further research...|$|R
5|$|At the 2014 Wales summit, {{the leaders}} of NATO's member states reaffirmed their pledge to spend the {{equivalent}} of at least 2% of their gross domestic products on defense. In 2015, five of its 28 members met that goal. On 15 June 2016, NATO officially recognized cyberwarfare as an operational domain of war, just like land, sea and aerial warfare. This means that any cyber attack on NATO members can trigger Article 5 of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty.</b> Montenegro became the 29th and newest member of NATO on 5 June 2017, amid strong objections from Russia.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{development}} of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Organisation (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four swivelling nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of plenum chamber burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation's Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.|$|E
5|$|In September 1975, the 24th Infantry Division was {{reactivated}} at Fort Stewart, Georgia, {{as part of}} {{the program}} to build a 16-division US Army force. Because the Regular Army could not field a full division at Fort Stewart, the 24th had the 48th Infantry Brigade of the Georgia Army National Guard assigned to it as a round-out unit in place of its 3rd Brigade. Targeted for a <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Organization (NATO) role, the 24th Division was reorganized as a mechanized division in 1979. It was one of several divisions equipped with new M1 Abrams tanks and M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles that formed the core of the U.S. Army's heavily armored mechanized force for the 15 years that followed.|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> biases on multiyear predictability of unforced surface air temperature (SAT) variability are {{examined in the}} Kiel Climate Model (KCM). By employing a freshwater flux correction over the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to the model, which strongly alleviates both <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) biases, the freshwater flux-corrected integration depicts significantly enhanced multiyear SAT predictability in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector {{in comparison to the}} uncorrected one. The enhanced SAT predictability in the corrected integration is due to a stronger and more variable Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its enhanced influence on <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST. Results obtained from preindustrial control integrations of models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) support the findings obtained from the KCM: models with large <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> biases tend to have a weak AMOC influence on SAT and exhibit a smaller SAT predictability over the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector...|$|R
40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) observations in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> indicate {{the existence of}} strong multidecadal variability with a unique spatial structure. It is shown {{by means of a}} new global climate model, which does not employ flux adjustments, that the multidecadal SST variability is closely related to variations in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> thermohaline circulation (THC). The close correspondence between the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST and THC variabilities allows, in conjunction with the dynamical inertia of the THC, for the prediction of the slowly varying component of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> climate system. It is shown additionally that past variations of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> THC can be reconstructed from a simple <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST index and that future, anthropogenically forced changes in the THC can be easily monitored by observing SSTs. The latter is confirmed by another state-of-the-art global climate model. Finally, the strong multidecadal variability may mask an anthropogenic signal in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> for some decades...|$|R
