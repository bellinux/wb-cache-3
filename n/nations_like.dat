In the meantime, Churchill tried to promote the advantages of the conflict, such as the possibility of territorial gains in the Middle East (the reason that would ultimately bring Italy and Balkans <b>nations</b> <b>like</b> Greece into the war). The Ottoman government finally declared war on the Triple Entente on 11 November.
