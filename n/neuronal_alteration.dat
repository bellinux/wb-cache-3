40|$|Background: Dark neurons are {{generated}} in vivo as an acute or delayed consequence of several pathological situations and lesions. The {{present study was}} designed to evaluate whether inflammatory pain induces formation of dark neurons in the dorsal horn of rat spinal cord. Since NO and JNK pathway are involved in the mechanisms of pain generation and degenerative <b>neuronal</b> <b>alteration,</b> their roles were also considered. Methods: Histological procedures were employed for detection of dark neurons following induction of inflammatory pain. Results: On the fifth day; following daily injections of 5 % formalin, numbers of dark neurons increased significantly. Acute and chronic administration of 1 % or 2. 5 % formalin did not induce any remarkable <b>neuronal</b> <b>alteration</b> in the dorsal horn of lumbar spinal cord. Daily intrathecal administration of quercetin (inhibitor of JNK pathway) 100 &micro;g/rat, or PTIO (NO scavenger) 30 &micro;g/rat before injection of 5 % formalin, led to a reliable reduction of formation of dark neurons. Conclusion: Results indicate that induction of inflammatory pain for longer periods may result in a serious central disorder, and administration of neutralizers or inhibitors of NO and JNK may exert neuroprotective effect...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY In {{order to}} {{determine}} the effect of lidocaine in focal cerebral ischemia, the left middle cerebral artery was transorbltally occluded in twenty cats. Eleven received lidocaine hydrochloride intrave-nously. The infusion was begun half an hour prior to clip occlusion and the rate was adjusted to maintain an isoelectric EEC Nine cats served as controls, receiving an equivalent volume of 5 % dextrose 0. 2 % saline. Thirteen animals (7 lidocaine-treated and 6 control) were sacrificed after six hours of left middle cerebral artery occlusion without reperfusion. In the remaining seven cats, the vessel was occluded for four hours prior to sacrifice. Ischemic <b>neuronal</b> <b>alteration</b> was assessed by both histochemical (2 ' 3 ' 5 ' triphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium hydrochloride reaction) and histologies] examination.

40|$|AbstractThe {{precursor}} of the non-amyloid β/A 4 protein (non-Aβ) component of Alzheimer’s disease amyloid (NACP) /α-synuclein {{is the human}} homologue of α-synuclein, {{a member of a}} protein family which includes α-, β- and γ-synuclein. This protein is thought to be involved in neuronal plasticity because of its unique expression, mainly in the telencephalon during maturation. Consequently, disarrangement of NACP/α-synuclein might disrupt synaptic activity, resulting in memory disturbance. Previous studies have shown that damage to synaptic terminals is closely associated with global cognitive impairment and is an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Although the relationship between synaptic damage and amyloidogenesis is not clear, some proteins at the synaptic site have been implicated in both <b>neuronal</b> <b>alteration</b> and amyloid formation. Indeed, abnormal accumulation of both NACP/α-synuclein and Aβ precursor protein occurs at synapses of Alzheimer’s patients. Other evidence suggests that NACP/α-synuclein is a component of the Lewy bodies found in patients with Parkinson’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, and that a point mutation in this protein may be the cause of familial Parkinson’s disease. Consequently, abnormal transport, metabolism or function of NACP/α-synuclein appears to impair synaptic function, which induces, at least in part, neuronal degeneration in several neurodegenerative diseases...|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} of the ovarian hormone 17 β-estradiol to prevent neurodegeneration has been characterized in several animal models of brain and spinal cord pathology. However, the potential reparative activity of the hormone under chronic neurodegenerative conditions has received less attention. In this study we have assessed the effect of estradiol therapy in adulthood on chronic glial and <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations</b> caused by perinatal asphyxia (PA) in rats. Four-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats submitted to PA just after delivery, and their control littermates, were injected for 3 consecutive days with 17 β estradiol or vehicle. Animals subjected to PA and treated with vehicle showed an increased astrogliosis, focal swelling and fragmented appearance of MAP- 2 immunoreactive dendrites, decreased MAP- 2 immunoreactivity and decreased phosphorylation of high and medium molecular weight neurofilaments in the hippocampus, compared to control animals. Estradiol therapy reversed these alterations. These findings indicate that estradiol is able to reduce, in adult animals, chronic reactive astrogliosis and <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations</b> caused by an early developmental neurodegenerative event, suggesting that the hormone might induce reparative actions in the Central Nervous System (CNS). © 2010.

To increase the knowledge on the biochemical composition {{of this type of}} tumor for better diagnosis and prognosis, we performed a molecular study using ex vivo high resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) perfomed on HPC and peritumoral edematous tissues. Moreover, to help in the discrimination between HPC and meningothelial meningioma we compared the ex vivo HR-MAS spectra of samples from one patient with HPC and 5 patients affected by meningothelial meningioma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in vivo localized single voxel 1 H-MRS was also performed on the same patients prior to surgery and the in vivo and ex vivo MRS spectra were compared. We observed the presence of OH-butyrate, together with glucose in HPC and a low amount of N-acetylaspartate in the edema, that may reflect <b>neuronal</b> <b>alteration</b> responsible for associated epilepsy. Many differences between HPC and meningothelial meningioma were identified. The relative ratios of myo-inositol, glucose and gluthatione with respect to glutamate are higher in HPC compared to meningioma; whereas the relative ratios of creatine, glutamine, alanine, glycine and choline-containing compounds with respect to glutamate are lower in HPC compared to meningioma.

40|$|The type 1 ryanodine {{receptor}} (RyR 1) {{is expressed}} widely in the brain, {{with high levels}} in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. We have shown that L-type Ca(2 +) channels in terminals of hypothalamic magnocellular neurons are coupled to RyRs, {{as they are in}} skeletal muscle, allowing voltage-induced Ca(2 +) release (VICaR) from internal Ca(2 +) stores without Ca(2 +) influx. Here we demonstrate that RyR 1 plays a role in VICaR in nerve terminals. Furthermore, in heterozygotes from the Ryr 1 (I 4895 T/WT) (IT/+) mouse line, carrying a knock-in mutation corresponding to one that causes a severe form of human central core disease, VICaR is absent, demonstrating that type 1 RyR mediates VICaR and that these mice have a neuronal phenotype. The absence of VICaR was shown in two ways: first, depolarization in the absence of Ca(2 +) influx elicited Ca(2 +) syntillas (scintilla, spark, in a nerve terminal, a SYNaptic structure) in WT, but not in mutant terminals; second, in the presence of extracellular Ca(2 +), IT/+ terminals showed a twofold decrease in global Ca(2 +) transients, with no change in plasmalemmal Ca(2 +) current. From these studies we draw two conclusions: (i) RyR 1 plays a role in VICaR in hypothalamic nerve terminals; and (ii) a <b>neuronal</b> <b>alteration</b> accompanies the myopathy in IT/+ mice, and, possibly in humans carrying the corresponding RyR 1 mutation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT (i) Understanding how {{memory is}} formed is an {{essential}} question in Neuroscience and is necessary to treat memory disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease. Biological assays are used to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for memory formation, while computer-simulated models of neural networks are created to investigate how hippocampal networks encode memory. Few studies investigated, however, how learning-induced <b>neuronal</b> molecular <b>alterations</b> identified by biologists influence these computer-simulated networks, {{due to the lack}} of scientific interaction between these two types of investigations. (ii) We therefore created a consortium of biologists, biophysicians and mathematicians to bridge these two disciplines and begin to fill this gap. We will combine our knowledge to create more realistic computer CA 1 neuron models. Also, we will identify how hippocampal activation of CREB, a transcription factor highly implicated in memory, results in better memory formation as previously reported by the biologists. (iii) To accurately model CREB-dependent <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations</b> that lead to better memory formation, we propose additional biological experiments identifying how CREB modulates afterhyperpolarization and GABAergic transmission. Also, we will create new highly realistic BAM neural networks to evaluate how CREB-dependent alterations affect the critical capacity of these networks.

40|$|Photodynamic {{therapy has}} been used in the {{management}} of patients with malignant brain tumors even though the effects of this form of treatment on the adjacent normal brain are incompletely characterized. The authors examined, in sequential experiments, morphologic alterations affecting the cerebral cortex in rats injected with Photophrin II and exposed to light. Initially, minimal cell alterations, including cisternal swelling of both endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, involved only neurons located in the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex exposed to light. These changes spread, {{over a period of several}} hours, from the surface to the bottom of the cortex and eventually involved the entire cortical segment exposed to light. The earliest structural signs of lethal injury to neurons developed over a period of 18 hours after porphyrins had been photoactivated and astrocytes had been severely damaged. Signs of lethal injury to neurons included an increase in the number of mitochondrial cristae and appearance of amorphous electron-dense deposits within swollen mitochondria. The appearance of these alterations was followed by segregation of intracytoplasmic organelles and fragmentation of nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes. The tissue changes, including those involving neurons, eventually progressed to coagulation necrosis at 48 hours. These observations suggest that prophyrins injected to rats (48 hours before photoactivation) cause swelling and necrosis of astrocytes. This is followed by neuronal necrosis, which appears at two time intervals; the initial neuronal necrosis occurs after the astrocytic disintegration.

The present study aimed to determine the delayed expression of mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors, following 1, 2, 7, and 30 days of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. Using quantitative autoradiography, we highlighted significant decreases in mu, delta and kappa opioid receptor expression in ipsilateral cortices from day 1 post-MCAO. Moreover, in contralateral nucleus lateralis thalami pars posterior, ipsi- and contralateral nucleus medialis dorsalis thalami, and ipsilateral substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNr), kappa receptors were increased; mu receptor densities were decreased in nucleus ventralis thalami, pars posterior (VThP), and SNr. delta-Binding sites were increased in the striatum on day 30 post-MCAO. The alterations in opioid receptors in cortical infarcts were correlated with strong histological damage. Further reductions in opioid receptor densities in cortical infarcts were observed at later time points. In subcortical brain regions, opioid receptor densities were also altered but no histological damage was seen, except in the VThP, in which cell density was increased on day 30. Delayed reductions in opioid receptor densities in the infarct appeared as the continuation of the early processes previously demonstrated. However, changes in subcortical opioid receptor expression may correlate with neuronal alterations in remote brain regions. Changes in opioidergic receptor expression in these regions may be involved in the long-term consequences of stroke and could be used as biomarker of <b>neuronal</b> <b>alteration</b> through the use of imaging techniques in the clinic...|$|E
40|$|Spectrins {{line the}} {{intracellular}} surface of plasmalemma {{and play a}} critical role in supporting cytoskeletal stability and flexibility. Spectrins can be proteolytically degraded by calpains and caspases, yielding breakdown products (SBDPs) of various molecular sizes, with SBDP 120 being largely derived from caspase- 3 cleavage. SBDPs are putative biomarkers for traumatic brain injury. The levels of SBDPs also elevate in the brain during aging and perhaps in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), although the cellular basis for this change is currently unclear. Here we examined age-related SBDP 120 alteration in forebrain neurons in rats and in the triple transgenic model of AD (3 ×Tg-AD) relative to non-transgenic controls. SBDP 120 immunoreactivity (IR) was found in cortical neuronal somata in aged rats, and was prominent in the proximal dendrites of the olfactory bulb mitral cells. Western blot and densitometric analyses in wild-type mice revealed an age-related elevation of intraneuronal SBDP 120 in the forebrain which was more robust in their 3 ×Tg-AD counterparts. The intraneuronal SBDP 120 occurrence was not spatiotemporally correlated with transgenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, β-amyloid plaque development, or phosphorylated tau expression over various forebrain regions or lamina. No microscopically detectable in situ activated caspase- 3 was found in the nuclei of SBDP 120 -containing neurons. The present study demonstrates the age-dependent intraneuronal presence of an αII-spectrin cleavage fragment in mammalian forebrain which is exacerbated in a transgenic model of AD.

The small GTPases of the RAB family, which play an essential role in intracellular vesicular trafficking, {{have been shown to be}} involved in MR. We report here the identification of mutations in the small GTPase RAB 39 B gene in two male patients. One mutation in family X (D- 23) introduced a stop codon seven amino acids after the start codon (c. 21 C > A; p. Y 7 X). A second mutation, in the MRX 72 family, altered the 5 ' splice site (c. 215 + 1 G > A) and normal splicing. Neither instance produced a protein. Mutations segregate with the disease in the families, and in some family members intellectual disabilities were associated with autism spectrum disorder, epileptic seizures, and macrocephaly. We show that RAB 39 B, a novel RAB GTPase of unknown function, is a neuronal-specific protein that is localized to the Golgi compartment. Its downregulation leads to an alteration in the number and morphology of neurite growth cones and a significant reduction in presynaptic buttons, suggesting that RAB 39 B is required for synapse formation and maintenance.

40|$|SENESCENCE AND INFLAMMATION: TRIGGERING FACTORS OR MODULATORS OF NEURODEGENERATION? AN EXPERIMENTAL PROPOSITION TO EVALUATE THEIR RELEVANCE IN PATHOGENESIS OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a {{dementia}} {{characterized by}} the progressive loss of memory and cognitive function Pathogenesis of sporadic AD would {{be the result of}} a complex interaction between genetic disposition, biological changes that might be attributed to underlying conditions of diverse physiopathological nature, aging, and the existence of pro- or anti-inflammatory conditions. It is not known how the 2 characteristic lesions of AD, the senile plaque and the neurofibrillary tangle, are mutually related or what factors determine the likelihood of getting the disease. It is proposed that a primary glial malfunction is the underlying pathogenic event, both for accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and for the inflammatory process responsible for the <b>neuronal</b> <b>alteration</b> and its evolution towards neurodegeneration. The following objectives were addressed in this project: i) To evaluate the effect of ageing on glial activity and neuronal function; ii) To evaluate cytotoxic or protective soluble factors produced by the glia; iii) To evaluate changes in the expression of ageing-dependant Scavenger Receptors (SR); iv) To evaluate the activation of specific signal transduction pathways in the interaction of the glia with Aβ; v) To study the effect of hypoxia and acidosis on the processing of Aβ, reactivity to Aβ and the induction of neurodegeneration by Aβ; vi) To evaluate the function of monocytes {{as a model for the}} study of microglia. During execution of the project, the main results obtained in the development of the various objectives were the following: i) The hypoxic inhibitory response of the postsynaptic potential is decreased as rats get older, at the same time that posthypoxic residual inhibition disappears. Treatment with TGFβ determines that young animals respond to hypoxia in a similar way to that observed in old animals, while treatment with an ERK MAPK inhibitor (one of the signalling pathways activated by TGFβ) determines that old animals feature an inhibition by hypoxia that is similar to that of young animals. The above suggests that, at least partially, electrophysiological changes occurred during ageing respond to changes in the inflammatory activation of the nervous system. ii and iv) The microglial activation, both by Aβ and by inflammatory mediators, plays an important role in damage induction in AD. This microglial activation is, in turn, modulated by astrocytes and neurons which secrete modulator cytokines such as TGFβ in response to the inflammatory activation. TGFβ inhibits the production of damage mediators such as nitric oxide and superoxide radicals by microglia. This inhibition is correlated to changes in activation of transduction pathways for specific signals, among which STAT 1, ERK and p 38 MAPK - all of them central in the inflammatory response - stand out. Besides, it induces changes in various aspects, including the expression pattern of scavenger receptors. iii and iv) Scavenger receptors and, specifically in these studies, SR-MARCO seem to be relevant because of both their ability to bond and participate in Aβ's interaction and their ability to mediate the inflammatory activation of glial cells. Responses triggered by various ligands are different in microglia and astrocytes and may include production of nitric oxide, secretion of IL- 1 β, and activation of signal transduction pathways. Multiple environmental stimuli modulate the differential expression of the diverse scavenger receptors, including hypoxia, acidosis, inflammatory activity, ageing, etc. Identification of damage mediation mechanisms by the glia, understanding their participation in Aβ’s accumulation, in the modulation of its inflammatory response, and in changes suffered by the regulation of these processes during ageing allows better understanding pathogenic effects of AD. This knowledge will enable designing specific therapeutic approaches aiming at the pathogenic mechanisms involved and will also make it possible to make an early diagnose of the disease before it progresses towards an irreversible deterioration.

Furthermore, characterization of injury-induced plasticity provides a useful assay system for the identification of possible induction signals underlying these neuronal changes.

These changes are examined at the behavioral, electrophysiological, and morphological levels. Injury-induced changes in the electrophysiological properties of neurons were found that increased the signaling effectiveness of the injured neurons. This increase in signalling effectiveness could act to compensate for partial destruction of the injured neuron 2 ̆ 7 s peripheral processes. Recovery of a defensive behavioral response which serves to protect the animal from further injury was found within 2 weeks of injury. For the behavioral recovery to occur, new neural pathways must have been formed between the denervated area and the CNS. This was found to be mediated at least in part by new axonal growth which extended from the injured cell back along the original pathway (i. e. into the injured nerve). In addition, injury produced central axonal sprouting into different nerves that do not usually contain the injured neuron 2 ̆ 7 s axons. This could be important for (i) finding alternative pathways to the periphery when the original pathways are impassable and (ii) the formation of additional synaptic connections with post-synaptic targets which would further enhance the signalling effectiveness of the injured cell. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} reported (Europ, Neurol., 3, 347 - 364, 1970) on two clinical observations of progressive myoclonus epilepsy {{in the same}} family. Now, we complete the clinical study showing the neuropathological findings concerning {{one of the two}} patients who {{died at the age of}} twenty. Degenerative <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations</b> were found involving the olivo-cerebello-rubral system and, in a minor degree, the brain stem and thalamic structures. No Lafora bodies were found. These pathological features make it possible to suggest a differentiation from a first group of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (Unverricht-Lundborg) and another group (with epileptic manifestations) of dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica (Ramsay Hunt). We agree with the suggestion of other authors that it is difficult to establish precise differentiations between these groups at neuropathological level. We think however that the distinction is still possible on the basis of the clinical picture. Our observations cupport the hypothesis that our patient is an "abiotrophic" case of Unverricth-Lundborg syndrome, as we previously had suggested on clinical and especially neurophysiological findings...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFragile X {{syndrome}} (FXS) patients present <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations</b> {{that lead}} to severe intellectual disability, but the underlying neuronal circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. An emerging hypothesis postulates that reduced GABAergic inhibition of excitatory neurons is a key component in the pathophysiology of FXS. Here, we directly test this idea in a FXS Drosophila model. We show that FXS flies exhibit strongly impaired olfactory behaviors. In line with this, olfactory representations are less odor specific due to broader response tuning of excitatory projection neurons. We find that impaired inhibitory interactions underlie reduced specificity in olfactory computations. Finally, we show that defective lateral inhibition across projection neurons is caused by weaker inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. We provide direct evidence that deficient inhibition impairs sensory computations and behavior in an in vivo model of FXS. Together with evidence of impaired inhibition in autism and Rett syndrome, these findings suggest a potentially general mechanism for intellectual disability...|$|R

Genetic analyses showed that the BN-J phenotype results from an autosomal recessive indel novel mutation in the Crb 1 gene, causing dislocalization of the protein from the retinal Mu¨ller glia (RMG) /photoreceptor cell junction.

In this study, {{the number of}} neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus has been assessed in male and female Wistar rats at 3, 6, 12, 14, 18, 22 and 24 months of age, using the optical fractionator method. Male rats had more neurons than females at all the ages studied. Significant neuronal loss was observed in both sexes between 22 and 24 months of age. In a second experiment, 22 month-old male and female rats were treated for 10 weeks with 2 mg/kg/day of GH or saline. At 24 months of age, animals treated with GH had more neurons in the hilus than animals treated with saline. These findings indicate that GH is neuroprotective in old animals and that its administration may ameliorate <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations</b> associated to aging. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Summary Fragile X {{syndrome}} patients present <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations</b> {{that lead}} to severe intellectual disability, but the underlying neuronal circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. An exciting hypothesis postulates that reduced GABAergic inhibition of excitatory neurons is a key component in the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome. Here, I directly test this idea. First, I show that a Drosophila melanogaster model of fragile X syndrome exhibits strongly impaired olfactory behaviors. In line with this, olfactory representations are less odor-specific due to broader response tuning of excitatory projection neurons. I find that impaired inhibitory interactions underlie reduced specificity in olfactory representations. Finally, I show that defective lateral inhibition across projection neurons is caused by weaker inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. I provide direct evidence that deficient inhibition impairs sensory computations and behavior in an in vivo model of fragile X syndrome. Together with evidence of impaired inhibition in autism and Rett syndrome, these findings suggest a potentially general mechanism for intellectual disability. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Scrapie is a {{transmissible}} {{spongiform encephalopathy}} affecting {{the central nervous system}} in sheep. The key event in such neurodegeneration is the conversion of the normal prion protein (PrPC) into the pathological isoform (PrPSc). Misfolded prion proteins are normally degraded by the proteasome. This work, analyzing models of scrapie disease, describes the in vivo relationship between the proteasome and prions. We report that the disease is associated with an increase of proteasome functionality, most likely as a means of counteracting the increased levels of oxidative stress. Here, we show that prions coprecipitate with the 20 S proteasome and that they colocalize within the same neuron, thus raising the possibility that PrP interacts with the proteasome in both normal and diseased brain, affecting substrate trafficking and proteasome functionality. This interaction, inducing proteasome activation, leads to different <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations</b> and triggers apoptosis. Furthermore, testing the effects of isolated PrPC on purified 20 S proteasomes, we obtain a concentration- and proteasome composition-dependent decrease in the complex activity.

50|$|Nonsynaptic {{plasticity}} {{is a form}} of neuroplasticity {{that involves}} modification of ion channel function in the axon, dendrites, and cell body that results in specific changes in the integration of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). Nonsynaptic plasticity is a modification of the intrinsic excitability of the neuron. It interacts with synaptic plasticity, but it is considered a separate entity from synaptic plasticity. Intrinsic modification of the electrical properties of neurons plays a role in many aspects of plasticity from homeostatic plasticity to learning and memory itself. Nonsynaptic plasticity affects synaptic integration, subthreshold propagation, spike generation, and other fundamental mechanisms of neurons at the cellular level. These individual <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations</b> can result in changes in higher brain function, especially learning and memory. However, as an emerging field in neuroscience, much of the knowledge about nonsynaptic plasticity is uncertain and still requires further investigation to better define its role in brain function and behavior.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{amygdala}} {{is known}} to be involved in anxiety processing, but its role in the psychopathology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is still unclear. Aims: In this MRI study we investigated potential alterations in structural and functional connectivity of the amygdala in 42 adult patients with OCD and 37 healthy subjects. Method: Psychophysiological interaction analysis was used to explore amygdala functional connectivity during a negative affective task. Probabilistic tractography was then employed to study structural connectivity and integrity of underlying white matter fiber tracts. Results: Compared to controls, OCD patients showed a significantly increased functional connectivity of the left amygdala with mostly parieto-occipital regions during task. No structural connectivity differences could be found between the groups. In addition, only patients showed a significant association between functional and structural connectivity of these regions. Moreover, symptom severity was negatively associated with structural integrity of the underlying white matter tracts. Conclusions: Present results emphasize the relevance of the amygdala for OCD and may reflect that <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations</b> in structural connectivity could be associated with functional connectivity alterations in broader networks...|$|R
40|$|Trimethyltin-induced {{intoxication}} has a {{great impact}} on human health due to the widespread occurrence of methyltin compounds. Acute TMT intoxication in humans leads to a variety of neurological symptoms which involve primarily the limbic system. In the present review we summarized the neuromorphological correlates of this neurological syndrome extending the analysis to various extra-limbic regions and detailing the fine ultrastructure of TMT-induced <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations.</b> In order to comprehend the pathophysiology of TMT-induced neuronal damage we analysed the various experimental models of TMT-induced neurotoxicity. When comparing various animal species, it seems that the variety of neuropathological correlates are not related to species difference in the sensitivity to TMT toxicity but to a different susceptibility to secondary effects produced by TMT. In fact, apart from a primary neurotoxic damage induced by TMT at neuronal level, this compound promotes the onset of limbic and generalized seizures, which in turn add a secondary damage to that induced immediately by TMT. Thus, the different neuropathology observed in different animal species is produced mainly by a different sensitivity to epilepsy-induced brain damage...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of limbic {{encephalopathy}} clinically characterized by a progressive amnestic syndrome and many EEG seizures mainly localized on the left temporal area. Biological investigations revealed diabetes mellitus and a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (IADH). Haemodynamic and metabolic studies by positron-emission tomography showed an important increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen on the left anterior temporal region precisely where the electrical seizures were recorded. Nine months later, severe disorders of memory and a dramatic decrease in CBF and CMRO 2 on the same area region were present. At autopsy, a small size oat cell bronchial carcinoma was found with metastases in two small adjacent lymph nodes. Neuropathological examination showed atrophy (neuronal loss, protoplasmic gliosis) in the amygdala; where there was in addition an area of nodular gliosis. The hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus lesions were severe {{on the left and}} moderate on the right side. The authors discuss the nosology of their case in the paraneoplastic syndromes and, with a review of the literature, the role of ADH and cellular hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of specifically localized <b>neuronal</b> <b>alterations.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
