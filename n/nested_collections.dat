40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{techniques for}} compiling the nested parallelism of collectionoriented languages onto existing parallel hardware. Programmers of parallel machines encounter nested parallelism whenever they write a routine that performs parallel operations, and then {{want to call}} that routine itself in parallel. This occurs naturally in many applications. Most parallel systems, however, do not permit the expression of nested parallelism. This forces the programmer to exploit only one level of parallelism or to implement nested parallelism themselves. Both of these alternatives tend to produce code that is harder to maintain and less modular than code described at a higher-level with nested parallel constructs. Not permitting the expression of nested parallelism is analogous to not permitting nested loops in serial languages. This paper describes issues and techniques for taking high-level descriptions of parallelism {{in the form of}} operations on <b>nested</b> <b>collections</b> and automaticall [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an approach for pipelining nested data collections in scientific workflows. Our approach logically delimits arbitrarily <b>nested</b> <b>collections</b> of data tokens using special, paired control tokens inserted into token streams, and provides workflow components with high-level operations for managing these collections. Our framework provides new capabilities for: (1) concurrent operation on collections; (2) on-the-fly customization of workflow component behavior; (3) improved handling of exceptions and faults; and (4) transparent passing of provenance and metadata within token streams. We demonstrate our approach using a workflow for inferring phylogenetic trees. We also describe future extensions to support richer typing mechanisms for facilitating sharing and reuse of workflow components between disciplines.

40|$|We {{investigate}} and compare {{two forms of}} recursion on sets for querying <b>nested</b> <b>collections.</b> The first one is called sri and it corresponds to sequential processing of data.

First, we exhibit a uniform translation of sri queries into sru queries over the nested relational algebra. We observe that this translation maps PTIME algorithms into exponential-space queries. The second result proves that any uniform translation of sri queries into sru queries over the nested relational algebra must map some PTIME queries into exponential-space ones. In fact, {{in the presence of}} certain external functions, we provide a PTIME sri query for which any equivalent sru query requires exponential space. Thus, as a mechanism f [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The Dexter Model {{defines the}} notion of atomic {{components}} and composite components, {{but it does not}} prescribe, nor it suggests, any particular structure for composite components. This paper proposes a specific type of composite component, called “collection”. A collection is a container holding several members. Collections can contain other collections (<b>nested</b> <b>collections).</b> Collections can be regarded as sets, but they can also have an inner structure. Collections can be created in several ways: manually, through queries, by operations on other collections, by exploiting links, etc. Collections introduce a navigational pattern, based on their structure, that is different from the standard node&link navigation. If active media are considered, collections allow the design and implementation of complex synchronisation strategies, difficult to obtain otherwise. The paper describes the motivations for using collections, their structure, their navigational capabilities and a number of possible authoring mechanisms. It also examines the interplay between standard navigation and collection navigation, possible synchronization strategies for collections, as well as the requirements for the definition of a mntime support (which could be used to extend the runtime layer of the Dexter Model) ...|$|E

Moreover, it implies that many recursive queries, including simple ones like test for a chain, cannot be expressed in a nested relational language even when aggregate functions are available.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONRenal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) accounts for approximately 3 % of adult malignancies and {{is responsible for}} over 13, 000 deaths in the U. S. annually. The fatalities are largely due to distant metastasis, with lung, liver, bone and brain being most commonly affected organs. Gastric metastasis from RCC is a rare event (less than 20 cases reported in the English language literature) and usually presents as a large, solitary mass or ulcer (average size of 4. 8 cm) resembling primary gastric cancer. Here we report the first case of metastatic RCC presenting as small gastric polyps. PRESENTATION OF CASEThe patient was a 60 -year-old African American woman {{with a history of}} clear cell RCC (pT 1 bNX). She underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy 5 months after nephrectomy due to anemia. Two non-ulcerated, 0. 6 -cm benign-appearing polyps were found at the greater curvature of the gastric body, which were subsequently removed endoscopically. Unexpectedly, histopathologic examination of the gastric polyps revealed <b>nested</b> <b>collections</b> of vacuolated epithelioid cells in a background of delicate, arborizing vasculature, immediately beneath the congested and hyperplastic foveolar epithelium. A diagnosis of metastatic RCC was rendered after confirming the renal epithelial origin by immunohistochemical stains. DISCUSSIONGastric metastasis from RCC usually presents as a large, solitary mass or ulcer, but it can be subtle and present as multiple, small benign-appearing polyps.

Thus, for example, the result permits the integration of deterministic and probabilistic analysis to eliminate regions from an uncertainty set and reduce even further the complexity of some problems.
