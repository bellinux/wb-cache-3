5|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{about the}} Tribune made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx {{to reach a}} sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the Tribune had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy. Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses {{of the working class}} of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the Tribune was the most widely circulated journal in the United States. Editorially, the Tribune reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> the Tribune have wide readership with the United States and <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class. Marx's first article for the New York Tribune was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the Tribune on 21 August 1852.|$|E

5|$|Discovery {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the California Supreme Court ordered reciprocal discovery rules, without an initial law requiring it. However, a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> both sides refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for both sides. In 1974, the California Supreme Court ordered the legislature to create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.|$|E

5|$|Further {{analysis}} shows that several processes were in {{progress in the}} late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction.

Several recitals ensued and led to the making of a television documentary on Sorabji, which was broadcast in 1977. The images in it consisted mostly of still photographs of his house; there was just one brief shot of Sorabji waving to the departing camera crew.|$|E
