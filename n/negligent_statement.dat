2500|$|Legal capital must be {{maintained}} (not distributed to shareholders, or distributed [...] "in disguise") unless a company formally reduces its legal capital. Then it can make distributions, which might be desirable if a company wishes to shrink. A private company must have a 75 per cent vote of the shareholders, and the directors must then warrant that the company will remain solvent and {{will be able to}} pay its debts. If this {{turns out to be a}} <b>negligent</b> <b>statement,</b> the director can be sued. But this means it is hard to claw back any profits from shareholders if a company does indeed go insolvent, if the director's statement appeared good at the time. If not all the directors are prepared to make a solvency statement, the company may apply to court for a decision. In public companies, a special resolution must also be passed, and a court order is necessary. The court can make a number of orders, for example that creditors should be protected with security interest. There is a general principle that shareholders must be treated equally in making capital reductions, however this does not mean that unequally situated shareholders must be treated the same. In particular, while no ordinary shareholder should lose shares disproportionately, it has been held legitimate to cancel preferential shares before others, particularly if those shares are entitled to preferential payment as a way of considering [...] "the position of the company itself as an economic entity". Economically, companies buying their own shares back from shareholders would achieve the same effect as a reduction of capital. Originally it was prohibited by the common law, but now although the general rule remains in section 658 there are two exceptions. First, a company may issue shares on terms that they may be redeemed, though only if there is express authority in the constitution of a public company, and the re-purchase can only be made from distributable profits. Second, since 1980 shares can simply be bought back from shareholders if, again this is done out of distributable profits. Crucially, the directors must also state that the company will be able to pay all its debts and continue for the next year, and shareholders must approve this by special resolution. Under the Listing Rules for public companies, shareholders must generally be given the same buy back offer, and get shares bought back pro rata. How many shares are retained by the company as treasury shares or cancelled must be reported to Companies House. From the company's perspective the legal capital is being reduced, hence the same regulation applies. From the shareholder's perspective, the company buying back some of its shares is much the same as simply paying a dividend, except for one main difference. Taxation of dividends and share buy backs tends to be different, meaning that often buy backs are popular just because they [...] "dodge" [...] the Exchequer.|$|E
5000|$|Judicial {{concern has}} also been {{expressed}} about potential liability for negligent misstatements. Unlike physical acts, a <b>negligent</b> <b>statement</b> may be relied upon by {{a great many people}} leading to a wide class of potential claims. Accordingly, in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd the House of Lords imposed the requirement that there would need to be a [...] "special relationship" [...] in order to justify a duty of care under which a person making a <b>negligent</b> <b>statement</b> could be held liable to a person who relied upon it.|$|E
5000|$|IDL (sued by CAC on a {{third party}} basis) was liable for its <b>negligent</b> <b>statement</b> that the plaintiff's {{permission}} was not required. As {{an expert in the}} public relations field the second defendant should have realized that {{there might have been a}} legal problem. CAC was awarded judgment for contribution and indemnity in respect of the damages awarded to Athans.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{the conduct}} {{takes the form}} of {{omissions}} or <b>negligent</b> <b>statements,</b> it is usually not wrongful even if physical harm results. The courts scrutinise such cases very carefully, as special factors need to exist for liability to arise.|$|R
50|$|Candler v Crane, Christmas & Co 1951 2 KB 164 is an English {{tort law}} case. In it, Denning LJ {{delivered}} an important dissenting judgment, arguing for a {{duty of care}} for <b>negligent</b> <b>statements.</b> This was later upheld in Hedley Byrne v Heller & Partners Ltd 1963 2 All ER 575 by the House of Lords.|$|R
50|$|Brightman J {{held that}} Overbrooke Estates Ltd were not {{responsible}} and could get specific performance. Condition R(b) was effective - not to exclude liability, but {{to define their}} duty so that responsibility for the auctioneer's <b>negligent</b> <b>statements</b> was never assumed. The condition meant that no ostensible authority {{had been given to}} the auctioneers as agents to make representations on Overbrooke's behalf. Therefore s 3 MA 1967 did not apply.|$|R
5000|$|Negligent {{misrepresentation}} under Statute, {{enacted by}} the Misrepresentation Act 1967. When dealing with a negligent misrepresentation it is most lucrative (joint with fraudulent misrepresentation, Contributory Negligence notwithstanding) for an action to be brought under statute law as {{the burden of proof}} that is required passes to the person who made the statement. So it is for the person who made the <b>negligent</b> <b>statement</b> to prove that the statement was either not one of fact but opinion and that [...] "had reasonable ground to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true" [...] - the so-called innocent defence.|$|E
50|$|Smith v Eric S Bush 1989 1 AC 831; The {{defendants}} were surveyors for a mortgagee. They performed {{a survey of}} the house, declaring it to need no significant repair. Relying on the survey, the house was conveyed to a purchaser. The chimney stack in the house subsequently fell down, and the purchaser sued for the <b>negligent</b> <b>statement.</b> It was held that even though the defendants had issued a liability waiver, it could not stand up to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977's test of reasonableness. More importantly, however, the court held that it was reasonable for the purchaser of a modest house to rely on the surveyors' evaluation, as it was such common practice. Thus, the court extended Hedley Byrne liability to proximate third parties.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{misrepresentation}} and the exposure of universities to legal liability for innocent, fraudulent or <b>negligent</b> <b>statements</b> by academics or administrative staff made to students or prospective students. A greater public awareness of consumer rights through media coverage of damage awards, speculative actions by lawyers, and a changed perception of universities by students have led to litigation against universities where defects {{in the provision of}} services have occurred. This article seeks to highlight the importance of oral and written statements made by universities and staff and the legal consequences resultant on inaccurate or careless misrepresentations...|$|R

50|$|Started as Crown Corporation, Langbar was {{the biggest}} pump and dump fraud on the Alternative Investment Market, part of the London Stock Exchange. The company was at one point valued greater than $1 billion, based on {{supposed}} bank deposits in Brazil which did not exist. None of the chief conspirators were convicted, although their whereabouts are known. A patsy who made a <b>negligent</b> false <b>statement</b> about the assets was convicted and banned from being a director. The investors who lost as much as £100 million sued one of the fraudsters and recovered £30 million.|$|R
