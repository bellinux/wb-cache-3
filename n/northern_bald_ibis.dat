His genus Upupa contained species that had a long curved bill and a short blunt tongue. These included the <b>northern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> and the hoopoe, birds now known to be completely unrelated to the choughs.|$|E

50|$|The ibises are gregarious, long-legged {{wading birds}} with long down-curved bills. Along with the spoonbills they form one {{subfamily}} within the Threskiornithidae family. The <b>northern</b> <b>bald</b> ibis' closest relative, {{and the only}} other member of the genus, is the southern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis,</b> G. calvus, of southern Africa. The two Geronticus species differ from other ibises in that they have unfeathered faces and heads, breed on cliffs rather than in trees, and prefer arid habitats to the wetlands used by their relatives.|$|R

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is part of}} {{the genus}} Geronticus, which includes two distinct species. The southern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> (Geronticus calvus) is restricted primarily to the southern regions of Africa whereas its counterpart, the waldrapp (Geronticus eremita) is found in the northern regions of the continent. Both species share common characteristics regardless of their geographic separation. Both species nest on rock cliffs and display distinct breeding behaviours adapted for their particular locations. Similarly, they both show evolutionary adaptations in foraging behaviours due to their dry habitats. The separation between these two species is believed to have occurred relatively recently. This separation, between G. calvus and G. eremita, is believed to have occurred only 335 000 to 1 million years ago.|$|R

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is part of}} the family, Threskiornithidae, {{which is}} composed of birds from the warm temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the exclusion of Oceania.

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> (Geronticus calvus) {{is a large}} bird {{found in}} open grassland or semi-desert {{in the mountains of}} southern Africa.Taxonomically, it is most closely related to its counterpart in the northern regions of Africa, the waldrapp (Geronticus eremita).

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is known}} to be a relatively quiet bird. This species in particular has been noted to make a weak gobbling sound. This is refers back to their old Afrikaans name of “Wilde-Kalkoen”, otherwise translated as “wild turkey”. This bird is most boisterous in the nesting areas and in flight. It projects a high-pitched keeaaw-klaup-klaup call, resembling that of a turkey’s.|$|R
50|$|In {{line with}} the legacy of Konrad Lorenz, the {{research}} focus of the KLF lies on behavioural biology of birds and cognitive studies. Research models are in particular greylag goose, <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> and corvid birds. In addition to behavioural studies, the KLF is active in conservation efforts of bold ibis {{and was the first}} institution world-wide that succeeded in establishing a self-sustained colony of bold ibis from birds bred in captivity.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> is a {{bird that}} feeds and roosts in large groups. They travel in groups of up to 100 individuals to find suitable foraging areas. As insectivores, their diet is composed mainly of insects and other small invertebrates found in burnt grasslands. The species live on cliff edges where they build their nests {{and for the most}} part, breed in colonies. They do little vocalizing besides occasional gobbling sounds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{lives for}} an average of 20 to 25 years in captivity (oldest {{recorded}} male 37 years, oldest recorded female 30 years). The average age in the wild has been estimated as 10 to 15 years.|$|E

5000|$|The {{southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> is {{a species}} {{with a very}} restricted homerange.

[...] The species is confined to the eastern regions of South Africa and are restricted to the highland and mountainous regions. Its range extends from the highlands of Lesotho extending into Swaziland. The birds may migrate short distances within their designated home ranges.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> nests in {{cliffs and}} breeds on open ledges. Due to the mostly inaccessible {{nature of these}} areas, observations during breeding season are difficult to obtain. However, these birds are known to predominantly breed in colonies, while some pairs decide to nest away from the rest. The females lay their eggs anywhere from late July to mid-October. Following this, the young develop feathers for flight around mid-October and into the month of December.|$|R
