40|$|A genre {{label of}} 'Noise Music' or 'Noise' has emerged {{over the last}} two decades and become an {{increasingly}} common descriptor for artists working at the fringes of various forms of rock and popular music. Yet in theorizing noise (in the theoretical sense) and Noise (a genre and culture), discourse has often been limited to those artists with strong ties to the Western Avant-Garde and its institutions, or at the very least, those who profess creative indebtedness to that tradition. Though this is true of many prominent Noise musicians, this framing can exclude or marginalize many of the rich details that constitute the aesthetic and personal identities of <b>Noise</b> <b>culture.</b> This paper will address the gap between existing academic Noise discourse and the experiences of musicians living in San Diego whose music, at times, may be considered Noise. Through interviews and observations of performances, I will provide an ethnographic account of these musicians, their work, and their communities as a means of grounding discussion in lived experience. After locating these musicians and their work within various cultural and aesthetic topographies, I will use observations about their creative practices and their descriptions thereof to theorize the significance of physical materials in meaning-making processe...|$|E

40|$|Phenotypic {{heterogeneity}} among individual cells within isogenic populations {{is widely}} documented, but its consequences {{are not well}} understood. Here, cell-to-cell variation in the stress resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, particularly to cadmium, was revealed {{to depend on the}} antioxidant glutathione. Heterogeneity was decreased strikingly in gsh 1 mutants. Furthermore, cells sorted according to differing reduced-glutathione (GSH) contents exhibited differing stress resistances. The vacuolar GSH-conjugate pathway of detoxification was implicated in heterogeneous Cd resistance. Metabolic oscillations (ultradian rhythms) in yeast are known to modulate single-cell redox and GSH status. Gts 1 p stabilizes these oscillations and was found to be required for heterogeneous Cd and hydrogen-peroxide resistance, through the same pathway as Gsh 1 p. Expression of GTS 1 from a constitutive tet-regulated promoter suppressed oscillations and heterogeneity in GSH content, and resulted in decreased variation in stress resistance. This enabled manipulation of the degree of gene expression <b>noise</b> in <b>cultures.</b> It was shown that cells expressing Gts 1 p heterogeneously had a competitive advantage over more-homogeneous cell populations (with the same mean Gts 1 p expression), under continuous and fluctuating stress conditions. The results establish a novel molecular mechanism for single-cell heterogeneity, and demonstrate experimentally fitness advantages that depend on deterministic variation in gene expression within cell populations...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{permeates}} our highly mediated and globalised <b>cultures.</b> <b>Noise</b> as art, music, {{cultural or}} digital practice {{is a way}} of intervening {{so that it can be}} harnessed for an aesthetic expression not caught within mainstream styles or distribution. This wide-ranging book examines the concept and practices of noise, treating noise not merely as a sonic phenomenon but as an essential component of all communication and information systems. The book opens with ideas of what noise is, and then works through ideas of how noise works in contemporary media, to conclude by showing potentials within noise for a continuing cultural renovation through experimentation. Considered in this way, noise is seen as an essential yet excluded element of contemporary culture that demands a rigorous engagement. Reverberations brings together a range of perspectives, case studies, critiques and suggestions as to how noise can mobilize thought and cultural activity through a heightening of critical creativity. Written by a strong, international line-up of scholars and artists, Reverberations looks to energize this field of study and initiate debates for years to come...|$|R
40|$|This article reappraises {{representations}} of “ 9 / 11 ” within a longer history of {{noise in the}} American novel. Consumed by {{the noise of the}} present, driven by the desire to speak loudly, and convinced of the importance of traumatic “event” both to the present moment and to the lives of future generations, novels of the political “now” are often afflicted by what Jacques Derrida refers to as “archive fever”, a phenomenon that is characterized by an eagerness to dispose of the present into the past and to imagine how the contemporary world will be remembered by future generations (Derrida 1998, 68). In this way, this article argues that “ 9 / 11 ” fictions by Don DeLillo, John Updike, Jonathan Safran Foer, Jess Walter, and Amy Waldman are best understood as ideologically inflected narratives that emphasise the <b>noise</b> of contemporary <b>culture,</b> associating the present with the singular noise of “ 9 / 11 ” and thus limiting how novelists write a history of their contemporary moment...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, much media {{attention}} has been paid to the phenomenon of ‘vocal fry’ – a creaking, growling affectation that occurs when the voice is in its lowest register. Vocal fry has been understood as a specifically feminine affliction. Yet this vocalisation is neither new nor gender specific; indeed, vocal fry has long been used in music as a means of aiding expressivity and generating unusual vocal sonorities. In this article, Marie Thompson interrogates the phenomenon of vocal fry and its use as a musical resource. She argues that vocal fry, as it has been characterised in recent accounts by ‘feminist’ and media commentators, connects to a historical lineage of ‘feminised’ <b>noise.</b> In Eurocentric <b>cultures,</b> feminine vocal qualities and speech have long been admonished as ‘noisy’ – that is, unwanted, irritating, meaningless and damaging. She also examines vocal fry's utilisation in music in relation to the work of Joan LaBarbara and Runhild Gammelsæter: arguing that if LaBarbara extends the creak, Gammelsæter extends the growl. Consequently, Marie Thompson proposes that LaBarbara and Gammelsæter’s work can be interpreted as alluding to the connections between noise and femininity...|$|R
40|$|This brief chapter {{has three}} goals: 1) to {{introduce}} some ideas from ecologicalpsychology into ecomusicology; 2) {{to use these}} to expose and critique assumptions we may have about the distinctions to be made between nature and <b>culture,</b> <b>noise</b> and music; and 3) to apply this ecological thinking to how we teach music, particularly in higher education. A number of writers and musicians have helped highlight and critique the sharp distinctions between music and noise made in folk and academic aesthetics, or to show how such distinctions rest upon and indeed mirror wider sociological issues (Cage 1961, Schaeffer 1966, Shafer 1977, Attali 1985, Truax 2001). The idea of noise {{and its relationship to}} music have been brought to the forefront of writing on music (Hegarty 2007). I aim to critique this opposition by exploring how artistic and everyday modes of perception and action rest upon identical processes of sensitivity to information, thus questioning our assumptions about culture and nature as objects of study (Windsor 2004, Windsor and de Bézenac 2012). This ecological approach to music (Clarke 2005, Reybrouck 2005) embeds musicology within a semiotics bounded by the physicality of action and perception, and it provides a neat counterpoint to the relativism that Cook finds troubling (Cook 2000, Dibben and Windsor 2001) ...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Stina Johansson, Anna Lennartsson, Caroline WennerstenTutors: Peter Caesar   Title: Communication without boundaries? – a study {{about the}} {{problems}} of Gothenburg culture festival communications to multicultural areas. Keywords: communication, multucultural areas, communicationmodel, attitudes, diversity marketing, culture, Gothenburg Culture Festival     Background: There can be many problems with communication in multicultural areas. It has become more important for companies to communicate in order to gain competitive advantage. Gothenburg Culturefestival has a large number of visitors and since last year they have noticed that there are not as many visitors from some multicultual areas in Gothenburg. This makes it interesting {{to see what kind of}} problems that exists in the current communication.   Problem statement: What noise is there in communicating to a multicultural target group and how does they affect the goals and the result with the communication? Purpose: The purpose of this paper is based on the communicationmodel and from there describe the communication between companies and multicultural areas, and from this identify problems with such communication. Method: 118 respondents were selected through a convenience sample and then  asked questions through structured interviews based on a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained 15 questions concerning Gothenburg Culture Festival and their communication. The interviews were conducted in four multicultural areas in Gothenburg and the respondents consisted of many different nationalities.   Conclusions: There are many noises in communucating with a multicultural target group. They come from both the sender, the reciever, but it also lies in the message itself. Different <b>noises</b> are <b>culture,</b> attitudes, interest, language, the way the message is sent but also what the message is communicating. These noises are later affecting the goals and the results with the communication negatively. In our case the noises where difficulties with the language but also negative attitudes about the event. All of these noises is to be observed in the work of communicating with a multicultural target group.   Suggestion of further research: Out of the problems identified in this thesis, a study with a bigger population can be made, but also with more areas around Gothenburg. A study concerning only the people who have not visited Gothenburg Culturefestival can also be made in order to specify their wants and see if there is a pattern why they do not visit the event. A study between different areas in Gothenburg with different amount of visitors can be made to see if there is any cultural differences between the different areas...|$|R
40|$|Tourists bring many {{benefits}} {{to a local}} community, encouraging it {{to be involved in}} that activity; however, it may also have detrimental effects like garbage, <b>noise,</b> violence, external <b>culture</b> and the damaging of the natural environment among others, which may promote community dissatisfaction. The contact between the tourist and the local community is a concern, especially when the community is located near protected areas. In this case, the community must know the tourist destination well, so it can collaborate in the tourism development without harming the environment. In this context, the present article aims to demonstrate the results of a research study conducted as part of a doctorate program in Sciences from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. It had as an objective to elaborate a methodology proposal to measure the local community satisfaction indicator, with applicability on a case study in the Mateiros community located in the surrounding area of the Parque Estadual do Jalapão –PEJ conservation unit in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. This is a study of an interdisciplinary nature that had the deductive method as its guide. The indicator result is going to be presented in this study. It pointed out as negative factors: there is no involvement between the local community and the tourism sector, and there is also dissatisfaction with regard to the town’s basic services. The study showed as positive the local community knowledge about the various attractions in the surrounding area and that the group recognizes the importance of the tourism for the town and life. Concerning the methodology that was used, the results showed that it can collaborate in seeking actions of improvement and involvement of the community in the planning and development of the local tourism. It comes out as an efficient analysis tool, thus enabling the perceiving of the local community point of view...|$|R
40|$|The four novels - The Floating Opera, The End of the Road, White Noise, and Vineland - are {{representative}} of the cultural shift away from traditional moral concepts after World War II. Popular culture has increasingly become the guiding force for the continuation of American society, and in Don DeLillo�s White <b>Noise,</b> popular <b>culture</b> and its creation of myth (according to the author�s representation of America) has become embedded in the system and life of contemporary America. John Barth�s novel The End of the Road and its predecessor The Floating Opera are important in any discussion of the role of popular culture and popular mythology in post-war America. They both appear to signal an end to sincere intellectual thought or debate, and the notion of imposing a rational moral world upon the social landscape surrounding the individual. The Floating Opera explores the common tendency of society to avoid difficult intellectual struggles, and the central character and first-person narrator ultimately realises that questions about the nature of existence are of no objective value. In The End of the Road the character Jacob Horner adopts a superficial reflection of pre-existing rules and social conventions. Together these novels reflect much of what is at present understood as the postmodern aesthetic, and are indicative of many of the changes in America that were about to occur. The Floating Opera was published in 1956 and The End of the Road was published in 1958, but they are still highly relevant beyond the period in which they were written. White Noise (1984) portrays a system founded on the Hollywood mythology, and the superficial reflection of pre-existing rules and social conventions found in The End of the Road. The novel revolves around the experiences of the narrator, Jack Gladney, a university lecturer who teaches Hitler studies at Blacksmith College, and his wife Babette. The course which he teaches on Hitler is influenced by Hollywood myth, and the novel portrays a consumer-based society that has lost much of the firm moral basis which traditional religious concepts formerly supplied. The role of television, Hollywood, and the idea of simulation are all explored throughout the novel and are important forces in any examination of post-war American society. Finally, in Vineland (1990) the social upheavals which occurred during the late � 60 s and early � 70 s are explored {{from the perspective of the}} 1980 s. The novel refers to a vast array of images and icons from popular culture, and the brief youth rebellion, in the late � 60 s, which failed to inspire any final social revolution. The result of this failed social revolution is a landscape of popular culture in modern America, where Godzilla leaves footprints in Japan and popular mythology from television or pulp novels coincides with everyday life. There are references in typical Pynchonesque fashion to those who must necessarily be orchestrating these social and cultural alterations, but they, as specific individuals, remain anonymous or hidden from the scope of the author (although, as in White Noise, there are deliberate references to the CIA and other agencies or departments within the U. S. Federal Government). Vineland is important, therefore, both as an account of the social changes which occurred in America between the late � 60 s and � 80 s, and the increasing role of popular culture in America. These four novels form the basis of an exploration of the role of popular mythology and popular culture in post-war America. They form a clear progression, and allow a detailed analysis of the social and cultural changes which contemporary America has undergone since the end of World War II...|$|R
40|$|Epigenetic {{mechanisms}} {{may explain}} some of the missing heritability associated with CVD and how external factors such as diet, environment and lifestyle contribute to disease development and progression. This thesis aimed to investigate the role of epigenetics in atherosclerosis- from initiation to plaque development and its subsequent outcomes. Injury to the endothelium and subsequent inflammation represent a critical starting point for atherosclerosis. A primary objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the use of epigenetic targeting agents SFN and SAHA (Vorinostat) on the expression of CXCL 16, IL 8, IL 18 and miR 210 and miR 145, in TNF&# 945; stimulated endothelial (EA. hy 926) and macrophage (THP- 1) cell lines. The findings of this thesis suggest that the expression of CXCL 16, IL 8, IL 18 and the indicated miRNAs can be altered by histone deacetylase inhibitors SFN and SAHA. However, the amount of HDACi (SFN and SAHA) and duration of treatment may have disparate effects and depend on the pre-existing inflammatory background in this case cytokine levels. This could limit potential use in the clinic. As CXCL 16 plays a multifaceted role in all stages of atherosclerosis, genetic variation which influences gene expression is of particular interest. An AEI investigation of the CXCL 16 SNP rs 2277680 was undertaken to determine allelic expression imbalance in the presence and absence of epigenetic modifying agents. These experiments found that AEI can be induced following treatment with various ETAs, proposing an epigenetic mechanism for AEI. The question remains as to whether all cells produce mRNA from both alleles, albeit at different levels, or one allele is silenced completely (monoallelic expression) and the observations are the result of heterogeneous mixtures of cells with either one or the other allele silenced. However, monoallelic expression is unlikely as AEI can be observed following 6 h treatment, a time point which is too short to be attributed to cell turnover. This study also investigated the stability of AEI over multiple passages during cell culture. These results suggest that AEI is predominately stable, with considerable <b>noise,</b> over cell <b>culture</b> but becomes less predictable with increasing passage number. This study also raises the question as to the effectiveness and reproducibility of using cells which have been frozen in DMSO due to its potential for altering allelic expression imbalance. Finally, the expression of miRNAs 145 and 210 has previously been shown to be reduced in patients with plaques which are prone to rupture. However, an association in stroke recurrence prediction from an initial cardiac event has not been examined. 	This is the first study to demonstrate an inverse relationship between miR 145 and CD 68 macrophages in stroke recurrence in a clinical data set. This finding confirms the role of miR 145 in CVD, and as a biomarker of decreased stroke recurrence, a potential therapeutic target and predictive marker. Data generated in this study suggest that decreased miR 145 expression is associated with a greater risk of stroke recurrence. Levels of miR 145 were significantly increased in non-recurrent patients when compared against those who had stroke recurrence after initial stroke/TIA, but before carotid endarterectomy (P= 0. 0360). Furthermore, miR 145 expression was also shown to be significantly associated with histological features of plaque inflammation and instability, such as increased cap and plaque macrophage count, evidence of intraplaque haemorrhage, luminal thrombus with lipid nanocapsules and the degree of plaque stability (P= 0. 0207, 0. 0258, 0. 0447, respectively). The work detailed in this thesis describes different methodologies that can be used to help elucidate and alter the epigenetic mechanisms affecting gene expression in atherosclerosis. The results unequivocally show an influence of histone acetylation and RNA interference in the development and stability of atherosclerotic plaque...|$|R
