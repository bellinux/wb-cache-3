Using IIR linear phase filters one can obtain symmetry properties for the wavelet and scaling functions. In this paper we describe all possible IIR linear phase filters generating symmetric wavelets with any prescribed number of vanishing moments.

Explicit expressions for the coefficients of <b>numerator,</b> <b>denominator,</b> zeroes, and poles are presented. This new parameterization allows one to design linear phase quadrature mirror filters with many other properties of interest such as filters that have any preassigned set of zeroes in the stopband or that satisfy an almost interpolating property.

40|$|Background: In the {{previous}} studies, {{the rate of}} primary infertility was reported differently. It seems the main reasons {{are related to the}} different methods of data collection and information analysis. Therefore, introducing a precise method to determine the infertile couples and the population exposed to the risk of infertility is an important issue to study primary infertility. Methods: The proposed methodology for assessing primary infertility rate has been designed and applied by Avicenna Research Institute in a national survey. Sampling was conducted based on probability proportional to size cluster method. In this survey, after reviewing the former studies, the reproductive history was used as a basis for data collection. Every reproductive event was recorded with a code and a date in the questionnaire. To introduce a precise method, all possible events were considered thoroughly and for each situation, it was determined whether these cases should be considered in <b>numerator,</b> <b>denominator</b> or it should be eliminated from the study. Also in some situations where the correct diagnosis of infertility was not possible, a sensitivity analysis was recommended to see the variability of results under different scenarios. Conclusion: The proposed methodology can precisely define the infertile women and the population exposed to the risk of infertility. So, this method is more accurate than other available data collection strategies. To avoid bias and make a consistent methodology, using this method is recommended in future prevalence studies...|$|E

BackgroundThere are no published QIs to promote quality measurement and improvement for ACHD patients. MethodsWorking groups of ACHD experts reviewed published data and United States, Canadian, and European guidelines to identify candidate QIs. For each QI, we specified a <b>numerator,</b> <b>denominator,</b> period of assessment, and data source. We submitted the QIs to a 9 -member panel of international ACHD experts. The panel rated the QIs for validity and feasibility in 2 rounds {{on a scale of}} 1 to 9 using the RAND/University of California–Los Angeles modified-Delphi method, and final QI selection was on the basis of median scores. ResultsA total of 62 QIs were identified regarding appropriateness and timing of clinical management, testing, and test interpretation. Each QI was ascertainable from health records. After the first round of rating, 29 QIs were accepted, none were rejected, and 33 were equivocal; on the second round, 55 QIs were accepted. Final QIs included: 8 for atrial septal defects; 9 for aortic coarctation; 12 for Eisenmenger; 9 for Fontan; 9 for D-transposition of the great arteries; and 8 for tetralogy of Fallot. ConclusionsThis project resulted in development of the first set of QIs for ACHD care based on published data, guidelines, and a modified Delphi process. These QIs provide a quality of care assessment tool for 6 ACHD conditions. This rigorously designed set of QIs should facilitate measuring and improving the quality of care for this growing group of patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{concordance}} {{correlation coefficient}} (CCC) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) {{are used for}} interrater reliability studies. Although it seems that their definitons are equivalent, the estimates are different. Letting Yij be continuous data for subject i (i = 1, · · ·, n) assessed by randomly selected rater j (j = 1, · · ·,m), usual two-way ANOVA model is Yij = µ+ai+bj+eij, where ai ∼ N(0, σ 2 S), bj ∼ N(0, σ 2 R), and eij ∼ N(0, σ 2 e), respectively, and the ICC was defined by ρICC = σ 2 S/(σ 2 S+σ 2 R+σ 2 e) [1]. While, CCC considering fixed effect for raters is defined by ρCCC = 2 ΣjΣk>jσjk/{(m − 1) Σσ 2 j +mΣ(µj−µ) 2 }, where σ 2 j and σjk are variance and covariance of data from rater j and k (j ̸ = k), and µj and µ are the mean for rater j and overall mean. The equality ρICC = ρCCC was deduced using θ 2 R = 1 m− 1 Σ(µj − µ) 2 in place of σ 2 R in ρICC [2, 3]. Conversely, the equality also holds for randomly selected raters if we use (m − 1) σ 2 R = E{Σ(bj − b) 2 } in place of Σ(µj − µ) 2. The unbiased estimator for ρICC is rICC = (VS − Ve) /{VS + (m − 1) Ve + mn (VR − Ve) }, where VS, VR, and Ve are the mean squares for subject, rater, and error, respectively. While, same formula as ρCCC is usually used for the estimate rCCC by replacing σjk,σ 2 j, µj, and µ by sample statistics sjk, s 2 j, Ȳ. j, and Y ̄; applying Sjk = Σi(Yij − Ȳ. j) (Yik − Ȳ. k) and Sjj = Σi(Yij − Ȳ. j) 2, sjk = 1 nSjk and s 2 j = 1 nSjj are used. However, alternative devisor n − 1 may {{also be used for}} statistical inference and we write corresponding estimate as rCCC∗. Applying ΣSjj = (n − 1) {VS + (m − 1) Ve} and 2 ΣjΣk>jSjk = (n − 1) (m − 1) (VS − Ve), we have alternative expression for rCCC and rCCC ∗ which is very similar to rICC; using (VS − Ve) as common <b>numerator,</b> <b>denominator</b> is VS + (m − 1) Ve + mn− 1 VR for rCCC and VS + (m − 1) Ve + mn VR for rCCC∗, respectively.

40|$|Through the {{sequential}} {{analysis of a}} data set, comprising 86 OTUs of Raoulia subg. raoulia measured on 98 characters, different multivariate numerical manipulations are performed, compared and assessed. The creation of additional characters derived from sampled characters (ratios) is investigated. The univariate distributional properties of these derived characters, are seen to be mainly non-normal, although strategies for minimising {{this in terms of}} the choice of numerator and denominator are advocated. To include a ratio and its two constituent characters in a data set will invariably lead to the multiple inclusion of the same information beyond a level that might occur with normal inter-character correlations in a biological data set. Through the exploration of the multiple and bivariate correlation coefficients it is shown that simple calculations will reveal an optimum strategy in terms of removing one of the three characters. Using three shape ratios independently as examples and developing a discriminant function for the 13 a priori defined species in the data set, based on the three characters <b>numerator,</b> <b>denominator,</b> and the ratio, it is shown that the ratio per se has the superior correlation with the grouping variable in each instance. Using the multivariate moments of skewness and kurtosis, the multivariate normality of the taxon based on the 63 continuous characters was assessed. This normality of the taxon was seen to be dependent primarily on the character number and the status of the OTUs most distant from the centroid. The repercussions of the removal of the outlying OTUs and the status of these six outliers was further explored by cluster analysis. Using a reduced 39 -character data set the individual group normality of both portions of three successive dichotomies was assessed. It was seen from this that a reasonable range of Mahalanobis D 2 s about a centroid was essential for multivariate normality. It was further shown, via a pair-wise discriminant analysis on each of the three partitions, that OTUs disturbing the multivariate normality of a single group are not necessarily those that are misclassified within the prescribed groups. The inter-group associations revealed by the canonical variate plots and the jackknife iYlahalanobis D 2 s indicated the possibility of amalgamating a number of the species groups. The detection of outlying OTUs on the basis of large relative minimum jackknife Mahalanobis D 2 s was compared with the detection via the earlier single-group analyses this showed that even apparently extreme outliers were providing some not inconsiderable stability to their hypothesised groups, and that their removal could be an extreme course of action. In order to reassess the above changes using the entire data set and to reach a conclusive grouping strategy a new method was proposed as being appropriate to such circumstances. This method allows for the independent summation of the univariate X 2 and F ratios approximated by X 2 values, of each character based on a given groupiug strategy. These values were recomputed for an alternative strategy and the difference between the sums compared to the X 2 distribution, with the change in the degrees of freedom as the degrees of freedom. Given the 'final' groups dermed by the previous analysis, characters were extracted to form a diagnostic hierarchy of dichotomous subdivisions...|$|E
