5|$|The {{existence}} of a <b>neutral</b> <b>atmosphere</b> implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, {{the nature of the}} Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything. The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400–2,500cm−3. As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.|$|E
25|$|At mid-latitudes, the F2 layer daytime ion {{production}} {{is higher in}} the summer, as expected, since the Sun shines more directly on the Earth. However, there are seasonal changes in the molecular-to-atomic ratio of the <b>neutral</b> <b>atmosphere</b> that cause the summer ion loss rate to be even higher. The {{result is that the}} increase in the summertime loss overwhelms the increase in summertime production, and total F2 ionization is actually lower in the local summer months. This effect is known as the winter anomaly. The anomaly is always present in the northern hemisphere, but is usually absent in the southern hemisphere during periods of low solar activity.|$|E
500|$|Despite the Voyager data, {{evidence}} for a tenuous oxygen atmosphere (exosphere) on Ganymede, {{very similar to the}} one found on Europa, was found by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 1995. HST actually observed airglow of atomic oxygen in the far-ultraviolet at the wavelengths 130.4nm and 135.6nm. Such an airglow is excited when molecular oxygen is dissociated by electron impacts, which is evidence of a significant <b>neutral</b> <b>atmosphere</b> composed predominantly of O2 molecules. The surface number density probably lies in the [...] range, corresponding to the surface pressure of [...] These values are in agreement with the Voyagers upper limit set in 1981. The oxygen is not evidence of life; it is thought to be produced when water ice on Ganymede's surface is split into hydrogen and oxygen by radiation, with the hydrogen then being more rapidly lost due to its low atomic mass. The airglow observed over Ganymede is not spatially homogeneous like that over Europa. HST observed two bright spots located in the northern and southern hemispheres, near ± 50° latitude, which is exactly the boundary between the open and closed field lines of the Ganymedian magnetosphere (see below). The bright spots are probably polar auroras, caused by plasma precipitation along the open field lines.|$|E

2500|$|Models {{are usually}} {{expressed}} as computer programs. [...] The model may {{be based on}} basic physics of the interactions of the ions and electrons with the <b>neutral</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and sunlight, {{or it may be}} a statistical description based on a large number of observations or a combination of physics and observations. One of the most widely used models is the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), which is based on data and specifies the four parameters just mentioned. The IRI is an international project sponsored by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) and the International Union of Radio Science (URSI). The major data sources are the worldwide network of ionosondes, the powerful incoherent scatter radars (Jicamarca, Arecibo, Millstone Hill, Malvern, St Santin), the ISIS and Alouette topside sounders, and in situ instruments on several satellites and rockets. IRI is updated yearly. IRI is more accurate in describing the variation of the electron density from bottom of the ionosphere to the altitude of maximum density than in describing the total electron content (TEC).

40|$|A {{comparison}} of different model simulations of the ionosphere variability during the 2009 sudden stratosphere warming (SSW) is presented. The {{focus is on}} the equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere simulated by the Ground-to-topside model of the Atmosphere and Ionosphere for Aeronomy (GAIA), Whole Atmosphere Model plus Global Ionosphere Plasmasphere (WAM+GIP), and Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtended version plus Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (WACCMX+TIMEGCM). The simulations are compared with observations of the equatorial vertical plasma drift in the American and Indian longitude sectors, zonal mean F region peak density (NmF 2) from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) satellites, and ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) total electron content (TEC) at 75 °W. The model simulations all reproduce the observed morning enhancement and afternoon decrease in the vertical plasma drift, as well as the progression of the anomalies toward later local times {{over the course of several}} days. However, notable discrepancies among the simulations are seen in terms of the magnitude of the drift perturbations, and rate of the local time shift. Comparison of the electron densities further reveals that although many of the broad features of the ionosphere variability are captured by the simulations, there are significant differences among the different model simulations, as well as between the simulations and observations. Additional simulations are performed where the <b>neutral</b> <b>atmospheres</b> from four different whole atmosphere models (GAIA, HAMMONIA (Hamburg Model of the <b>Neutral</b> and Ionized <b>Atmosphere),</b> WAM, and WACCMX) provide the lower atmospheric forcing in the TIME-GCM.
