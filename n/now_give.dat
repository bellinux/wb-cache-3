25|$|We <b>now</b> <b>give</b> a brief {{indication}} of how irreducible root systems classify simple Lie algebras over , following the arguments in Humphreys. A preliminary result says that a semisimple Lie algebra is simple {{if and only if}} the associated root system is irreducible. We thus restrict attention to irreducible root systems and simple Lie algebras.|$|E

25|$|Buckbarrow {{is a small}} fell in the English Lake District {{overlooking}} {{the western end of}} Wastwater. It is featured in Alfred Wainwright’s Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells and is given a height of 1,410ft approximately; however, the Ordnance Survey and other guide books <b>now</b> <b>give</b> an altitude of 423m (1,388ft). The fell’s name means ‘The hill of the buck or goat’. It is derived either from the Old English word bucc meaning buck or the Old Norse word bokki meaning a male goat.|$|E
25|$|We can <b>now</b> <b>give</b> a {{complete}} description of w = z½. To do {{so we need}} two copies of the z-plane, each of them cut along the real axis. On one copy we define the square root of 1 to be e0 = 1, {{and on the other}} we define the square root of 1 to be e'iπ = 1. We call these two copies of the complete cut plane sheets. By making a continuity argument we see that the (now single-valued) function w = z½ maps the first sheet into the upper half of the w-plane, where 0 ≤ arg(w) < π, while mapping the second sheet into {{the lower half of the}} w-plane (where π ≤ arg(w) < 2π).|$|E
25|$|The royal {{bloodline}} that Tutankhamun's family shared {{ended with}} the death of the young pharaoh, and with that came a question of the legitimacy of the following rulers. His tomb was the only one discovered that was not very disturbed by grave robbers, which allowed Carter to uncover many artifacts and the untouched mummy. It gave amazing insight into the royal burials, mummification, and tombs of the New Kingdom's 18th Dynasty. Since its discovery and widespread popularity, it has led to DNA testing done on it and other mummies from the time period that <b>now</b> <b>give</b> a proven family tree for many of the royalty during the 18th Dynasty. Since his death was unexpected and either poorly recorded or simply the records were lost over the years, with the discovery of his mummy and advances in modern technology, there is now strong and supported evidence as to Tutankhamun's death, and with that one of Egypt's most popular mysteries appears to have been solved.|$|E

25|$|Start {{with one}} setting exactly {{opposite}} to the other. All the pairs of particles {{give the same}} outcome (each pair is either both spin up or both spin down). Now shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A {{small fraction of the}} pairs, say f, <b>now</b> <b>give</b> different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction f of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2f.|$|E
25|$|Wetzlar lies on {{the eastern}} edge of the Rhenish Massif. The {{substrate}} consists of geologically young sediments of the Lahn and much older Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of the two main geological units of the Massif, the Lahnmulde and the so-called Giessen nappe. The northwestern part of the urban area {{lies on the}} Lahntal silt, sand and gravel, which have only slightly hardened. They were deposited by the River Lahn, at a point where its valley (which is still up to one kilometre wide) to the west becomes increasingly narrow and deep. The main part of the city is built on in part intensively folded, faulted and slated layers of shales, sandstone, quartzite and limestone. They were deposited in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods in a sea characterised by island chains, volcanoes and atolls that were pushed together and covered by a layer of rock that had been transported from another location during the period of mountain building known as the Variscan orogeny. The marine sedimentary rocks which resulted from this tectonic action <b>now</b> <b>give</b> the town its character as they were often used for building material.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} it was also {{traditional}} for all judgments to be reserved. Although in a small number of cases this was useful, in the majority of cases it simply made coming to court more expensive and wasted time. As soon as Mansfield became Lord Chief Justice, he changed the rules so that, unless the court had doubts over the evidence presented to them, a judgment was to be made immediately. This had a far-reaching effect on the English courts. Judges from the Court of Appeal and High Court of Justice <b>now</b> <b>give</b> reserved judgments in only a minority of cases. His reforms led to the Court of King's Bench becoming one of the most active courts, {{at the expense of the}} Court of Common Pleas, which was described as the [...] "sleepy hollow".|$|E

The music of chorões also provided the initial inspiration for his Chôros, a series of compositions written between 1920 and 1929.
