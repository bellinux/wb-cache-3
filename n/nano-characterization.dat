The goal of this work was the improvement of analytical STEM-techniques and its application on <b>nano-characterization</b> of III-N-heterostructures. The optimization of electron energy-loss spectroscopy provides a measurement techniques which yields spatially resolved information about bandgap energy and dielectric function on a nanometer scale. A combination of STEM-techniques like EELS, convergent electron diffcration (CBED) and Z-contrast imaging was used to characterize and improve structural properties, interfaces and chemical composition of InGaN-layers.

However, despite the many advances in this field, its impact and penetration in our daily life has been hindered by a convoluted and iterative process, cycling through modeling, nanofabrication and <b>nano-characterization.</b> The fundamental reason is the fact that not only the prediction of the optical response is very time consuming and requires solving Maxwell's equations with dedicated numerical packages.

Specimens with different coating features were prepared systematically by using different coating parameters such as the top-coat spraying conditions and reheat-treatment conditions. Especially, the reheat-treatment was applied to the TBC specimen with different temperature either in air or in inert argon (Ar) gas atmosphere.

However, the current record conversion efficiency of polycrystalline kesterite devices is 12. 6 %—i. e., at least 2. 4 % short of the efficiency threshold needed to make this material competitive with chalcogenide-based thin film technologies. This shortage in conversion efficiency has been in part ascribed to the large extent of carrier recombination by defects at the grain boundaries and contact/absorber interfaces. In this work, methods nanoscale compositional and electrical characterization of grain boundaries and contact/absorber interfaces in kesterite solar cells have been developed, using a unique combination of advanced <b>nano-characterization</b> tools including Auger Nanoprobe Microscopy (NanoAuger), Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) and Cryogenic Focused Ion Beam (Cryo-FIB).

The composites were fabricated by combining hot extrusion and compression moulding. Physico-chemical characterization by TGA and DSC indicates that Mg anticipates the thermal degradation of the polymers but does not compromise their stability during processing. Especial emphasis is devoted {{to determine the effect}} of strain rate and Mg content on mechanical behavior, thus important information about the visco-elastic behavior and time-dependent response of the composites is obtained. Relevant for the intended application is that Mg addition increases the elastic modulus and hardness of the polymeric matrices and induces a higher resistance to flow. The elastic modulus obtained by DSI experiments shows good agreement with that obtained by uniaxial compression tests. The results indicate that DSI experiments are a reliable method to calculate the modulus of polymeric composites reinforced with micro-particles.

40|$|Phosphorous, {{being one}} of the {{fundamental}} building blocks of life, has been linked with the increase of cyanobacteria and algae growth. One of the main ways that phosphorous enters the marine ecosystem is through the form of runoff phosphates from fertilizers and industrial processes. In addition to disrupting the biology of ecosystems another drawback of excess of phosphates is the tendency for these chemical groups to form scale buildup on metal through the form of calcium phosphate. The goal of our project is to investigate a novel way of removing phosphate groups from wastewater {{with the use of the}} rare earth element cerium. Current methods that remove phosphates use iron and aluminum salts to react with the phosphate, creating crystalline complexes that can be filtered out as a precipitate. Our team hopes to evaluate a similar precipitation reaction with phosphate and cerium and evaluate the optimal parameter that promote the desired reaction. The main benefit of this reaction is that its crystals are exponentially smaller than the ones produced by the traditional phosphate removal processes (indicating that this novel method might be more efficient than the traditional methods). The main challenge of this project is to properly characterize the produced cerium phosphate crystals and design an industry-scale filtration process that would remove these crystals effectively. This analysis will be completed with the use of analytical chemistry techniques, <b>nano-characterization</b> equipment and process engineering design work. The filtration system design process will focus on optimizing produced crystalline complexes and then collecting and removing them effectively for large quantities of water.

40|$|Space {{vehicles}} {{residing in}} the low Earth orbit (LEO) are exposed to a harsh environment that rapidly degrades their materials. The LEO ranges from 200 - 700 km in altitude from the Earth’s surface, and the temperature varies between 200 and 400 K. The most hazardous species in LEO is atomic oxygen (AO) containing 5 eV kinetic energy d ue to the high velocity of the spacecrafts (8 km/s). The goal {{of this research is}} the elucidation of the fundamental mechanisms of semiconductor degradation and passivation in LEO conditions by comparing the structural differences in the oxide films created by exposure to AO and molecular oxygen (MO). Silicon is the base material for solar cells used in LEO whereas Ge and SiO x films are common coatings to protect polymer materials that are used as structural materials in spacecrafts.   Hyperthermal AO was created by the laser detonation of MO within a high vacuum (HV) chamber, that produces a high flux of AO. A variety of <b>nano-characterization</b> techniques, including high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were used to determine the microstructure and local chemistry of the oxide and the oxide/semiconductor interface. For Si, the amorphous silica formed by AO was nearly twice as thick, more ordered, and more homogeneous in composition, than the oxide formed by MO. The Si/SiO x interface formed by AO was atomically abrupt, with no suboxides detected near the interface or throughout the oxide. The oxide scale formed by MO on Si(100) consisted of transitional oxidation states. The oxide film formed on Ge(100) due to exposure to 5 eV AO, is 2 - 3 times thicker and similarly to the Si/SiO x interfaces, the Ge/GeO x interface was found to be atomically abrupt.   The oxidation kinetics of Si and Ge were monitored in situ using a research quartz crystal microbalance (RQCM) that was incorporated into the AO source. The oxidation kinetics in hyperthermal AO did not follow the standard linear to parabolic Deal-Grove kinetics.

40|$|On February 15, 2008 the National Academy of Engineering {{unveiled}} their fourteen grand {{challenges of}} engineering for the 21 st century. At {{the top of}} the list and voted by the public as the most important challenge was the thrust to make solar energy economical. My research has been dedicated to solving this millennial challenge by developing routes to high-efficiency, solution-processed photovoltaics (PV) for low-cost and low-energy manufacturing. ^ My research has primarily advanced two methods for solution processed PV. In one method, semiconducting nanocrystals are synthesized and then suspended in an appropriate solvent to form an ink. The ink is then applied to a substrate by a variety of high-throughput methods such as spray coating or doctor blading and then annealed to form a polycrystalline absorber layer for solar energy. I have applied this method with great success to Cu 2 ZnSnS 4, a promising earth-abundant, non-toxic semiconductor. A challenge with this material is its propensity to form binary and ternary undesired phases. Using advanced <b>nano-characterization</b> techniques, my colleagues and I have been able to determine the spatially resolved composition of these nanoparticles and have found them to be highly non-uniform. In addition, I developed synthesis techniques aimed at controlling the nucleation and growth of this material to improve nanocrystal compositional homogeneity. Though particles produced in this work still exhibit some non-uniformities, they are greatly improved. When combined with optimized fabrication techniques, I have been able to advance the efficiency of nanocrystal ink based solar cells of CZTS from 7. 2 to 9. 0 percent in our lab. ^ Another promising route to solution-processed PV is by directly coating molecular precursor solutions (rather than first forming nanocrystals) and annealing the coating to form the polycrystalline solar absorber layer. Unfortunately, a major challenge is that many metals, metal salts, and chalcogens that would be useful precursors to such films have poor solubility in organic solvents compatible with roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques. Interestingly, we have found that mixtures of commonly available thiols and amines are able to dissolve at room temperature and pressure a host of metals and salts that are otherwise insoluble in either solvent by itself. In this work, I have primarily focused on CdTe—which has been by far the most successful technology in terms of production cost ($/peak watt) and energy payback time for thin-film solar cells. In this research thrust I demonstrate for the first time the fabrication of CdTe thin-films via a solution-processed molecular precursor approach by dissolving CdCl 2 and Te in ethylenediamine and 1 -propanethiol. The films are formed by spin-coating thin layers of the solution and then annealing each layer until a ~ 1. 5 μm thick film is achieved. I have achieved 0. 5 % efficient devices by this method. As thiol-amine mixtures have the potential to leave residual sulfur in these films, other novel solvent systems are presented as future work. ^ While amine-thiol mixtures are excellent solvents for many materials, they do not dissolve lead chalcogenides with ease. I leverage this to develop room-temperature synthesis routes to PbS, PbSe, PbTe, and PbSxSe 1 -x nanoparticles. This is achieved by mixing a lead salt dissolved in thiol-amine with a chalcogen dissolved in thiol-amine at room temperature. We find that when particles produced in this manner are pressed into pellets, they show comparable thermoelectric performance to more complicated and energy intensive synthesis techniques. Ultimately, we wish to enable the use of these particles in room-temperature fabricated quantum dot solar cells. This requires the synthesis of highly monodisperse, stable colloids and is the subject of future work using thiol-amine mixtures and related aqueous analogues. ...|$|E
40|$|Zn-bearing clay {{minerals}} occur worldwide in several supergene nonsulfide ores, {{where they may}} represent an important metal source [2, 3, 4]. In the present work a crystal chemical investigation, by means of XRPD, WDS, ICP-MS/OES and FTIR, has been undertaken on two trioctahedral Zn-smectites, belonging to the supergene nonsulfides of the Skorpion (Namibia) and Yanque (Peru) deposits. The Skorpion mineralization is the largest supergene nonsulfide zinc deposit in the world. It is hosted in Neoproterozoic rocks {{that are part of}} a volcano-sedimentary sequence within the Gariep Belt {{in the southern part of}} the country. In this deposit sauconite predominates over the other Zn-oxidized minerals, mainly represented by smithsonite, hemimorphite and Zn-bearing phosphates [5, 6]. The Yanque prospect is a (Zn) -Pb nonsulfide concentration located 20 km north of Santo Tomás village in Peru [7]. The deposit consists of several sub-horizontal stratabound bodies that extend in depth to more than 100 m. Yanque is hosted by a sedimentary breccia with lateral facies variations, which stratigraphically comprehends parts of the Mara and Ferrobamba Formations [8]. Sauconite is the most abundant economic Zn mineral in the Yanque deposit. The first studies on the composition and thermal properties of sauconite from different localities were provided by [9, 10]). Recently, mineralogical studies on this Zn-clay were carried out by various authors, i. e. [3, 11 - 13], but structural data on sauconite are scarce. The XRDP pattern of the Skorpion sample exhibits broad diffraction maxima indicative of the lack of perfect long-range order due to stacking faults and/or fine grained crystallite dimension. The (001) basal reflection is positioned at about 14. 72 Å, whereas the diagnostic peak d 060 is at 1. 533 Å. For the Yanque sample XRPD data indicate the presence of minor amount of quartz, illite, kaolinite, chlorite, K-feldspar and goethite. Both sauconites show variable contents of Al and Zn, as well as Fe and Mg. The IR spectra show a distinctive band at about 3644 cm- 1, assigned to the Zn(OH) 3 stretching vibrations.

40|$|Zn-clay {{minerals}} are worldwide {{associated with}} a variety of base metal ores, as the supergene nonsulfide supergene deposits [1]. In these occurrences, sauconite (the Zn-bearing triocthaedral smectite) occurs either the prevailing economic minerals or minor components of the weathering-derived mineral assemblage. The best example of supergene nonsulfide zinc deposit – where sauconite predominates over the other Zn-oxidized minerals - is the world-class Skorpion mineralization (Namibia). Skorpion ore is hosted in Neoproterozoic rocks and sauconite predominates over the other Zn-oxidized minerals [2]. Among other worldwide occurrences, the Yanque (Zn) -Pb nonsulfide supergene deposit is also sauconite-dominated [3]. This study deals with a detailed characterization of sauconite from Skorpion and Yanque by means of combined XRPD, WDS, FTIR and TEM-HRTEM, aimed to determine composition, structural features and micro- and nano-textures of the Zn-clays occurring in the two deposits. Taking into account that the mineralogical data on sauconite are few [i. e. 4, 5], this information allow to better identify their properties, to constrain the genesis of the ore deposits, as well as to plan a correct metallurgical processing. Chemical data on the studied sauconite samples indicate that octahedral sites are occupied by Zn cations with minor contents of Al, as well as Fe and Mg, while the interlayer contains predominally Ca 2 + cations. The IR spectra show a distinctive band at about 3644 cm- 1, assigned to the Zn(OH) 3 stretching vibrations. For the Skorpion sample it has been possible to separate a small fraction of pure smectite, whereas the Yanque sample contains small amounts of quartz, illite, kaolinite, chlorite, K-feldspar and goethite. The XRDP pattern of the Skorpion sample shows the (001) basal reflection at about 14. 72 Å, characteristic of di-hydrated Ca 2 + rich-smectite, and the diagnostic peak d 060 at 1. 533 Å, indicative of the trioctahedral nature of this smectite. The pattern exhibits broad and asymmetric diffraction maxima that are typical effects of disorder, stacking faults and/or fine grained crystallite dimension. To overcome these issues a suite of crystallographic programs are employed for a thorough microstructural characterization of these mineral phases. The TEM-HRTEM study shows that the microtextures of the Zn-clays observed at size below 10 μm are of two types, i. e. compact clay packages and porous clay aggregates. The first type is represented by straight and almost isoriented packets, as an epitaxial growth onto mica crystals or rarely as void fillings. The packets can locally pass to slightly curved fibres coexisting with the straight packets. The second type consists of very fine-grained packets, with sizes lower than the compact clay packages types, ca. < 400 nm. Electron diffraction patterns show that sauconite has a turbostratic arrangement. As reported in literature, it is tricky to obtain lattice-fringe images of very hydrated clays, as sauconite, due to the structural damage caused by the electron beam and the vacuum of the TEM environment and/or electron irradiation, which cause dehydratation and collapse of smectite. For the investigated samples, the measured smectite spacing is from 10 Å, {{in the case of a}} complete collapse, to ≈ 14 Å in case of an incomplete collapse (for example d 001 of 13 Å in the Skorpion sauconite). TEM-AEM study demonstrated that the Skorpion sauconites are mainly Ca-rich varieties, in comparison to the Peruvian samples, which contains also significant quantity of K. In Skorpion, the dioctahedral smectite (beidellite) is very subordinate respect to its Zn-triocthaedral counterpart, and finely intergrown with sauconite (as in Peru samples, where beidellite is clearly more abundant). The occurrence of Zn-beidellite and other phyllosilicates (chlorite, baileychlore, etc.) at the micro- and nanoscale in the studied samples confirms the complex mineralogical nature of the Zn-nonsulfide smectite-rich (micro) systems, with remarkable implications for mineralogical evaluation and processing.

These make them ideal for biomedical applications such as magnetic labeling, hyperthermia cancer treatment, targeted drug delivery, and contrast enhancement agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In drug delivery applications, MNPs can be determined with high accuracy [1]. It would {{be of interest to}} localize and characterize MNPs at the nanoscale for biological applications. However, very limited studies exist on detecting and characterizing the magnetic signals of nanoparticles in biological science. Many methods in surface structure analysis are used as <b>nano-characterization</b> techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field electron microscopy (FEM), field ion microscope (FIM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA) and electron probe. These techniques detect the surface or interface to show the physical and chemical properties at the nanoscale. But any kind of these techniques has the limitations of one kind or another. For example, LEED and X-ray diffraction method require that the sample has a periodic structure; the resolution of optical microscopy and SEM are insufficient to distinguish surface atoms; high-resolution TEM is mainly used for thin bulk samples and interfacial studies to detect the magnetic properties, but the sample preparation process to get cell sections for TEM analysis is time consuming, and {{only a small part of}} cell section can be analyzed; FEM and FIM can only detect the tip radius of less than 100 nm of the atomic structure in two-dimensional geometry. Most commonly, studies which analyze the magnetic nature of MNPs use a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). But due to low sensitivity and ultimately poor accuracy neither is an appropriate technique to measure the magnetic moment of individual MNPs, whatever in air or in liquid environment. Proper characterization and monitoring the properties of MNPs system are important for their potential applications. Currently, one of the most common methods for intracellular imaging of magnetic nanoparticles is fluorescence microscopy [2]. A disadvantage of this technique is that nanoparticles must first be labeled with fluorescent probes in order to be visualized. Due to the inherent limitations, the resolution of optical instruments is restricted by the wavelength of the light [3]. In 2010, Sun et al. conjugated fluorescent probes to the surface of magnetic nanoparticles to map cellular uptake pathways [4]. Relative to fluorescence microscopy, two-photon microscopy (TPM) offers improved resolution to study cellular interactions with magnetic nanoparticles, requiring the particles to be labeled with a two-photon fluorescent dye [5]. However it has been known that the imaging depth in TPM cannot be increased indefinitely, meanwhile optimization of the two-photon excitation efficiency is limited by the degree of damage the specimen can tolerate [6]. Due to the relatively poor resolution and reliability of these techniques, scanning probe microscopes (SPM) emerged out. SPM is a generation of scanning tunneling microscope based on a variety of new probe microscopes, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), lateral force microscopy (LFM) and electrostatic force microscope (EFM). Among these techniques magnetic force microscope (MFM), a label-free in vitro detection method for magnetic materials, has the capability to detect nanoscale magnetic domains and simultaneously obtain atomic force microscopy topography images. Due to its ability to localize, characterize and distinguish magnetic materials from other materials at the nanoscale, as well as the advantage of three-dimensional information, MFM offers the great potential for the in vivo research. The scope for MFM lies in detecting the presence of magnetic nanomaterials and spatially localizing magnetic domains. It is likely that magnetic nanomaterials (occur in clusters or aggregates) are embedded in a biological matrix to different depth, and surrounded by bio-molecules. The development and application of MFM for detecting MNPs hold great promise in biology. Spatially localizing magnetic plaques, at nanometer resolution in ambient atmospheric environment, will provide a better understanding of the deposition mechanism of magnetic material derivatives in the biological tissues. The background on magnetic materials and nanoparticles is presented in chapter 1 and AFM/MFM experimental apparatus and technique is illustrated in chapter 2. In the last three chapters of the thesis the results of three different typologies of experiments are reported. The studies I have conducted are developed in the framework of the research activities of the laboratory of Scanning Probe Microscopy of EMiNaLab (coordinator prof. Marco Rossi), at the Department of Basic and Applied Sciences for Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome. In particular, in Chapter 3, we investigate bacterial biofilms at the first time, which are colonies of microbes embedded in a self-produced exopolysaccharides extracellular matrix presenting a major concern in health care. We will demonstrate an approach based on magnetic force microscopy to perform accurate measurement of the thickness of soft thin films - although it may easily extended even to stiff films - deposited on periodically patterned magnetic substrates. By detecting the biofilm thickness MFM will provide a novel method to study the thin film. In the second part of the thesis, MFM is applied to visualize and quantitatively measure magnetically labeled vesicular system. Vesicles containing magnetic nanoparticles as magnetic target carrier can be used for a wide range of biological application. The encapsulation of drugs in vesicles can minimize drug degradation and inactivation by increasing drug bioavailability and targeting to the pathological area. Many different non-contact techniques have been proposed. Nevertheless, MFM has never been used to study vesicular systems embedding MNPs, either qualitatively or quantitatively. MFM will be illustrated to evaluate the amount of MNPs incorporated in single vesicle, together with discussion on its merits and possible sources of uncertainty. In the last part of the thesis, we developed the capability of AFM/MFM to detect magnetically labeled materials of biological interest, which are magnetoferritin, APTES functionalized Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles and cells labeled Fe@Au nanoparticle. AFM/MFM will allow us to detect magnetic nanoparticles within submembranes and without severe deformation of samples. In our study, We expect to demonstrate the potential of MFM for the study of magnetic properties of different nano-biosystems, illustrating our approaches which aim at deducing quantitative information from MFM characterizations. Such a research is useful for future applications of MFM, indicating the potential to image magnetic nanoparticles unlabelled and unmodified in living cellular systems. The overall target of the thesis is to develop and standardize reliable innovative protocols, using scanning probe microscopy-based techniques that could be implemented in rapid and early theranostic methods.
