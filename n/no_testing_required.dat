40|$|Abstract—Although the {{quadrature}} mixing radio front-end {{offers an}} attractive way to perform frequency translation, its image rejection capability is severely affected by gain and phase imbalances (I/Q imbalances) between its two analog signal paths. Digital signal processing techniques {{have been widely}} proposed to compensate for these mixer imperfections. Of these techniques, the class of blind compensation techniques seems very attractive since <b>no</b> <b>test</b> signals are <b>required.</b> This correspondence presents a novel I/Q imbalance extraction technique which uses a Cholesky decomposition of the received signal’s covariance matrix to extract the exact imbalances of the front-end. Analysis is also presented on extracting and separating the imbalances of a cascaded imbalanced modulator and demodulator. Both a block-based and an adaptive variant of the technique are proposed, and a performance evaluation over multipath channels is presented.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a test method for analog and mixed signal device {{at very low}} cost and it‟s based on OBIST (oscillation test) method. This method is built-in self test method appropriate for {{functional and structural testing}} of analog and mixed signal circuit. In test mode, the test circuit is converted into an oscillator. Then faults inside the test circuit that cause an affordable deviation of the oscillation frequency from its value are detected. Through this <b>test</b> method, <b>no</b> <b>test</b> vector is <b>required</b> to apply. Therefore in this test technique, the test vector generation drawbacks are eliminated and also the test time is reduced because limited number of oscillation frequencies is evaluated for each test circuit. This characteristic implies that Oscillation-test methodology is very attractive for further wafer-probe testing as final production testing. During this paper, the simulation results of this test method has been provided and verified throughout some examples like CMOS inverter and FET (field effect transistor) ...|$|R

40|$|Federal Aviation Administration will {{certainly}} require the Heavy Lift Rotorcraft {{to be operated}} under Category A performance and operations requirements. Because of the weight, no operation will be allowed except Category A according to FAA Part 29. 1 (c). This means that any where along the flight path, the aircraft {{must be able to}} land safely following an engine failure or continue flight. A repeatable flight profile must be developed and executed to ensure that the aircraft can be safely landed or flown away depending on its location on the flight profile. This means that there will be <b>no</b> Height-Velocity <b>testing</b> <b>required</b> as is currently required for Part 29 Category B. Since all the configurations shown to date are different than existing rotorcraft, each type would have to develop their individual requirements under existing special conditions FAA Part 21. 17 (b). This means the FAA will take the opportunity to negotiate additional requirements or change requirements to ensure safety. For example, since the tiltrotor did not fit normal rotorcraft category, new rules were negotiated between the applicant and the FAA. As a result of this negotiation, performance requirements for Category A were increased. The rules were written in terms of guaranteed performance instead of Category A requirements. Detailed discussion will follow later. The proposed tiltrotor would likely follow along with the current tiltrotor rules with the possibility of increase Category A performance requirements.
