40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Section 127 a, title 10 of the United States Code provides the Department of Defense (DOD) with two options for funding nontraining deployments and operations when Congress has not provided funds in advance. These options involve waiving reimbursements for support services and transferring amounts from other DOD accounts. Section 127 a prescribes specific procedures {{to be followed by}} DOD when these funding options are used; requires DOD to notify Congress of and report on certain new contingency operations; and states that the Comptroller General of the United States shall from time to time, and when requested by a Committee of Congress, conduct a review to determine whether DOD is complying with the statutory requirements and limitations. GAO found that DOD has complied with the requirements contained in section 127 a. Since the current <b>notification</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> of section 127 a were enacted in 1996, DOD has provided congressional notification for four operations, involving Bosnia, Kosovo, hurricane relief in Central America, and East Timor. DOD has rarely used the funding options provided in section 127 a. It used the section 127 a funding option allowing waiver of reimbursement for units providing support once, for Bosnia operations in fiscal year 1996, and has never used the option allowing transfer of funds. However, DOD has used other options to fund contingency operations, such as using funds that were planned to be spent later in a fiscal year and seeking supplemental appropriations. ...|$|E
40|$|Agency (EPA) {{is proposing}} a {{drinking}} water regulation for arsenic, {{as required by}} the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The proposed health-based, non-enforceable goal, or Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG), for arsenic is zero, and the proposed enforceable standard, or maximum contaminant level (MCL), for arsenic is 0. 005 mg/L. EPA is also requesting comment on 0. 003 mg/L, 0. 010 mg/L and 0. 020 mg/L for the MCL. EPA is listing technologies that will meet the MCL, including affordable compliance technologies for three categories of small systems serving less than 10, 000 people. This proposal also includes monitoring, <b>reporting,</b> public <b>notification,</b> <b>and</b> consumer confidence <b>report</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> State primacy revisions for public drinking water programs affected by the arsenic regulation. In addition, in this proposal the Agency is clarifying compliance for State-determined monitoring after exceedances for inorganic, volatile organic, and synthetic organic contaminants. Finally, EPA is proposing that States will specify the time period and sampling frequency for new public water systems and systems using a new source of water to demonstrate compliance with the MCLs. The requirement for new systems and new source monitoring will be effective for inorganic, volatile organic, and synthetic organic contaminants.

C of the license. Additionally, License Conditions 2. C. (4), 2. C. (6), 2. C. (7), 2. C. (8), 2. C. (9), 2. C. (10), 2. C. (11), 2. C. (12), 2. C. (13), and 2. C. (14) are being deleted as these conditions are obsolete or adequately described elsewhere. The proposed change to delete Section 2. F is administrative in nature and will eliminate <b>notification</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> from the Facility Operating License which is adequately governed by the reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50. 72 and 10 CFR 50. 73. Furthermore, the change will reduce unnecessary regulatory burden and allow WCNOC {{to take advantage of}} the revision to 10 CFR 50. 73 that allows for Licensee Event Reports to be submitted within 60 days instead of 30 days as required by the current Section 2. F. Additionally, this application proposes to revise Technical Specification Table 5. 5. 9 - 2, "Steam Generator Tube Inspection, " to delete the requirement to notify the NRC pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 72 (b) (2) if the steam generator tube inspection results in a C- 3 classification.
