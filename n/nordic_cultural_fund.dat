50|$|This {{move towards}} the EEC led to {{desire for a}} formal Nordic treaty; the Helsinki Treaty {{outlined}} {{the workings of the}} Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a <b>Nordic</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Fund</b> and Nordic House in Reykjavík. Danish Prime Minister Hilmar Baunsgaard proposed full economic cooperation ("Nordek") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway). Nordek was then abandoned.|$|E
50|$|The mutual {{intelligibility}} between the Continental Scandinavian languages is asymmetrical. Various {{studies have shown}} Norwegian speakers {{to be the best}} in Scandinavia at understanding other languages within the language group. According to a study undertaken during 2002-2005 and funded by the <b>Nordic</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Fund,</b> Swedish speakers in Stockholm and Danish speakers in Copenhagen have the greatest difficulty in understanding other Nordic languages. The study, which focused mainly on native speakers under the age of 25, showed that the lowest ability to comprehend another language is demonstrated by youth in Stockholm in regard to Danish, producing the lowest ability score in the survey. The greatest variation in results between participants within the same country was also demonstrated by the Swedish speakers in the study. Participants from Malmö, located in the southernmost Swedish province of Scania (Skåne), demonstrated a better understanding of Danish than Swedish speakers to the north.|$|E

40|$|The Nordic Council of Ministers is {{a central}} {{platform}} for cultural co-operation in the Nordic countries. The activities of the Council of Ministers {{in the field of}} culture interact with other areas of formal and informal Nordic co-operation, both in and outside the Nordic region. In a global context, the Nordic region will continue to lead the way as a creative and open region in terms of art and culture. <b>Nordic</b> <b>cultural</b> co-operation will manage the historical, cultural and linguistic heritage and ensure continuity, but will also encourage new cultural expressions and impulses. Changes in circumstances relating to cultural life and art, demography and technology call for flexibility and renewal. It is important that cultural policy is developed and implemented on the basis of relevant and current facts, research and knowledge. Fundamental to <b>Nordic</b> <b>cultural</b> co-operation is the principle of Nordic added value, i. e. that the collaboration involves areas where the Nordic countries have common interests and face common challenges. Exchange of experiences, skills, and formation of networks will enable efficiency and development. The cultural co-operation will promote sustainable development. This involves joint efforts to stimulate inclusive, accessible and gender-equal culture and art that challenges norms and values, and that gives people a greater sense of purpose and belonging. Broad cultural co-operation will develop a sense of community and understanding between everyone living in the Nordic region, and will enhance cohesion. The Nordic Model and Nordic art and culture are in great demand internationally. The <b>Nordic</b> <b>cultural</b> co-operation will communicate values such as democracy, freedom of expression and the importance of civil society in both international and regional contexts...|$|R

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the political instrumentalization of culture. Specifically, it studies {{how this is}} done through cultural policy within Western democracies. The analysis takes, as an example, official <b>Nordic</b> <b>cultural</b> cooperation in the post-war period. During this time, <b>cultural</b> exchange among <b>Nordic</b> countries {{became the subject of}} political attention establishing itself as part of the Nordic inter-governmental cooperation framework. This work focuses on three key moments in the history of official <b>Nordic</b> <b>cultural</b> cooperation: (i) the failure of the NORDEK plan (a plan which envisaged extensive economic cooperation between the Nordic countries) and the establishment of the Nordic Council of Ministers in 1971; (ii) the collapse of the Soviet system {{at the end of the}} 1980 s - beginning of the 1990 s; and (iii) the movement towards promoting the Nordic region on the global market in the first decade of the 2000 s. The analysis traces the lack of convergence between the official arm’s length principle in cultural policy and how cultural cooperation actually worked. The results of the research both demonstrate the various ways culture was instrumentalized and also prove that the politically defined concept of culture can receive different interpretations in the official discourse depending on current political goals...|$|R
