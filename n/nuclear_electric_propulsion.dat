50|$|Enceladus {{is a small}} icy moon, {{seemingly}} {{similar in}} chemical makeup to comets, with jets or geysers of water erupting from its surface that might be connected to active hydrothermal vents at its subsurface water ocean floor, where the moon's ocean meets the underlying rock, a prime habitat for life. The geysers could provide easy access for sampling the moon's subsurface ocean, {{and if there is}} microbial life in it, ice particles from the sea could contain the evidence astrobiologists need to identify them. Water from the ocean is assumed to upwell through cracks in the ice and then eject into outer space through the plumes. This water would remain liquid up to shallow depths in the order of even of tens of meters.The EnEx mission consists of a lander carrying the IceMole, and an orbiter with the main function to act as a communications relay between the lander and Earth. After launch, the lander and orbiter would perform the interplanetary transfer to Saturn together, using the on-board <b>nuclear</b> <b>electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> (NEP) to power electric ion thrusters. The lander would land at a safe distance away from an active vapor plume. The IceMole would then be deployed to melt its way through, while navigating autonomously around hazards, and towards a target subglacial aquiferous fracture at a depth of about 200 m for an in situ examination for the presence of microorganisms before potential biosignatures and biomolecules are degraded by exposure to outer space. The IceMole has a high energy demand that would be met by a cable run from the lander's small nuclear reactor providing 5 kW of electrical power.|$|E

An important element of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> spacecraft is the power conversion system, which converts the reactor heat to electrical power for use by the ion propulsion system and other spacecraft loads. The electrical integration of the power converter and ion thruster represents a key technical challenge in making <b>nuclear</b> <b>electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> technology possible. This technical hurdle was addressed extensively on December 1, 2003, when a closed- Brayton-cycle power-conversion unit was tested with a gridded ion thruster at the NASA Glenn Research Center.

40|$|Thermionic energy {{conversion}} (TEC) potentialities for <b>nuclear</b> <b>electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> (NEP) are examined. Considering current designs, their limitations, and risks raises critical {{questions about the}} use of TEC for NEP. Apparently a reactor cooled by hotter-than- 1675 K heat pipes has good potentialities.

Among the variables investigated were electrical and thermal losses in electrodes, leads and heat chokes. Those elements which minimized the electrical losses tended to increase thermal losses and system weight. Overall mechanical design and relative positioning of components also had impacts on converter efficiency and the power subsystem weight. Numerical calculations were made using the computer heat transfer code SINDA coupled with electrical loss parameters. The results of the computations are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Current {{analysis}} of advanced unmanned planetary missions in the 1980 's and beyond indicate {{the need for}} propulsion systems with performance capabilities beyond those of current and near state-of-art. One propulsion system concept being considered to fill this need is <b>nuclear</b> <b>electric</b> low thrust <b>propulsion</b> (NEP). Two different NEP system power levels are considered for performance analysis: 100 kw and 250 kw. The 100 kw NEP system uses a Centaur(D- 1 T) chemical stage for injection to an interplanetary transfer and the 250 kw system uses a spiral escape maneuver. Performance comparison is in general {{made on the basis}} of net payload at the target as a function of flight time.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{initially}} {{concerned with the}} minimum-time, exoatmospheric flight of a rocket with constant thrust acceleration magnitude, as {{in the cases of}} <b>nuclear</b> and solar <b>electric</b> <b>propulsion.</b> Gravitational acceleration is assumed to be a constant scalar multiple of the radius vector, plus a correction term which is a given function of time. The solution to the state equations is obtained in terms of elliptic integrals. A method is presented for the solution of the two-point boundary-condition problem associated with orbital transfer. At most, the latter method requires iteration upon final time, angle of injection, and two other parameters which are bounded. An example problem is provided which involves a rocket with very low thrust and a spiraling trajectory of many revolutions, but an altitude change of only several hundred miles above the earth. Finally, the original elliptic integral solution is extended to a larger class of low and intermediate thrust problems with constant thrust magnitude, mass decreasing with time, and an inverse square gravitational force...|$|R
