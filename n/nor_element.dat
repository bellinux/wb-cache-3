40|$|As part of {{the fifth}} and final year in civil {{engineering}} at University of Agder, this master’s thesis has been composed. This report was written during the spring semester of 2017. The purpose of this thesis was to dimension a slim balcony in UHPFRC. <b>Nor</b> <b>Element</b> {{wanted to be able}} to produce slim balconies in their own production facilities. <b>Nor</b> <b>Element</b> is currently producing balconies, but these have thicker cross sections. This master’s thesis involves a literature study and a dimension process. In the literature study the relevant guidelines and Eurocodes are presented. The study contains relevant formulas and recommendations needed to dimension a balcony in UHPFRC. Since there is no Norwegian Standard for how to design with UHPFRC, the French standard NF P 18 - 710 are considered. For this master’s thesis, the following problem statement was created: «Dimensioning of balcony in UHPFRC. » A more detailed research question was also constructed: “How slim cross-section would be possible to achieve while designing a balcony in UHPFRC?” In addition to the research question, a supplementary question was added: “Why should UHPFRC be used instead of normal concrete?” Calculations were made according to the French standard for UHPFRC, and a regulation from AFGC in France. The results from the calculations showed that a cross-section of 100 mm would be possible to achieve. Considering only the geometry, a cross-section of 96 mm would be possible to achieve. Calculations for this cross-section would have to be checked. That it is possible to achieve a cross-section of 100 mm using UHPFRC, is an acceptable motive to use UHPFRC instead of traditional concrete...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{were taken}} of the {{roughness}} characteristics of ice accreted on NACA 0012 airfoils in the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel (IRT). Tests were conducted with size scaled, using models with chords of 26. 7, 53. 3, and 80. 0 cm, and with liquid-water content scaled, both according to previously-tested scaling methods. The width of the smooth zone which forms {{on either side of}} the leading edge of the airfoil and the diameter of the roughness elements are presented in non-dimensional form as functions of the accumulation parameter. The smooth-zone width was found to decrease with increasing accumulation parameter. The roughness-element diameter increased with accumulation parameter until a plateau was reached. This maximum diameter was about 0. 06 times twice the model leading-edge radius. Neither smooth-zone width <b>nor</b> <b>element</b> diameter were affected by a change in freezing fraction from 0. 2 to 0. 4. Both roughness characteristics appeared to scale with model size and with liquid-water content...|$|E
40|$|The {{explosion}} mechanism behind Type Ia supernovae is {{a matter}} of continuing debate. The diverse attempts to identify or at least constrain the physical processes involved in the explosion have been only partially successful so far. In this paper we propose to use the thermal X-ray emission from young supernova remnants (SNRs) originating in Type Ia events to extract relevant information concerning the explosions themselves. We have produced a grid of thermonuclear supernova models representative of the paradigms currently under debate: pure deflagrations, delayed detonations, pulsating delayed detonations, and sub-Chandrasekhar explosions, using their density and chemical composition profiles to simulate the interaction with the surrounding ambient medium and the ensuing plasma heating, nonequilibrium ionization and thermal X-ray emission of the ejecta. Key observational parameters such as electron temperatures, emission measures, and ionization timescales are presented and discussed. We find that not only is it possible to identify the explosion mechanism from the spectra of young Type Ia SNRs, it is in fact necessary to take the detailed ejecta structure into account if such spectra are to be modeled in a self-consistent way. Neither element line flux ratios <b>nor</b> <b>element</b> emission measures are good estimates of the true ratios of ejected masses, with differences of as much as 2 or 3 orders of magnitude for a given model. Comparison with observations of the Tycho SNR suggests a delayed detonation as the most probable explosion mechanism. Line strengths, line ratios, and the centroid of the Fe Kα line are reasonably well reproduced by a model of this kind. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
