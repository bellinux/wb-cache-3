5000|$|In the mid-1990s, {{a series}} of men's {{magazines}} were established such as Maxim, FHM, and Stuff. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's Slitz re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men {{in their late teens}} and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men. The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling. With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as Katie Price, became household names. By 2004, Page 3 regulars earned anywhere from £30,000 to 40,000, where the average salary of a <b>non-Page</b> 3 model, as of 2011, was between £10,000 and 20,000. In the early 2000s, glamour models, and aspiring glamour models, appeared on reality television shows such as Big Brother to gain fame. Several Big Brother alumni parlayed their fifteen minutes of fame into successful glamour modelling careers. However, the glamour market became saturated by the mid-2000s, and numerous men's magazines including Arena, Stuff and FHM in the United States went under. During this time, there was a growing trend of glamour models, including Kellie Acreman and Lauren Pope, becoming DJs to supplement their income. In a 2012 interview, Keeley Hazell said that going topless is not the best way to achieve success and that [...] "she was lucky to be in that 1% of people that get that, and become really successful." ...|$|E

5000|$|Memory managementThe {{deterministic}} memory pool {{allocated for}} RTX {{is taken from}} the system <b>non-paged</b> pool memory. For example, under Windows 7, the amount of <b>non-paged</b> pool is: for 32-bit, 1 GB to 2 GB of the random-access memory (RAM) depending on the configuration; for 64-bit, 75% up {{to a maximum of}} 128 GB.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} phase, basic {{internal}} memory structures are created, and each CPU's interrupt controller is initialized. The memory manager is initialized, creating areas for the file system cache, paged and <b>non-paged</b> pools of memory. The Object Manager, initial security token for assignment {{to the first}} process on the system, and the Process Manager itself. The System idle process {{as well as the}} System process are created at this point.|$|R
5000|$|... 8 TB of {{kernel mode}} virtual address {{space for the}} {{operating}} system. As with the user mode address space, this is a 4096-fold increase over 32-bit Windows versions. The increased space primarily benefits the file system cache and kernel mode [...] "heaps" [...] (<b>non-paged</b> pool and paged pool). Windows only uses a total of 16 TB out of the 256 TB implemented by the processors because early AMD64 processors lacked a [...] instruction.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a textline detection algorithm for degraded historical documents. Our method {{is based on the}} conventional procedure that extracts textlines after binarization. However, in order to address the challenges in historical handwritten documents, we have developed new methods for binarization and textline extraction. First, we proposed an ROI setting method to deal with the <b>non-page</b> region problem. Also, we developed a textline detection method that can handle the metadata and page skews. Experimental results on a variety of datasets showed that our method outperforms conventional methods and both steps in our system are essential for the overall performance.|$|E
30|$|In {{historical}} document binarization, the combined approach introduced above [21] showed good performance. However, {{it was developed}} for page regions and hence has some difficulties in handling the images like Fig.  1. To be precise, the challenges are that (a) non-text regions have similar colors or intensities to the text pixels and hence the conventional methods fail to classify them correctly and (b) these misclassified pixels corrupt the statistics {{that will be used}} in text and non-text classification. In order to address these problems, we develop a <b>non-page</b> region detection algorithm and apply the binarization method in [21] to the ROIs as illustrated in the first stage of Fig.  3.|$|E
30|$|We remove {{detected}} <b>non-page</b> {{regions and}} then perform binarization {{on the remaining}} regions. The binarization method {{is the same as}} the combined approach in [21]. In detail, a background image is estimated from the pixels that are classified as backgrounds by the local method [19]. Then, an image is defined whose pixel value is the ratio of input image’s pixel value to the background image’s pixel value. The image is named “normalized image.” Otsu’s method is applied to the normalized image to obtain the global output. Some features of foreground and background pixel values (e.g., mean and standard deviation) and average stroke width of the character are estimated from the background image and global output. From these features, parameters for the local binarization method are selected and the local output is obtained. The global method usually results in clean output but the faint parts of the foreground are often disappeared. On the other hand, the local method preserves faint characters but yields noisy output. So these two methods are combined for recovering the faint parts of the global output with the local output. The detailed description can be found in [21].|$|E
50|$|Additional boards became {{available}} with time, including a 40K memory board - TANRAM, {{made up of}} 32K of dynamic and 8K of static RAM, bringing the total <b>non-paged</b> memory to 48K, a dedicated parallel I/O board featuring 16 parallel input/output ports; a similar dedicated serial I/O board featuring 8 serial input/output ports, a disk controller board for use with disk drives, a Disk Operating System - TANDOS 65, a high resolution graphics board featuring 8K of static graphics RAM giving a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels, a dedicated 32K ROM board, (aimed mainly at OEM and general purpose applications or for use with AIM KIM and SYM systems), capable of holding either 8 × 2732 or 16 × 2716 EPROMs; and a 32K RAM board featuring two 16K banks of 4116 dynamic RAM, again intended for similar purposes to the 32K ROM board. In addition, several third-party suppliers offered boards designed for use with the Microtan 65 system.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] object {{contains}} properties {{unique to}} the type of the object as well as static methods that implement the services offered by the object. Objects managed by Object Manager must at least provide a predefined set of services: [...] (which closes a handle to an object), [...] (create another handle to the object with which another process can gain shared access to the object), [...] (gather information about its attributes and properties), [...] (get the security descriptor of the object), [...] (change the security access), and [...] (to synchronize with one or more objects via certain events). Type objects also have some common attributes, including the type name, whether they are to be allocated in <b>non-paged</b> memory, access rights, and synchronization information. All instances of the same type share the same type object, and the type object is instantiated only once. A new object type can be created by endowing an object with Properties to expose its state and methods to expose the services it offers.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} feature of a database management systems (DBMS) is its client/server architecture, where managing shared memory among the clients and the server is always an tough issue. However, similarity queries are specially sensitive {{to this kind of}} architecture, since the answer sizes vary widely. Usually, the answers of similarity query are fully processed to be sent in full to the user, who often is interested in just parts of the answer, e. g. just few elements closer or farther to the query reference. Compelling the DBMS to retrieve the full answer, further ignoring its majority is at least a waste of server processing power. Paging the answer is a technique that splits the answer onto several pages, following client requests. Despite the success of paging on traditional queries, little work has been done to support it in similarity queries. In this work, we present a technique that not only provides paging in similarity range or k-nearest neighbor queries, but also supports them in two variations: the forward similarity query and the backward similarity query. They return elements either increasingly farther of increasingly closer to the query reference. The reported experiments show that, depending on the proportion of the interesting part over the full answer, both techniques allow answering queries much faster than it is obtained in the <b>non-paged</b> way.
