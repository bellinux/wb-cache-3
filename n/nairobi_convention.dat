2500|$|Following World War II, the United Nations (UN) {{extended}} feminism's global reach. They {{established a}} Commission on the Status of Women in 1946., which later joined the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 1948, the UN issued its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which protects [...] "the equal rights {{of men and}} women", and addressed both equality and equity. Starting with the 1975 World Conference of the International Women's Year in Mexico City {{as part of their}} Decade for Women (1975–85), the UN has held a series of world conferences on women's issues. These conferences have worldwide female representation and provide considerable opportunity to advance women's rights. They also illustrate deep cultural divisions and disagreement on universal principles, as evidenced by the successive Copenhagen (1980) and Nairobi (1985) conferences. Examples of such intrafeminism divisions have included disparities between economic development, attitudes towards forms of oppression, the definition of feminism, and stances on homosexuality, female circumcision, and population control. The <b>Nairobi</b> <b>convention</b> revealed a less monolithic feminism that [...] "constitutes the political expression of the concerns and interests of women from different regions, classes, nationalities, and ethnic backgrounds. There is and must be a diversity of feminisms, responsive to the different needs and concerns of women, and defined by them for themselves. This diversity builds on a common opposition to gender oppression and hierarchy which, however, is only the first step in articulating and acting upon a political agenda." [...] The fourth conference was held in Beijing in 1995, where the Beijing Platform for Action was signed. This included a commitment to achieve [...] "gender equality and the empowerment of women" [...] through [...] "gender mainstreaming", or letting women and men [...] "experience equal conditions for realising their full human rights, and have the opportunity to contribute and benefit from national, political, economic, social and cultural development".|$|E

40|$|This article aims to {{investigate}} the juridical concept of “shipwreck”. Italian law {{does not provide a}} legal definition of shipwreck (“relitto”) although the explanatory memorandum on Maritime Code states that the wreckage of a vessel implies an “intervened substantial modification of the physical consistence of the res”; French law specifies that “L’état d’épave résulte de la non-flottabilité, de l’absence d’équipage à bord et de l’inexistence de mesures de garde et de manoeuvre” while, on the contrary, English law classifies wrecks in “jetsam”, “floatsam”, “lagan” and “derelicts”, giving relevance to the abandonment of the vessel sine spe recuperandi and sine animo revertendi. The significance and combination of objective criteria (physical stranding, sinking, submersion or destruction of the ship) and subjective criteria (abandonment of the ship without the intention to return and resume the possession) will be examined in order to determine what a shipwreck is from a legal point of view; in particular the analysis will focus on the concept of non-buoyancy and perishing of the ship (derived from the Latin notion of interitus rei) and on the notion of “abandonment”. Furthermore the article will consider the definitions of shipwreck given by international conventions on Maritime Law, such as the International Convention on Salvage (1989), the <b>Nairobi</b> International <b>Convention</b> on the Removal of Wrecks (2007) and the Unesco Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (2001), comparing the broader classifications of shipwreck included in those treaties with the national definitions. In light of the aforementioned analysis, the conclusion will consider if it is possible to individuate the lowest common denominator and some basic elements of a truly international (and, possibly, universal) definition of “shipwreck”...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} approach to coastal zone management was formally endorsed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNECD) in 1992, {{when it was}} included {{as one of the}} principle recommendations of Agenda 21 and today it is accepted by most coastal nations as the most appropriate method of managing the coastal zone. Although the principle of integrated coastal zone management has subsequently been adopted a number of other non-binding international instruments such as the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, it has not, until recently, been adopted in any binding international instruments. This changed when the Protocol on the Integrated Coastal Zone Management in the Mediterranean to the Barcelona Convention was adopted in 2008. As its title indicates, the Mediterranean ICZM Protocol applies to the Mediterranean Sea and is legally binding on those states that have ratified it. The fact that the Mediterranean ICZM Protocol is the only legally binding instrument specifically aimed as coastal zone management is about to change. This is because in 2010 the Parties to the Amended <b>Nairobi</b> <b>Convention</b> agreed to work towards the adoption of a legally binding ICZM Protocol for the Western Indian Ocean. Pursuant to this agreement, an Ad-hoc Legal and Technical Working Group for the Drafting of an ICZM Protocol to the <b>Nairobi</b> <b>Convention</b> was appointed and in 2011 this Ad-Hoc Working Group produced a Fifth Draft of the ICZM Protocol to the Amended <b>Nairobi</b> <b>Convention.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to set out and critically discuss some of the key provisions of the Fifth Draft of the ICZM Protocol to the Amended <b>Nairobi</b> <b>Convention,</b> especially in light of the provisions of the Mediterranean ICZM Protocol...|$|E
40|$|Of {{concern to}} a number of states are wrecks, {{particularly}} those from the two World Wars, which pose a pollution or navigation hazard but which also have historic or broader cultural value. The issue of hazardous wrecks was addressed in 2007 with the adoption of the <b>Nairobi</b> Wreck Removal <b>Convention</b> (“WRC”), which allows states to remove, or have removed, a wreck that poses a hazard to the environment, to navigation or to the broader economic interests of the state. Designed to apply primarily in the exclusive economic zone, but also potentially in the territorial sea, the Convention clarifies states’ powers of intervention with regard to pollution hazards and extends existing powers to cover navigation hazards. This article examines the relationship between the WRC and hazardous historic wrecks. In particular, it considers how the WRC regime might be used to assist states in determining how to remove the hazard {{while at the same time}} protecting the historic value of the wreck.

40|$|The Johannesburg Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters as of 2003 is {{a crucial}} {{breakthrough}} and important legal tool {{for the implementation of}} risk analysis systems by customs authorities governed by the the World Customs Organization (WCO) around the globe. However it has not entered into force yet. Is this new legal tool failing early? The old <b>Nairobi</b> <b>Convention</b> from 1977 is outdated and has never been widely accepted. This paper addresses the need for mutual Customs assistance, a common legal basis and analyses the current situation. The author underlines the idea that the Johannesburg Convention recognises the increased global concern for the security and facilitation of the international trade supply chain, and that offences against customs law are prejudicial to the security of the Contracting Parties and their economic, commercial, fiscal, social, public health and cultural interests. It also recognises that the international exchange of information is an essential component of effective risk management and that such exchange of information should be based on clear legal provisions. The author also points out that though mutual customs ssistance is possible {{on the basis of the}} <b>Nairobi</b> <b>Convention</b> or on the basis of bilateral agreements and other binding or non-binding WCO and/or UN legal tools, the Johannesburg Convention would make things better, clearer and modern. In conclusion the author argues that in case the JC is not going to be ratified by most countries the overall aim of a more secure supply chain is about to fail due to administrational hindering and hesitating governments. The methods used during the study are analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization, systematic and functional analysis. Also available in Russia...|$|E

40|$|Because “not every {{international}} environmental problem {{needs to be}} dealt with on a global level[1]”, the regionalization of {{international environmental}} law has {{emerged as one of the}} most important legal trends over the last decades. In the field of marine environment, this movement has been taking place mostly within the UNEP regional seas programme, now involving over 140 States. Noteworthily, the regulation of coastal management stood apart from this movement for a long time: while coastal zone management projects have developed at all scales for over two decades[2], legal regulation has long been confined to the national and sub-national levels. From the 1972 US Coastal Zone Management Act to the 2008 South African Integrated Coastal Management Act, domestic legal frameworks have regularly been strengthened in most parts of the world, while progressively translating into law the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) concept. However, most recent developments in ICZM implementation demonstrate an increasing interest for a regional regulation through the adoption of ad hoc protocols within regional seas frameworks. Adopted in January 2008 and entered into force in March 2011, the Mediterranean ICZM Protocol is the first of its kind and constitutes, as of today, the only supra-State legal instrument specifically aimed at coastal zone management. It is however unlikely that the Mediterranean ICZM Protocol remain an isolated, legal alien in the regional seas landscape. The attractiveness of such a new kind of instrument seems to be increasing, as demonstrated by the recent decision of the Parties to the <b>Nairobi</b> <b>Convention</b> to follow the path of the Barcelona Convention[3]. The Black Sea is also more informally now looking at the opportunity to develop such a protocol. It appears timely, therefore, to start drawing some early lessons from the most advanced cases, that is the Mediterranean and Western Indian Ocean (WIO). This is precisely what this presentation will aim at, based on research and consultancy conducted over the last five years in these two regions as well as at the global level. In particular, this presentation will: (i) briefly remind the regional seas concept and institutional framework; (ii) provide an overview of the content of the Mediterranean and WIO ICZM Protocols; (iii) enumerate the expected benefits of having a regional, legally binding regulation instrument for ICZM; (iv) identify key necessary conditions for success on the regional and national contexts, the drafting and negotiation process, as well as the way implementation issues are anticipated. This presentation will thus identify key conditions under which such ICZM Protocols may actually make a difference in placing coastal areas on a sustainable path. [1] Alhéritière D.

40|$|The Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks {{came into}} {{force on the}} 14 of April 2015 and {{provides}} a framework for wreck removal. Three central questions arise when dealing with shipwrecks; Who is responsible? What measures can and are to be taken based on such a responsibility? And lastly; how can the responsibility be enforced? The <b>Nairobi</b> <b>Convention</b> on the Removal of Wrecks addresses these questions. The registered owner of a ship bears strict liability according to the convention but can be exonerated by certain limited defenses. Measures {{that are to be}} taken include locating, marking and subsequently removing the wreck. The onus to remove the wreck is on the registered owner, but there are also options available for the State affected by the wreck should the registered owner not cooperate or be unable to contact. Finally the convention strives to ensure enforceability by compulsory insurance for ships, wherever registered, with a gross tonnage of 300 tons and above calling any port or offshore facility in a State Party. The convention also enables an Affected State to claim the insurer directly. This article will analyze the convention by the use of the convention text, its preparatory works and legal writing. The article suggests that even though the convention provides a unified framework for wreck removal, it has inclusions that may actually inhibit harmonization. The convention is also in part unclear and ambiguous. Despite this the article concludes in the convention being a natural step forward in unifying the regulation of wrecks and providing a platform to deal with wreck removal in the future...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis thesis {{outlines}} {{and critically}} assesses {{the regulation of}} land-based sources and activities causing pollution (LBSA) in the coastal and marine environment in two broad areas of sub-Saharan Africa, the West and Central African Region (WACAF) and the West Indian Ocean (WIO) region. These two regions are both endowed with a diversity of life forms and resources that support large populations of coastal communities. The legal and institutional aspects are outlined and examined against the theoretical backdrop of the relatively new concept of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), the goals of which are to ensure that decisions taken in all sectors regarding the environment and {{at all levels of}} government are harmonized and consistent with countries' coastal policies in order to achieve sustainable development of coastal and marine areas. More specifically, the work examines the international soft and hard law developments as well as regional legal developments, paying particular attention to the two UNEP initiated Conventions in the regions namely the 1985 Convention for the Protection, Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Eastern African region (<b>Nairobi</b> <b>Convention)</b> and the 1981 Convention for the Cooperation in the Protection and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the West and Central African Region and its Protocol concerning Cooperation in Combating Pollution in Cases of Emergency (Abidjan Convention), as well as their respective Protocols. The work concludes by examining {{the extent to which these}} international and regional developments have been incorporated in the legal and institutional framework structures of three select countries namely, Kenya (representing the WIO) region, Nigeria (representing the WACAF region) and South Africa on the interface of both regions.

40|$|The first {{beaches in}} the Caribbean have begun flying the Blue Flag, {{denoting}} cleanliness, environmental conservation and safety. The Blue Flag International Jury has given 12 coastal {{sites in the}} Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Puerto Rico the right to display the prestigious eco-label. The Blue Flag Campaign for beaches and marinas {{is run by the}} non-profit organisation Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE) and has been operating in Europe since 1987. Since its launch, it has proved to be an effective environmental management tool, but the early criteria for the Blue Flag awards, largely based on water quality standards, have gradually been expanded to include wider areas of environmental management, such as waste management and coastal planning and protection. It is expected that implementation of the Blue Flag Campaign in the Caribbean will encourage the sustainable use of beach ecosystems in the region, as well as other coastal resources, including rural areas further inland. Special criteria have been designed for the region, which take account of the environmental particularities of the Caribbean Sea, such as the presence of coral reefs. In 2004, 2, 333 beaches and 605 marinas were flying the Blue Flag in 29 countries. In 1981, South Africa became the first country outside Europe to fly the blue flag on its beaches. More countries are applying to join, including several southeastern African nations which signed the <b>Nairobi</b> <b>Convention,</b> the Convention for the Protection, Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Eastern African Region. Former Executive Director of the Caribbean Conservation Association, Dr. Joth Singh, said this certification would be a boost for the sustainable management of coastal resources in the region. The important thing about the Blue Flag programme is that it will encourage environmental management at the respective sites on a continuous basis, he said. Blue Flag status is only valid {{for as long as the}} criteria are maintained. Therefore, the onus is on those in charge of the sites to ensure that their flags are kept flying.
