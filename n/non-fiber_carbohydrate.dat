40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the potential use of fruticulture waste as an additive in elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) cultivar Napier silage at different densities, defining the effect of fermentative quality, microbiological characteristics and bromatological composition. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications in a 4 x 3 factorial scheme, comprising a control, banana waste (BW), mango waste (MW), and passion fruit waste (PFW) at three densities (400, 500 and 600 kg green matter [GM] m- 3). The effect of ensiling density was greatest in the exclusively elephant grass silage, where a compaction of 600 kg GM m- 3 contributed to improvements in fermentation and microbiological processes. The addition of banana waste to the elephant grass silage promoted improvements only in bromatological composition, raising the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> (NFC) content and reducing fiber components (neutral detergent fiber [NDFap] and acid detergent fiber [ADFap] corrected for ash and protein), but the addition of banana waste did not favor the fermentative or microbiological processes.

40|$|Abstract: Diets {{formulated}} with {{protein sources}} presenting different resistance to ruminal degradation were compared by evaluating ruminal parameters, production and microbial efficiency and nutrients {{flow to the}} omasum in goats. Eight rumen cannulated non-lactating, non-pregnant goats were distributed in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with two replicates. Treatments consisted of four diets where different sources of plant protein accounted for the major protein source named soybean meal, source of higher ruminal degradability, and three other sources of higher resistance of degradation: roasted soybean, corn gluten meal, and cottonseed cake. Amounts of rumen protein were similar among rations; however, flows of dry matter, protein and <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> to omasum were higher for diets with protein source with reduced rumen degradation rate. Higher values of rumen ammonia were obtained by using ration with soybean meal as major source of protein. Higher values of pH were obtained for rations with roasted soybean e cottonseed cake. Regarding kinetic of transit, similar values were found among rations. Diets with protein sources presenting reduced ruminal degradation increase nutrients flow to the omasum in goats and alter digestive parameters such as pH and ammonia without compromising bacteria growth and efficiency, which grants their use for dairy goats with similar efficiency to rations using more degradable sources of protein. 201...|$|E

In rumen epithelium, the significantly increased expressions of TLR 1, 6, 10 were associated with the significantly decreased expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 ß), IL- 6, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10. Constrained correlation analysis indicated that the increased abundance of commensal bacteria in Verrucomicrobia subdivision 5 contributed to the upregulation of TLR 10 expression. Finally, the significantly increased concentrations of rumen SCFAs, coupled with the significantly upregulated expressions of epithelial genes related to short chain fatty acid (SCFA) absorption were observed in goats fed with 31 % NFC diet. Thus, the NFC-induced expansion of rumen microbiota promoted epithelium tolerance by enhancement of the intensity of TLR 10 signaling. The newly established equilibrium benefited to the transport of ruminal energy substances into the blood...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess impacts of fungal {{treatment}} on the nutritional value of peanut hulls (PH) or urea {{at the rate}} of 5 kg/ 100 g of PH. Fermented sugar beet pulp inoculated with Trichoderma viride was supplemented to PH at rates of 5. 0, 10. 0 and 15. 0 g/ 100 g air dry of PH andmixed well before aerobic incubation for 21 days. Organic matter (OM) content of PH declined with increased levels of fermented sugar beet pulp inoculums, while crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), and ash increased. Fiber contents were decreased with both treatments of fermented sugar beet pulp and urea. Total N of PH increased with urea treatment, which reduced the true protein N to total protein N ratio. In sacco degradabilities of dry matter (DM), OM, and CP with urea treatment increased compared with fungal treatment. The DM intake of peanut hulls treated with fungus (PHF) was higher (P < 0. 05) than with peanut hulls treated with urea (PHU). Digestibility of OM, CP, neutral detergent fiber, and <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> by native breed Ossimi sheep with PH were higher (P < 0. 05) than with PH or urea treated PH. The intakes, losses, and balance of N increased (P < 0. 01) with PHF versus PH feeding. Feeding PHF increased (P < 0. 01) ruminal concentrations ofNH 3 -N, acetic acid, butyric acid, and the acetic to propionic acid ratio. Bacterial and protozoal counts increased (P < 0. 05) with feeding PHF or PHU versus PH. Overall, this fungal treatment of peanut hulls created a higher nutritive value feed for ruminants...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar o efeito da substituição do milho e farelo de soja por levedura de cana-de-açúcar e uréia, sobre o consumo de nutrientes, digestibilidade e desempenho, em ovinos. Foi avaliada a inclusão de 0; 10, 20 e 30 % de levedura corrigida com uréia. Foram distribuídos, aleatoriamente, 32 ovinos castrados nos quatro tratamentos, num delineamento inteiramente casualizado. Os consumos de matéria seca, matéria orgânica, extrato etéreo, proteína bruta e carboidratos totais não foram influenciados, pela inclusão de levedura na dieta. Os consumos de carboidratos não-fibrosos e NDT diminuíram, e o de fibra em detergente neutro aumentou linearmente com a inclusão de levedura. A digestibilidade da proteína bruta, extrato etéreo, fibra em detergente neutro e carboidratos totais não foram influenciados, enquanto que a digestibilidade da matéria seca, matéria orgânica e carboidratos não-fibrosos diminuíram linearmente com a inclusão de levedura. Os pesos ao abate, da carcaça fria e quente, ganho de peso, rendimento de carcaça fria e quente e perda ao resfriamento diminuíram linearmente com a inclusão de levedura. O rendimento dos cortes comerciais não foi alterado pela inclusão de levedura. Conclui-se que a substituição do milho e farelo de soja por levedura e uréia, na dieta de ovinos, afetou negativamente o consumo de energia e o desempenho animal. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} the replacement of cracked corn and soybean meal with sugar cane yeast and urea on nutrient intake, digestibility and performance of sheep. The additions of 0, 10, 20 and 30 % of sugar cane yeast enriched with urea were evaluated. Thirty-two castrated male sheep were assigned to the four treatments in a completely randomized design. The results showed that intakes of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, ether extract and total carbohydrates were not affected by sugar cane yeast. However, intake of <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> and TDN decreased, and neutral detergent fiber intake increased linearly when the level of sugar cane yeast increased. The digestibility of crude protein, ether extract, neutral detergent fiber and total carbohydrate were not affected, while the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter and <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> decreased linearly as a function of sugar cane yeast levels. Slaughter weight, hot and cold carcass weight, live weight gain and both hot and cold carcass dressing decreased linearly as functions of levels of sugar cane yeast. The dressing of commercial cuts, as a function of cold carcass, was not affected by sugar cane yeast. It was concluded that the replacement of cracked corn and soybean meal with sugar cane yeast and urea in the diet of sheep adversely affected energy intake and animal performance...|$|R
40|$|A trial {{involving}} a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments {{was conducted to}} evaluate two corn silage hybrids (Agromen, AGN 35 -A 42) and (Bayer, A 3663) and concentrate levels (25 and 50 %) on animal performance. Twenty-four Holstein x Zebu crossbred steers, averaging 335 ± 30 kg of BW, were distributed in six randomized blocks to evaluate intake, digestibility, and performance. Treatments consisted of 75 % corn silage A + 25 % concentrate, 50 % corn silage A + 50 % concentrate, 75 % corn silage B + 25 % concentrate, and 50 % corn silage B + 50 % concentrate (dry matter basis); formulated to be isonitrogenous (13 % crude protein, dry matter basis). There were no differences in the daily intakes of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), and crude protein. Additionally, there was a concentrate effect on <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> and total digestible nutrients intakes, and on total apparent digestibility of DM and OM, with higher intakes for steers fed diets with 50 % of concentrate. However, average daily gain (ADG) was not influenced by treatments.

5000|$|Livestock include beef cattle, dairy cattle, horses, goats, {{sheep and}} llamas. There is no {{specific}} requirement of feed intake for each livestock because their feed continuously varies based on the animals’ age, sex, breed, environment, etc. However basic nutrient requirement of a livestock’s feed must consist of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Dairy cattle need more energy in their feed than other type of cattle. Studies have shown that energy supplied by feed is provided by various <b>carbohydrate</b> sources include <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> (NFC) such as fermentable feeds or neutral detergent fiber (NDF) such as forage. Feeds with high NDF is good for rumen health, however provides less energy and vice versa. Fats are added in the livestock feed to increase energy concentration, especially when the NFC content is already too high since excessive NFC lessens the NDF fraction, affecting the rumen digestion. In ruminants, most proteins consumed are breakdown by microorganisms and the microorganism later get digested by the small intestine. The [...] suggested that the crude protein required in livestock feed should be less than 7%. Lactating ruminant especially dairy cattle require highest amount of protein, especially for milk synthesis. Minerals including calcium, phosphorus and selenium are required by livestock for maintaining growth, reproduction and bone health.|$|R
40|$|Undersander et al. (1993) {{developed}} {{a method for}} estimating milk per ton of forage dry matter (DM) as an index of forage quality. The milk per ton index is based on energy content of the forage predicted from acid detergent fiber (ADF) content and DM intake potential of the forage predicted from neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content. The milk per ton index has now been modified to use new NRC recommend-ations (National Research Council, 2001) for calculating energy (Schwab and Shaver, 2001), and an easy to use Excel 5. 0 spreadsheet called Milk 2000 has been developed. MILK 2000 uses forage analyses (crude protein, NDF, in vitro NDF digestibility, starch (corn silage only), and <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrate)</b> to estimate energy content using a modification of the NRC (2001) summative approach and DM intake from NDF (Mertens, 1987) and in vitro NDF digestibility (Oba and Allen, 1999) to predict milk production per ton of forage DM. In MILK 2000, the intake of energy from forage for a 1350 lb. milking cow consuming a 30 % NDF diet is calculated and the cow’s maintenance energy requirement (proportioned according to the percentage of forage in the diet) is then subtracted from energy intake to provide {{an estimate of the}} energy available from forage for conversion to milk (NRC, 1989). Forage DM yield multiplied times the milk produced per ton of forage DM provides an estimate of the milk produced per acre and combines yield and quality into a single term. Greater documentation of the equations used to calculate Milk 2000 and the Excel spreadsheets are available at the following website...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects inclusion of 0 %, 33. 3 %, 66. 7 % and 100 % natural matter (NM) of mesquite pod meal (MPM), in substitution of corn, on the intake, digestibility and feeding behavior of lactating Saanen goats. The forage:concentrate ratio in the diet was 40 : 60, using elephant grass silage as a forage source. Eight adult lactating goats with about 60 days in milk and weighting 50 kg were divided into two 4 × 4 latin squares and four 17 -day experimental periods. Dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and total digestible nutrient (TDN) intakes were not influenced by MPM levels. Ether extract (0. 51; 0. 34; 0. 36; 0. 20 kg/day) and <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> (NFC) (0. 54; 0. 53; 0. 49; 0. 36 kg/day) intakes showed a linear effect with increased MPM. Organic matter (OM) and NDF intakes presented a quadratic behavior. The maximum OM intake was estimated with the replacement of 40. 5 %. The maximum estimated intakes for NDF were 0. 665 kg/day and 14. 8 g/kg body weight, with a replacement close to 60 %. Nutrient digestibility coefficients and TDN levels (655. 0 g/kg) were not affected, except for NFC. The time spent eating, ruminating and idle was not influenced by the addition of MPM. The feeding rate of DM had a linear decrease which reflected the intake restriction. Corn replacement with MPM should not exceed 40. 5 %, although its total replacement does not interfere with the intake of DM, CP and TDN on the apparent digestibility of nutrients and most ingestive behavior parameters...|$|E
40|$|Objective This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine molecular structures related to carbohydrates and lipid in alfalfa hay cut at early bud, late bud and early flower and in the afternoon and next morning using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT/IR) and to determine their relationship with alfalfa hay nutrient profile and availability in ruminants. Methods Chemical composition analysis, carbohydrate fractionation, in situ ruminal degradability, and DVE/OEB model were used to measure nutrient profile and availability of alfalfa hay. Univariate analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis (CLA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were conducted to identify FT/IR spectra differences. Results The FT/IR non-structural carbohydrate (NSCHO) to total carbohydrates and NSCHO to structural carbohydrate ratios decreased (p< 0. 05), while lignin to NSCHO and lipid CH 3 symmetric to CH 2 symmetric ratios increased with advancing maturity (p< 0. 05). The FT/IR spectra related to structural carbohydrates, lignin and lipids were distinguished for alfalfa hay at three maturities by PCA and CLA, while FT/IR molecular structures related to carbohydrates and lipids were similar between alfalfa hay cut in the morning and afternoon when analyzed by PCA and CLA analysis. Positive correlations were found for FT/IR NSCHO to total carbohydrate and NSCHO to structural carbohydrate ratios with <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> (by wet chemistry), ruminal fast and intermediately degradable carbohydrate fractions and total ruminal degradability of carbohydrates and predicted intestinal nutrient availability in dairy cows (r≥ 0. 60; p< 0. 05) whereas FT/IR lignin to NSCHO and CH 3 to CH 2 symmetric stretching ratio had negative correlation with predicted ruminal and intestinal nutrient availability of alfalfa hay in dairy cows (r≥− 0. 60; p< 0. 05). Conclusion FT/IR carbohydrate and lipid molecular structures in alfalfa hay changed with advancing maturity from early bud to early flower, but not during the day, and these molecular structures correlated with predicted nutrient supply of alfalfa hay in ruminants...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{nutrition}} plays a {{key role}} in ruminant performance and represents the largest proportion of costs in animal feed. The present study evaluated whether the roughage portion of Santa Inês sheep diets could be supplemented with different ratios of tropical kudzu as a protein source and assessed the best inclusion level of tropical kudzu based on digestibility, intake, nitrogen balance and feeding behavior. Twenty rams were evaluated during the 20 -day experimental period, and they were fed formulated diets with a roughage portion (60 %) consisting of Elephant grass and tropical kudzu, the latter supplemented at different concentrations (0, 25, 50 and 75 % on a dry matter basis). Forty percent of the concentrate portion consisted primarily of ground corn and soybean meal adjusted to obtain an isoproteic diet. Chemical and bromatological analyses, as well as, analyses to assess intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and feeding behavior, were conducted. No statistically significant differences were found (P> 0. 05) for the intake and digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), hemicellulose (HEMI), <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> (NFC) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) or for the feeding behavior (feeding, rumination and idle times in h/day) and nitrogen balance between the diets studied. Thus, tropical kudzu can be considered a feed alternative to supplementation with prime protein foods (in this case, soybean meal) in sheep diets...|$|R

This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the best concentration of peanut cake in the ensiling of massai grass of the chemical-bromatological composition, fermentative characteristics, forage value rate, ingestion estimates, and digestibility of dry matter in the silage. Materials and methods. The {{experiment was}} carried out at the Experimental Farm of São Gonçalo dos Campos at the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil. The treatments consisted of massai grass that was cut at 40 days and dehydrated, in addition to 0 %, 8 %, 16 %, and 24 % peanut cake in the fresh matter and treatment without cake. The material was compressed in experimental silos (7 liter) that were opened after 76 days. Results. The addition of 8 - 24 % peanut cake improved the silage’s chemical-bromatological parameters, increased the dry matter and <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> and reduced the fibrous components. There was a linear increase in the estimated values of digestibility and the ingestion of dry matter depending on the levels of peanut cake in the silage. There was an improvement in the fermentative characteristics, with a quadratic effect positive for levels of ammoniacal nitrogen. The forage value rate increased linearly with the inclusion of peanut cake. Conclusions. The inclusion of up to 24 % peanut cake during ensiling of massai grass increases the nutritive value of silage and improves fermentation characteristics...|$|R

It was determined the following aspects: apparent digestibility of diets; phosphorus (P), calcium and fluorine apparent absorption; ruminal pH; ruminal ammonia concentration; microbial efficiency and plasma P. Five rumen fistulated Holstein steers weighting 275 - 283 kg were used. Experimental design was a 5 &# 215; 5 Latin square and diets consisted of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of dicalcium phosphate replacement by rock phosphate in the mineral supplement. Addition of rock phosphate in the diets produced a linear increase on intake, rumen outflow and fecal output and total disappearance of fluorine. Diets did not differ to apparent absorption of calcium as well as dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and <b>non-fiber</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> intake, excretion, digestion and partial and total apparent digestibility. Plasma phosphorus was not influenced by diets and the average was 5. 93 mg/dL. There was no difference for ruminal pH and ruminal ammonia concentration. Dicalcium phosphate replacement did not affect apparent and true protein microbial synthesis. Total replacement of dicalcium phosphate by rock phosphate in growing steer mineral supplement did not affect ruminal environment and protein synthesis in rumen. Considering this, dicalcium phosphate replacement in growing steer diets decreases P absorption and depending on its requirements it should be carefully seen...|$|R
