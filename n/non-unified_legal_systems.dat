40|$|Efficient and {{sustainable}} use of forest resources depend on various factors. However, {{one of the}} most emphasized and discussed topics among these factors is forest ownership. Comparative law is an important way of analyzing and understanding <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> of different countries, and identifying different aspects of the current <b>legal</b> <b>systems.</b> This study tries to analyze forest ownership with regard to comparative law. France for the Continental-European <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> Great Britain for the Anglo-Saxon <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> and Russia Federation for the Socialist <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> are taken respectively as a base. Thus, how right to ownership is evaluated in different <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> and what are the main features of that are indicated. As a result, private forest ownership is common in the Continental-European <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> and Anglo-Saxon <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> while state ownership is common in the Socialist <b>legal</b> <b>system.</b> Prevalence of private forest ownership in the Continental-European and the Anglo-Saxon <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> is also closely related to the previous use rights transferred into right to ownership. In addition, it is concluded regarding the historical process that many changes occurred on forest ownership types without considering differences in <b>legal</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Since its rise at the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, comparative legal research has gained an inﬂuential place in legal research concerning national <b>legal</b> <b>systems.</b> Comparative <b>legal</b> methodology is used to acquire insight into foreign <b>legal</b> <b>systems,</b> to ﬁnd solutions for problems of a speciﬁc <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> or to promote the uniﬁ cation of law between national <b>legal</b> <b>systems.</b> Its methods consist of a comparison of different <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> or <b>legal</b> traditions (external comparison), or of ﬁelds of law within national <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> (internal comparison). With the proliferation of regulatory regimes at the international level (e. g. in the context of the United Nations or the WTO), comparative legal research has expanded its focus to include international law.
