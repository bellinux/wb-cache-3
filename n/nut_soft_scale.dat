40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{summarize}} the economic importance, biology, {{and management of}} <b>soft</b> <b>scales,</b> focusing on pests of agricultural, horti-cultural, and silvicultural crops in outdoor production systems and urban landscapes. We also provide summaries on voltinism, crawler emergence timing, and predictive models for crawler emergence to assist in developing <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> management programs. Phloem-feeding <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> pests cause direct (e. g., injuries to plant tissues and removal of nutrients) and indirect damage (e. g., reduction in photosynthesis and aesthetic value by honeydew and sooty mold). Variations in life cycle, reproduction, fecundity, and behavior exist among congenerics due to host, environmental, climatic, and geographical variations. Sampling of <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> pests involves sighting the insects or their damage, and assessing their abundance. Crawlers of most univoltine species emerge {{in the spring and}} the summer. Degree-day models and plant phenological indicators help determine the initiation of sampling and treatment against crawlers (the life stage most vulnerable to contact insecticides). The efficacy of cultural management tactics, such as fertilization, pruning, and irrigation, in reducing <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> abundance is poorly documented. A large number of parasitoids and predators attack <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> populations in the field; therefore, natural enemy conservation by using selective insecticides is important. Systemic insecticides provide greater flexi-bility in application method and timing, and have longer residual longevity than contact insecticides. Application timing of contact in-secticides that coincides with crawler emergence is most effective in reducing <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> abundance...|$|R

40|$|Several {{mealybug}} and two <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> {{species have}} been identified as vectors of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV- 3), the most abundant of the Closteroviridae associated with grapevine leafroll disease. To identify further <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> vectors of GLRaV- 3, the ability of three species, Coccus longulus, Parasaissetia nigra and a Saissetia sp., to transmit the virus to grapevine was determined under laboratory conditions. Using cultured <b>soft</b> <b>scales,</b> first-instar nymphs of C. longulus and P. nigra were given acquisition access to GLRaV- 3 -infected rootstock hybrid LN 33. Saissetia sp. was reared on LN 33 infected with GLRaV- 3 and Grapevine virus A (GVA). Nymphs were transferred from virus source to virus-free grapevine plants (cv. Cabernet franc). Recipient plants were tested for GLRaV- 3 and GVA with nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (nested RT-PCR) and RT-PCR, respectively. The study shows {{for the first time that}} C. longulus, P. nigra and a Saissetia sp. are vectors of GLRaV- 3. Saissetia sp. did not transmit GVA. The biology of C. longulus and P. nigra on grapevine was examined at different constant temperatures ranging between 18 and 35 °C, and at 25 and 30 °C, respectively. None of the nymphs survived past the second-instar stage except for one C. longulus female at 30 °C, which produced 117 offspring. The low survival rate could explain the low abundance and patchy distribution of <b>soft</b> <b>scales</b> in South African vineyards. However, outbreaks of <b>soft</b> <b>scales</b> in European vineyards have been reported and this study shows that more <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> insect species than hitherto thought are able to transmit the virus.

40|$|The coccinellid Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Muls. is an oligophagous {{predator}} {{that is used}} {{to control}} mealy bugs in the orchards and greenhouses. Citrus <b>soft</b> <b>scale,</b> Pulvinaria aurantii, as an active pest on citrus plants in North of Iran is also attacked by this predator. This research was conducted to study biological characteristics of C. montrouzieri on citrus <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> and mealy bug, Planococcus citri. Initially, Cryptolaemus eggs were collected from colonies of two preys and reared in laboratory (14 L: 10 D, 25 ± 1 ˚C, and RH 70 ± 5 %). The incubation period of eggs, 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd and, 4 th larval instars, and total larval, prepupal, and pupal stages were studied on two preys. The developmental stages on two preys were not significantly different, except for the 4 th larval instar at 1 % and total larval stages at 5 %. The sex ratio of male to female on two preys were not significantly different at 1 % and was 1 : 1. Except for pre-oviposition period, other parameters including female longevity, average number of eggs laid per day, average total number of eggs laid per female and percentage of hatching were significantly different at 1 % on the two preys. The average feeding of total larval period on eggs of mealy bug and citrus <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> were 5715 and 7694, respectively that, the difference was significant at 1 %. The results showed that some of the biological characteristics of Cryptolaemus on two preys were significantly different.

40|$|Metaphycus sp. nr. flavus (Encyrtidae: Hymenoptera) is a {{parasitoid}} species {{collected from}} the Mediterranean region which lays its eggs in the immature stages of several economically important <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> insects (Hemiptera: Coccidae), including brown <b>soft</b> <b>scale,</b> Coccus hesperidum L. (= host insect). Preliminary tests suggested that the parasitoid is most successful in producing offspring when it oviposits in the younger stages of brown <b>soft</b> <b>scale.</b> In Y-olfactometer bioassays measuring wasp choices and residence times, naïve parasitoids were significantly more attracted to yucca leaves infested with 26, 27, or 28 d-old scale than to uninfested leaves, whereas leaves with older (29 - 30 d-old) scale were no more attractive than uninfested leaves. Parasitoids also spent significantly {{more time in the}} arm with yucca leaves infested with 26 d-old scale than in the arm with uninfested leaves. These results are consistent with observations of the parasitoid's reproductive success on scale of different ages, whereby older scale are more likely to encapsulate the developing eggs of M. sp. nr. flavus females than are younger scale. Further bioassays determined that yucca leaves that had been infested with 26 d-old scale but from which the scale had been removed were as attractive as infested leaves. In contrast, infested yucca leaves from which scale had been removed and the leaves subsequently washed with distilled water were less attractive than infested leaves. Furthermore, the wash water containing scale residues was attractive to female wasps. In total, these results suggest that Metaphycus sp. nr. flavus females utilize volatile, water soluble compounds produced by brown <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> as cues to locate suitable hosts...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} {{effective}} field theory techniques can be applied in the high temperature T regime of plasmas to improve {{the accuracy of the}} physics of the hard scales (or scales of order T), and as a by-product, also that of the <b>soft</b> <b>scales</b> (or scales of order gT).
