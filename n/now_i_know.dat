500|$|Almost a {{year after}} filming her final scenes, Lister {{explained}} that she felt her exit was the right choice, saying: [...] "It felt {{it was time to}} go so I just ran with my instincts. Looking back, I was nervous but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I've done the right thing. I love theatre work. It gives me such a buzz. [...] was the break I'd been praying for. I threw myself into the part and enjoyed every minute of it. I had three superb years and it was brilliant." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Consider the lyrics: Prayed {{through the}} nights / Felt so alone / Suffered from {{alienation}} / Carried the weight {{on my own}} / Had to be strong / So I believed / And <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I've succeeded / In finding the place I conceived. Well, just because you are young doesn't mean that you haven't had a hard life. It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself, basically on my own, my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everyone else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person – ethnically. And sometimes {{that can be a}} problem. If you look a certain way everybody goes, 'White girl,' and I'd go, 'No, that's not what I am.'" ...|$|E

500|$|A {{muscle strain}} forced Mackin {{to miss a}} {{pre-season}} friendly against Shrewsbury Town in July 2008 and he returned to pre-season training later that month. He was shown a red card after picking up two yellow cards in his first appearance of 2008–09, which was Wrexham's first match in the Conference Premier, as they beat Stevenage Borough 5–0 at home on 9 August 2008. On reflection, Mackin said [...] "As for the second yellow I felt the ball was there to be won and I thought that's what I did. Looking back <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I should have stayed on my feet". He was handed a one-match suspension and returned in a 1–1 draw away to Rushden & Diamonds on 17 August 2008. Mackin scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a 25-yard shot against Grays Athletic, which was Wrexham's only goal in a 2–1 away defeat on 20 September 2008. Despite starting the season as a regular in the team, he found opportunities hard to come by after the arrival of Dean Saunders as manager.|$|E
500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} was photographed by Björk's former boyfriend, the French {{director}} Stéphane Sednaoui. It shows the singer {{standing in a}} London street, her pale skin and dark hair contrasting with the vivid colours of the Japanese-inspired signs behind her. An earlier shoot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino was scrapped; it would later appear in a 1995 article for The Face, in which Björk explained: [...] "It cost £24,000. But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what I want. OK, I admit it, [...] I'm a pop star"! In the original cover picture, Björk was surrounded by silver balls, but she scrapped the cover in favour of something [...] "more poppy". Designer Paul White of Me Company—who had been a frequent collaborator since The Sugarcubes—"surrounded her with giant postcards to represent communication with friends and family". Me Company designed the artwork, while Martin Gardiner modelled the lotus flower used in the album's booklet and packaging. The jacket Björk wears, shown on the cover, was inspired by Royal Mail airmail envelopes, referencing the album's title. It was specially crafted from envelope paper called Tyvek by designer Hussein Chalayan. Björk {{was a friend of}} Chalayan and an admirer of his designs, modelling for him in September 1995. The jacket is displayed under glass at Hard Rock Reykjavík, and was part of a 2015 MoMA retrospective on the singer, titled Björk. Vice has identified the airmail jacket look as one the [...] "ultimate fashion moments" [...] of Björk's career.|$|E

500|$|Although xx {{had been}} highly {{anticipated}} by XL, the album's success exceeded expectations in the press. McDonald said their direction and sound {{would have been}} entirely different had expectations been higher. Croft was [...] "baffled" [...] by the acclaim given to what she viewed as an album they had made [...] "for themselves". Sim had mixed feelings about its success and believed it could affect his songwriting in the future: [...] "This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were. When I was writing the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> so many people will. I might feel I {{have to be a}} bit more private." [...] At the Mercury Prize ceremony, he said the time since its release has [...] "felt like a haze", but that the event serves as [...] "a moment of clarity". In their acceptance speech, the band announced they would use the £20,000 prize money to build their own studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album Coexist. When Coexist debuted in September 2012, xx was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on NMEs list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by Rolling Stone, who found its music radical as [...] "an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence" [...] during popular music's period of maximalism.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Madonna has been {{involved}} in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, who worked on Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), said that [...] "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it." [...] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: [...] "I don't know where [...] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'." [...] Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including [...] "Lucky Star" [...] which she composed on synthesizer. Rolling Stone has named her [...] "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." [...] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing [...] "incredible" [...] hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and its line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you're mine." [...] Though Madonna has worked with producers across many genres, her songs have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Some of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which led to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the [...] "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time".|$|E

60|$|I had reread Bowen's adventures {{so often}} that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> them almost by heart, and so <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>I</b> was looking upon the last remnant of that ancient man-race--the Alus of a {{forgotten}} period--the speechless man of antiquity.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} I thought that I had heard enough, and slipped away when their backs were turned. For, friend Mahatma, I {{had just seen}} a fox shot, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what {{shooting}} meant.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Australian Commander, Major General [...] Eastick ... {{mounted the}} rostrum and after {{accepting}} {{the sword of}} surrender from Suga was about to dismiss him when a shout, rising simultaneously from the throats of the Board of Directors of the 'Old Lady' and 'Ginnie' stopped the proceedings. 'Hold on, {{we have something to}} show you.' Carrying the radio and generator Len [...] proudly showed them to the General and turning to Suga, asked, 'Well, {{what do you think about}} it Suga?' <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the full meaning of the saying 'If looks could kill.' Len would have died a horrible death".|$|E
2500|$|Ian Parrott {{wrote in}} his book on Elgar that the [...] "dark saying", and {{possibly}} {{the whole of the}} Enigma, had a biblical source, 1 Corinthians 13:12, which in the Authorised Version reads, [...] "For now we see through a glass, darkly (enigmate in the Latin of the Vulgate); but then face to face: <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known." [...] The verse is from St. Paul's essay on love. Elgar was a practising Roman Catholic and on 12 February 1899, eight days before the completion of the Variations, he attended a Mass at which this verse was read.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Coetzee criticised {{contemporary}} anti-terrorism laws as resembling those {{employed by}} the apartheid regime in South Africa: [...] "I {{used to think that}} the people who created [...] laws that effectively suspended the rule of law were moral barbarians. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> they were just pioneers ahead of their time". The main character in Coetzee's 2007 Diary of a Bad Year, which has been described as blending [...] "memoir with fiction, academic criticism with novelistic narration" [...] and refusing [...] "to recognize the border that has traditionally separated political theory from fictional narrative", shares similar concerns about the policies of John Howard and George W. Bush.|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> how {{it would}} be. You men have such restless curiosity! Talk of the curiosity of women, indeed! 'Tis nothing. But be satisfied, for you are not to know {{anything}} {{at all of the}} matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> don't <b>know,</b> and {{you don't}} know; and I can't {{see that there}} is any use talking about it <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> him a long while before she did, and if she has allowed him to make a fool of her, it isn't my fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So when we {{got about}} a couple of miles to the west of Ushant, we lay to. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> we were on the forty-eighth {{parallel}} of latitude, for I had looked that out on the chart, so I said to Captain Dork,-- ...|$|R
2500|$|We agonised {{over the}} {{inclusion}} of [...] "Yesterday" [...] in the show. It is such a famous song, the icon of an era, but had it been heard too much? The story of {{the addition of the}} original string quartet is well known, however, few people know how limited the recording was technically, and so the case for not including it was strong, but how could we ignore such a marvellous work? We introduced it with some of Paul's guitar work from [...] "Blackbird", and hearing it <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it was right to include it. Its simplicity is so direct; it tugs at the heartstrings.|$|E
2500|$|Hinrich {{started the}} {{exhibition}} game against Lithuania on August 13, 2006. He scored 10 points, had 2 steals, and shot 80% {{from the field}} in a US win. After the game, Hinrich was asked about starting the game. He responded, [...] "We're playing in groups right <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> when I get my time, I just {{try to make the}} best of it, make sure our team is successful. It's one of those deals when you play in groups in spurts like that, it's a little bit tougher. But, you don't hold back and give it everything you got because you know you'll be rested a lot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the match, Willard {{was quoted}} as saying, [...] "Dempsey is a {{remarkable}} hitter. It {{was the first time}} that I had ever been knocked off my feet. I have sent many birds home in the same bruised condition that I am in, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how they felt. I sincerely wish Dempsey all the luck possible and hope that he garnishes all the riches that comes with the championship. I have had my fling with the title. I was champion for four years and I assure you that they'll never have to give a benefit for me. I have invested the money I have made". [...] Willard later claimed to have been defeated by [...] "gangsterism".|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{a mystery}} in this,--a mystery that I cannot fathom," [...] he said. [...] "And <b>now</b> <b>I</b> would <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what {{measures}} it would be proper to take." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; but, after all, that's {{no great}} admission. You see, {{with most of}} us what we call courage is largely the result of experience. <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was a match for Sergeant's tough. The man is big, but he has only a hazy notion when to lead off and how to parry." ...|$|R
6000|$|But I {{was called}} from earth--yea, called [...] Before my rose-bush grew; [...] And would that <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> What feels he {{of the tree}} I planted, [...] And whether, after I was called [...] To be a ghost, he, as of old, [...] Gave me his heart anew! ...|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, a Midrash {{interpreted}} [...] where Moses told Aaron, [...] "This is {{what the}} Lord meant when He said: ‘Through those near to Me I show Myself holy, and gain glory before all the people.'" [...] The Midrash taught that God told this to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, when in [...] God said, [...] "there I will meet with the children of Israel; and the Tabernacle shall be sanctified by My glory." [...] And {{after the death of}} Nadab and Abihu, Moses said to Aaron, [...] "At the time that God told me, I thought that either you or I would be stricken, but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that they [...] are greater than you or me." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{worker at}} DC Central Kitchen saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard {{his desire to}} show he was sorry. She thought that the [...] "Kitchen" [...] {{would be a good}} place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and {{cleaning}} bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: [...] "It's {{the kind of place where}} you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s, the Beatles were officially derided in the USSR as the [...] "belch of Western culture" [...] {{and in the}} 1980s McCartney was refused {{permission}} to play there. According to The Moscow Times, when McCartney finally got to play the song at his Back in the World tour in Moscow's Red Square in May 2003 {{at the age of}} 60, [...] "the crowd went wild". When asked about the song before the concert McCartney said he had known little about the Soviet Union when he wrote it. [...] "It was a mystical land then," [...] he said. [...] "It's nice to see the reality. I always suspected that people had big hearts. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that's true." [...] "Finally we got to do that one here," [...] he said after the song.|$|E
60|$|Two {{months have}} passed since that period; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> no more about him <b>now</b> than <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> then.|$|R
60|$|On this {{occasion}} I had no misgivings. On the former visit I {{had for a}} moment been overwhelmed at the unexpected sight {{of the body of}} the woman I thought <b>I</b> loved--I <b>knew</b> it now--lying in her tomb. But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> all, and it was to see this woman, though in her tomb, that I came.|$|R
60|$|One day in {{the spring}} I came to the terrace which overlooks the plain, and as I sat down to warm myself in the sunshine, gazing at the broad country which <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> so well, and the distant hills, the wish came to me to write the history of my life.|$|R
