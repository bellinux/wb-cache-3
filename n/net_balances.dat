50|$|Twice a year, the Office of Management and Budget {{delivers}} {{an economic}} {{assessment of the}} unemployment insurance program {{as it relates to}} budgetary issues. As it relates to the FY 2012 budget, the OMB reports that the insured unemployment rate (IUR) is projected to average 3.6% in both FY 2011 and in FY 2012. State unemployment regular benefit outlays are estimated at $61 billion in FY 2011 and $64.3 billion in FY 2012, down somewhat from Midsession estimates. Outlays from state trust fund accounts are projected to exceed revenues and interest income by $16.0 billion in FY 2011 and $15.1 billion in FY 2012. State trust fund account balances, net of loans, are projected to continue to fall, from -$27.4 billion at the end of FY 2010 to -$62.7 billion at the end of FY 2013, before starting to grow again. <b>Net</b> <b>balances</b> are not projected to become positive again until well beyond FY 2016. Up to 40 states are projected to continue borrowing heavily from the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) over the next few years. The aggregate loan balance is projected to increase from $40.2 billion at the end of FY 2010 to a peak end-of-year balance of $68.3 billion in FY 2013. Due to the high volume of state loans and increased EB payments, FUA and EUCA are projected to borrow $26.7 billion from the general fund in FY 2011 and an additional $19.4 billion in FY 2012, with neither account projected to return to a net positive balance before 2016. The general fund advances must be repaid with interest.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY European Union budget {{negotiations}} often {{focus on}} member states ' financial <b>net</b> <b>balances,</b> {{rather than on}} spending with EU-level added value. But net positions are an unreliable guide to sound EU policy. Changing the budget process is a precondition for any significant reform; the stubborn link between <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> and spending decisions will not be broken until the decision-making procedure changes. This will {{improve the quality of}} EU budget spending. POLICY CHALLENGE Net balance debates are a political reality, so the question is how to deal with <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> in the least damaging way possible for spending efficien-cy. Our proposal provides a practical solution to the present fixation on <b>net</b> <b>balances,</b> while taking account of members states ’ constraints. The propos-al has two main features: i) the separation of EU public goods and redistrib-utive expenditures in the EU budget, with public goods defined unanimously – and upfront – by the EU Council and financed according to GNI shares; ii) negotiation of <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> to determine redistributive expenditures. While not immediately leading to large compositional changes in the EU budget, our proposal makes explicit the trade-offs between spending on EU public goods and re-distribution. By increasing transparency, it would cre-ate the right political environment and incen-tives to move towards more EU public goods. N...|$|E

40|$|Lacustrine {{groundwater}} discharge (LGD) {{can play a}} major role in water and nutrient balances of lakes. Unfortunately, studies often neglect this input path due to methodological difficulties in the determination. In a previous study we described a method which allows the estimation of LGD and groundwater recharge using hydraulic head data and groundwater <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> based on meteorological data. The aim of this study is to compare these results with discharge rates estimated by inverse modelling of heat transport using temperature profiles measured in lake bed sediments. We were able to show a correlation between the fluxes obtained with the different methods, although the time scales of the methods differ substantially. As a consequence, we conclude that the use of hydraulic head data and meteorologically-based groundwater <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> to estimate LGD is limited to time scales similar to the calibration period...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{more than}} 40 year record of net and {{seasonal}} mass-balance records from measure-ments {{made by the}} United States Geological Survey on South Cascade Glacier, Washington, and Wolverine and Gulkana Glaciers, Alaska, shows annual and interannual fluctuations that reflect changes in the controlling climatic conditions at regional and global scales. As the mass-balance record grows in length, it is revealing significant changes in previously described glacier mass-balance behavior, and both inter-glacier and glacier–climate relationships. South Cascade and Wolverine Glaciers are strongly affected by the warm and wet maritime climate of the northeast Pacific Ocean. Their <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> have generally been controlled by winter accumulation, with fluctuations that are strongly related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Recently, warm dry summers have begun to dominate the net balance of the two maritime glaciers, with a weakening of {{the correlation between the}} winter balance fluctuations and the PDO. Non-synchronous periods of positive and negative net balance for each glacier prior to 1989 were followed by a 1989 – 2004 period of synchronous and almost exclusively negative <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> that averaged – 0. 8 m for the three glaciers...|$|E

Objective:We examined the effect of consuming isonitrogenous, isoenergetic, and macronutrient-matched soy or milk beverages (18 g protein, 750 kJ) on protein kinetics and <b>net</b> muscle protein <b>balance</b> after resistance exercise in healthy young men. Our hypothesis was that soy ingestion would result in larger but transient hyperaminoacidemia compared with milk and that milk would promote a greater <b>net</b> <b>balance</b> because of lower but prolonged hyperaminoacidemia.

40|$|Canadian lynx and snowshoe hare {{interact}} in a predator-prey relationship in which lynx abundance is more strongly dependent upon hare abundance than vice versa. A four-compartment stochastic compartmental model is specified that represents <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> of live individuals in each population, together with cumulative, nondecreasing balances of dead individuals of both populations. Reproduction is modeled as time-variant Poisson arrival processes. Residence times in live compartments, equivalent to ages of individuals, are modeled as conditional distributions, dependent upon abundances {{of the other}} population in each case. Models of residence-time distributions are hypothesized for each population and fitted to available data on abundance in live compartments over an 85 -year period. Multiple regression techniques are used to fit the models, from which conditional distributions of population abundances in live compartments are used to compute numerical estimates of <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> from year 1850 to year 1935 and beyond.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The <b>net</b> mass <b>balance</b> {{fluctuations}} of Arctic and Sub-Arctic glaciers, {{north of}} 47. 5 ° North latitude, are described over a 45 -year period from 1957 to 2002 using two parameters {{derived from a}} gridded climatology reanalysis. Variability among 185 measured glaciers was represented according to two main components. The first component represents the temporal variability of the <b>net</b> <b>balance</b> series derived from a statistically defined geographic region. The second component represents the glacier-specific variability in the <b>net</b> <b>balance</b> series (the amplitude of variability). Each component was numerically derived using gridded monthly mean temperature and precipitation data at a 2. 5 ° spatial resolution. These two main components of the <b>net</b> <b>balance</b> series can be determined from simple glacier location data. The temporal variability component was determined using patterns of warm season temperature that were then used to define the statistically correlated regions. The glacier-specific component was approximated along continuum of continentality. Continentality {{was based on the}} relative ratio of warm to cool season temperature at the glacier location, which was then normalized and differenced using precipitation magnitude. Ultimately 21 distinct geographic regions containing at least one representative glacier were defined for the first, temporal component. In data-rich regions, such as the Alps and Scandinavia, spatial variability was identified on a finer scale than individual mountain ranges. The temporal evolution of measured <b>net</b> <b>balance</b> series within each region were more closely related to each other than measured mass balance on the scale of mountain ranges. This temporal signal can be considered the most likely temporal signal that would be characteristic of unmeasured glaciers within the spatial extent of the region. This spatial extent defined for each region is specific, and based on similarities in physical climatology as opposed to more vaguely defined regions based on mountain ranges or other geographic features. The, second, glacier specific component of the series was related to <b>net</b> <b>balance</b> standard deviations (58...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} to characterise the (optimal) demand for cash balances in deregulated markets. After the model of James Tobin, 1958, <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> are determined in order to maximise the expected return of a certain portfolio combining risk and capital.

Within this setting, the monetary equilibrium determines the rate at which a unit of capital is exchange by a unit of exposure to risk, or equivalently, it determines the market price of risk.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with malignancies of the upper GI tract {{are at increased risk}} for malnutrition and perioperative death and complications. Standard nutritional support has not significantly altered outcome. Growth hormone (GH) and insulin have been shown to have some benefit in patients with cancer; however, their action in patients undergoing resection has not previously been studied. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing surgery for upper GI tract malignancies were prospectively randomized into one of three nutritional support groups after surgery: 10 patients received standard TPN, 10 received TPN plus daily injections of GH, and 10 received daily GH, systemic insulin, and TPN. The patients underwent a protein kinetic radiotracer study on the fifth day after surgery to determine whole body and skeletal muscle protein kinetics. RESULTS: Patients who received standard TPN only were in a state of negative skeletal muscle protein <b>net</b> <b>balance.</b> Those who received GH and insulin had improved skeletal muscle protein <b>net</b> <b>balance</b> compared with the TPN only group. Whole body protein <b>net</b> <b>balance</b> was improved in the GH and the GH and insulin groups compared with the TPN only group. GH and insulin combined did not improve whole body <b>net</b> <b>balance</b> more than GH alone. GH administration significantly increased serum IGF- 1 and GH levels.
