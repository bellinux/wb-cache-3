25|$|In 2001, {{when the}} Changi Airport Line was opened, {{some of these}} trains plying the East West Line had luggage racks {{installed}}. These luggage racks were installed in every carriage of the train, taking up the space of two seats <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{at the end of}} each carriage. The purpose of those racks were to let travellers heading to the airport, who usually carry a large amount of luggage, to have a space to place their bags easily.|$|E
25|$|Passenger safety {{instructions}} are inside train carriages above {{the doors and}} stations at ticket hall and platforms. These instructions direct passengers to use emergency phones and also include an emergency phone number to traffic center. There is emergency-stop handles at platforms, which are used to stop the train either arriving or departing in cases such as person trapped between doors, or person fallen onto track. There are emergency brake handles inside the carriage <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and {{at both ends of}} carriage.|$|E
25|$|Anne Neville died on 16 March 1485, {{probably}} of tuberculosis, at Westminster. The day she died, {{there was}} an eclipse, which some took to be an omen of her husband's fall from heavenly grace. She was buried in Westminster Abbey in an unmarked grave {{to the right of}} the High Altar, <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the Confessor's Chapel. Richard III is said to have wept at her funeral. Nevertheless, rumours circulated that Richard III had poisoned her in order to marry his niece Elizabeth of York.|$|E

50|$|A pair {{of doors}} were finally {{opened at the}} far right of the main entrance. As concert goers entered the stadium through <b>the</b> two open <b>doors,</b> those waiting {{in front of all}} of <b>the</b> other <b>doors</b> began pushing forward. After a short period of waiting and then {{knocking}} on <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and <b>the</b> glass <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>the</b> crowd realized that none of <b>the</b> remaining <b>doors</b> would be opened. The entire crowd then surged and pushed toward <b>the</b> two <b>doors</b> which had been opened. This caused many people to get trampled while some suffered more serious injuries. Eleven people were unable <b>to</b> escape <b>the</b> crowd pushing toward them and died by asphyxiation. Twenty-six other people reported injuries.|$|R
25|$|Late Night was a {{production}} of Lorne Michaels' Broadway Video (and, since 2003, O'Brien's Conaco). It was taped in Studio 6A in the GE Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. <b>Next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> were framed pictures of Letterman, Carson, Jack Paar and Steve Allen, each of whose groundbreaking late-night shows originated from studio 6A or 6B (where The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon is currently taped). The studio holds just over 200 audience members. It was taped at about 5:30pm as an uninterrupted hour-long program, with the band playing music through the portions that would be filled by commercials. Generally, shows were taped at 5:30pm Monday through Friday, although {{for much of the}} show's run, reruns would be aired on Mondays and the show would not tape that day.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. In regards to the video's concept, Swift stated, [...] "It deals with the haunting power of music and how hearing a song {{years after it was}} first popular can have such an emotional appeal." [...] Clayton Collins portrayed Swift's love interest in the music video. He was cast because of his physical resemblance to the real subject of the song, in that they were both tall with dark hair. The video begins with Swift, dressed by a white sundress, as she lies on the grass of a lake-bed and holds a transistor radio. Suddenly, the setting is switched to Collins as he drives a white and orange 1970 Chevrolet CST-10. He then turns his radio on and ceases driving, coming to a complete stop on a road. As Collins facial expressions become more serious, he flashbacks to memories with Swift. Swift and Collins are seen frolicking in a field, lying beside another on the back of Collins' CST-10, staring at the stars together, holding hands as they walk, and slow dancing. When the song is in its final chorus, Collins arrives at a wooden cabin in his pick-up truck. He runs up the staircase to discover an enveloped letter <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He then sits on the staircase, opens the envelope, and reads the letter. The video transcends towards Swift playing an acoustic guitar as she leans against the wooden cabin. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the lake-bed and performing with a guitar next to the wooden cabin. The video concludes with Swift, once again, lying on the initial setting.|$|E

The ride up was difficult, but the ride down could be precarious. The cable often got snarled and had to be unsnarled by hand.|$|R

2500|$|Investigations {{concluded}} the trams {{were not in}} line with UK safety standards (in fact they would suffer more damage than a UK car {{in the event of}} accident) due to their height and width. Additionally other problems were found including the drivers seat being {{on the opposite side of}} the road (UK roads drive from the left), Conversion to remove ticket sales (Tickets are sold from the stops before boarding). LRT system requirements dictate the separation of the driver from direct passenger contact for road safety reasons. As the driver was <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> (in order to receive fares), this wasn't possible.|$|E

Most meals are provided in this manner, which the hermit then eats in the solitude of his cell. There are two meals provided for much of the year: lunch and supper. During seasons or days of fasting, just one meal is provided. The hermit makes his needs known to the lay brother by means of a note, requesting items such as a fresh loaf of bread, which will be kept in the cell for eating with several meals. Carthusians observe a perpetual abstinence from meat.|$|E
2500|$|The front (west) façade {{has a wide}} {{porch with}} heavy lava stone walls {{surrounding}} the porch area. [...] The porch is covered by {{an extension of the}} main hip roof.

2500|$|Harris {{walked toward}} the bookcases {{between the west and}} center section of tables in the library. He jumped on one and shook it, then shot in an unknown {{direction}} within that general area. Klebold walked through the main area, past the first set of bookcases, the central desk area and a second set of bookcases into the east area. Harris walked from the bookcase he had shot from, past the central area to meet Klebold. The latter shot at a display case located <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> then turned and shot toward the closest table, hitting and injuring 17-year-old Mark Kintgen in the head and shoulder. He then turned toward the table to his left and fired, injuring 18-year-olds Lisa Kreutz and Valeen Schnurr with the same shotgun blast. Klebold then moved toward the same table and fired with the TEC-9, killing 18-year-old Lauren Townsend. At this point, the seriously injured Valeen Schnurr began screaming, [...] "Oh my God, oh my God!" [...] In response, Klebold asked Schnurr if she believed in the existence of God; when Schnurr replied she did, Klebold simply asked [...] "Why?" [...] before walking from the table.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> EMUs have <b>doors</b> on {{both sides}} of the train and {{therefore}} can easily be used in either direction. Even though the SKM line has stops with high platforms, the units can be used on low platform stations as well. The most common livery for SKM electric multiple units is yellow and blue. The exception are units with advertising labels, which are coloured according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> advertiser's wishes.

50|$|The covered vans of the Kassel {{class were}} based on the DSV's A2 wagon, the most {{striking}} differences being the use of a barrel roof instead of a flat roof and the brakeman's cab being located at floor level directly on the undercarriage rather than being elevated. The wagon body was stabilised by a diagonal reinforcing brace in the sections of wall <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> In order <b>to</b> be able <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> undercarriage of the Om wagon (see below), the wagon body was shortened by 200 mm, so that the loading length was now only 7,720 mm.|$|R
25|$|In Mexico, the T250 sedan {{went on sale}} as a 2009 model, {{replacing}} the Opel-based Chevrolet Corsa and GM Daewoo-built Pontiac G3, after the GM announcement of discontinuing the Pontiac brand following the 2009 model year in Mexico and the 2010 model year elsewhere. It is produced in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. From the May 2010 model year, <b>the</b> GM badges <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were removed. From the 2012 model year, the Aveo underwent a facelift, receiving a similar front-end with {{the one of the}} hatchback. It is no longer sold in the United States and Canada.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two major}} {{characteristics}} that distinguish the 1000-series from the later series cars. On their sides, the cars had two mylar curtain rollsigns, one above a window <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> on each end (while the other car classes have a single flip-dot or LED sign above a window <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> center <b>doors).</b> Second, <b>the</b> bulkheads on {{each end of the}} 1000-series cars feature windows that extend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the bulkhead frame, whereas other car classes' bulkhead windows only extend slightly higher than the side windows. A rehabilitation of the cars in 1993 converted one rollsign on each side into an exterior loudspeaker, while the other rollsign, as well as the bulkhead signs, were converted to flip-dot displays, replacing the original rollsigns entirely. The cars also received General Electric AC propulsion (same as that of the AnsaldoBreda A650 railcar used on LA Metro), replacing the original Westinghouse cam control DC propulsion systems, making them the first cars on <b>the</b> system <b>to</b> use such propulsion systems.|$|R
