40|$|ABSTRACT: The broader {{analysis}} {{of greenhouse gases}} such as CO 2, and of other, <b>non-greenhouse</b> <b>gases,</b> such as SO 2 and NOx is already very high on the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) agenda. Various analyses of {{many aspects of the}} problem have been and are being carried out and a spectrum of measures are being contemplated. The authors have developed a web-based tool that is freely available online for calculating the exhaust gas emissions (CO 2, SO 2 and NOx) of specific types of ships under a variety of operational scenarios. It can be used for example by ship owners who need to know both the amount of emissions that their ships produce, and, indirectly, the bunker consumption, in order to choose between alternative scenarios that are both economic and more environmental friendly. In this paper, the algorithm that is behind the web tool as well as the practical importance of this tool are presented. Actual scenarios based on data provided by shipping companies are used and possible ways to incorporate the webtool into actual decision-making are analyzed...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} {{some of the}} basic energy balance and climate change impact issues {{associated}} with biofuels. For both the basic energy and greenhouse gas balances of producing and using a range of fuels, and for the increasingly debated and important issues of <b>non-greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> impacts such as a land, fertilizer and water use, we conclude that an improved framework for the analysis and evaluation of biofuels is needed. These new methodologies and data sets are needed on both physical and socioeconomic aspects of life-cycle of biofuels. We detail some of components {{that could be used to}} build this methodology and highlight key areas for future research. We look history and potential impacts of building the resource base for biofuel research, as well as at some of the land-use and socioeconomic impacts of different feedstock-to-fuel pathways. ...|$|E
40|$|Options for {{mitigation}} of enteric methane {{and other}} greenhouse gases from ruminant livestock systems are constrained by regional {{characteristics of the}} systems. In both developing and developed countries there are various <b>non-greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> issues that {{also need to be}} considered when identifying effective and sustainable options for greenhouse gas mitigation, for example regional human food security and the need for poverty alleviation of farmers in developing countries. On a global basis, major cattle populations are located in grassland and mixed crop-livestock systems in developing countries. Successful global mitigation of enteric methane emissions from ruminant livestock systems can only be achieved if significant mitigation from these developing country systems is also achieved. Dramatic reductions in enteric methane gas production can be demonstrated in biological simulations on an individual animal basis. What is required, however, is that mitigation options need to be evaluated {{in the context of the}} livestock system before being promoted for adoption, because th...|$|E
40|$|The Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) are a set {{of climate}} change {{policies}} and actions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). NAMAs, designed with a bottom-up approach through national processes, focus on active involvement of developing countries in climate change mitigation actions. One term, “transformational impact,” has been widely used as a key concept or metric of the NAMAs. However, this concept does not have one internationally agreed-upon definition, thus creating barriers especially for the NAMA funding process. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} examine how “transformational impact” is defined and to understand commonalities and variations in this definition across different organizations involved in the NAMA process. As a part of the Masters Project, interviews were conducted with people from 12 different organizations and the interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed. The analysis suggests that interviewees believe that the NAMAs’ transformational impact should go beyond a project-centric approach to mitigation actions to include <b>non-greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> benefits, such as broad national government projects. Each organization emphasized different themes in the interviews. The international organizations and institutions mainly focused on national ownership of the NAMAs, whereas funding agencies stressed the actual projects of developing countries. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the NAMAs should create a platform to facilitate communication about the NAMA process among different organizations...|$|E
40|$|Decadal climate {{predictions}} exhibit large biases, {{which are}} often subtracted and forgotten. However, understanding the causes of bias is essential to guide efforts to improve prediction systems, and may offer additional benefits. Here the origins of biases in decadal predictions are investigated, including whether analysis of these biases might provide useful information. The focus is especially on the lead-time-dependent bias tendency. A “toy” model of a prediction system is initially developed and used {{to show that there}} are several distinct contributions to bias tendency. Contributions from sampling of internal variability and a start-time-dependent forcing bias can be estimated and removed to obtain a much improved estimate of the true bias tendency, which can provide information about errors in the underlying model and/or errors in the specification of forcings. It is argued that the true bias tendency, not the total bias tendency, should be used to adjust decadal forecasts. The methods developed are applied to decadal hindcasts of global mean temperature made using the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM 3), climate model, and it is found that this model exhibits a small positive bias tendency in the ensemble mean. When considering different model versions, it is shown that the true bias tendency is very highly correlated with both the transient climate response (TCR) and <b>non–greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> forcing trends, and can therefore be used to obtain observationally constrained estimates of these relevant physical quantities...|$|E
