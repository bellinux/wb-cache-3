5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|Alan Rushton {{adds that}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{household}} {{of the newly}} married Duchess of Kent, including Conroy, {{is known to have}} had haemophilia, and that her probable awareness of the scandals surrounding the behaviour of Caroline of Brunswick and Caroline Matilda of Great Britain would have deterred her from seeking an affair elsewhere. Furthermore, Princess Victoria was said to have borne a strong family resemblance to her father and grandfather George III.|$|E
5|$|For the XI Corps, {{it was a}} sad {{reminder}} of their retreat at Chancellorsville in May. Under heavy pursuit by Hays and Avery, they clogged the streets of the town; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corps had planned routes for this contingency. Hand-to-hand fighting broke out in various places. Parts of the corps conducted an organized fighting retreat, such as Coster's stand in the brickyard. The private citizens of Gettysburg panicked amidst the turmoil, and artillery shells bursting overhead and fleeing refugees added to the congestion. Some soldiers sought to avoid capture by hiding in basements and in fenced backyards. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig was one such person who climbed a fence and hid behind a woodpile in the kitchen garden of the Garlach family {{for the rest of the}} three-day battle. The only advantage that the XI Corps soldiers had was that they were familiar with the route to Cemetery Hill, having passed through that way in the morning; many in the I Corps, including senior officers, did not know where the cemetery was.|$|E

5|$|The crowd roared in {{approval}} and Arab audiences were electrified. The assassination attempt backfired, quickly playing into Nasser's hands. Upon returning to Cairo, he ordered {{one of the}} largest political crackdowns in the modern history of Egypt, with the arrests of thousands of dissenters, mostly members of the Brotherhood, but also communists, and the dismissal of 140 officers loyal to Naguib. Eight Brotherhood leaders were sentenced to death, although the sentence of its chief ideologue, Sayyid Qutb, was commuted to a 15-year imprisonment. Naguib was removed from the presidency and put under house arrest, but was never tried or sentenced, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> army rose to defend him. With his rivals neutralized, Nasser became the undisputed leader of Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Tony Kanal {{went to one}} of the band's early {{shows and}} soon joined the band as its bassist. After {{initially}} rejecting her advances, he began dating Gwen, but they kept their relationship secret for a year, feeling that it was an unspoken rule that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band dates her. Paul Caseley (trombone) also joined the band in 1987. Eric Carpenter (saxophone) joined the horn section soon after.|$|E
25|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{collective}} was {{experienced with}} explosives. Terry Robbins and Cathy Wilkerson lacked knowledge {{even in the}} basics of electricity.

They inserted dynamite into a one-foot length of water pipe packed with nails. Precisely what went wrong remains uncertain, but the resulting series of blasts in the sub-basement of the townhouse killed those near the bomb and caused {{the collapse of the}} townhouse.|$|E

25|$|In 1652, the Court at the Colony of Connecticut {{ordered that}} no Indian could walk near an Englishman's house either in town or at his farm on the Sabbath without being fined or imprisoned.

25|$|In 1788, the British Committee for the Abolition of Slavery sent a Swedish {{opponent}} of the slave trade, Anders Sparrman, to Gustav III. The committee feared that other nations would expand their trade if Britain stopped its own. They sent books about the issue and a letter, in which the king was encouraged to hinder his subjects {{to participate in this}} disgraceful trade. In the response letter, delivered through Sparrman, he wrote that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country had participated in the slave trade and that he would do all that he could to keep them from doing so.|$|E
25|$|The open valve in the {{ventilation}} system allowed the huge blast wave {{and possibly the}} fire and toxic smoke to enter the second and perhaps {{the third and fourth}} compartments as well. All of the 36 men in the command post located in the second compartment were immediately incapacitated by the blast wave and likely killed. One sailor's body was found embedded in the ceiling of the second compartment. Although the sub was at periscope depth with her radio antennas extended, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> command post was able to send a distress signal or press a single button that would initiate an emergency ballast tank blow and bring the submarine to the surface.|$|E

25|$|The Libyan Arab Jamhairiya {{rejected}} {{the allegations against}} the country. They pointed to how their country is founded on direct people's democracy that guaranteed direct exercise of authority by all citizens through the people's congresses. Citizens were able to express opinions of the congresses on issues related to political, economic, social, and cultural issues. In addition, there were information platforms such as newspapers and TV channels for people to express their opinions through. Libyan authorities also argued that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Libyan Arab Jamahiriya suffered from extreme poverty and hunger, {{and that the government}} guaranteed a minimum of food and essential needs to people with low incomes. In 2006, an initiative was adopted for providing people with low incomes investment potfolios amounting to $30,000 to be deposited with banks and companies.|$|E
25|$|The ballet {{became famous}} for Nijinsky's leap {{through one of}} the two large windows {{at the back of the}} stage. The height of the leap was an {{illusion}} though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through the window on the sixth step. The skirting board (base board) under the window was very low, giving the illusion that the leap was higher than it actually was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience saw Nijinsky land. It looked like he would soar on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the orchestra pit who held the penultimate chord. In doing so, the leap was given a sense of great length and height.|$|E

25|$|The group put {{themselves}} through challenges that {{forced them to}} find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold. For example, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group was permitted {{to be late for}} training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing. During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out {{in order to make a}} jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.|$|E
25|$|The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya's {{delegation}} to the United Nations issued a report about human rights in Libya.

25|$|When Sergeyev died in Nice, France on 23 June 1951 the notations {{passed on}} {{for a brief time}} to a Russian {{associate}} of his, from whom Mona Inglesby purchased them, continuing to stage his productions with International Ballet until its closure in 1953. Inglesby, through the London theatrical dealer Ifan Kyrle Fletcher, sold the Petipa Swan Lake notation to Harvard University in 1967, followed {{by the rest of the}} notations in 1969, for a sum claimed to be around £6,000. Today the collection is known officially as the Nikolai Sergeev Dance Notations and Music Scores for Ballets, though it is commonly referred to simply as The Sergeyev Collection. For some time the notations were useless, as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world had any knowledge of how to read Stepanov's method.
