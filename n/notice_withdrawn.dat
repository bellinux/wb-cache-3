50|$|Through Municipal clerk Ganpat, Jai stumbles {{upon the}} secret that pop star Sarena {{is not the}} real {{daughter}} of industrialist Vivek Devan, who had taken great pains {{to ensure that no}} one knew she was adopted. Jai realizes that this could be the story he was looking for and goes ahead and publishes it, thus incurring the wrath of Vivek Devan. Even the tabloid owner Dada (Rajpal Yadav) is upset with Jai and disapproves his idea of unraveling the truth. An enraged Vivek Devan takes legal action against the tabloid by sending defamation notice for Rupees five crores and he also tries to suppress any further information being leaked. Sarena, however, notices her father's anxiety and confronts him, only to discover that Jai, despite his crude ways of going about it, had written the truth. Ignoring her father's protests, Sarena goes in search of her real mother. At every stage, her companion in her mission is Jai, who follows her through the journey from Mumbai to Ooty to get the legal <b>notice</b> <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|E
50|$|Evans {{had given}} advice to local {{authorities}} {{on the safety}} requirements of a mobile crane and other equipment used by Harris in connection with their bungee jump business {{which led to the}} local authorities either banning Harris from offering bungee jump services or serving prohibition notices under the 1974 Act. When the Secretary of State revealed that Evans' advice had not been in keeping with HSE policy, the ban was lifted and the <b>notices</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> The issue was whether Evans, as an HSE officer, in advising local authorities on the safety of equipment used for a bungee jumping business, had a duty of care to Harris to avoid causing economic loss.|$|R
50|$|In February 2016 the Eastern Michigan University Board of Regents {{submitted}} <b>notice</b> to <b>withdrawn</b> {{from the}} Achievement Authority in June 2017. Following the notice Michigan Senate leaders announced {{they would be}} working to dismantle the EAA {{as part of a}} Detroit Public Schools support package.|$|R
5000|$|On September 30, 2010, an Interpol red notice - one of Interpol’s {{tools for}} {{tracking}} international fugitives - was issued. The notice said that Palazzolo is [...] "devoted to international drug trafficking" [...] {{and that he}} helped other Mafia representatives abscond abroad. Palazzolo’s local attorney, Norman Snitcher, reacted with a letter to Interpol asking that the red <b>notice</b> be <b>withdrawn</b> as it did not accurately reflect details about his client.|$|R
50|$|He {{singularly}} dissented in a 13 to 1 {{verdict of}} the Supreme Court, holding that judges {{of the superior}} judiciary should not be condemned unheard; {{that they should not}} be proceeded against for contempt; that such <b>notices</b> issued be <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It is nonsense," [...] murmured the Oldest Inhabitant, who, {{as a man}} of the past, felt jealous {{that all}} <b>notice</b> should be <b>withdrawn</b> from himself to be lavished on the future, [...] "sheer nonsense, to waste so much thought on what only is to be." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2. In 1997, Housing Board of Madhya Pradesh {{served a}} legal notice of {{defamation}} for his satirical article [...] "Ishmashan aur Housing Board ka Makaan" [...] published on 17 June 1997 {{in the section}} [...] "Kante ki Baat" [...] in the national daily Navbharat Times. The <b>notice</b> was later <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>notice</b> was <b>withdrawn</b> soon. Due to {{an uproar}} {{in the number}} of people protesting against {{shutting}} down Lamakaan and the signing of around 3,000 people on the online petitioning site change.org demanding the withdrawal of the notice, the attention of IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao was drawn. The issue was resolved after GHMC Deputy Commissioner P. Mahender spoke with the owner of the place. The notice did not specify what was the cause of the nuisance but instead talked about the place running without a license. It was decided that the parking space of Jalagam Vengalarao Park would be used for four-wheeler parking.|$|R
50|$|Michael Martin Plunkett {{is a child}} genius {{who comes}} from a broken home: His father is a hustler and his mother is an {{alcoholic}} and drug addict who engages {{in a series of}} one-night stands. After his parents divorce, Plunkett takes solace in a series of disturbing fantasies in which he re-assembles his classmates' body parts. The fantasies lead Plunkett to becoming a peeping Tom, and from the time he is seven until he turns eleven, he spends all of his free time spying on his neighbors and observing people having intercourse. Before he can graduate junior high, Plunkett's teachers, having <b>noticed</b> his <b>withdrawn</b> nature in class, send him to the school psychologist, who identifies Plunkett as disturbed but nonetheless passes him to high school after Plunkett emotionally manipulates him into a fit of rage.|$|R
5000|$|Joe {{once had}} a serious {{relationship}} with Beth (Janet Montgomery), and while he believes they were good together and mostly happy, their main problem was Joe's tendency to act foolishly while drunk. One evening, while having dinner with their friends Tim and Gita, Joe <b>notices</b> Beth is <b>withdrawn</b> {{and seems to be}} in a bad mood. Later, while emptying the rubbish, Joe finds a positive pregnancy test and is overjoyed to be a prospective father. Beth reveals she does not want the baby and is getting an abortion. Joe, who is still drunk, is heartbroken, and remembering she drank throughout dinner he calls her selfish and guilty of trying to harm their unborn child.|$|R
6000|$|But, on the whole, we will remark {{here that}} this {{business}} of Louis looks altogether different now, as seen over Seas and at the distance of forty-four years, than it looked then, in France, and struggling, confused all round one! For indeed it is a most lying thing that same Past Tense always: so beautiful, sad, almost Elysian-sacred, 'in the moonlight of Memory,' it seems; and seems only. For observe: always, one most important element is surreptitiously (we not <b>noticing</b> it) <b>withdrawn</b> from the Past Time: the haggard element of Fear! Not there does Fear dwell, nor Uncertainty, nor Anxiety; but it dwells here; haunting us, tracking us; running like an accursed ground-discord through all the music-tones of our Existence;--making the Tense a mere Present one! Just so is it with this of Louis. Why smite the fallen? asks Magnanimity, out of danger now. He is fallen so low this once-high man; no criminal nor traitor, how far from it; but the unhappiest of Human Solecisms: whom if abstract Justice had to pronounce upon, she might well become concrete Pity, and pronounce only sobs and dismissal! ...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{an initial}} {{response}} by WCR to NR over the incident, NR expressed [...] "concern at the WCR demonstrated controls, communication and commitment" [...] considering them inadequate. Following a further meeting on 30 March 2015 between both parties, {{in an unprecedented}} reaction NR suspended WCR's operator's licence effective from midnight 3 April 2015. Previously operators have been banned from certain routes, {{but this was the}} first total network ban since privatisation. The suspension notice states: Network Rail has had concerns about WCR's performance of its Safety Obligations for some time, and recent events lead Network Rail to believe that the operations of WCR are a threat to the safe operation of the railway. If five of the seven required remedies are completed by May 15, with demonstrable progress towards completion of the other two, the suspension <b>notice</b> will be <b>withdrawn.</b> The required steps include introducing a risk-based driver monitoring regime, and demonstrating that there is an effective and secure system of tamper-evident seals for train protection isolator cocks on all relevant traction.|$|R
5000|$|One day, while {{answering}} phones, Eden {{is taking}} a customer's order when the customer asks how much it'll cost, which Eden knows {{is an indication that}} it is a police sting, but she takes the order anyway and says nothing. Eden and Vaughn take a girl to the house of a man named Mario, and Eden instantly recognizes him as the one who transported her to the warehouse in the trunk of his car. Eden goes to the bathroom and finds a room full of baby beds. She also finds Priscilla, who is heavily pregnant (why she was taken away, as she'd tested positive on one of the daily tests) and blissfully ignorant as to what will actually happen to her baby (he or she will be sold). Vaughn <b>notices</b> Eden being <b>withdrawn</b> on the way back, deduces that she found out what Mario's house is used for and attempts to force Eden to kill a girl in the desert to prove her loyalty, but she is stopped at the last minute by Vaughn.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two ways}} for the {{employee}} to terminate the employment contract - through a proper notice that shall be given within the specified period, and extraordinary notice. In both cases this is a subjective right of the worker. According to Art. 326(2) of the Labour Code, the notice period varies {{depending on whether the}} working contract is permanent and temporary. In case of a permanent contract, the law in Bulgaria provides for a notice period of 30 days, as long as the parties have not previously agreed on a longer period (that shall not exceed 3 months). The minimum notice period for temporary contract termination is 3 months. In accordance with Art. 326(4) of the Labour Code the termination notice may be revoked by the employee simultaneously or prior to its receipt by the employer. Afterwards, a <b>notice</b> may be <b>withdrawn</b> {{by the end of the}} notice period with the consent of the employer (Art. 326(4) LC). It is possible for employees in Bulgaria to terminate the employment contract without notice as well, but only for a particular reason, as provided in Art.327 of the Labour Code. The most significant ground therein is a scenario where the employer is reluctant to pay the employee his due remuneration. Under the applicable labour law provisions even a delay of one day is sufficient for the employee to unilaterally terminate the employment relationship without complying with the usual notice periods.|$|R
6000|$|Dejected and humbled, she {{had even}} some {{thoughts}} of not going with the others to the theatre that night; {{but it must be}} confessed that they were not of long continuance, for she soon recollected, in the first place, that she was without any excuse for staying at home; and, in the second, that it was a play she wanted very much to see. To the theatre accordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her; she feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness for plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the London stage, which she knew, on Isabella's authority, rendered everything else of the kind [...] "quite horrid." [...] She was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure; the comedy so well suspended her care that no one, observing her during the first four acts, would have supposed she had any wretchedness about her. On the beginning of the fifth, however, the sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father, joining a party in the opposite box, recalled her to anxiety and distress. The stage could no longer excite genuine merriment--no longer keep her whole attention. Every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box; and, for the space of two entire scenes, did she thus watch Henry Tilney, without being once able to catch his eye. No longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play; his <b>notice</b> was never <b>withdrawn</b> from the stage during two whole scenes. At length, however, he did look towards her, and he bowed--but such a bow! No smile, no continued observance attended it; his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction. Catherine was restlessly miserable; she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation. Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation--instead of proudly resolving, in conscious innocence, to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it, to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation, and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight, or flirting with somebody else--she took to herself all the shame of misconduct, or at least of its appearance, and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause.|$|R
