40|$|In {{the present}} research, <b>nicotine</b> <b>alkaloid</b> {{production}} by Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) hairy roots and tropane alkaloid production by Hyoscyamus niger hairy roots were investigated. The first {{objective of this}} research was to improve the oxygen mass transfer in hairy root cultures with microbubbles. Oxygen was shown as a critical nutrient for the growth of tobacco and H. niger hairy roots. In a 1 -liter fermentor, microbubble dispersion improved the oxygen mass transfer, tobacco hairy root growth, and nicotine production in the medium. In a novel ground-joint column bioreactor, microbubbles enhanced the oxygen mass transfer and the growth of H. niger hairy roots. The second objective {{of this research was}} to enhance the release of alkaloids from the hairy roots into the culture medium. In a l-liter fermentor, nicotine concentration in medium was improved by adjusting the medium pH to 6. Unlike the <b>nicotine</b> <b>alkaloid,</b> hyoscyamine concentration in medium was not detectable at medium pH 6, whereas hyoscyamine in medium increased to 42 mg l- 1 at medium pH 3. Similar to the hyoscyamine, scopolamine in medium increased from 0. 1 to 11 mg l- 1 when the medium pH was adjusted from 6 to 3. The release of alkaloids into culture medium provides opportunities to isolate a high-value alkaloid directly from the culture fluid, and reduces the cost of product recovery...|$|E

The estimates of heritability, coefficients of variability and genetic advance was calculated in a multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) F 2 segregating populations for 10 traits including nicotine percentage, total soluble sugars and yield contributing traits during 2015 seasons at Northern Light Soils (NLS). The estimates of phenotypic coefficients of variation (PCV) were high and moderate for plant height (18. 16 %), number of leaves (15. 96 %), leaf area index (27. 35 %), internodal length (21. 01 %), stem diameter (16. 73 %), grade index (13. 86 %), nicotine percentage (19. 87 %), total soluble sugars (39. 81 %), chlorides (23. 35 %) and leaf yield (13. 27 %) in MAGIC-F 2 segregating populations at NLS 2015 season. High heritability coupled with high and moderate genetic advance was observed for all the traits studied. Correlation studies revealed that total soluble sugars was positively and significantly correlated with leaf area index, stem diameter, grade index and leaf yield. However total soluble sugars was negatively correlated with nicotine as total <b>nicotine</b> <b>alkaloid</b> and with chlorides percentage.

In this study the effect of a single intraperitoneal injection of either <b>nicotine</b> or an <b>alkaloid</b> extract of the tobacco plant (0. 5 mg/kg) on the efflux of DA were investigated. DA was measured in vivo by intracerebral microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens and the striatum of freely-moving rats.

The extract also evoked a significant increase in DA extracellular levels in both regions (+ 33 and + 38 % above baseline). However, this effect was significantly higher compared to nicotine in the striatum only. In conclusion, the tobacco extract enhanced the neurochemical effect of nicotine alone in the striatum, a response that could underlie the higher propensity of developing addictive-like behavior using <b>nicotine</b> with tobacco <b>alkaloids...</b>|$|R

Plant Physiology Division, Palmerston North, on the effect of varying late season night temperatures on the development of a range of flue-cured tobacco genotypes. The study involved imposing three night temperatures, 10 °C, 15 °C and 20 °C, when the plants came into flower. Ten F 1 genotypes of a five parent diallel cross (no parents, no reciprocals) were grown at each night temperature with three replications per temperature. Fourteen morphological, physical and chemical characters were measured. The effect of late season night temperature was negligible but there was some evidence of genotype environment interaction for some of the characters. The experiment was conducted using single plants as plots and the statistical analysis showed acceptable coefficients of variation for biological studies. The genetic analysis of the diallel showed that general combining ability variance is the most important type of genetic variance in the characters examined. This agrees with the majority of other tobacco diallel studies. As general combining ability variance is largely a measure of additive genetic variance, breeding homozygous lines from a heterozygous base population should be the best approach to follow. Heritability values were of sufficient size for several of the commercially important characters to indicate that improvement through selection was possible. General combining ability and phenotypic simple correlations between pairs of characters were generally in good agreement, demonstrating that phenotypic selection will result in altering the genotypes in the desired direction for the characters in question. The experiment showed a large negative correlation between the two economically important characters, yield and total <b>nicotine</b> <b>alkaloids.</b> This result is in agreement with similar studies carried out by other workers in this field.
