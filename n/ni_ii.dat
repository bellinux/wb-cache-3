40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to prepare {{potentially}} cheaper carbon for the adsorptive removal of Nickle [Ni (II) ] from aqueous solution. The adsorption capacity of the prepared carbon to remove <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> from aqueous solution was determined and adsorption mechanism was investigated. Rice husk carbon was prepared by incineration in a muffle furnace. The incinerated rice husk carbon (IRHC) was characterised in terms of surface area, micropore area, micropore volume, average pore diameter and surface morphology. Adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> by IRHC was examined. The influence of operating parameters, namely, pH, initial concentration and contact time on adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> by IRHC was evaluated. Batch adsorption tests showed that extent of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> adsorption depended on initial concentration, contact time and pH. Equilibrium adsorption was achieved in 120 min, while maximum <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> adsorption occurred at pH 4. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were studied and the equilibrium adsorption data was found to fit well with the Langmuir isotherm model. Langmuir constants Q ° and b were 14. 45 and 0. 10, and Freundlich constants Kf and 1 /n were 4. 0 and 0. 26, respectively.

The spectra were taken at a resolving power of about 1000 with an array grating spectrometer on the 4 m telescope of Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Based on the observed line intensities we have estimated the minimum mass of each ion: M(Co II) = (6. 0 +/- 1. 8) x 10 exp - 5 solar mass; M(Ni I) = (1. 1 +/- 0. 1) x 10 exp - 3 solar mass; and M(Fe II) = (8. 0 +/- 1. 5) x 10 exp - 3 solar mass. From these we infer total masses for cobalt, nickel, and iron in the ejecta. The nickel and iron line profiles are markedly asymmetric. We interpret these as arising from two components, one centered on the stellar rest velocity with an approximately 3250 km/s full width, and the second at about + 1200 km/s with an approximately 1100 km/s full width.

Parameters such as pH, contact time, metal ion concentrations as well as temperature were monitored. The residual concentration of Mn (II), <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> and Cd (II) were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The results revealed that maximum <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> and Cd (II) ion removal occurred at pH of 6 while Mn (II) ion occurred at pH of 7 respectively. Langmuir and Temkin adsorption isotherm were used to describe the equilibrium data. The equilibrium data fitted well to Langmuir isotherm than Temkin isotherm. Thermodynamic investigation showed that standard Gibbs free energy (∆G˚) was positive indicating the feasibility and non-spontaneous of the process. The positive value of standard Enthalpy (∆H˚) implies that the reaction was endothermic and the negative standard Entropy (∆S˚) signifies decrease in the randomness at the solid/solution interface of the adsorbent during the adsorption process. The kinetic study revealed that adsorption of Mn (II), <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> and Cd (II) could be best described by pseudo-second model.
