5|$|Judge Kaul {{issued a}} dissenting opinion in both cases. In these {{opinions}} {{he asserted that}} he continues {{to believe that the}} ICC lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae over the situation in Kenya. His assertion was that the although crimes were committed they were <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nature which constitute crimes against humanity within the jurisdiction of the ICC. This was the third time that Judge Kaul wrote a similar dissent opposing the prosecutions.|$|E
5|$|Males {{appear to}} reach {{maturity}} at around 45–50mm, at between 9 and 12 months, {{and at this}} size begin to develop a grey to brownish yellow wash beneath the chin. This indicates {{the development of a}} vocal sac and thus an ability to commence calling behaviour. Females reach sexual maturity at two years; those smaller than 65mm are not seen in amplexus; this length is not reached until the second season after metamorphosis. The frog is <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> type that only breeds once. Females can shed up to 26% of their weight when spawning, while males have also been seen to lose weight during breeding, because they are eating less. The weight lost during the breeding season is typically regained from January to September.|$|E
5|$|Python uses duck typing and has {{typed objects}} but untyped {{variable}} names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations {{that are not}} well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting {{to make sense of}} them.|$|E

5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do <b>not.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>a</b> group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{then goes}} through a third reading. At this stage, only {{amendments}} <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> material character may {{be made to the}} bill. The minister moving the third reading may also make a speech outlining the changes made to the bill. The bill is then put to the vote. In most cases, a simple majority of Parliament is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} the forest in the Wind River Range is the primary destination for mountain climbers. Nine of the highest 10 peaks in Wyoming are here, and the mountains are primarily of granitic rock with countless cliffs and sheer rock walls. The Cirque of the Towers is particularly popular as it has numerous peaks within a relatively short distance of each other. Two particular climbs on the peaks in the cirque are considered amongst the finest climbing adventures available in the U.S. The Absaroka Range also attracts climbers but <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> technical nature since the rocks are not considered solid enough for good anchoring points. For the tallest peaks in the Wind River Range, the entire summiting effort will take even experienced climbers many days due to the inaccessibility {{of the region and}} complexity of the climbing effort.|$|E

5|$|To {{expand the}} {{connection}} between Terra and Riku, scenes foreshadowing future events involving Riku from Terra's perspective {{were added to the}} game, though Nomura has stated that these scenes are <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> precognitive nature. Nomura expects that in future games, {{the connection between}} both of them would be expanded. Ryōtarō Okiayu was chosen as Terra's Japanese voice actor as the staff wanted one actor similar to Chikao Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor, and Akio Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor while using Terra's body. The staff found Chikao's was a dry sort of voice, Akio's a deep, resonating sort of voice, and liked how Okiayu bore elements from both actors.|$|E
5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
