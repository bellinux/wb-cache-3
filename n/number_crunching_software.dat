40|$|In {{recent years}} much {{interest}} is grown {{about the possibility}} to apply novel software technologies (such as those ones coming from Artificial Intelligence) {{to the field of}} Scientific Calculus. There is an increasing need of such approaches due to the hard requests for integration-cooperation features in modern applications, whose simulation tasks are asked to go far beyond the mere and rigid application of presumed general purpose numerical methods. In this paper we explore the use of Software Agents for Circuit-CAD (CCAD) with uncertainties handling capabilities. In such a field, solving some hard problems, like Tolerance and Sensitivity Analysis (TSA) for strongly non-linear circuits in presence of large parameters' uncertainties, benefits much more from a clever preliminary choice of the best problem-tuned numerical method rather than from a blind <b>number</b> <b>crunching</b> approach. <b>Software</b> Agents seem to meet these constraints while introducing a high degree of flexibility, which enables the implementation of dynamic adaptive resolution schemes for given CCAD tasks. We present an example of use of the proposed architecture utilizing Java to specify agents as active objects. Some applications of the new strategy to TSA circuits-related problems are presented...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{cross-sectional}} study {{to investigate the}} association of Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) score with clinical presentation and expenditure of hospitalized adult trauma patients with femoral fractures. Methods: According to the data retrieved from the Trauma Registry System between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2015, a total of 2086 patients aged ≥ 40 years and hospitalized for treatment of traumatic femoral bone fracture were categorized as high-risk patients (OSTA − 1, n = 638). Two-sided Pearson’s, chi-squared, or Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare categorical data. Unpaired Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to analyze normally and non-normally distributed continuous data, respectively. Propensity-score matching in a 1 : 1 ratio was performed using <b>Number</b> <b>Crunching</b> Statistical <b>Software</b> (NCSS) software (NCSS 10; NCSS Statistical Software, Kaysville, UT, USA), with adjusted covariates including mechanism and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS); injuries were assessed based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), and Injury Severity Score (ISS) {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of OSTA-related grouping on a patient’s outcome. Results: High-risk and medium-risk patients were predominantly female, presented with significantly older age and higher incidences of co-morbidity, and were injured in a fall accident more frequently than low-risk patients. High-risk patients and medium-risk patients had a different pattern of femoral fracture and a significantly lower ISS. Although high-risk and medium-risk patients had significantly shorter lengths hospital of stay (LOS) and less total expenditure than low-risk patients did, similar results were not found in the selected propensity score-matched patients, implying that the difference may be attributed to the associated injury severity of the patients with femoral fracture. However, the charge of surgery is significantly lower in high-risk and medium-risk patients than in low-risk patients, regardless of the total population or the selected propensity score-matched patients. This lower charge of surgery may be attributed to a less aggressive surgery applied for older patients with high or medium risk of osteoporosis. Conclusions: This study of hospitalized trauma patients with femoral fracture according to OSTA risk classification revealed that high-risk and medium-risk patients had significantly higher odds of sustaining injury in a fall accident than low-risk patients; they also present a different pattern of femoral bone fracture as well as a significantly lower ISS, shorter hospital LOS, and less total expenditure. In addition, the significantly lower charge of surgery in high-risk and medium-risk patients than in low-risk patients may be because of the preference of orthopedists for less aggressive surgery in dealing with older patients with osteoporotic femoral bone fracture...|$|R
