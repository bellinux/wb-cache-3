5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{electronic}} {{white noise}} machines became commercially available.

Also, white noise is sometimes used to mask sudden noise in facilities with research animals.|$|E

5|$|The D± signals used by low, full, {{and high}} speed are carried over a twisted pair (typically, unshielded) to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> crosstalk.

40|$|Abstract—Micro {{electromechanical}} sensors (MEMS) play a {{vital role}} along with global positioning devices in navigation of autonomous vehicles. These sensors are low cost,easily available but depict colored <b>noises</b> <b>and</b> unpredictable discontinuities. Conventional filters like Kalman filters and Sigma point filters are not able to cope with nonwhite noises. This research has utilized H ∞ filter in nonlinear frame work both with Kalman filter and Unscented filter for navigation and self alignment of an airborne vehicle. The system is simulated for colored <b>noises</b> <b>and</b> discontinuities and results are compared with not robust nonlinear filters. The results are found 40 %- 70 % more robust against colored <b>noises</b> <b>and</b> discontinuities. Keywords—filtering, integrated navigation, MEMS, nonlinear filtering, self alignmen...|$|R

5|$|ZnO has a {{relatively}} large direct band gap of ~3.3eV at room temperature. Advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic <b>noise,</b> <b>and</b> high-temperature and high-power operation. The bandgap of ZnO can further be tuned to ~3–4eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform <b>noise,</b> <b>and</b> less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E

5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} used {{in many of the}} same {{applications}} as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{declaration}} by the Dean, {{demolition of}} {{the remains of the}} old cathedral began in 1668. Demolition of the Old Cathedral proved unexpectedly difficult as the stonework had been bonded together by molten lead. Wren initially used the then-new technique of using gunpowder to bring down the surviving stone walls. Like many experimental techniques, the use of gunpowder was not easy to control; several workers were killed and nearby residents complained about <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> damage. Eventually, Wren resorted to using a battering ram instead. Building work on the new cathedral began in June 1675.|$|E
