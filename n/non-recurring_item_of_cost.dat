40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{measure the}} effects of changes in {{treatment}} of acute myeloblastic leukaemia that may give better value for money. DESIGN [...] Retrospective analysis of patients' notes to identify <b>items</b> <b>of</b> management <b>costing</b> money; prospective <b>costing</b> <b>of</b> these <b>items.</b> The Medical Research Council acute myeloblastic leukaemia 9 trial was used to identify the amount and distribution <b>of</b> these <b>costs</b> when either one or two courses of induction treatment were required to obtain complete remission. These findings were then extrapolated to four published international controlled trials using similarly intense treatment and in which the number of courses of treatment required for complete remission was stated, to compare British costs for treatment with idarubicin and daunorubicin, both in combination with cytarabine. SETTING [...] Leukaemia unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, London. SUBJECTS [...] Data on 10 patients receiving intensive induction treatment for acute myeloblastic leukaemia were used to identify 160 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> in four broad groups: general (including accommodation), diagnostic, supportive treatment, and cytotoxic chemotherapy. One newly treated patient was prospectively assessed over one month, including a time and motion study, to cost these items; then costs for 268 patients from the MRC trial receiving moderate induction chemotherapy including daunorubicin were assessed, and <b>costs</b> for treatment <b>of</b> 522 patients in the four international studies comparing daunorubicin with idarubicin were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Cost effectiveness was measured as the overall cost to obtain complete remission in untreated patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia after treatment with idarubicin or daunorubicin. RESULTS [...] The 160 costed items were measured for their sensitivity in varying the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> treatment, this being assessed within Britain in other district general and private hospitals to measure the extremes <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> these <b>items.</b> Overall, idarubicin, although more expensive, showed a substantial saving (1477 pounds per patient) in total hospital costs, more than offsetting the increased <b>cost</b> (607 pounds) <b>of</b> the new treatment, an overall savings of 870 pounds per patient (5 %). CONCLUSION [...] Approaches modelling cost effectiveness may be {{an essential part of}} planning new programmes of treatment in the future. This method can be used to estimate the <b>cost</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> the treatments in different environments and countries where costs may vary widely...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether UK companies engage in classification shifting {{in the post}} IFRS era. While IFRS were issued {{to improve the quality}} of accounting practices and provide users with more useful information, <b>non-recurring</b> <b>items</b> disclosure is less regulated than under UK GAAP. Therefore, firms have more opportunity to exercise discretion in the classification <b>of</b> <b>items</b> within the Income Statement. Whilst there is only weak evidence of misclassification <b>of</b> recurring <b>items</b> prior to the introduction of IFRS (Athanasakou et al., 2009), our results reveal that managers are more likely to exercise their discretion in the disclosure <b>of</b> <b>non-recurring</b> <b>items</b> following the adoption of IFRS. More specifically, it is found that managers are more likely to misclassify some recurring <b>items</b> as <b>non-recurring</b> when this allows them to report core earnings increases. In contrast, there is no evidence that companies engage in classification shifting to avoid reporting core losses. However, this may be logical behaviour in that, while credit rating agencies do not penalize firms who use classification shifting to avoid reporting core earnings decreases, they may penalize firms who use it to avoid reporting core losses...|$|R

40|$|The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> storing corn in {{the crib}} {{on the farm}} is made up <b>of</b> three main <b>items,</b> shrink, {{interest}} and insurance, and destruction by vermin. The biggest <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> is the shrink, or loss of moisture. This amounts to about 10 percent. This shrink, however, is offset or more than offset by the highest price received for the improved grade which results from the shrink. Interest and insurance come to nearly half a cent a bushel a month. It costs half a cent a bushel, therefore, to store corn, if the loss by vermin, or the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> a rat-proof crib, is not included.

40|$|Background: Stroke is {{the second}} most {{frequent}} cause of death in developed countries and the most frequent cause of permanent disability. This way this illness creates high costs for society which should be minimized as much as possible. One of the possibilities is to administer cost-saving drugs which are at the same time from the medical {{point of view of the}} top quality and their economic effectiveness can be identified by means of pharmacoeconomic analysis. Objective: The objective of the work is to identify and carry out a quantified estimate <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> connected with the stroke treatment in the Czech Republic. Next is the necessary to confront the results with the alternative solution to the treatment (taking drug Xarelto instead of Warfarin) and to carry out comparison of the both the possibilities from the quantitative point <b>of</b> view. Methods: <b>Costs</b> <b>of</b> stroke treatment are evaluated from the social point of view. From their determination COI method with type of bottom-up approach has been picked out which includes all-life cost-of-illness. For comparison <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> both the treatment vari-ants the Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA) has been chosen, the results of which shows net cost savings. Data are taken from non-public data of the provider (St. Anne 's Uni-versity Hospital Brno), Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, Czech Statistical Office, foreign studies and consultations with neurologists as well. Results: Total social <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> treatment of stroke were 12 991 273 843, 65 CZK. COI method was used to calculate average costs for one patient with Warfarin in the amount of 1 203 423, 68 CZK, in case of alternative treatment with Xarelto in the amount of 1 465 963, 32 CZK. Relaps creates the biggest <b>item</b> <b>of</b> the <b>costs.</b> CMA method was used to identify savings when Warfarin is administered in the average amount of 262 539, 64 CZK per patient. The hypothesis that Xarelto is more effective from the economic point of view has not been confirmed. Conclusion: Because <b>of</b> high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> Xarelto, this drug has not beaten the economic effectiveness of Warfarin with lower quality.
