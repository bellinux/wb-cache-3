500|$|Salma Yaqoob, then {{leader of}} the Respect Party, said in 2010 of Choudary: [...] "He is a bigot whose goal {{in life is to}} provoke division. He engages in these provocations because he is deeply hostile to any coming {{together}} of Muslims and non-Muslims. For him, the fact {{that a majority of the}} British people – Muslim and non-Muslim – oppose the war in Afghanistan is not something to be celebrated, but is something to be feared." [...] Rod Liddle, writing in The Spectator, said: [...] "Anjem Choudray...is one of those thick-as-mince gobby little chancers who could only possibly come from Britain." [...] Conservatives in the United States have also been critical of Choudary. Fox <b>News</b> <b>host</b> Sean Hannity called Choudary [...] "one sick, miserable, evil S.O.B." [...] during a segment on his show discussing the 2011 Egyptian protests.|$|E

500|$|On July 10, CNN <b>News</b> <b>host</b> Anderson Cooper {{interviewed the}} National Center for Missing & Exploited Children's co-founder and former emcee of America's Most Wanted, John Walsh about the case. Walsh stated that [...] "absolutely someone knows" [...] the {{identity}} of the Jane Doe and that in similar cases, it was often the [...] "live-in boyfriend" [...] or the mother of the child that had abused or neglected one of several children in a family, citing that the victim could have been [...] "accidentally killed or starved to death." [...] When explaining a probable reason why the girl had remained unidentified, Walsh stated that [...] "people do not want to talk to cops," [...] possibly due to the fear of authorities investigating their own lives. For instance, the family of Anjelica Castillo, who were undocumented immigrants and never reported the victim missing due to fear of deportation. Walsh encouraged viewers to contact him instead, giving the number for the show he hosts, The Hunt With John Walsh and the URL for his profile on the CNN website. He confirmed that those submitting tips could remain anonymous.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, {{the video}} for Branch's fourth single [...] "I Am America" [...] was {{released}} on YouTube. Her husband, Michael Branch, wrote the song partly in response to criticism of the Tea Party protests from Democrats, while also drawing on his own difficulties in life. In an interview for Billy Kelly of the Washington Times' Tea Party Report, Branch told how soon after her husband wrote the song he had her quickly learn the lyrics and then recorded her performing the song. She originally felt the song was too confrontational for her, but decided the message was so important that she should record the song. In the music video, footage of Tea Party rallies is interspersed with scenes of Branch singing on a sound stage and kids holding signs containing political messages and scripture. [...] "I Am America" [...] was played on the July 7, 2010, broadcast of Glenn Beck's radio show and a week later Fox <b>News</b> <b>host</b> Bill O'Reilly devoted {{a portion of his}} “Pinheads and Patriots” segment to the song, saying that [...] "for honoring legitimate protest" [...] Branch was a patriot. About 21 days after being uploaded the video had nearly 475,000 views. [...] "I Am America" [...] soon became a popular song with the Tea Party movement and has been described as the movement's anthem. The New York Times described Branch as having a [...] "dynamic presence" [...] on stage when singing the song.|$|E

[...] The site said VanderSloot was [...] "litigious, combative, and a bitter foe of the gay rights movement." [...] VanderSloot made a series of television appearances, in some of which he called for donations to Romney in protest of the list. VanderSloot accused the Obama campaign of targeting him unfairly and said that he went through [...] "living hell" [...] as a result.

2500|$|Poplawski was {{a member}} of Stormfront, a white {{supremacist}} website, where he was a frequent visitor and poster.

[...] Poplawski last logged into Stormfront at 3:32a.m. Saturday, only hours before the shootings. [...] Poplawski also frequently visited and occasionally posted on Alex Jones' Infowars website. One of his frustrations with the site, though, was that it supposedly didn't focus enough on the nefarious roles played by Jews in all these conspiracies. [...] "For being such huge players in the endgame," [...] he observed in a March 29, 2009, posting to Infowars, [...] "too many 'infowarriors' are surprisingly unfamiliar with the Zionists." [...] Among Poplawski's [...] "last few links from MySpace" [...] were a Myers-Briggs personality test, and a psychotherapy chart.|$|E
2500|$|Hours {{after the}} rally finished, Martin Luther King Jr.'s {{personal}} attorney and speechwriter, Clarence B.

Jones, a visiting professor at Stanford University, said the Beck rally seemed to be tasteful and did not appear to distort King's message, which included a recommitment to religious values. James Freeman, in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, wrote positively about the rally, remarking that [...] "the day was largely devoted to expressions of gratitude for the sacrifices of U.S. soldiers, for great men of American history like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and for God." [...] He said [...] "you couldn't find a more polite crowd" [...] and remarked that he couldn't find a single piece of trash left on the Mall by attendees. After noting how the crowd refused to boo when Dave Roever gave the closing prayer thanking God for President Obama and members of Congress, Freeman theorized that [...] "between Saturday's crowd in Washington and the tea partiers agitating for limited government, we may be witnessing the rebuilding of the Reagan coalition, the fusion of religious and economic conservatives." [...] Fox <b>News</b> <b>host</b> Bill O'Reilly described it as an [...] "appeal for a return to Judeo-Christian values" [...] and called it [...] "a huge victory for Glenn Beck and Americans who believe that his message of honor and dignity is worthwhile." [...] He also said, [...] "I don't think there's anybody in the country that could have mobilized that many people at this point in time." ...|$|E

Gutfeld said, [...] "As most musicians know, this is a vast improvement over the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the worst band on the planet. The ape is better than Anthony Kiedis. By the way, the ape is 45, which is half the age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More, don't ever forget it." [...] After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying [...] "Two days ago I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet. I {{received a lot of}} flack from fans all over the world. What I meant to say was the Red Hot Chili Peppers [...] the worst band in the universe. I’d like to apologize for that confusion. I want to explain {{that we live in a}} binary universe," [...] he continued. [...] "You're either a Faith No More fan, or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. You cannot love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis, because they are two different people. You have to love Mike Patton, you cannot love Anthony Kiedis. So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe, because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe." [...] Flea responded to Gutfeld's comments a few days later saying [...] "I remember seeing a poll recently that said people who watch Fox News knew less about world affairs than people who watch no news at all. It's clearly a funny program. It doesn't faze me, not really. I heard that. It's funny. I don't care. They're all welcome to hate us. God bless 'em." ...|$|E
