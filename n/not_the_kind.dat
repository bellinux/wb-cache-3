5|$|A {{desert is}} <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and {{for the development of}} their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E

25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I {{think it is a}} fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E

25|$|According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect” (Ethics 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), {{and capable}} of loving both himself—and us, insofar as {{we are part of}} his {{perfection}} (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends amor intellectualis dei (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of being who could ever love us back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).|$|E

500|$|One review {{about the}} soundtrack said that, [...] "this is no {{ordinary}} album and will be preferred by musical elites.

Andrew Bast from The Daily Beast, however, gave the video a negative review and criticized it for being overly sexual.|$|E

500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It {{took me a while}} to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of song I would write myself. But as soon as I heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{acknowledges}} {{having said}} intemperate things in years past, though {{he also says}} that many stories have been exaggerated. One psychoanalytic comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper, and cultural critic Julia Keller argues that voters want leaders who are passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty. McCain has employed both profanity and shouting on occasion, although such incidents have become less frequent over the years. Lieberman has made this observation: [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person." [...] Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks, expressed concern about a McCain presidency: [...] "He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me." [...] Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after it was clear he would win the nomination.|$|E

500|$|For Storaro, {{the limited}} color palette {{was the most}} {{challenging}} aspect of production. [...] "These are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of colors the audience is used to seeing," [...] he noted. [...] "These are much more dramatic in strength, in saturation. Comic strip art is usually done with very simple and primitive ideas and emotions," [...] Storaro theorized. [...] "One of the elements is that the story is usually told in vignette, so what {{we tried to do}} is never move the camera at all. Never. Try to make everything work into the frame." [...] For the matte paintings, Ellenshaw and Lloyd executed over 57 paintings on glass, which were then optically combined with the live action.

500|$|Paramount {{felt the}} film was too {{controversial}} for release, giving it only a few preview showings and a one-week run in Detroit before shelving it. The film's first theatrical release occurred in France on July 7, 1982. In the United Kingdom, {{it was part of}} the 37th Edinburgh International Film Festival and the 27th London Film Festival in 1983, and was released late that year by United International Pictures. It received positive reviews in both countries. Lisa Dombrowski of Film Comment notes, [...] "In the end, Sam Fuller's White Dog was muzzled by a collision of historically specific economic and political interests, as support for freedom of expression took a back seat to Paramount's bottom line and the NAACP's ongoing battles with Hollywood over representation and employment. A Sam Fuller thriller was simply <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of antiracist picture that a major studio knew how to market in 1981 or that African-American organizations wanted Hollywood to make at the time." ...|$|E

He does not wish to leave his command, but his friend, fireman Jack Allen, finally induces him to go on the promise that he, Jack, will call later. Perhaps one reason Jack is so accommodating is because he likes [...] sister. Jack pays ardent court to her, and the flame of their affection resists all of young Willie's efforts to put it out.
