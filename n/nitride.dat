40|$|AbstractA new <b>nitriding</b> {{technology}} using active screen plasma <b>nitriding</b> (ASPN) {{was carried}} out in order to increase the <b>nitriding</b> speed of AISI 5140 steel. The fast <b>nitriding</b> process is based upon the different solubility and diffuse rate of nitrogen atoms in austenite and in ferrite of steel respectively. First, the <b>nitriding</b> samples were heated above the eutectoid temperature for a few minutes to dissolve a large amount of nitrogen and form a nitrogen-rich layer {{on the surface of the}} <b>nitrided</b> samples. Then, the <b>nitriding</b> temperature was decreased below the eutectoid temperature and kept the temperature for a long time to make the dissolved nitrogen in the nitrogen-rich layer diffuse into ferrite.
