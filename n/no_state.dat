5|$|Breckinridge's {{personal}} turmoil did not hinder {{his political}} accomplishments. He was appointed superintendent {{of public education}} by Governor William Owsley. He was the sixth person to hold the office since its creation in the 1830s. The task was daunting. Only one of every ten school-age children in Kentucky ever attended school, and at least thirty Kentucky counties had received <b>no</b> <b>state</b> educational funds since 1840.|$|E
5|$|He died on March 29, 1829. He {{was taken}} to the {{cemetery}} by his sons. There was <b>no</b> <b>state</b> funeral at the time, because Juan Lavalle made a coup against the governor Manuel Dorrego and executed him, starting a period of civil war. Lavalle was defeated by Juan Manuel de Rosas, who was appointed governor. Once he restored peace, Rosas made a state funeral for Saavedra, on January 13, 1830.|$|E

5|$|This {{inequality}} further offended {{the smaller}} countries. Finally, this inequality {{also meant that}} the minority rights were not seen as a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had <b>no</b> <b>state</b> to back up their claims were relatively disadvantaged when compared to ones backed up by a powerful state or group of interests.|$|E
5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since <b>no</b> <b>state</b> has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer pain from his condition, and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, {{and expected to}} find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in <b>no</b> <b>state</b> to express a considered view. After the operation {{there seemed to be}} an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} the monarch had {{little control over}} lords, or required {{the construction of new}} castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission– {{as was the case in}} England in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being <b>no</b> <b>state</b> control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. There are very few castles dated with certainty from the mid-9thcentury. Converted into a donjon around 950, Château de Doué-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Jeter {{maintains}} {{homes in}} Marlboro Township, New Jersey; Greenwood Lake, New York; and the Davis Islands neighborhood of Tampa, Florida. He previously owned a penthouse apartment in Manhattan's Trump World Tower. Regarding his official residence, Jeter settled a tax {{dispute with the}} New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in 2008. New York State alleged that Jeter should have paid state income tax from 2001 to 2003, as Jeter resided in the Manhattan apartment he bought in 2001; Jeter claimed to have established his residence in Tampa, Florida, in 1994 {{and that he was}} still a resident of Florida at the time.

5|$|Marshall was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of Indiana's recently passed eugenics and sterilization laws, and ordered state institutions not to follow them. He was an early, high-profile opponent of eugenics laws, and he carried his opposition into the vice-presidency. His governorship {{was the first in}} which <b>no</b> <b>state</b> executions took place, due to his opposition to capital punishment and his practice of pardoning and commuting the sentences of people condemned to execution. He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created anti-trust laws to attempt to break several large businesses. He participated in a number of ceremonial events, including personally laying the final golden brick to complete the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{state parks}} and forests {{prohibit}} the possession or {{consumption of alcohol}}ic beverages except at pre-approved events. There is <b>no</b> <b>state</b> law against public consumption of alcohol in other locations, but most municipalities have open container laws prohibiting or restricting public consumption. The fine for alcohol possession in a state park is $71, whereas municipal fines for public consumption violations can {{be as high as}} $2000, although they are generally much lower. Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), public intoxication without accompanying disorderly behavior is not a criminal offense, and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication. New Jersey law allows a police officer to take people found to be intoxicated in public to their residence or to a medical facility.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} of trucks were spotted by Jersey City police {{entering}} {{the city on the}} skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they were told that the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was <b>no</b> <b>state</b> law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1927, {{the route}} was {{a branch of}} pre-1927 Route 6, which had run south from Camden and split into two {{branches}} in Mullica Hill that ran to Salem and Bridgeton. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 46 was designated along the former branch of pre-1927 Route 6 that ran from Bridgeton to Mullica Hill. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which stated that <b>no</b> <b>state</b> route and U.S. route could share the same number, Route 46 was changed to Route 77 to avoid a conflict with US 46 in North Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The Greenback ticket {{received}} 305,997 {{votes and}} no electoral votes, compared to 4,446,158 for the winner, Republican James A. Garfield, and 4,444,260 for Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock. The party was strongest in the West and South, but in <b>no</b> <b>state</b> did Weaver receive more than 12% of the vote, and his nationwide total was just 3%. That figure represented {{an improvement over}} the Greenback vote of 1876, but to Weaver, who expected twice as many votes as he received, it was a disappointment.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks of}} 28 March were a {{continuation}} of the rapid advances that had so shattered the Fifth Army since the first days of the Spring Offensive. Prisoners of war taken by the 48th Battalion attested to {{the fact that this was}} not a set-piece assault, but merely an attack off the line of march. The 50th Reserve Division was in <b>no</b> <b>state</b> to renew the offensive on the following day, and 229 RIR was withdrawn from the line. It had suffered 309 casualties, with 230 RIR losing another 240.|$|E

5|$|There are <b>no</b> <b>state</b> {{roads and}} {{virtually}} no township {{roads in the}} watershed of Hammersley Fork. However, there are dirt roads and gravel roads, and several stream crossings in the watershed. The first settlers arrived in the watershed in 1827 and the first roads in the area were constructed several years later. Industrial activities such as logging were common in the watershed in the early 20th century, but there is currently virtually no such activity there. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream throughout its entire length. Most of the creek has a substantial riparian buffer.|$|E
5|$|With {{highways}} in {{and near}} Moab {{back in the}} 1960s limited to just two state-maintained highways, there was <b>no</b> <b>state</b> route built to access Dead Horse Point. The only two highways in the area were U.S. Route 160 (now U.S. Route 191) and State Route 128. There were two routes assigned {{in the direction of}} Dead Horse Point in the 1960s, SR-278 and SR-279. The route that SR-313 runs along was mapped by 1969, stretching all the way to Dead Horse Point as an unmarked county highway. Though SR-279 was completed in 1962, SR-278 was never constructed. In 1975, the proposal for SR-278 was cancelled. In its place, the Utah Department of Transportation assigned SR-313, assuming maintenance for what was local roads.|$|E
5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving <b>no</b> <b>state</b> aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E
