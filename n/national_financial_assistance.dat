Title IV (State Firearms Control Assistance) and the 1968 Gun Control Act were two federal reactions to handgun violence. More recently, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was passed in 1993 and sets national minimum requirements for firearms purchases. The main focus of the Brady Act is to prevent felons from obtaining firearms.|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES—The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to examine (1) trends concerning <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> from the <b>national</b> government to local governments, (2) trends regarding death rates and life expectancies among prefectures, and (3) the effect of the <b>national</b> <b>financial</b> adjustment policy in equalising both the revenues of local governments and variations in the health levels among prefectures in terms of death rates and life expectancies.  DESIGN—The study analysed prefectural income, the amount of <b>national</b> taxes collected, <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> from the <b>national</b> government to local governments, and age adjusted death rates and life expectancies of all of the prefectures in Japan during the period from 1965  through 1995.  MAIN RESULTS—(1) Under the financial adjustment policy, <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> from the <b>national</b> government to the local governments, which consists of the sum of the local allocation tax and treasury disbursements, increased from 1831  billion yen in 1965  to 31   116 billion yen in 1995.  (2) During the same period, the age adjusted death rate per 100   000 people decreased from 1168. 9  (1965) to 545. 3  (1995). The range of variation in the age adjusted death rate among prefectures diminished as the coefficient of variation of the death rate declined from 0. 060  in 1965  to 0. 043  in 1995.  (3) There was a significant statistical correlation between higher prefectural incomes and lower mortality rates during from 1965  until 1975  (p <  0. 05), whereas this correlation was indistinct in the 1980 s and has not been observed since 1990.  (4) The relative health level of Tokyo has declined in terms of its ranking among all the prefectures with regard to life expectancy, from being the best in 1965  to below average in 1995.  CONCLUSIONS—The <b>national</b> <b>financial</b> adjustment policy to balance the revenues of local governments has increased the health levels of rural prefectures. It is probable that the policy reduced the disparity in death rates and life expectancies among prefectures throughout the country. However, the policy has precluded the nation's capital city from applying its economic resources as local government expenditures to deal with the megacity issues affecting health.    Keywords: fiscal adjustment policy; mortality disparit...|$|R

Over 90 percent of students at the fifty-one respond-ing dental schools received <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> {{in the form of}} loans, grants, scholarships and/or work-study programs, with students receiving an average of $ 43, 191 per year.

The primary source of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> was in the form of loans, accounting for nearly 90 percent of the reported <b>financial</b> <b>assistance.</b> Most of the remaining assistance was in the form of obligated or unobligated grants and scholarships, with an increasing share attributable to grants/scholarships with obligations following graduation.

40|$|Official lenders provide <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> to {{countries}} that face sovereign debt crisis.

On the one hand, <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> can help to avoid defaults by bridging times of fundamental crises or resolving coordination failures among private investors. On the other hand, the insurance effect of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> lowers borrowing costs which induces the sovereign to accumulate higher debt levels. To assess the overall effect of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> on the probability of default we construct a quantitative model of endogenous credit structure and sovereign default that allows for self-fulfilling expectations of default.
