25|$|Various other notes (relatively flat or sharp {{with respect}} {{to those of the}} major scale) can be {{accessed}} by cross fingering techniques, and all the notes (except the lowest of each octave/register) can be flattened by half holing. Perhaps the most effective and most used cross fingering is that which produces a flattened form of the seventh <b>note</b> (<b>B</b> flat instead of B on a C whistle, for example, or C natural instead of C sharp on a D whistle). This makes available another major scale (F on a C whistle, G on a D whistle).|$|E

500|$|The song {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} {{which consists of}} eight measures of instrumentals, followed by eight measures in which Akon sings [...] "Woohoo, yeehoo".

Overdubbing is introduced {{in the middle of the}} first verse to produce a sequence of eighth <b>note</b> <b>B</b> minor chords from Stefani's vocals. Stefani's voice is overdubbed again when she sings the chorus twice. Akon performs, and Stefani then sings the second verse and the choruses again.

60|$|It was, then, towards nightfall {{upon the}} twelfth day of June 1685 {{that the news}} reached {{our part of the}} country that Monmouth had landed the day before at Lyme, a small seaport on the {{boundary}} between Dorsetshire and Devonshire.

Mounted messengers clattered through the village street with their heads low on their horses' necks, for the great tidings must be carried to London, that the Governor of Portsmouth might know how to act. (<b>Note</b> <b>B,</b> Appendix.) We were standing at our doorway in the gloaming, watching the coming and the going, and the line of beacon fires which were lengthening away to the eastward, when a little man galloped up to the door and pulled his panting horse up.|$|E

6000|$|Those organic {{compounds}} of which organized beings are built up, consist, {{as is well}} known, of matter of an extreme complexity. and great instability; whence result the changes of form {{to which it is}} continually subject. This view enables us to comprehend the possibility, of the phenomena of vegetative life being due to an almost infinite complexity of molecular combinations, subject to definite changes under the stimuli of heat, moisture, light, electricity, and probably some unknown forces. But this greater and greater complexity, even if carried to an infinite extent, cannot, of itself, have the slightest tendency to originate consciousness in such molecules or groups of molecules. If a material element, or a combination of a thousand material elements in a molecule, are alike unconscious, it is impossible for us to believe, that the mere addition of one, two, or a thousand other material elements to form a more complex molecule, could in any way tend to produce a self-conscious existence. The things are radically distinct. To say that mind is a product or function of protoplasm, or of its molecular changes, is to use words to which we can attach no clear conception. You cannot have, in the whole, what does not exist in any of the parts; and those who argue thus should put forth a definite conception of matter, with clearly enunciated properties, and show, that the necessary result of a certain complex arrangement of the elements or atoms of that matter, will be the production of self-consciousness. There is no escape from this dilemma,--either all matter is conscious, or consciousness is something distinct from matter, and in the latter case, its presence in material forms is a proof of the existence of conscious beings, outside of, and independent of, what we term matter.
