Here we targeted loss of E-cadherin in skin epithelium. The epidermal basal layer responded by elevating P-cadherin, enabling these cells to maintain adherens junctions. Suprabasal layers upregulated desmosomal cadherins, but without classical cadherins, terminal differentiation was impaired. Progressive hyperplasia developed with age, a possible consequence of proliferative maintenance in basal cells coupled with defects in terminal differentiation. In contrast, hair follicles lost integrity of the inner root sheath and hair cuticle without apparent elevation of cadherins. These findings suggest that, if no compensatory mechanisms exist, E-cadherin loss may be incompatible with epithelial tissue survival, whereas partial compensation can result in alterations in differentiation and proliferation...|$|E

The Nekrasov partition function for a four-dimensional N= 2 gauge theory with a surface operator is believed equal to the wave-function of the corresponding integrable system, or the Hitchin system, and is identified with the conformal block with a degenerate field via the AGT relation. We verify the conjecture by showing that the <b>null</b> <b>state</b> condition leads to the Schrodinger equations of the integrable systems. Furthermore, we show that the deformed prepotential emerging from the period integrals of the principal function corresponds to monodromy operation of the conformal block.
