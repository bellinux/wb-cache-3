40|$|Graduation date: 1999 This thesis {{describes}} compensation {{techniques for}} cascaded delta-sigma A/D converters (ADCs) and high-performance switched-capacitor (SC) circuits. Various correlated-double-sampling (CDS) techniques are presented {{to reduce the}} effects of the nonidealities, such as clock feedthrough, charge injection, opamp input-referred noise and offset, and finite opamp gain, in SC circuits. A CDS technique for the compensation of opamp input-referred offset and clock-feedthrough effect is examined and improved to achieve continuous operation. Experimental results show that after the compensation, the SC integrator's output signal swing is greatly increased. The effects of the analog circuitry nonidealities in delta-sigma ADCs are also analyzed. The analysis shows that the nonidealities in cascaded delta-sigma ADCs cause <b>noise</b> <b>leakage,</b> which limits the overall performance of the cascaded modulators. In order to reduce the <b>noise</b> <b>leakage,</b> a novel adaptive compensation technique is proposed. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed compensation techniques, a prototype 2 - 0 cascaded modulator was designed. Its first stage, a second-order delta-sigma modulator with test signal input circuit, was designed and fabricated in 1. 2 μm CMOS technology. The measurement results show that the <b>noise</b> <b>leakage</b> is reduced effectively by the compensation, and the performance of the cascaded delta-sigma modulator is greatly improved...|$|E

The multi-stage noise-shaping (MASH) CT??M architecture is identified as an advancement to the single-loop CT??M architecture {{in order to satisfy}} the ever stringent requirements of next generation wireless systems. However, it suffers from the problems of quantization <b>noise</b> <b>leakage</b> and non-ideal interstage interfacing which hinder its widespread adoption. To solve these issues, this dissertation proposes a MASH CT??M with on-chip RC time constant calibration circuits, multiple feedforward interstage paths, and a fully integrated noise cancellation filter (NCF). The prototype core modulator architecture is a cascade of two single-loop second- order CT??M stages, each of which consists of an integrator-based active-RC loop filter, current-steering feedback digital-to-analog converters, and a four-bit flash quantizer. On-chip RC time constant calibration circuits and high gain multi-stage operational amplifiers are realized to mitigate quantization <b>noise</b> <b>leakage</b> due to process variation. Multiple feedforward interstage paths are introduced to (i) synthesize a fourth-order noise transfer function with DC zeros, (ii) simplify the design of NCF, and (iii) reduce signal swings at the second-stage integrator outputs.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} dual-path 2 - 0 MASH (Multi-stAge-noise -SHaping) ADC with two verified digital corrections of DAC mismatch error and quantization <b>noise</b> <b>leakage.</b> By using these two techniques, {{the requirements for}} the analog circuits are greatly relaxed. The dual-path structure generates two outputs, one only composed of conversion errors, the other input signal plus conversion errors. For the above two correlation algorithms, the input signal is the largest interference. Hence, the first output is suitable for a correlation operation, greatly speeding up the correlation based techniques, while the second serves as the final output after removal of the DAC error and quantization <b>noise</b> <b>leakage.</b> 			The dissertation also proposes a new Dynamic Element Matching (DEM) technique, namely Segmented Data Weighted Averaging (SeDWA), for application in a multi-bit Delta-Sigma Modulator (DSM). In SeDWA, the DAC elements are divided into several subsets with Data Weighted Averaging (DWA) applied in each set. This allows a simpler and faster implementation, and the selecting sequences for the DAC elements are more randomized than in conventional DWA. It reduces pattern tones, but still provides mismatch error shaping. In the simulated Power Spectra Density (PSD), no in-band pattern tones were observed, and only a moderate rise of the noise floor. Therefore, higher Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) was achieved. The implementation of SeDWA can be simpler and faster than that of conventional DWA, making it suitable for high-speed applications. To verify the first technique, an experimental dual-path 2 - 0 MASH DSM was built. The split structure allows fast convergence and improved accuracy for the correction.

40|$|Abstract. Side-channel {{information}} leaked {{during the}} execution of cryptographic modules usually contains various noises. Normally, these noises have negative effects {{on the performance of}} side-channel attacks exploiting noisy leakages. Therefore, to reduce <b>noise</b> in <b>leakages</b> usually serves to be an effective approach to enhance the performance of side-channel attacks. However, most existing noise reduction methods treat all noises as a whole, instead of identifying and dealing with each of them individually. Motivated by this, this paper investigates the feasibility and implications of identifying trend noise from any other noises in side-channel acquisitions and then dealing with it accordingly. Specifically, we discuss the effectiveness of applying least square method (LSM for short) to remove inherent trend <b>noise</b> in side-channel <b>leakages,</b> and also clarify the limited capability of existing noise reduction methods in dealing with trend noise. For this purpose, we perform a series of correlation power analysis attacks, as a case of study, against a set of real power traces, published in the second stage of international DPA contest which provides a public set of original power traces without any preprocessing, from an unprotected FPGA implementation of AES encryption.
