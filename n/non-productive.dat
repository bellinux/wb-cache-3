5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{informed}} by events {{prior to the}} Great Depression when – {{in the opinion of}} Keynes and others – international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into <b>non-productive</b> and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.|$|E
5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it {{should be}} {{expected}} that industry will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is an}} empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage <b>non-productive</b> rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E

25|$|While daydreaming {{has long}} been derided as a lazy, <b>non-productive</b> pastime, it is now {{commonly}} acknowledged that daydreaming can be constructive in some contexts. There are numerous examples of people in creative or artistic careers, such as composers, novelists and filmmakers, developing new ideas through daydreaming. Similarly, research scientists, mathematicians and physicists have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.|$|E
25|$|Industry is {{the core}} force of oil sands development. The first major players, Suncor Energy and Syncrude, {{dominated}} the market until the 1990s. Currently there are 64 companies operating several hundred projects. The majority of production now comes from foreign-owned corporations, {{and the maintenance of}} a favourable climate for these corporations grants them strong influence; much stronger than that of <b>non-productive</b> stakeholders, such as citizens and environmental groups.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{money market}} is {{classified}} into the organised sector, comprising private, public and foreign-owned commercial banks and cooperative banks, together known as 'scheduled banks'; and the unorganised sector, which includes individual or family-owned indigenous bankers or money lenders and non-banking financial companies. The unorganised sector and microcredit are preferred over traditional banks in rural and sub-urban areas, especially for <b>non-productive</b> purposes such as short-term loans for ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of PCP include fever, <b>non-productive</b> cough (because sputum is too viscous to become productive), shortness of breath (especially on exertion), weight loss, and night sweats. There is usually not {{a large amount of}} sputum with PCP unless the patient has an additional bacterial infection. The fungus can invade other visceral organs (such as the liver, spleen, and kidney), but only in a minority of cases.|$|E
25|$|By May 1, 1649, the Huron burned 15 {{of their}} villages {{to prevent their}} stores from being taken and fled as {{refugees}} to surrounding tribes. About 10,000 fled to Gahoendoe (now also called Christian Island). Most who fled to the island starved over the winter, {{as it was a}} <b>non-productive</b> settlement and could not provide for them. After spending the bitter winter of 1649–50 on the island, surviving Huron relocated near Quebec City, where they settled at Wendake. Absorbing other refugees, they became the Huron-Wendat Nation. Some Huron, along with the surviving Petun, whose villages the Iroquois attacked in the fall of 1649, fled to the upper Lake Michigan region, settling first at Green Bay, then at Michilimackinac.|$|E
25|$|Mexico drilled {{its first}} shale gas well in 2011, in the Burgos Basin of {{northern}} Mexico, in {{the equivalent of}} the Eagle Ford Formation of the US. But as of February 2013, there have been only six productive shale gas and tight oil wells drilled in Mexico (a seventh was abandoned as <b>non-productive),</b> all producing from Eagle Ford equivalent. The national oil company Pemex has limited investment capital, and focuses its effort on what it sees as higher-return conventional oil and gas projects, rather than gas shales or tight oil. The US Energy Information Administration estimates Mexico's recoverable reserves of shale gas to be 681 trillion cubic feet, the fourth largest shale gas reserves in the world.|$|E
25|$|Conspicuous leisure, or the <b>non-productive</b> use of {{time for}} the sake of {{displaying}} social status, is used by Veblen as the primary indicator of the leisure class. To engage in conspicuous leisure is to openly display one's wealth and status, as productive work signified the absence of pecuniary strength and was seen as a mark of weakness. As the leisure class increased their exemption from productive work, that very exemption became honorific and actual participation in productive work became a sign of inferiority. Conspicuous leisure worked very well to designate social status in rural areas, but urbanization made it so that conspicuous leisure was no longer a sufficient means to display pecuniary strength. Urban life requires more obvious displays of status, wealth, and power, which is where conspicuous consumption becomes prominent.|$|E
25|$|The {{trade deficit}} induced Buffett {{to enter the}} foreign {{currency}} market {{for the first time}} in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett emphasized the <b>non-productive</b> aspect of a gold standard for the United States dollar in 1998 at Harvard: It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head. In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} on an Eco-socialist revolution, Kovel advocates the “rapid {{conversion}} to ecosocialist production” for all enterprises, followed by “restoring ecosystemic integrity to the workplace” through steps like workers ownership. He then {{believes that the}} new enterprises can build “socially developed plans” of production for societal needs, such as efficient light-rail transport components. At the same time, Kovel argues for the transformation of essential but, under capitalism, <b>non-productive</b> labour, such as child care, into productive labour, “thereby giving reproductive labour a status equivalent to productive labour”. During such a transition, he believes that income should be guaranteed and that money will still be used under “new conditions of value… according to use and to {{the degree to which}} ecosystem integrity is developed and advanced by any particular production”. Within this structure, Kovel asserts that markets will become unnecessary – although “market phenomena” in personal exchanges and other small instances might be adopted – and communities and elected assemblies will democratically decide on the allocation of resources.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{off with}} {{pioneering}} work by Ernest Mandel from 1964, various {{attempts have been}} made to link the long waves of capitalist development to long-term fluctuations in average profitability. Mandel's influential Phd thesis Late Capitalism (in German 1972, English version 1975) was a critical response to Henryk Grossman's theory. Like Henryk Grossman, Mandel was convinced of the centrality of profitability in the trajectory of capitalist development, but Mandel did not believe that Marx's reproduction models could be used to create a theory of capitalist crises. In Grossman's profitability model, there was only a series of business cycles and, sometime after the 34th cycle, a general breakdown of capitalism, because insufficient surplus value was being generated. Leaving aside the issue of the validity of Grossman's model, his picture of capitalist development did not explain historical phases of faster and slower economic growth lasting about 25 years or so. After World War 2, a long boom occurred, instead of a deepening capitalist crisis which many Marxists had expected. That was what Mandel wanted to explain (Mandel's and Grossman's growth models both ignore the accumulation of <b>non-productive</b> capital assets and profits not arising from new surplus-value).|$|E
25|$|Organizations {{increasingly}} {{make money}} from trading in already existing assets which are not used by them to produce any new products and services with. Put differently, an increasing share of total generic profit income consists of net interest, net taxes, net capital gains, fees & royalties, and rents. This can happen {{because a lot of}} <b>non-productive</b> assets have been accumulated that are available for trade; second-hand physical assets, financial assets and properties are being traded; all sorts of things are traded internationally, taking advantage of currency and cost differentials; assets are being held via all kinds of special financial constructions to extract profit, etc. And, an increasing amount of interest payments, rents and capital gains have been excluded from operating surplus because, by statistical definition, they are not classified as production expenditure at all (i.e. they are not counted as value-added). Post-Keynesian researchers such as Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie therefore tried to devise more adequate measures of the real financial profitability of companies. If a lot of capital is borrowed at a cost which is lower than the income obtained from reinvesting it in assets that appreciate in value, then a lot of profit income is earnt which has nothing directly to do with creating new product value, and therefore is not counted as value-added. Instead, existing wealth is transferred from one set of owners to another.|$|E

[...] Balsai's theory is that there are enough differences between animals from different islands that pairing of lizards from different locales will be unproductive, further frustrating many captive breeding attempts.|$|E
500|$|On 7 April Air America pilot Nikki A. Fillipi, with USMC Lt Robert Twigger, {{assigned}} to the DAO as the US Navy liaison officer, surveyed 37 buildings in Saigon as possible landing zones (LZ), selecting 13 of them as fit for use. Workers from Pacific Architects and Engineers visited each of the 13 LZs to remove obstructions and painted H's (the exact dimensions of a UH-1 Huey helicopter's skids) {{on each of the}} LZs. President Gerald Ford, in an address to the American public on 11 April, promised to evacuate Vietnamese civilians of various categories. The 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade (9th MAB), which was to supply helicopters and a security force for the evacuation, sent a delegation to consult with Ambassador Graham Martin on current plans on 12 April. Ambassador Martin told them that he would not tolerate any outward signs that the United States intended to abandon South Vietnam. All planning would have to be conducted with the utmost discretion. Brigadier General Richard E. Carey, commander of the 9th MAB, flew to Saigon the next day to see Ambassador Martin; he later said that [...] "The visit was cold, <b>non-productive</b> and appeared to be an irritant to the Ambassador". Thirteen Marines from the Marine Security Guard (MSG) detachment were deployed to the DAO Compound on 13 April to replace the eight Marine Guards withdrawn from the closed Danang and Nha Trang consulates who had been providing security up to that point.|$|E
