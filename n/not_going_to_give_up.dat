2500|$|In January 2009, on a {{broadcast}} of The 700 Club, Robertson {{stated that he}} is [...] "adamantly opposed" [...] to the division of Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians. He also stated that Armageddon is [...] "not going to be fought at Megiddo" [...] but will be the [...] "battle of Jerusalem," [...] when [...] "the forces of all nations come together and try to take Jerusalem away from the Jews. Jews are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> Jerusalem—they shouldn't—and {{the rest of the}} world is going to insist they give it up." [...] Robertson added that Jerusalem is a [...] "spiritual symbol that must not be given away" [...] because [...] "Jesus Christ the Messiah will come down to the part of Jerusalem that the Arabs want," [...] and that's [...] "not good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ungdomshuset {{soon began}} holding {{a number of}} {{meetings}} concerning {{the defense of the}} house, some of which were attended by up to a thousand people. The users began {{to make it clear that}} they were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the house without a fight. The consensus within the broad specter of supporters slowly, but surely started to change from non-violent protest to a felling that if violence was the only way to defend the house [...] "then so be it". This radical shift in the movement was caused by a number of things. First of all the conflict had turned into deadlock. The users of the house made a compromise offer to the city council, that if they would present the young people with a new house, they would peacefully leave Ungdomshuset. The only demand was that the new house was the same size as Ungdomshuset. The city council blankly refused that offer.|$|E
2500|$|A senior IDF officer {{told reporters}} on the {{outskirts}} of Jericho that [...] "We want to take them out alive, but if they threaten us, we won't hesitate to kill them. We won't agree to any change in Saadat's prison status". Some inmates took control of an armory in the prison. Israeli troops encircled the building while bulldozers knocked down nearby walls and helicopters fired missiles in an attempt to turn the prison into a [...] "pressure cooker". The Israelis called on all the Palestinians {{to come out of the}} compound. Many came out, including security officials and prisoners, who stripped to their underwear, as the Israelis had ordered. Saadat told Al Jazeera television in a telephone interview from the prison that [...] "Our choice is to fight or to die. We will not surrender", and that [...] "We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up,</b> we are going to face our destiny with courage". By nightfall, he ordered his men to put down their weapons and surrender. Shortly after 19:00, Chief of the Israeli Central Command, Major-General Yair Naveh, announced that the wanted men and several other militants in the jail had surrendered. The six, stripped to their underpants, surrendered and were questioned by security officials in the prison compound. The IDF also arrested sixty-seven other Palestinians who were still hiding inside the compound.|$|E

6000|$|... "Link Merwell and Job Haskers, {{and that}} Sol Blugg is with them," [...] he murmured. [...] "Evidently they are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the hunt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> yet," [...] {{answered}} the boy. [...] "If we can't get up any other way, {{we can build}} a stairs with those loose stones we just passed." ...|$|E

60|$|JOHNNY. This {{poor girl}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{have a fair}} deal, and you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it her. I can see that with half an eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Grant, [...] "but I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> {{you that}} letter. Are you {{coming in to}} supper? It really wouldn't commit you to anything." ...|$|R
60|$|FALDER. I don't understand. You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me up--after all this? There's something--[Starting {{forward to}} JAMES] Sir, I swear solemnly there's been nothing between us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I won't--and there's {{an end of}} it," [...] said Barry. [...] "It's all nonsense. You can't do {{anything}} to me: you said so yourself.

60|$|And {{it was no}} {{more than}} just enough. I ordered the {{windlass}} manned, the sails loosed, and the topsails set. But by the time I had cast the ship I could hardly feel any breath of wind. Nevertheless, I trimmed the yards and put everything on her. I was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the attempt.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} mean {{to have it}} arranged, you had better look to it. I am {{speaking}} in earnest, Rufford. I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> authorities. Indeed if I did I might give up everybody. The very servants suppose that they know it, and there isn't a groom or horseboy about who isn't in his heart congratulating the young lady on her promotion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I {{know that}} you are in love. I hope you are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> over being in love, Johnny, because it is such fun." ...|$|R

6000|$|Marston {{was silent}} for a moment or two. Mabel's trust moved him and he was half embarrassed. Then he said: [...] "There's a remark of yours I can't let go. No ground you think you ought to venture on is awkward to us. Very well. You don't approve Harry's marrying Flora, but what line d'you want me to take? I can't give him up and you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> your friend. It wouldn't be like you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, {{when she}} took so much pains to get my things. It's a {{nonsensical}} notion of mine, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> to it. My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort. You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for common." [...] And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.|$|E
60|$|For all that, she was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> {{the resolve}} {{she had made}} long ago. She owed her father much, and must carry out the task he had unconsciously left her. She meant to search the country he had {{traveled}} for the silver vein; and then, if she was persuaded {{it could not be}} found, she would have paid her debt and be free to lead the life that others led. In the meantime, she was, so to speak, set apart, like a nun, from common joys and sorrows by a vow that must be kept. Perhaps this was an exaggeration, but it was partly true.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something must be done," [...] he said. [...] "Yet {{her lungs}} can't stand the exposure. She can't travel till the {{temperature}} rises. And I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> her up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> in <b>to</b> a {{bunch of}} school boys!" [...] stormed Slogwell Brown, who, in his manner, {{was every bit as}} much of a bully as his son.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so, but she's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him any more," [...] Wilkinson rejoined. [...] "He married Sadie for her money, {{and now he}} hasn't sense {{enough to}} stick to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Clifford Pyncheon!" [...] {{said the}} man of patches, [...] "you may scheme for {{me as much as}} you please; but I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> this one scheme of my own, even if I never bring it really to pass. It does seem to me that men make a {{wonderful}} mistake in trying to heap up property upon property. If I had done so, I should feel as if Providence was not bound to take care of me; and, at all events, the city wouldn't be! I'm {{one of those people who}} think that infinity is big enough for us all--and eternity long enough." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{told me that}} he {{had been}} {{suffering}} from fever at intervals, and was very weak. He looked all he said, but even while I watched, both man and dog plumped out to their natural sizes, precisely as dried apples swell in water. Garin was on his shoulder, and his breast and feet all at the same time, so that Stanley spoke all through a cloud of Garin--gulping, sobbing, slavering Garm. He did not say anything that I could understand, except that he had fancied he was going to die, but that now he was quite well, and that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> Garin any more to anybody under the rank of Beelzebub.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Conway, {{all that}} is {{thoroughly}} unfair. The would-be author talks of his would-be book to everybody. I have never talked of Miss Dale to any one but you, {{and one or two}} very old family friends. And from year to year, and from month to month, I have done all that has been in my power to win her. I don't think I shall ever succeed, and yet I am as determined about it as I was when I first began it,--or rather much more so. If I do not marry Lily, I shall never marry at all, and if anybody were to tell me to-morrow that she had made up her mind to have me, I should well nigh go mad for joy. But I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> all my life for love. Indeed the less I can bring myself to give up for it, the better I shall think of myself. Now I'll go away and call on old lady Demolines.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{he shall}} have her. I {{made him a}} promise and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it up. I told {{him that if he}} was in earnest he should have her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't thank me," [...] {{cried the}} old lady. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> you anything,--far from it. I object to you altogether. What {{business}} have {{you to come}} courting my niece?" ...|$|R
50|$|After it {{was clear}} that Marie was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth <b>to</b> a son, her husband began a series of badly {{concealed}} affairs. Her husband fathered numerous illegitimate children during the marriage.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what would}} become of him; and {{what would become}} of me? And what would become of the dreadful little impediments which might follow? Of course to me Frank Jones {{is the best of}} men. I can't have him; and that is just all about it. I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the world because Frank Jones is lost. Love is not to be lord of all with me. I shall steer my little boat among the shiny waters of the London theatres, and may perhaps venture among the waves of Paris and New York; but I shall do so always with my eyes open. Gas is the {{atmosphere}} in which I am destined to glitter; and if a Marquis comes in the way,--why, I shall do the best I can with the Marquis. I won't bring you to trouble if I can help it, or anyone else with whom I have to do. So good-night, father." [...] Then she kissed his forehead, and went up to bed leaving him to wonder at the intricacies of his position.|$|E
60|$|And then--when {{that prayer}} {{has gone up}} in earnest, and has been {{answered}} by the gift of a clean heart, and of a right spirit, which desires nothing but to be made clean and made right, to learn its duty and to do it--then, I say, that man may go back safely and freely, to such forms and ceremonies, {{as he has been}} accustomed to, and have been consecrated by the piety and wisdom of his forefathers. For, says David, though forms and ceremonies, sacrifice and burnt-offering cannot make any peace with God, yet I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> forms and ceremonies, sacrifice and burnt- offerings. No. When my peace is made, when the broken and the contrite heart has put me in my true place again, and my heart is clean, and my spirit right once more; then, he says, will God be pleased with my sacrifices, with my burnt-offerings and oblations; because they will be the sacrifice of righteousness, of a righteous man desiring to shew honour to that God from whom his righteousness comes, and gratitude to that God to whom he owes his pardon.|$|E
60|$|The {{floor was}} filled early, {{and the scene}} {{gathered}} gayety and brilliancy. It had the charm that {{the taste of the}} school could give in the artistic effects, and its spirit of generous comradery found play in the praises they gave each other's costumes, and each other's looks when they were not in costume. It was a question whether Cornelia who came as herself, was lovelier than Charmian, who was easily recognizable as Cleopatra, with ophidian accessories in her dress that suggested at once the serpent of old Nile, and a Moqui snake-dancer. Cornelia looked more beautiful than ever; her engagement with Ludlow had come out and she moved in the halo of poetic interest which betrothal gives a girl with all other girls; it was thought an inspiration that she should not have come in costume, but in her own character. Ludlow's fitness to carry off such a prize was disputed; {{he was one of the}} heroes of the Synthesis, and much was conceded to him because he had more than once replaced the instructor in still-life there. But there remained a misgiving with some whether Cornelia was right in giving up her art for him; whether she were not recreant to the Synthesis in doing that; the doubt, freshly raised by her beauty, was not appeased till Charmian met it with the assertion that Cornelia was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> her art at all, but after her marriage was coming back to study and paint with Ludlow.|$|E
6000|$|Drill {{shook his}} head. [...] "It’s a secret process," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "I {{might want to}} go into the hat trade some day, and I’m <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> things away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You may jaw,' said Bradshaw at last, 'as {{much as you}} jolly well please, but I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> this away. All you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> know is that I shan't {{be there}} tomorrow.' ...|$|R
