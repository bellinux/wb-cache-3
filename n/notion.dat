Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic <b>notion</b> of mental content and the computational <b>notion</b> of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E

40|$|When {{we take a}} cab we {{may feel}} cheated if the driver takes an {{unnecessarily}} long route {{despite the lack of}} a contract or promise to take the shortest possible path. Is the behavior of the driver a¤ected by beliefs about our cheating <b>notions,</b> and where do his beliefs come from? For that matter, where do our cheating <b>notions</b> come from, and how do they color our own decisions? We address these questions {{in the context of a}} trust game by asking participants directly about their personal <b>notions</b> of cheating. We nd that both parties to a trust exchange have personal <b>notions</b> of what constitutes cheating; that these <b>notions</b> have a bimodal distribution; and that cheating <b>notions</b> are determined by parentally-transmitted values. We think about cheating <b>notions</b> as moral expectations, which provide a micro-foundation for guilt which extends the scope for empirical applications of guilt aversion theory. We document that cheating <b>notions</b> substantially a¤ect decisions on both sides of the trust exchange...|$|R
