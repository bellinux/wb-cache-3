30|$|We {{introduce}} a new node in the LTE-A network {{referred to as the}} cognitive resource manager (CRM), which coordinates the OSA to the unlicensed spectrum based on the notifications reporting the channel status perceived by the cognitive UEs. Based on the above, the CRM must include a MIHF entity which manages the event notification subscription and also receives and processes all <b>notifications</b> <b>concerning</b> spectrum sensing in order to build the Geo-DB. Since the CRM does not perform any sensing task and only compiles MIH event notifications from remote entities, it is necessary to implement a remote MIHF in every LTE-A UE. With the aim of keeping the Geo-DB updated, the CRM needs to know when a cognitive user measures that the RSSI in the licensed band crosses a specific power level or threshold. Therefore, after the attachment procedure, the CRM must send to the active user a MIH_Event_Subscribe message with the list of RBs to be monitored. Moreover, with the MIH_Link_Configure_Thresholds primitive the CRM specifies the thresholds associated with this list.|$|R
40|$|In the United States, the Clean Water Act gives EPA {{a mandate}} to set ambient water quality {{standards}} for all contaminants in surface water and to monitor toxic chemicals. However, EPA has "received health-related data on only 15 % of the 20, 000 new chemicals released in the last 30 years " (StarTribune). In addition, no federal laws have been enacted to directly control groundwater quality. Consequently, with the growth in new chemicals {{it has become increasingly}} important to measure the welfare costs of toxic water contamination. Estimating the costs of toxic chemical contamination in water bodies has received relatively little attention. What makes the valuation complicated is that empirically estimated welfare costs are likely to be “situation-dependent”. That is, the estimated value and composition of welfare costs of toxic pollution may be affected by the composition of water demand and information given to the public, and as a result, the actions of private and public agents.

40|$|Objectives: Non-compliance {{with the}} NIH Public Access Policy can {{severely}} hamper researchers’ efforts by delaying awards funding. Facilitating {{compliance with the}} policy can be a problematic process, especially across large institutions with numerous colleges, schools, centers and institutes. Collaborating with a department that spans all of these entities can ensure unlimited opportunities to provide compliance support and assistance. Methods: In early 2013, librarians from the Health Sciences Libraries (HSL) were invited {{to meet with the}} training coordinator for the campus-wide Sponsored Projects Administration (SPA) to discuss potential collaboration to help with the potential ramifications of NOT-OD- 13 - 042; the NIH Public Access Policy (PAP) <b>notification</b> <b>concerning</b> the delaying of processing of awards with start dates 1 July 2013. As part of this collaboration, SPA and a HSL librarian would co-present SPA sponsored workshops on the public access policy, an eRA Commons account would be assigned to provide access to the Public Access Compliance Monitor (PACM) and the NIH Manuscript Submission System, public access policy questions, issues and My NCBI /My Bibliography training requests received by SPA would be routed to the librarian {{and the creation of a}} detailed Public Access Policy Compliance library webpage that featured library and SPA resources. Results: Collaboration with SPA began in Spring 2013. A Public Access Policy dedicated HSL email address, public-access@umn. edu, was shared with SPA and non-compliance questions that arrived at SPA were routed to this address for trouble-shooting. Assignment of an eRA Commons account by SPA increased the ability to “diagnosis and treat” non-compliant articles, as it facilitated access to the PACM, NIH Manuscript Submission System and awards view in My Bibliography. A detailed, SPA-user friendly website devoted to the policy, NIH Public Access Policy & Compliance was developed that included cross-references to resources found on the SPA training webpage. The first co-teaching occurred in November 2013 and followed by co-teaching engagements at the SPA training site, an auditorium based recorded webinar and workshops at departmental in-service training. Coordination with SPA has led to helping NIH investigators campus-wide that would not otherwise have thought to turn to HSL for help on compliance issues [...] law, statistics, bio-sciences, chemistry or from the coordinate campuses. Conclusion: Collaboration with SPA on NIH Public Access Policy compliance has exponentially expanded the services and scope that the Health Sciences Libraries is able to offer NIH investigators in their grant and research efforts, resulting in more research dollars awardedMedical Library Associatio...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{how different}} institutional structures shape {{the research and}} development (R&D) of genetically modified crops (GM-crops). Whether this R&D is conducted within companies, cooperatives or public research organizations (both publicly and privately funded R&D) is expected to influence the type of crops and traits that are developed and therefore the effects on society and ecosystems that potentially could follow from the use of GM-crops. This issue is analyzed empirically by statistical analysis of 1323 notifications for field trials with GM-crops that have been submitted under two EU Directives in seven European countries. The results show that the type of R&D organization influences the traits and crops that are developed. Companies are more likely to submit <b>notifications</b> that <b>concern</b> GM-crops that secure the potential for profit than are other types of R&D organizations, while R&D organizations that are purely publicly funded are more likely to submit <b>notifications</b> that only <b>concern</b> biosafety research than are cooperatives and companies.

40|$|Background: <b>Notifications</b> <b>concerning</b> American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis have {{increased}} {{in recent years in}} the state of Acre, Brazil. Despite identification of distinct Leishmania species isolated from cutaneous lesions, there are still no records of visceral leishmaniasis in the state. However, studies on the sand fly fauna in this region are still limited. Findings: Insects were collected from April 2011 to April 2012, using HP light traps distributed in four residential areas and one recreational area in Rio Branco, Capital of the State of Acre in the Amazon region of Brazil. A total of 456 sand flies were collected, comprising 256 females and 200 males. Taxonomic identification revealed 16 Phlebotominae genera and 23 species, as follows: Trichophoromyia auraensis, Nyssomyia whitmani, Nyssomyia antunesi, Pressatia choti, Evandromyia saulensis, Evandromyia walkeri, Evandromyia begonae, Migonemyia migonei, Pintomyia serrana, Psychodopygus paraensis, Sciopemyia sordelii, Migonemyia pusilla, Pintomyia nevesi, Brumptomyia avellari, Micropygomyia acanthopharynx, Micropygomyia micropyga, Pintomyia odax, Lutzomyia sherlocki, Pressatia calcarata, Pressatia duncanae, Bichromomyia flaviscutellata, Evandromyia bourrouli and Evandromyia bacula. From this group, Tr. auraensis and Ny. whitmani were the most abundant species in both forested areas and the peridomiciliary environment. Conclusions: We find that the sand fly fauna in the urban and peri urban areas of Rio Branco is very diverse comprising 23 species, as diverse as that in areas of primary forest. Some species, such as Nyssomyia whitmani, Ny. antunesi and Bichromomyia flaviscutellata are known vectors of parasites responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis, and Trichophoromyia auraensis is a putative vector in this Amazonian region...|$|R
40|$|Background A {{voluntary}} surveillance {{scheme of}} occupational skin diseases (OSDs) in The Netherlands starting in 2001 aimed to improve insight {{in the incidence}} of OSD especially occupational contact dermatitis (OCD), risk professions and causal agents. This paper presents the results of this scheme during 2001 - 05. Methods Reports of new cases of OSD received from the participating dermatologists on a monthly basis were analysed. Data evaluated included information on diagnosis, sex, age, sickness, absenteeism, profession and causal agents. Relative differences in incidence rates between industries or branches were estimated by calculating incidence rate ratios. Results About 80 % of the <b>notifications</b> <b>concerned</b> OCD. The highest number of notifications was recorded {{in the first year of}} the scheme. This was probably due to reporting of a mixture of incident and prevalent cases. During the following 5 years, the number of yearly notifications of OSD declined. Hairdressers, nurses, metalworkers, mechanics and cleaners were the most commonly affected professions. Wet work and irritating substances were the most frequently reported causal agents. Most patients with OCD were not absent from work. Conclusions A voluntary surveillance scheme with dermatologists provides valuable data about the distribution of OCD in risk professions and the causal agents. However, it has certain limitations in assessing trends in incidence. Active medical surveillance in populations at risk should be encouraged not only to improve secondary prevention but also to obtain more reliable information about the incidence of OC...|$|R

40|$|When the {{municipal}} {{child welfare services}} in Norway receive <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> regarding a child {{they are responsible for}} reviewing the general situation and assistance requirements of the relevant child and determining whether the case should be dismissed or not. In this dissertation we will consider a study carried out by three municipal child welfare institutions on <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> and requests for assistance that involve nine families with altogether 19 children aged between 2 and 12. I will focus on discursive forms of practice and perspectives of children that relate to the studies carried out by the child welfare authorities and also have {{a closer look at the}} consequences these may have for the relevant children. I have collected data on the <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> and requests for assistance which formed the basis of the study of 9 cases by the child welfare authorities, including the child welfare workers’ analytical procedures, the questions and thematic focus of the study, who had been invited to contribute information, their narratives of the child’s situation and assistance requirements and the child welfare workers’ own conclusions and decisions in these cases. I have also carried out interviews with child welfare workers, parents and children who have been involved in the above mentioned inquiry. The analysis of the empirical material has been inspired by Michel Foucault and Norman Fairclough. They are both concerned with the role of language and discourse in the development of practises. With the help of a micro-analytical focus I have attempted to make some interpretations with regard to the tendencies and practises I have discussed in the analysis. The <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern,</b> on which the study of the child welfare authorities were based, centred on children’s behaviour/manners, delays in children’s evolution, violence between parents in the presence of children, the mental health of parents, suspicions of sexual abuse and allegations about gross neglect. Parents who themselves have been in touch with the child welfare authorities and requested assistance emphasized the challenges of their daily workload and asked for relief. The three municipal child welfare institutions in part relied on different approaches (different research models and research categories) in order to examine the children’s situation and requirements, regardless of the uniqueness of each case. Most of the informants used by the child welfare authorities were adult persons (parents and various representatives from the professions). In two out of nine cases, children got the opportunity to provide the premises for the decisions reached in the cases. The attitude of the child welfare workers and their inclination to involve children in the research process differed from study to study. However, there was a general tendency to exclude the perspectives and narratives of the children, who were not treated as meaningful subjects in the process of inquiry. There was hardly any emphasis on their rights (the right to information and the right to express opinions). Other discourses were given priority over the discourse of rights. In the process of inquiry, the child welfare workers primarily sought to obtain individual descriptions of children and parents, narratives about the childhood of parents and accounts of interplay within the family. This indicates that child welfare workers rely on psychological knowledge. They also tended to study family networks and to some extent searched for information regarding the everyday life and its structure within the families. There was little focus on living conditions or how the family members handled various challenges in their daily lives. For the most part, deviant children (the children were described in terms of delayed development, lack of social skills, lack of empathy, ADHD, and similar things) and parents who failed in their parenting duties or parents who had requested assistance were highlighted in the narratives by the various professionals and in the conclusions drawn by the child welfare authorities. The conclusions made by child welfare authorities were marked by a lack of specific and contextual information. In eight of the cases it was decided to offer the parents advice and guidance, whereas relief measures were recommended in two of the cases. One of the cases was dismissed. A decision to offer concrete assistance to the children was not reached in any of the cases, in spite of specific measures to assist the children having been mentioned in a number of the cases. The children are constituted as something different than the adults. This difference is not only linguistically generated through the way we talk about them, but also through the fact that child welfare workers largely ignore them in the process of inquiry. This reflects the hegemony of knowledge that prevails within the current child welfare services, how knowledge becomes productive with regard to the positioning of children and parents. Both the <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> and the studies of the child welfare authorities demonstrate that the language we use is not neutral. The use of language (academic terms) and the thematic focus evident in the <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> and studies were closely related to the specific task and institutional connections of the various participants. In relation to the inquiries and decisions carried out by the child welfare authorities, several discourses together form a certain order of discourse. I have attempted to show that the research practise of the child welfare authorities is not only marked by legal and economic power structures, but also that the power of knowledge strongly affects how the child welfare services are ru...|$|R

When disaster strikes, despite having tenable plans for routine replenishment and operations, many organizations find themselves ill-prepared, ill-equipped, and without effective mechanisms in place to sustain operations during {{the immediate aftermath of}} a crisis. Health care operations can be abruptly halted due to the non-availability of supply. The purpose of this work is to add to a necessary, growing body of works related specifically to health care logistics preparedness and disaster mitigation. Logistics management is a specialized genre of expertise within the health care industry and is largely contributive to {{the success or failure of}} health care organizations. Logistics management requires extensive collaboration among multiple stakeholders&#x 2014;internal and external to an organization.

One critical aspect of disaster planning is regard for competent logistics management and the effective provision of necessary items when they are needed most. In many communities, there seems to be little evidence available regarding health care logistics involvement in disaster planning; at times, evidence of planning efforts perceptibly end at intra-organizational doors within facilities. Strategic planners are being continually reminded that health care organizations serve a principal role in emergency preparedness planning and must be prepared to fulfill the associated possibilities without <b>notification.</b> The <b>concern</b> is that not enough attention is being paid to repeated lessons being observed in disasters and emergency events...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} Korea’s fair disclosure regulation on the timeliness and informativeness of earnings announcements. The present regulation for Korean listed firms requires that if a company’s sales revenue, operating income (or loss) and net income (or loss) have changed by over 30 % compared to the prior year, the firm must disclose this information through a preliminary financial report (PFR) even before the company is audited by external auditors. To analyze {{the effects of this}} policy, we first investigate the timeliness of preliminary financial report disclosures. We examine the extent to which Korean listed companies actually comply with the requirement for prompt <b>notification</b> of information <b>concerning</b> material changes in financial performance. Second, we investigate the informativeness of preliminary financial reports by analyzing differential stock market reactions to different timings of preliminary financial report disclosures. Our empirical results reveal {{that more than half of}} our sample firms release their preliminary financial reports after external audits are completed, thereby potentially invalidating the effectiveness of the regulation. In addition, we find that preliminary financial reports have information value only if they are disclosed prior to annual audit report dates. This finding supports the notion that timeliness increases the informativeness of preliminary financial report disclosure by curbing insiders’ ability to potentially profit from their information advantage...|$|R

We sought to describe the outcomes of <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> regarding the health, performance, and conduct of health practitioners from ten professions in Australia and to identify factors associated with the imposition of restrictive actions. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all notifications lodged with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency over 24  months. Notifications were followed for 30 - 54 months. Our main outcome was restrictive actions, defined as decisions that imposed undertakings, conditions, or suspension or cancellation of registration. RESULTS: There were 8307 notifications. The notification rate was highest among doctors (IR[*]=[*] 14. 5 per 1000 practitioners per year) and dentists (IR[*]=[*] 20. 7) and lowest among nurses and midwives (IR[*]=[*] 2. 0). One in ten notifications resulted in restrictive action; fewer than one in 300 notifications resulted in suspension or cancellation of registration. Compared with notifications about clinical care, the odds of restrictive action were higher for notifications relating to health impairments (drug misuse, OR[*]=[*] 7. 0; alcohol misuse, OR[*]=[*] 4. 6; mental illness, OR[*]=[*] 4. 1, physical or cognitive illness, OR[*]=[*] 3. 7), unlawful prescribing or use of medications (OR[*]=[*] 2. 1) and violation of sexual boundaries (OR[*]=[*] 1. 7). The odds were higher where the report was made by another health practitioner (OR[*]=[*] 2. 9) or employer (OR[*]=[*] 6. 9) rather than a patient or relative. Nurses and midwives (OR[*]=[*] 1. 8), psychologists (OR[*]=[*] 4. 5), dentists (OR[*]=[*] 4. 7), and other health practitioners (OR[*]=[*] 5. 3) all had greater odds of being subject to restrictive actions than doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Restrictive actions are the strongest measures health practitioner boards can take {{to protect the public}} from harm and these actions can have profound effects on the livelihood, reputations and well-being of practitioners. In Australia, restrictive actions are rarely imposed and there is variation in their use depending on the source of the notification, the type of issue involved, and the profession of the practitioner.

40|$|Numerous {{inquiries}} into {{child protection}} services in Australia and internationally {{have concluded that}} failures in child protection service responses are in large part attributable to: rising demand on child protection services; a workforce suffering low morale who are ill-equipped for the role; families receiving {{too little too late}} in the form of intervention; and a rising population of children in care paired with a lack of suitable placements. Data on children coming to the attention of state/territory child protection authorities show that, since collation of the data commenced, the workload of these departments has escalated {{in terms of the number}} of concerns raised about child welfare. Looking at patterns of <b>notifications</b> (reports of <b>concerns</b> relating to the abuse/neglect of children) over the past two decades, the scale of the increase can be readily observed, whether considering the absolute number of notifications (which reflects the initial workload, as departmental staff need to screen and potentially respond to these), or the rate of notifications per thousand children in the population. A fairly consistent trend across Australia over the past decades is that around one in every five or six of the concerns notified to statutory child protection departments are substantiated (i. e., meet the threshold for a department to intervene due to the child/young person having been harmed, or being at risk of harm from abuse/neglect). This leaves around four in every five cases where there is no legislative grounds for intervention, and yet some level of vulnerability, need or risk has been notified. In this chapter of Families, policy and the law, we briefly consider the historical origins that underpin the current approach to child protection in Australia, discuss the theory and intent underpinning current reforms, and discuss the promise of a public health approach and why it appears not to be delivering the desired outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{mandatory}} bovine abortion {{notification system}} in France aims to detect {{as soon as}} possible any resurgence of bovine brucellosis. However, under-reporting seems to be a major limitation of this system. We used a unilist capture-recapture approach to assess the sensitivity, i. e. the proportion of farmers who reported at least one abortion among those who detected such events, and representativeness of the system during 2006 - 2011. We implemented a zero-inflated Poisson model to estimate the proportion of farmers who detected at least one abortion, and among them, the proportion of farmers not reporting. We also applied a hurdle model to evaluate the effect of factors influencing the notification process. We found that the overall surveillance sensitivity was about 34 %, and was higher in beef than dairy cattle farms. The observed increase in the proportion of notifying farmers from 2007 to 2009 resulted from an increase in the surveillance sensitivity in 2007 / 2008 and an increase in the proportion of farmers who detected at least one abortion in 2008 / 2009. These patterns suggest a raise in farmers' awareness in 2007 / 2008 when the Bluetongue Virus (BTV) was detected in France, followed by {{an increase in the number}} of abortions in 2008 / 2009 as BTV spread across the country. Our study indicated a lack of sensitivity of the mandatory bovine abortion <b>notification</b> system, raising <b>concerns</b> about the ability to detect brucellosis outbreaks early. With the increasing need to survey the zoonotic Rift Valley Fever and Q fever diseases that may also cause bovine abortions, our approach is of primary interest for animal health stakeholders to develop information programs to increase abortion notifications. Our framework combining hurdle and ZIP models may also be applied to estimate the completeness of other clinical surveillance systems. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
