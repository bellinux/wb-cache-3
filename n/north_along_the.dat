5|$|North of Bloor Street, {{the wide}} valley floor became {{dominated}} by industrial {{concerns of the}} Taylor family, including the Don Valley Brick Works. The area from the Forks of the Don and <b>north</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s.

5|$|The Palisades Interstate Parkway {{begins at}} the George Washington Bridge (GWB) in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Passengers from the upper level of the GWB can {{directly}} get on the PIP northbound, while passengers from the lower level of the bridge must travel through GWB Plaza on US9W before getting on the parkway. Passengers riding northbound on the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) must be in local lanes to directly get on the PIP. Once the PIP leaves the GWB, it proceeds <b>north</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey Palisades, past the Englewood Cliffs Service Area. Unlike service areas further <b>north</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> parkway, there are two in Englewood, one for northbound drivers and one for southbound drivers. The others are in the center median shared by drivers going in both directions. There are also three different scenic lookout points over the Palisades near {{the northern tip of}} the island of Manhattan at the Harlem River. After this, the PIP parallels US9W and the Hudson River for its entire run in New Jersey. All four exits in New Jersey are either with US9W, or within mere feet of the route. The PIP leaves New Jersey into New York in the borough of Rockleigh.|$|E

5|$|The fleet {{then moved}} <b>north</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Ionian coast towards Samos, before {{abruptly}} turning west into the Aegean Sea. The fleet sailed next to Naxos, {{in order to}} punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition that the Persians had mounted there a decade earlier. Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; those that the Persians caught were enslaved. The Persians then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians.|$|E

The modest houses built in the same size and type of construction were laid along a network of roads.|$|E
5|$|At the Pennsylvania {{state line}} in South Valley, PA346 exits the Allegheny National Forest and becomes NY280 upon {{entering}} New York. The route heads <b>north</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern edge of}} the Allegheny Reservoir as East Bank Perimeter Road, clipping the southwestern corner of Allegany State Park prior to entering the Allegany Indian Reservation. NY280 passes {{in and out of the}} park once more before turning to the east toward Quaker Lake as it enters the town of Coldspring. At Quaker Lake, NY280 penetrates the park boundary once more and intersects Allegany State Park Route3 (ASP Route3) at the Quaker Run entrance. Here, NY280 turns north, traversing a small waterway separating Quaker Lake from the reservoir before reentering the Allegany Indian Reservation limits.|$|E

5|$|During their {{fighting}} retreat up the Rhône, the Germans also withdrew {{their remaining}} forces from their garrisons in south-western France. These divisions raced <b>north</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic coast and then swung towards the east at the Loire {{to link up}} {{with the rest of}} Army GroupG at Burgundy. While {{they did not have to}} fight the Western Allies as much as the Germans had done at the Rhône, they still had to advance through French partisan-dominated terrain. About 88,000 men moved north, leaving 20,000 in south-western France behind. During the retreat, about 19,000 men were captured by the Allies and 60,000 men reached Army GroupG's line, where they were integrated into the defense of the Vosges mountains.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, road users {{wishing to}} go from Saltash to Plymouth had two main choices. Travel by coach {{involved}} a long detour north either to Gunnislake New Bridge (a one-lane bridge constructed in 1520), or other bridges further <b>north</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Devon – Cornwall border. The alternative was to catch a ferry across the Tamar. The Torpoint Ferry had been running successfully since 1791 (and is still in active service) while the Saltash Ferry ran near to the bridge's present location. While popular, the ferries did not have sufficient capacity by the 20th century to cater for motor traffic. The idea for a fixed crossing across the Tamar had been floated around since the early 19th century, and proposals had been discussed in Parliament as early as 1930.|$|E
5|$|I-35E was {{completed}} {{north of downtown}} Saint Paul in 1970. The first section to open ran north from Maryland Avenue in Saint Paul to I-694 in Little Canada; this {{was completed}} in the early 1960s, concurrently with I-694 west to old MN49 (Rice Street). Later that decade, I-35E was extended south to downtown Saint Paul, opening first to Pennsylvania Avenue and then to I-94, including the I-35E / I-94 concurrency (and I-94 in both directions). In 1970, I-35E was extended <b>north</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> I-35E / I-694 concurrency in Little Canada– Vadnais Heights and also extended northbound to its northern terminus at Columbus near Forest Lake; the adjacent sections of I-35, I-35W, and I-694 opened {{at about the same}} time.|$|E
