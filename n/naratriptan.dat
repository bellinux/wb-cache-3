50|$|Since December 23, 2014 in Canada both generic {{versions}} of <b>naratriptan</b> have been unavailable to consumers {{because of a}} quarantine on the only two sites producing the necessary ingredient used by Sandoz and Teva for distribution in Canada: IPCA Laboratories in Pithampur, India and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories in Srikakulam, India.|$|E
50|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 53 clinical trials {{has shown that}} all triptans are effective for treating migraine at marketed doses and that <b>naratriptan,</b> although less effective than sumatriptan and rizatriptan was more effective than placebo in reducing migraine symptoms at two hours and efficacy was demonstrated in almost two thirds of subjects after four hours of treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Triptans are {{specific}} and selective agonists for the 5-HT1 receptors. Sumatriptan binds to 5-HT1D receptors, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, <b>naratriptan,</b> almotriptan, and frovatriptan binds to 5-HT1B/1D and eletriptan binds to 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptors. Triptans {{are believed to}} exert their effects through vasoconstriction, leading to reduced carotid arterial circulation without affecting cerebral blood flow, peripheral neuronal inhibition, or inhibition of transmission through second order neurons of the trigeminocervical complex.|$|E
50|$|All triptans have an indole {{structure}} {{identical to}} the neurotransmitter 5-HT. Classic triptan structure contain side chain on the indole ring, and a basic nitrogen in a similar distance from the indole structure. The main structural difference of the triptans is {{the position of the}} sulfonamide and the side chain attached to it (see figure 1 and table 1). Rizatriptan and zolmitriptan have instead of a sulfonamide a triazole and 2-oxazolidone respectively. Another exception to the classic structure is seen on eletriptan where the nitrogen-alkyl chain connected to the indole ring is replaced with a dimethyl-pyrrolidine, and in <b>naratriptan</b> where the nitrogen-alkyl chain is replaced with an 1-methyl-piperidine ring.|$|E
50|$|Sumatriptan was {{the pioneer}} drug in this class. The second generation's triptans such as zolmitriptan, <b>naratriptan,</b> rizatriptan, almotriptan, {{eletriptan}} and frovatriptan soon became available.Different triptans {{are available in}} different formulations and in different strengths (see table 2). They have been formulated as subcutaneous injections, oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal spray and as rectal suppositories. Delivery system of the triptans may {{play an important role}} in the onset of action. The selection of anti-migraine drug for patients depends on their symptoms. The first selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan, was first synthesized as a subcutaneous injection, then as an oral tablets and more recently as a nasal spray, it is also available in some countries as suppositories. The subcutaneous injection is the fastest way to stop a rapidly progressing migraine attacks. The sumatriptan nasal spray provides faster onset of action than the tablets but it produces a similar headache response at 2 hours. Some patients prefer the nasal spray as it works more rapidly than the tablets and does not have as many adverse effects as the subcutaneous injection. Nasal spray is although not suitable for all patients, because some patients experience bad taste and lack of consistency of response. Zolmitriptan was developed with the strategy to create a more lipophilic compound, with faster absorption and better ability to cross the blood brain barrier than sumatriptan. It is available as tablets, orally disintegrating tablets and as nasal spray in some countries. Rizatriptan is available as tablets and orally disintegrating tablets but <b>naratriptan,</b> almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan are only available in tablets, for now.|$|E

40|$|Preclinical {{pharmacological}} {{profile of}} the selective 5 -HT 1 F receptor agonist lasmiditan. A comment We read with great interest the article Preclinical phar-macological {{profile of the}} selective 5 -HT 1 F receptor agonist lasmiditan by Nelson et al., published in Cephalalgia (1). In our clinical practice {{we are looking for}} new effec-tive drugs without adverse events in the treatment of acute migraine attack. Lasmiditan seems promising, as we can see from the study of Ferrari et al. (2) in the same issue of Cephalalgia. In the article of Nelson et al. (1), Table 3 reports that 5 -HT 1 F EC 50 (the concentration that produces 50 % of the maximal response) is 19. 4 1. 8 nM for <b>naratriptan,</b> 43. 1 2. 6 nM for lasmiditan and 2540 210 nM for rizatriptan. These data, we believe, are interpretable as <b>naratriptan</b> showing an affinity 2 -fold greater than lasmiditan and about 1300 -fold greater than rizatriptan on the 5 -HT 1 F receptor. We know that among the triptans <b>naratriptan</b> is per-haps the least effective, and it is used preferentially as short prophylactic treatment because of its long half-life. From reading these data (1) {{it is difficult to see}} how lasmiditan, a less potent drug for the 5 -HT 1 F receptor and without other specific actions on other 5 HT recep-tors, could have a greater efficacy than <b>naratriptan.</b> Furthermore, the lack of clinical correlation between the highly effective triptan rizatriptan, which has a very low affinity for 5 -HT 1 F receptors, and <b>naratriptan</b> could cast doubts about the relevance of 5 -HT 1 F receptor affinity on the efficacy of lasmiditan and, more generally, about their role in the pathogenesis of migraine attack. These differences are not commented on in the arti-cle (1) except for the statement that the triptans show a large variability in their potencies on the 5 HT 1 F recep-tor.

40|$|Because the "intensity dependence" of {{cortical}} {{auditory evoked potentials}} (IDAP) {{is under}} serotonergic control, {{it can be used}} to assess central antimigraine effects of 5 HT 1 B/ 1 D agonists. We measured IDAP before and 2 h after <b>naratriptan</b> (5 mg, n = 19) and zolmitriptan (5 mg, n = 19) in healthy volunteers. IDAP was expressed as the amplitude-stimulus intensity function ("ASF slope"). <b>Naratriptan</b> tended to increase ASF slope (mean difference 0. 23 +/- 0. 62 microV/ 10 dB, p = 0. 06) while zolmitriptan (0. 08 +/- 0. 95 microV/ 10 dB, p = 0. 35) did not. We assessed the suitability of IDAP for measuring central antimigraine drug effects using repeatability data (see companion paper). We calculated the trade-off between the size of the expected drug effects (ASF slope difference) and the necessary sample size.

40|$|The {{observation}} that 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) {{is effective in}} treating acute attacks of migraine when administered intravenously resulted in a research effort {{that led to the}} discovery of the 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonist sumatriptan. Clinical experience has shown sumatriptan to be an effective treatment with some limitations, such as relatively poor bioavailability, which <b>naratriptan</b> was developed to address. Increasing bioavailability has been achieved with greater lipophilicity and thus the potential for greater activity in the central nervous system. In this study the increased access to central sites has been exploited in an attempt to characterize the pharmacology of those central receptors with the newer tools available. Trigeminovascular activation was examined in the model of superior sagittal sinus stimulation. Cats were anaesthetized with α-chloralose (60 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, intraperitoneal), paralyzed (gallamine 6 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, intravenously) and ventilated. The superior sagittal sinus was accessed and isolated for electrical stimulation (250 [*]μs pulses, 0. 3 [*]Hz, 100 [*]V) by a mid-line circular craniotomy. The region of the dorsal surface of C 2 spinal cord was exposed by a laminectomy and an electrode placed for recording evoked activity from sinus stimulation. Stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus resulted in activation of cells in the dorsal horn of C 2. Cells fired with a probability of 0. 69 ± 0. 1 at a latency of 9. 2 ± 0. 2 [*]ms. Intravenous (i. v.) administration of <b>naratriptan</b> at clinically relevant doses (30 and 100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), inhibited neuronal activity in trigeminal neurones of the C 2 dorsal horn, reducing probability of firing without affecting latency. The effect of <b>naratriptan</b> could be reversed by administration of the selective 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor antagonist GR 127935 (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.). These data establish that <b>naratriptan</b> acts on central trigeminal neurones since sagittal sinus stimulation activates axons within the tentorial nerve and there are no inhibitory effects mediated within the trigeminal ganglion. Furthermore, given that this inhibition could be reversed by the relatively selective 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor antagonist GR 127935, it is highly likely that the anti-migraine effects of drugs of this class with central nervous system access are mediated, at least in part, by 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptors within the trigeminal nucleus...|$|E

40|$|The c-AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and its {{phosphorylated}} product (P-CREB) are nuclear proteins expressed after {{stimulation of}} pain-producing {{areas of the}} spinal cord. There is evidence indicating that central sensitization within dorsal horn neurons is dependent on P-CREB transcriptional regulation. The objectives {{of the study were}} to investigate the expression of P-CREB in cells in rat trigeminal nucleus caudalis after noxious stimulation and to determine whether pre-treatment with specific anti-migraine agents modulate this expression. CREB and P-CREB labelling was investigated within the trigeminal caudalis by immunohistochemistry after capsaicin stimulation. Subsequently, the effect of i. v. pre-treatment with either sumatriptan (n =  5), or <b>naratriptan</b> (n =  7) on P-CREB expression was studied.

40|$|Rizatriptan (Maxalt(R); Maxalt-MLT(R); Maxalt-Melt(R)) is an oral {{serotonin}} 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D {{receptor agonist}} (triptan) {{used in the}} acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Rizatriptan 5 mg and 10 mg are effective in relieving the symptoms of migraine and the 10 mg dose provided faster pain relief than sumatriptan 50 mg, <b>naratriptan</b> 2. 5 mg, ergotamine/caffeine 2 mg/ 200 mg and possibly zolmitriptan 2. 5 mg, while displaying similar tolerability. Two cost-utility analyses performed from a societal perspective indicated that rizatriptan 10 mg was dominant over ergotamine/caffeine 2 mg/ 200 mg, sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg, <b>naratriptan</b> 2. 5 mg, zolmitriptan 2. 5 mg and analgesic-based usual care in the acute treatment of migraine. In one analysis also performed {{from the perspective of}} a healthcare payer, rizatriptan was still dominant over <b>naratriptan,</b> sumatriptan and zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was cost effective compared with usual care with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of $Can 31 _ 845 (2002 values) and an incremental cost per additional attack aborted of $Can 49. 82. A modelled cost-effectiveness analysis conducted from a healthcare payer's perspective indicated that almotriptan 12. 5 mg was more cost effective than rizatriptan 10 mg as a result of better tolerability. The incremental cost per additional successfully treated patient (defined as being sustained pain free without adverse events) with almotriptan was $US 6. 94 (1999 values). In other nonmodelled cost-effectiveness analyses, rizatriptan 10 mg, eletriptan 40 mg and almotriptan 12. 5 mg most consistently displayed the greatest cost effectiveness in different analyses using different clinical endpoints. A modelled analysis of the costs of migraine-related productivity losses in US corporations indicated that the use of rizatriptan rather than usual care to treat migraines could result in annual cost offsets of approximately $US 84 - 118 (2000 values) per employee in lost productivity avoided. An intervention study in Spanish postal service workers demonstrated that replacement of usual care with rizatriptan reduced the mean per-patient cost of lost productivity per migraine attack from _ 34. 47 (2001 / 2002 values) before the intervention to _ 13. 94 and _ 4. 59 for the first and second post-intervention migraine attacks. In conclusion, rizatriptan is one of the more clinically effective and therefore cost-effective oral triptans available for the acute treatment of migraine. The available data from cost-utility analyses suggest that rizatriptan is more cost effective than ergotamine/caffeine, simple analgesics, <b>naratriptan,</b> zolmitriptan and sumatriptan. The economic value of rizatriptan depends on the payer's perspective, as the greatest savings can be expected to be achieved in terms of reduced migraine-related loss of work productivity compared with less effective treatments. For healthcare payers, the high acquisition cost appears to be at least partly offset by reduced migraine-related healthcare resource use when compared with usual care. The comparative cost effectiveness of the newer triptans requires further elucidation from comprehensive direct comparisons.

40|$|In {{the past}} 10 years, {{there have been}} great {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} the pathophysiology of the migraine. This has been {{due in part to the}} realization that the migraine attack can be blocked by activating the serotonin receptor, namely the 5 -hydroxytryptamine/ 1 D receptor. This switches off the inflammatory process around the blood vessel, which is the cause of the migraine pain, and constricts the blood vessel involved, thus relieving pressure on it. The first drug that was developed to activate this system was sumatriptan, followed by zomitriptan, <b>naratriptan</b> and rizatriptan. These drugs are, as a group, called the 'triptans'.

40|$|Sumatriptan or {{eletriptan}} produced vasocontraction {{in common}} carotid artery (CCA) by stimulating 5 HT 1 B receptors (see also Akin & Gurdal, this issue). <b>Naratriptan</b> as a 5 HT 1 B/D agonist, {{was unable to}} produce vasocontraction in this artery, but inhibited the vasocontractile response induced by sumatriptan or eletriptan.

All patients had similar profiles of headache characteristics and consumption (quality and quantity) of SM before initiation of the treatment, but most were not severe headache sufferers, heavy SM overusers or were overusing opioids. After 5 weeks the headach...|$|E
40|$|The current {{evidence-based}} guideline on self-medication in migraine and tension-type headache of the German, Austrian and Swiss headache {{societies and}} the German Society of Neurology is addressed to physicians engaged {{in primary care}} as well as pharmacists and patients. The guideline is especially concerned with {{the description of the}} methodology used, the selection process of the literature used and which evidence the recommendations are based upon. The following recommendations about self-medication in migraine attacks can be made: The efficacy of the fixed-dose combination of acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine and the monotherapies with ibuprofen or <b>naratriptan</b> or acetaminophen or phenazone are scientifically proven and recommended as first-line therapy. None of the substances used in self-medication in migraine prophylaxis can be seen as effective. Concerning the self-medication in tension-type headache, the following therapies can be recommended as first-line therapy: the fixed-dose combination of acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine as well as the fixed combination of acetaminophen and caffeine as well as the monotherapies with ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid or diclofenac. The four scientific societies hope that this guideline will help to improve the treatment of headaches which largely is initiated by the patients themselves without any consultation with their physicians...|$|E
40|$|Background: Migraine is a common, chronic, {{neurovascular}} disorder, generally characterised by {{attacks of}} severe headache and {{autonomic nervous system}} dysfunction. Triptans are selective serotonin 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonists that represent effective therapeutic options for moderate-to-severe migraine attacks but with higher acquisition costs relative to usual care therapies. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the cost effectiveness of rizatriptan treatment compared with `Usual Care' or other triptans available in Canada for patients with moderate-to-severe migraine for whom other therapies (e. g. NSAIDs, simple analgesics) are insufficient or contraindicated. Methods: A decision-analysis model was created to estimate migraine treatment costs over a 24 -hour period in patients with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe migraine as defined by the International Headache Society criteria. Costs and clinical outcomes were observed over a 24 -hour period from therapy initiation. Efficacy measures consisted of `pain-free response at 2 hours' and `sustained pain free for 2 - 24 hours'. Oral rizatriptan 10 mg was compared with other oral triptans (i. e. sumatriptan 50 or 100 mg), <b>naratriptan</b> 2. 5 mg and zolmitriptan 2. 5 mg, based on a meta-analysis and compared with `Usual Care' based on a naturalistic study of people who experience migraine and who were similar to the target population. `Usual Care' was defined as an aggregate of medications prescribed for the Canadian population for the indication of migraine, weighted by the relative frequency of use of prescriptions over a 1 -year period. Analyses were conducted from the Ontario (Canada) Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOH<C) perspective and the broader societal perspective. Results are presented as the cost per migraine attack aborted (i. e. pain free at 2 hours), as well as the cost per QALY. Several one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. All costs are expressed in 2002 $Can. Results: Cost estimates are similar to previously published Canadian studies. Rizatriptan compared with `Usual Care' produced an incremental cost per attack aborted of $Can 49. 82 and a cost per QALY gained of $Can 31 _ 845 from the MOH<C perspective. When a societal perspective was considered (which included time loss from paid and unpaid work activities), rizatriptan dominates `Usual Care': that is, it is cost saving and more effective. All other triptans are also dominated by rizatriptan as they offer higher costs and lower efficacy. Conclusions: This study shows that rizatriptan treatment for patients who experience moderate-to-severe migraines may represent a cost-effective strategy for improving care of migraine patients in Canada.
