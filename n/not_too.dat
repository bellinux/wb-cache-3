These distinctly exceed the tree line. In Greenland, the habitat may reach the 77th latitude line. The Myxogastria species reach their largest biodiversity and highest frequency in forests of temperate regions, which are ideal habitats because of the amount of rich organic material, suitable humidity (<b>not</b> <b>too</b> high) and long-lasting snow cover for snow-inhabiting species.|$|E
