40|$|Household {{aerosols}} are self-contained handheld {{devices for}} spraying {{products such as}} air fresheners, hairspray, surface cleaners, polishes, and deodorants. Industrial aerosols are similar devices for spraying: cleaners, lubricants, paints, and adhesives. They also have hospital and specific medical uses for spraying coagulants and disinfectants. Worldwide around 20 billion devices are manufactured annually and the UK has a major share of this market, manufacturing 5 billion units, {{second only to the}} USA. Led by the Californian Air Resources Board (CARB) in 2001, there is mounting pressure for the use of liquefied gas propellants (volatile organic compounds) in aerosol cans to be banned. This paper addresses the challenges of creating a fine spray using a pressurized inert gas (<b>non-VOC)</b> as the propellant for household aerosols. The spray produced has to achieve a relative performance to that of a traditional fine spray VOC propellant aerosol with regard to droplet size, reach, cone angle, and flow rate. The findings of this work have demonstrated that to achieve a sub- 50 -µm (Dv, 50) spray is extremely challenging when using compressed inert gas and single fluid alone. However, by bleeding air into the insert arrangement, a spray of 24 µm (Dv, 50) can be obtained and this is comparable in droplet size to that produced by a traditional fine spray VOC aerosol...|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper the ozone-forming {{potential}} of n-propyl bromide (NPB) was studied {{with a new}} methodol-ogy designed to address issues associated with a marginal smog-forming compound. However, the U. S. Environ-mental Protection Agency (EPA) subsequently revised its policy and now recommends using the Maximum Incre-mental Reactivity (MIR) scale to rank the ozone-forming potential of all volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in-cluding those of marginal ozone productivity. Neverthe-less, EPA contemplated exceptions to the box-model-derived MIR scale by allowing use of photochemical grid-model simulations for case specific reactivity assessments. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) also uses the MIR scale and CARB has a Reactivity Scientific Advisory Committee that can consider exceptions to the MIR scale. In this study, grid-model simulations that were recom-mended by EPA are {{used to evaluate the}} incremental ozone impacts of NPB using an update to the chemical mechanism developed in an earlier paper. New methods of analysis of the grid-model output are further developed here to quantify the relative reactivities between NPB and ethane over a wide range of conditions. The new grid-model-based analyses show that NPB is significantly dif-ferent and generally less in ozone-forming potential (i. e., reactivity) than predicted by the box-model-based MIR scale relative to ethane, EPA’s “bright-line ” test for <b>non-VOC</b> status. Although NPB has low reactivity compared to typical VOCs on any scale, the new grid-model analyses developed here show that NPB is far less reactive (and even has negative reactivity) compared to the reactivity predicted by the MIR scale...|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} cue {{obtained by}} an animal exhibiting the flehmen response {{is the presence}} of a non-volatile organic compound. In contrast to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), non-volatile organic compounds are those carbon compounds that do not participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions or evaporate under normal atmospheric conditions. The VNO detects <b>non-VOCs,</b> which must have direct contact with the odor source. Sources of <b>non-VOCs</b> relevant to the flehmen response include pheromones and hormones excreted from the genital regions or urine of animals.|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{authors are}} {{developing}} new carbonized board from medium-density fiberboard (MDF) which will has same functionality as white charcoal. New carbonized board from MDF has significant characteristics which are <b>non-VOCs</b> and formaldehyde emission, emitting far-infrared radiation, and electromagnetic shielding [19]. Therefore, {{it can be}} used as deodorization, dehumidification, filtration, and adsorption material. According to Kercher and Nagle [20], carbonized board can be possibly transformed to other shape due to its machinability and be used in industry. We recognized carbonized MDF (c-MDF) for use in indoor construction material as an environment controller due to its ability to absorb formaldehyde, benzene, and toxic VOCs and as replacement of inflammable materials.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of organic}} {{compounds}} in the European Union {{will in the}} future be regulated {{in accordance with the}} Council Directive 1999 / 13 /EC of 11 March 1999 [1]. In this directive, any organic compound {{is considered to be a}} volatile organic compound (VOC) if it has a vapour pressure of 10 Pa or more at 20 oC, or has a corresponding volatility under the particular condition of use. Introduction of such a limit will sometimes create problems, because vapour pressures cannot be determined with an infinite accuracy. Published data on vapour pressures for a true VOC will sometimes be found to be below 10 Pa and vice versa. When the same limit was introduced in the USA, a considerable amount of time and money were spent in vain on comparing incommensurable data [2]. In this paper, a model is presented for prediction of the vapour pressures of VOCs at 20 oC from their chemical (UNIFAC) structure. The model is implemented in a computer program, named P_PREDICT, which has larger prediction power close to 10 Pa at 20 oC than the other models tested. The main advantage of the model, however, is that no experimental data, which will introduce uncertainty in the predictions, is needed. Classification using P_PREDICT, which only predicts one value for a given UNIFAC structure, is proposed. Organic compounds, which can be described by the UNIFAC groups in the present version of P_PREDICT, therefore, can be classified unambiguously as either VOCs or <b>non-VOCs.</b> Most people, including the present authors, feel uneasy about prioritising precision above accuracy. Modelling vapour pressures, however, could save a lot of money and the errors introduced are not large enough to have any substantial adverse effects for neither human beings nor the environment. A method for calculating vapour pressures at other temperatures than 20 oC is tested with a dubious result. This method is used for EU risk assessment of new and existing chemicals...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} effect of county-level air quality regulatory status on polluting behavior across counties. Ozone is regulated subject to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of the Clean Air Act. When a county is out of compliance (or out of attainment) for the ozone standard, the county implements a strict plan for reducing the concentrations of precursors to ozone which are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). I use county-level attainment status for 1 -hour ozone as a proxy for air quality regulatory regime. Regulation of ozone creates a tighter regulatory climate that could spill over and lead to reduced emissions of a large range of pollutants (both regulated and unregulated), primarily those tracked by the EPA 2 ̆ 7 s Toxics Release Inventory. From estimation using panel data in a fixed-effects framework, the results provide support for the existence of spillovers as evidenced by the reduction of <b>non-VOC</b> emissions associated with non-attainment status of 1 -hour ozone and by the reduction of unregulated industrial carbon dioxide emissions. I also use county-level measures of pro-environment voting from the U. S. House of Representatives as a proxy for regional heterogeneity in preferences of citizens for more or less regulation in order to estimate their effect on toxic air emissions at a local level. Even though constructing county-level voting scores from congressional district scores requires a degree of approximation in counties that lie partially in multiple districts, the fact that county lines do not change with the decennial Census allows for measures of emissions activity in specific locations over time when using panel data spanning more than ten years. From estimation using panel data in a fixed-effects framework, the results suggest that allowing for regional heterogeneity in preferences at the county level can explain within-state variation in toxic emissions where state-level aggregates fail to identify such a relationship...|$|E
40|$|Focussing on {{individuals}} and institutions, {{the economic and}} social condition of the people of Fort Cochin between 1781 and 1830 has been studied. This study of the Dutch East India Company's (VOC) establishment on the south west coast of India provides a detailed research into the functioning of the company and its personnel there. To begin the company's presence on the coast around the year 1750, after it had been defeated by the raja of Travancore, on whom it was dependant for purchasing pepper, is summarized. It places the VOC's Malabar Command on the larger web of the VOC network in Asia. The VOC strove hard to maintain its pepper monopoly on the coast, but <b>non-VOC</b> trade in pepper contined. Three consecutive commanders between 1751 and 1764 constantly strove to expand the company's territorial possesions on the coast resulting in a metamorphosis in the command's functioning. The components of the Fort Cochinsociety and the relations among the different communities that made up the social world of Fort Cochin receive attention in the book. Starting with the company men and analysing the recruitment pattern of the VOC in Malabar Command, one is faced with rather startling facts. The majority of the VOC personnel in the mercantile sections were locally recruited. European women were a rare sight in Fort Cochin. The European company men married mestizo women and through them became rooted in Cochin. Their sons joined the Dutch company thereby forming 'VOC-family'. While Dutch men were securing their future on the Malabar Coast, the EIC was expanding in India. During the 1780 - 1784 Anglo-Dutch war, many Dutch settlements were lost to the British. Fort Cochin evaded the fate as the EIC was yet to conquer Mysore, a formidable power in the south. When in 1795, the British forces conquered Fort Cochin, the servants of the Dutch company were forced to decide their future course of action. The social and economic condition of the people of Fort Cochin under the British administration has been analysed and lives of former VOC servants and their families after the transition has been portraye...|$|E
