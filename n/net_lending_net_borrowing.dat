40|$|The initial {{implementation}} of the System of National Accounts (1993) for the United States by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Federal Reserve Board has two significant advantages for economists. First, the SNA are organized according to {{sectors of the economy}} defined by economic agents: firms, financial institutions, consumers, governments {{and the rest of the}} world. Second, the accounts integrate real and financial information, so that one can track not only production of, income from, and use of output, but also <b>net</b> <b>lending,</b> <b>net</b> <b>borrowing,</b> and net worth by sector. We exploit these two features in the SNA accounts to examine US economic history leading up to the financial crisis of 2007 and recession of 2008. First, the SNA data show recent increases in leverage in the household sector. We track the household shift to a net lending position through the capital and current accounts of the household sector and then the other SNA sectors. Second, in the financial businesses sector, the accounts largely miss the rise in exposure to the US housing market as well as the critical factors that significantly spread and amplified the housing-market related changes throughout the financial system and the real economy. Finally we present three ways in which SNA-type accounts could be improved to presage a similar future crisis. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper investigates <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> and <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> {{flows of}} the {{institutional}} sectors in Europe since {{the introduction of the}} Euro in 1999. Applying a simple statistical apparatus, this paper is novel in describing the sectoral behavior leading up to and during the crisis. We find that (1) many countries of the Northern group were characterized by low public deficits or even budget surpluses, current account surpluses and a private sector in a <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> position. In countries of the Southern periphery, in the Anglo-Saxon countries as well as in many Eastern European Economies private sector <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> coincided with a budget deficit and substantial current account deficits. (2) With the onset of the crisis private <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> soared in all countries while all governments incurred deficits, consistent with the notion of a balance sheet recession.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the South African household sector finds itself in a <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> or <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> situation and to analyse the situation. Research was done against the background of the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). As suggested by the 1993 SNA, the <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> situation of the South African household sector was calculated in the capital account of the household sector. It became clear that the South African household sector’s saving is in excess of its capital formation, although both components indicated a slight declining trend over the past almost thirty years. Current economic literature was used in focusing on household sector saving and capital formation definitions, categories, motivations and determinants. International situations with regards to saving and capital formation were also compared with that of South Africa, putting the South African situation into perspective. An econometric analysis of net household saving in South Africa for the period 1991 to 2002 indicated five factors that significantly influenced household sector saving over the period. The five factors comprise the income from property, the twelve-month fixed deposit rate, current taxes on income and wealth, compensation of employees and total private consumption expenditure. Making use of further data sets, it became clear that the South African government sector uses the household sector’s excess saving to finance increased current expenditure and does not channel these excess funds towards increased capital formation that would be beneficial for long-term economic growth. This study therefore suggested that the South African household sector should be encouraged to act entrepreneurial, which will lead to increased levels of capital formation, that will in turn contribute to long-term growth, and that can be financed by the current excess saving levels of the household sector. Increased capital formation will lead to increases in productivity and income. This will then enable the household sector to raise its level of saving, that again can be used to finance increased levels of capital formation. The five factors that tested significantly influencing household sector saving in South Africa, were linked to possible policy as well as other initiatives aimed at encouraging household sector saving and capital formation in South Africa. This study concluded by briefly discussing three initiatives currently encouraging and promoting the importance of saving in South Africa. Prof. A. E. Loot...|$|R

These subnational governments may face fiscal stress similar to the federal government. Given {{the nature of the}} partnership among levels of government in providing services to Americans and the economic interrelationships among levels of government, understanding potential future fiscal conditions of the state and local government sector is important for federal policymaking. To provide Congress and the public with this broader context, we developed a fiscal model of the state and local sector. This report describes this model and provides (1) simulations of the state and local government sector's long-term fiscal outlook, (2) an analysis of the underlying causes of potential fiscal difficulties for the sector, (3) a discussion {{of the extent to which}} the long-term simulations are sensitive to alternative assumptions, and (4) an examination of how the state and local government sector could add to future federal fiscal challenges. The potential fiscal outcomes of the state and local government sector are projected through two fiscal balance measures: <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> or <b>borrowing</b> and what we call the operating balance. <b>Net</b> <b>lending</b> or <b>borrowing</b> [...] which is roughly analogous to the federal unified surplus or deficit [...] is a measure of the balance of all receipts and expenditures during a given time frame. Historically, total expenditures have usually exceeded total receipts, and the sector issues debt to cover part of the costs of its capital projects. As such, <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> or <b>borrowing</b> typically measures the need for the sector to borrow funds or draw down assets to cover its expenditures. The operating balance net of funds for capital expenditures [...] referred to in this report as the "operating balance" [...] is a measure of the ability of the sector to cover its current expenditures out of current receipts, that is, the balance of expenditures and receipts related to activities taking place in a given year. Most states have some sort of requirement to balance operating budgets. Projects with longer time frames are typically budgeted separately from the operating budgets and financed by a combination of current receipts, federal grants, and the issuance of debt. Because some current receipts may be used to fund part of longer-term investments, we developed a measure of the operating balance that makes adjustments for the extent to which current receipts are unavailable to fund current expenditures because they have been spent on longer-term projects, such as investments in buildings and roads. ...|$|R

Insertion of financial accounts into the SAM requires the inclusion of flows related to capital accounts and financial asset (or liability) accounts (Emini and Fofack 2004) by each Institutional Sector. More specifically, net savings by institutional sector is a balance of incomes and expenditures. Together with net capital transfers (receivables and payables), net savings by institutional sector is used to accrue the non-financial flows (United Nations 2008).

40|$|Abstract: The System of National Accounts (1993) —and {{the initial}} {{implementation}} of the system for the United States by {{the staff at the}} Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Federal Reserve Board—has two major advantages for economists studying secular trends and cyclical patterns in real and financial macroeconomic activity. First, the SNA are organized according to sectors of the economy defined by the economic agents that allocate. The SNA provides aggregate data separately for firms, financial institutions, consumers, governments {{and the rest of the}} world. Second, the accounts integrate real and financial information, so that one can track not only production and use of output but also <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> and <b>borrowing</b> and <b>net</b> worth by sector. We exploit these two features in the SNA accounts to examine US economic history leading up to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. First, we document the secular changes in household saving and investment in housing and relate them to the contemporaneous changes in the household balance sheet. We track these changes through the capital and current accounts of the SNA sectors. Second, we examine statistics on the financial businesses sector and, while the SNA data provide some indications that a financial storm was brewing, we argue that the accounts largely miss the rise in exposure to the US housing market as well as the critical factors that significantly spread and amplified the housing-market related changes throughout the financial system and the real economy. We conclude by suggesting a few ways in which the SNA data might be augmented with additional information to possibly presage a future crisis sharing key features with the current one.

40|$|This paper aims at {{determining}} whether economic, financial and monetary integration {{on the one}} hand, and institutional factors on the other, {{may have led to}} gradual convergence in key fiscal variables across the euro area over the recent period, bringing fiscal positions closer together. The Maastricht convergence criteria have facilitated this process but we investigate here whether the structural factors bringing fiscal positions closer together have been a feature of European integration starting already in the 1970 s. The alternative scenario is that the euro zone is still characterised by largely idiosyncratic national fiscal policies. Over the 1970 - 1998 period we run contemporaneous cross-correlation, dispersion and cointegration tests using annual data for government <b>net</b> <b>lending,</b> and total current revenue and expenditure to uncover common trends, as measures of fiscal convergence. We also investigate whether the short term fiscal position in a given country shares both a common euro area component and national features (i. e., idiosyncratic national cycles) using a dynamic factor analysis on quarterly data for the four largest euro area countries since 1985. We find convincing evidence that for euro area countries cross-correlation has increased steadily over the sample period and that fiscal dispersion has been declining at a sustained pace among all countries in the sample. There is evidence of cointegration across the euro area for several countries on the basis of total current revenue, and also for total current expenditure. However, when the series are corrected for the business cycle, cointegration is only accepted for <b>net</b> <b>lending.</b> There is clearly common fiscal cycles for <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> across the euro area that do not only express common business cycles. However, while countries have followed more similar policies in the 1990 s in particular during the run-up to EMU, the timing of fiscal adjustment differed across countries.
