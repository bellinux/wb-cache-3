2500|$|... &#0; is not permitted, however, {{because the}} <b>null</b> <b>character</b> {{is one of}} the control {{characters}} excluded from XML, even when using a numeric character reference. An alternative encoding mechanism such as Base64 is needed to represent such characters.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{meaning of this}} character was like NOP - when sent to a printer or a terminal, it does nothing (some terminals, however, incorrectly display it as space). When electromechanical teleprinters were used as computer output devices, one or more <b>null</b> <b>characters</b> were sent {{at the end of}} each printed line to allow time for the mechanism to return to the first printing position on the next line. On punched tape, the character is represented with no holes at all, so a new unpunched tape is initially filled with <b>null</b> <b>characters,</b> and often text could be [...] "inserted" [...] at a reserved space of <b>null</b> <b>characters</b> by punching the new characters into the tape over the nulls.|$|R
2500|$|In Modified UTF-8 (MUTF-8), the <b>null</b> <b>character</b> (U+0000) {{uses the}} two-byte overlong {{encoding}} 110 10 (hexadecimal [...] ), instead of 00000000 (hexadecimal 00). Modified UTF-8 strings never contain any actual null bytes but can contain all Unicode code points including U+0000, which allows such strings (with a null byte appended) {{to be processed}} by traditional null-terminated string functions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{documentation}} the <b>null</b> <b>character</b> {{is sometimes}} {{represented as a}} single-em-width symbol containing the letters [...] "NUL". In Unicode, there is a character with a corresponding glyph for visual representation of the <b>null</b> <b>character,</b> [...] "symbol for null", U+2400 (␀)—not {{to be confused with}} the actual <b>null</b> <b>character,</b> U+0000.|$|E
50|$|Version 2.4 of the {{specification}} prescribes {{that all}} text fields (the fields that {{start with a}} T, except for TXXX) can contain multiple values separated by a <b>null</b> <b>character.</b> The <b>null</b> <b>character</b> varies by character encoding.|$|E

5000|$|... is {{a special}} file in Unix-like {{operating}} systems that provides as many <b>null</b> <b>characters</b> (ASCII NUL, 0x00) as are read from it. One of the typical uses {{is to provide a}} character stream for initializing data storage.|$|R
50|$|Most {{registry}} cleaners cannot repair scenarios such as undeletable registry keys {{caused by}} embedded <b>null</b> <b>characters</b> in their names; only specialized {{tools such as}} the RegDelNull utility (part of the free Sysinternals software) {{are able to do}} this.|$|R

50|$|Specifically, Carmody applied Dirichlet's theorem {{to several}} prime {{candidates}} {{of the form}} k·256n + b, where k was the decimal representation of the original compressed file. Multiplying by a power of 256 adds as many trailing <b>null</b> <b>characters</b> to the gzip file as indicated in the exponent which would still result in the DeCSS C code when unzipped.|$|R
50|$|Each link {{defines a}} {{full-duplex}} (continuous bidirectional transmission and reception) point-to-point connection between two communicating pieces of electronics. Every transmission path has a flow control protocol, {{so that when}} a receiver begins to get too much data, it can turn down the flow. Every transmission path's electronics can send link control data separately from normal data. When a link is idle, it transmits <b>NULL</b> <b>characters.</b> This maintains synchronization, finishes any remaining transmission quickly, and tests the link.|$|R
5000|$|C string literals are null-terminated; {{that is to}} say, a {{trailing}} <b>null</b> <b>character</b> as an end-of-string sentinel: ...|$|E

5000|$|The use {{scope for}} magic quotes was {{expanded}} in PHP 3. Single quotes, double quotes, backslashes and <b>null</b> <b>characters</b> in all user-supplied data {{all have a}} backslash prepended to them before being passed to the script in the , , [...] and [...] global variables. Developers can then in theory use string concatenation to construct safe SQL queries with data provided by the user. (This was most accurate when PHP 2 and PHP 3 were current, since the primary supported databases allowed only 1-byte character sets.) ...|$|R
50|$|A Transport Stream, {{and thereby}} ASI when over coax, can carry one or {{multiple}} SD, HD or audio {{programs that are}} already compressed, {{as opposed to an}} uncompressed SD-SDI (270 Mbit/s) or HD-SDI (1.485 Gbit/s). An ASI signal can be at varying transmission speeds and is completely dependent on the user's engineering requirements. For example, an ATSC (US digital standard for broadcasting) has a specific bit rate of 19.392658 Mbit/s. <b>Null</b> <b>characters,</b> represented by the ASCII comma, are used to pad the transmission to that rate should the media itself not require the entire bitstream.|$|R
50|$|Available datatypes include 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit and (introduced later) 64 bit integers. Microcode level {{support was}} {{available}} for <b>null</b> terminated <b>character</b> strings. However, this is not commonly used.|$|R
50|$|In {{all modern}} {{character}} sets the <b>null</b> <b>character</b> has a code point value of zero. In most encodings this is translated {{to a single}} code unit with a zero value. For instance in UTF-8 it is a single zero byte. However in Modified UTF-8 the <b>null</b> <b>character</b> is encoded as two bytes: 0xC0, 0x80. This allows the byte with the value of zero, which is now not used for any character, {{to be used as}} a string terminator.|$|E
5000|$|Many Unicode control {{characters}} {{are used to}} control the interpretation or display of text, but these characters themselves have no visual or spatial representation. For example, the <b>null</b> <b>character</b> (...) is used in C-programming application environments to indicate {{the end of a}} string of characters. In this way, these programs only require a single starting memory address for a string (as opposed to a starting address and a length), since the string ends once the program reads the <b>null</b> <b>character.</b>|$|E

50|$|Note {{that the}} code point U+0000, {{assigned}} to the <b>null</b> control <b>character,</b> is the only character encoded in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 that is always invalid in any XML 1.0 and 1.1 document.|$|R
50|$|Another {{situation}} where recovery is trivial is if traffic-flow security measures have each station sending a continuous stream of cipher bits, with <b>null</b> <b>characters</b> (e.g. LTRS in Baudot) being sent {{when there is}} no real traffic. This is common in military communications. In that case, and if the transmission channel is not fully loaded, there is a good likelihood that one of the ciphertext streams will be just nulls. The NSA goes to great lengths to prevent keys from being used twice. 1960s-era encryption systems often included a punched card reader for loading keys. The mechanism would automatically cut the card in half when the card was removed, preventing its reuse.|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{analysis}} {{must take}} into account the spelling-change processes of a language as well as its possi- ble configurations of stems, affixes, and infiectional markings. The computational difficulty of the task can be clari- fied by investigating specific models of morphological pro- cessing. The use of finite-state machinery in the "two- level"model by Kimmo Koskenniemi gives it the appear- ance of computational efficiency, but closer examination shows the model does not guarantee efficient processing. Reductions of the satisfiability problem show that finding the proper lexical/surface correspondence in a two-level generation or recognition problem can be computationally difficult. The difficulty increases if unrestricted deletions (<b>null</b> <b>characters)</b> are allowed...|$|R

5000|$|In C {{library and}} Unix conventions, the <b>null</b> <b>character</b> {{is used to}} {{terminate}} text strings; such null-terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for [...] "zero".|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} science, a Procrustean string is a {{fixed length}} string into which strings of varying lengths are placed. If the string inserted is too short, {{then it is}} padded out, usually with spaces or <b>null</b> <b>characters.</b> If the string inserted is too long, it is truncated. The concept is mentioned in the Sinclair ZX81 and Sinclair Spectrum user manuals, where {{a portion of a}} string is replaced by another string using Procrustean assignment—the replacement string is truncated or padded in order to have length equal to the portion being replaced. Although the term did not catch on in wider usage, it appears in some references, notably FOLDOC.|$|R

50|$|Both {{character}} termination {{and length}} codes limit strings: For example, C character arrays that contain <b>null</b> (NUL) <b>characters</b> cannot be handled directly by C string library functions: Strings using a length code {{are limited to}} the maximum value of the length code.|$|R
