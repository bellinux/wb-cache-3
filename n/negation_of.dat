5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion {{in the face of}} sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through <b>negation</b> <b>of</b> the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of <b>negation</b> <b>of</b> the Will. When viewed in this light, Parsifal, with its emphasis on Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E

40|$|A formal {{treatment}} of typed feature structures (TFSs) is developed to augncnt TFSs, so that negative descriptions of then can be treated. Negative descriptions of TFSs can make linguistic descriptions compact and thus easy to understand. Negative descriptions {{can be classified}} into three primitive negative descriptions: (1) <b>negations</b> <b>of</b> type symbols, (2) <b>negations</b> <b>of</b> feature existences, and (3) <b>negations</b> <b>of</b> feature-address value agreements. The forrealization proposed in this paper is based on A'/t-Kaci's complex terms. The first description is treated by extend- ing type symbol lattices to include complement type symbols. The second and third are treated by augmeuting term structures with strncturcs representing these negations. Algorithrm for augnentcd-TFS nnification have been developed using graph nnification, and programs using these algorithms have been writ- ten in C:ommon Lisp...|$|R

If we consider that up to here every negation has only been a relative one, we may ask if {{it is possible to}} say „nothing“ or „not“ in an absolute manner. This attempt is not idle, since great principles, such as that of sufficient reason, possibly make use of an absolute „not. “ How to speak of an "absolute nothing"? - Our negative speech is not exhausted by negation, since opposition, contradiction and difference contain some idea of the negative too.

40|$|In the modal mu-calculus, {{a formula}} is well-formed if each {{recursive}} variable occurs underneath an even number <b>of</b> <b>negations.</b> By means <b>of</b> De Morgan's laws, {{it is easy}} to transform any well-formed formula into an equivalent formula without negations – its negation normal form. Moreover, if the formula is of size n, its <b>negation</b> normal form <b>of</b> is of the same size O(n). The full modal mu-calculus and the negation normal form fragment are thus equally expressive and concise. In this paper we extend this result to the higher-order modal fixed point logic (HFL), an extension of the modal mu-calculus with higher-order recursive predicate transformers. We present a procedure that converts a formula into an equivalent formula without <b>negations</b> <b>of</b> quadratic size in the worst case and of linear size when the number of variables of the formula is fixed...|$|R

25|$|Assuming ZF is consistent, Kurt Gödel {{showed that}} the <b>negation</b> <b>of</b> the axiom of choice is not a theorem of ZF by {{constructing}} an inner model (the constructible universe) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC is consistent. Assuming ZF is consistent, Paul Cohen employed the technique of forcing, developed for this purpose, {{to show that the}} axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the <b>negation</b> <b>of</b> AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C is consistent. Together these results establish that the axiom of choice is logically independent of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.|$|E
