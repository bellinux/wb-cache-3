Oasis had achieved worldwide success with their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe and 1995 follow up (What's the Story) Morning Glory? The third album was highly anticipated by both fans and music critics. Oasis' management company, Ignition, {{were aware of}} the dangers of overexposure, and before release sought to control the media's access to the album. The campaign included limiting pre-release radio airplay and forcing journalists to sign gag orders. The tactics resulted in the alienation of both the press and many industry personnel connected with the band, and fueled large-scale speculation and wide publicity within the British music scene.|$|E

5|$|By the 13th century, {{a need to}} formalize {{the border}} between the Novgorod Republic and the Scandinavian {{countries}} became evident. The Novgorodians, along with the Karelians who came from the south, reached the coast of what <b>now</b> <b>is</b> Pechengsky District and the portion of the coast of Varangerfjord near the Voryema River, which <b>now</b> <b>is</b> a part of Norway. The Sami population was forced to pay tribute. The Norwegians, however, were also attempting to take control of these lands, resulting in armed conflicts. In 1251, a conflict between the Karelians, Novgorodians and the servants of the king of Norway led to the establishment of a Novgorodian mission in Norway. Also in 1251, the first treaty with Norway was signed in Novgorod regarding the Sami lands and the system of tribute collections, making the Sami people pay tribute to both Novgorod and Norway. By the terms of the treaty, Novgorodians could collect tribute from the Sami as far as Lyngen fjord in the west, while Norwegians could collect tribute on the territory of the whole Kola Peninsula except {{in the eastern part of}} Tersky Coast. No state borders were established by the 1251 treaty.|$|E
