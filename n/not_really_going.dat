500|$|The {{next two}} seasons {{were just as}} {{disastrous}} for the team's reputation. Several players, including Wallace, Stoudamire, and Qyntel Woods, were cited for marijuana possession. Woods pleaded guilty to first-degree animal abuse for staging dog fights in his house, some involving his pit bull named Hollywood. Hollywood and Woods' other pit bull, Sugar, were confiscated, and Woods was given eighty hours of community service. He also agreed to donate $10,000 to the Oregon Humane Society. Wallace was suspended for seven games for threatening a referee. Zach Randolph and Patterson got in a fight during practice, with Randolph sucker punching his teammate in the eye, an injury which kept Patterson from making a meaningful contribution during the playoffs. When police came to Stoudamire's house {{to respond to a}} burglar alarm, they noticed the smell of marijuana, searched the premises, and found a pound of cannabis located in a crawlspace; the search was later declared illegal and charges in the matter were dropped. Guard Bonzi Wells famously told Sports Illustrated in a 2002 interview: [...] "We’re <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to worry about what the hell (the fans) think about us. They really don’t matter to us. They can boo us everyday, but they’re still going to ask for our autographs if they see us on the street. That's why they’re fans, and we’re NBA players." [...] Wells was fined $50,000 by the Blazers for the statement.|$|E
500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E

I’ve done it in sparring with some hard kickers to let them know not to kick me anymore. Their legs didn’t break, but they would either take a minute to walk it off or they wouldn’t be kicking me as much. It’s something I’ve definitely been working on, thanks to Longo.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{prosecution}} believed Kraft's former lover, Jeff Graves, {{may have}} assisted Kraft in several murders. Graves, {{who had lived}} with Kraft between 1971 and 1976 (when 16 known murders attributed to Kraft occurred) had been questioned {{in relation to the}} Crotwell abduction and murder in 1975, when he verified part of Kraft's statement to police. When questioned further about the incident following Kraft's arrest in 1983, Graves had informed investigators: [...] "I'm <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to pay for it, you know." ...|$|R

"Now all men," [...] he went on, [...] "look for a space {{upon this}} assegai that I hold up," [...] and {{he lifted the}} bangwan of the {{deceased}} Bombyane high above his head {{so that all the}} multitude could see it. Every eye was fixed upon the broad bright spear. For a while he held it still, then he moved it round and round in a circle, muttering as he did so, and still their gaze followed it. For my part, I watched his movements with the greatest anxiety. That assegai had already been nearer my person than I found at all pleasant, and I had no desire to make a further acquaintance with it. Nor, indeed, was I sure that Indaba-zimbi was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to kill me. I could not understand his proceedings at all, and at the best I did not relish playing the corpus vile to his magical experiments.|$|E
60|$|The little model {{tried to}} answer, but her words would not pass her throat; {{she threw her}} head back trying to free them, and stood, swaying. Seeing her like this before him, white as a sheet, {{with her eyes closed}} and her lips parted, as though about to faint, Hilary seized her by the shoulders. At the touch of those soft shoulders, his face became suffused with blood, his lips trembled. Suddenly her eyes opened ever so little between their lids, and looked at him. And the {{perception}} that she was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to faint, that it was a little desperate wile of this child Delilah, made him wrench away his hands. The moment she felt that grasp relax she sank down and clasped his knees, pressing them to her bosom so that he could not stir. Closer and closer she pressed them to her, till it seemed as though she must be bruising her flesh. Her breath came in sobs; her eyes were closed; her lips quivered upwards. In the clutch of her clinging body there seemed suddenly the whole of woman's power of self-abandonment. It was just that, which, at this moment, so horribly painful to him, prevented Hilary from seizing her in his arms just that queer seeming self-effacement, as though she were lost to knowledge of what she did. It seemed too brutal, too like taking advantage of a child.|$|E
500|$|Cyril Connolly, {{reviewing}} You Only Live Twice in The Sunday Times {{wrote that}} Fleming's latest book was [...] "reactionary, sentimental, square, the Bond-image flails {{its way through}} the middle-brow masses, a relaxation to the great, a stimulus to the humble, the only common denominator between Kennedy and Oswald". The critic for The Times was largely unimpressed with You Only Live Twice, complaining that [...] "as a moderate to middling travelogue what follows will just about do... the plot with its concomitant sadism does <b>not</b> <b>really</b> get <b>going</b> until more than half way through". In contrast to the previous novels, The Times continued, [...] "though Mr. Fleming's macabre imagination is as interesting as ever, some of the old snap seems to have gone". Dealing with the cliffhanger ending to the story, the reviewer wrote that [...] "Mr. Fleming would keep us on tenterhooks, but at this rate of going even his most devoted admirers will free themselves before very long." ...|$|R

Phil starts building the treehouse with Luke's help, but Luke gives up on him after things are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>really</b> well. Phil tries to finish the treehouse alone when his neighbor Andre (Kevin Hart) sees him and offers to help him.|$|R

I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm <b>really</b> <b>not</b> even <b>going</b> to dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it.

6000|$|We {{swept in}} the course of five minutes into the Grand Canal; whereupon she uttered a murmur of ecstasy as fresh {{as if she had been}} a tourist just arrived. She had {{forgotten}} how splendid the great waterway looked on a clear, hot summer evening, and how the sense of floating between marble palaces and reflected lights disposed the mind to sympathetic talk. We floated long and far, and though Miss Tita gave no high-pitched voice to her satisfaction I felt that she surrendered herself. She was more than pleased, she was transported; the whole thing was an immense liberation. The gondola moved with slow strokes, to give her time to enjoy it, and she listened to the plash of the oars, which grew louder and more musically liquid as we passed into narrow canals, as if it were a revelation of Venice. When I asked her how long it was since she had been in a boat she answered, [...] "Oh, I don't know; a long time--not since my aunt began to be ill." [...] This was not the only example she gave me of her extreme vagueness about the previous years and the line which marked off the period when Miss Bordereau flourished. I was not at liberty to keep her out too long, but we took a considerable GIRL before going to the Piazza. I asked her no questions, keeping the conversation on purpose away from her domestic situation and the things I wanted to know; I poured treasures of information about Venice into her ears, described Florence and Rome, discoursed to her on the charms and advantages of travel. She reclined, receptive, on the deep leather cushions, turned her eyes conscientiously to everything I pointed out to her, and never mentioned to me till sometime afterward that she might be supposed to know Florence better than I, as she had lived there for years with Miss Bordereau. At last she asked, with the shy impatience of a child, [...] "Are we <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to the Piazza? That's what I want to see!" [...] I immediately gave the order that we should go straight; and then we sat silent with the expectation of arrival. As some time still passed, however, she said suddenly, of her own movement, [...] "I have found out what is the matter with my aunt: she is afraid you will go!" ...|$|E

5000|$|However, {{on several}} occasions, {{specifically}} on November 23, 1996 during a {{show at the}} Electric Factory in Philadelphia, Maynard James Keenan does grant some insight into another meaning of the song. Speaking to the audience he says, [...] "So, any of you ever watched those Warner Bros. cartoons? Sometimes there's that one where that guy is {{having a tough time}} trying to make a decision. He's got an angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. Seems pretty obvious, right? Usually it's the angel who is kind of the one trying to give him the good advice while the devil is {{trying to get him to}} do what's bad for him. It's not always that simple though. Most times they're <b>not</b> <b>really</b> angels or devils. They're just friends giving you advice, looking out for your best interest but <b>not</b> <b>really</b> understanding what's <b>going</b> to be best for you. So it kind of comes down to you. You have to make the decision yourself... This song is called H." ...|$|R
5000|$|In July 2006, legal {{commentator}} {{and television}} personality Nancy Grace interviewed Elizabeth Smart, purportedly {{to talk about}} pending legislation on sex-offender registration, but repeatedly asked her for information about her experience. In response to the questioning, Elizabeth told Grace, [...] "I really am here to support the bill and not to go into what -- you know, what happened to me." [...] When Grace persisted, asking Elizabeth {{what it was like}} to see out of a burqa her abductors forced her to wear, Elizabeth stated: [...] "I'm <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to talk about this at this time ... and to be frankly honest I really don't appreciate you bringing all this up." [...] Grace did not pursue further questioning about the abduction.|$|R
2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but <b>not</b> <b>really</b> liking what's <b>going</b> on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|R

5000|$|The tracks {{intended}} to comprise the completed album Jennifer Warnes which Warnes presented to her label Arista Records {{did not include}} [...] "Right Time of the Night". Arista president Clive Davis later told Billboard: [...] "If a such as Jennifer Warnes submits an album which is great but lacks a hit single, I and my A&R staff will say: 'Listen, you need a hit. Because you're <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to break off FM airplay...So we gave her 'Right Time of the Night'." ...|$|E

I was shocked, and then admiring of George’s ruthlessness. It’s a tough thing to build up a character and make somebody as memorable and impressive as Ned and then get rid of him. But {{at the same time it}} leads to a story that is so much more suspenseful because you truly have no idea what is going to happen and who is going to survive.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for I Survived a Zombie Holocaust has been positive. Grolsch Film Works and Nerdly both praised the film, with Grolsch Film Works stating [...] "More or less immunising itself against charges of unoriginality by constantly offering reflexive commentary {{on its own}} movie-bound qualities (or lack thereof), Pigden's film is an affectionate trawl though {{the mechanics of the}} modern zombie picture." [...] SciFiNow was more critical in their review, writing [...] "This well-intentioned horror comedy gets a few laughs and the cast are game (Ben Baker is particularly fun as ex-rugby player and glory-days obsessed Tane) but there’s <b>not</b> <b>really</b> too much <b>going</b> on here beyond the meta zombie movie jokes. One or two sequences work very well (such as the director convincing his first AD to literally sacrifice himself for the art) but it’s overlong at 100-odd minutes and it struggles to find jokes beyond the self-referential. It’s difficult to criticise a film this amiable too harshly, but it’s not particularly funny." ...|$|R

40|$|Howard Shevrin's {{interest}} in neuroscience was first methodological: it provided independent evidence on {{what goes on}} unconsciously. The foundation of the mind needs not to be entirely neurophysiological: {{it is possible to}} describe the mechanisms in psychological terms. However, we aren't anywhere near a unified theory of the brain and mind. When one goes into analysis, the theory is no longer simply about ideas, one's life almost hangs in the balance. There is an enormous disparity between the neuroscientist publishing his findings and the analyst who is treating patients, but not publishing. If neuro-psychoanalysis is only going to rely on the neuroscience part, it's <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to achieve its important objective.
