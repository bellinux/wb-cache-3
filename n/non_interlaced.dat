40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to model and control high speed 6 DOF visual servo loops. The modeling and control strategy take into account the dynamics of the velocity controlled 6 DOF manipulator as well as a simplified model of the camera and acquisition system in order to significantly increase the bandwidth of the servo loop. Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) is used to optimally control the visual loop with respect to the proposed dynamical model. The predictive feature of the GPC is used for optimal trajectory following in Cartesian space. Experimental results on a 6 DOF industrial robot are presented that validate the proposed model. The visual sensor used in the experiments is a high speed camera that acquires 120 <b>non</b> <b>interlaced</b> images per second. Using this camera, sampling rate of 120 Hz is achieved for the visual loop. Furthermore, a precise synchronization method is used to reduce the delays due to image transfer and processing. The experiments show a drastic improvement of the loop performance with respect to more clas-sical control strategies for 6 DOF visual servo loops.

The ideas there allow us {{to proceed with the}} development of a more comprehensive theory of stochastic adaptive filtering, control and identification. In adaptive filtering, we examine both indirect and <b>non</b> [...] <b>interlaced</b> direct schemes for prediction, using both least [...] squares and gradient parameter estimation algorithms. In addition to analyzing similar direct adaptive control algorithms, we propose new generalized certainty equivalence adaptive model reference control laws with simultaneous disturbance rejection. We also establish that the parameters converge to the null space of a certain matrix. From this one may deduce the convergence of several adaptive controllers. 1 Introduction The chief advantage of the stochastic formulation of adaptive problems is its ability to exploit the averaging properties of the disturbance.
