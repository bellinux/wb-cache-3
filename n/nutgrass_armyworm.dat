5000|$|The African {{armyworm}} (Spodoptera exempta) {{also called}} okalombo, kommandowurm, or <b>nutgrass</b> <b>armyworm,</b> is an African moth. It {{is a very}} deleterious pest, capable of destroying entire crops {{in a matter of}} weeks. The larvae feed on all types of grasses, early stages of cereal crops (e.g., corn, rice, wheat, millet, sorghum), sugar cane, and occasionally on coconut. [...] The armyworm gets its name from its habit of [...] "marching" [...] in large numbers from grasslands into crops. African armyworms tend to occur at very high densities during the rainy season, especially after periods of prolonged drought. [...] During the long dry season in eastern Africa, population densities are very low. Because outbreaks are never observed during the dry season, it is called the [...] "off-season" [...] by those who monitor African armyworms.|$|E
40|$|Presented at {{the meeting}} ofDecember 9, 1957) The lawn armyworm, Spodoptera mauritia (Boisduval), was first {{correctly}} recorded from Hawaii in 1953 (Pemberton, 1955) and within a year (Tanada, 1955) {{became one of the}} most serious pests of lawns, particularly those planted with Bermuda grass, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Persoon (fig. 1). Although the name S. mauritia appears early in Hawaiian literature, it was being used erroneously at that time for the <b>nutgrass</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Laphygma exempta (Walker) (see Swezey, 1938). Recently Fletcher (1956) has placed Hawaiian specimens in the subspecies, Spodoptera mauritia acronyctoides Guenee, rather than in the nominate subspecies, S. mauritia mauritia (Boisduval). He re ported the distribution of the former subspecies as the Oriental, Indo-Australian, and Pacific regions. The present importance of S. mauritia and the limited knowledge of its biology in Hawaii have prompted this study. In addition to the laboratory studies, which were conducted both at the Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Station and the Experiment Station of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters ' Associa tion, field observations of both authors are included herein. Description of Stages The descriptions and measurements of the various stages were based on live or freshly killed specimens. Length measurements were made of indi viduals soon after they had molted. Widths of the larval heads were measured under the binocular stereoscopic microscope. Such head measurements were obtained from molted head capsules except in the case of the last larval insta...|$|E
