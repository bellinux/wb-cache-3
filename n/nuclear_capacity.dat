50|$|The détente {{between the}} United States and the Soviet Union {{culminated in the}} signing of the SALT I (1972) and SALT II (1979) agreements, which placed {{constraints}} on further developments in <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacities.</b>|$|R
25|$|The surplus {{plutonium}} bred in each {{fast reactor}} {{can be used}} to set up more such reactors, and might thus grow the Indian civil <b>nuclear</b> power <b>capacity</b> till the point where the third stage reactors using thorium as fuel can be brought online, which is forecasted as being possible once 50 GW of <b>nuclear</b> power <b>capacity</b> has been achieved.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of the USSR {{and the end of the}} Cold War {{potential}} menaces to mainland France appeared considerably reduced. France began reducing its <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacities</b> and conscription was abolished in 2001. In 1990 France, led by François Mitterrand, joined the short successful Gulf War against Iraq; the French participation to this war was called the Opération Daguet.|$|R
25|$|Two consortia (EDF-Centrica and RWE-E.ON) had {{announced}} outline {{plans to build}} a total of 12.5GW of new <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity,</b> slightly more than the total capacity of British Energy's currently operating plants.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, President Sarkozy {{decided to}} {{extend the life of}} {{existing}} nuclear reactors beyond 40 years, following the Court of Audit decision that this is the best option as new <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity</b> or other forms of energy would be more costly and available too late. Within ten years 22 out of the 58 reactors will have been operating for over 40 years.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere in the world, {{nuclear power}} {{continues}} to be discussed in Malaysia, and plans are well-advanced in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Bangladesh. China briefly paused its nuclear development program, but has since restarted it. China plans to treble its <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity</b> to at least 58 GWe by 2020, then some 150 GWe by 2030, and much more by 2050.|$|E

40|$|China’s nuclear {{industry}} has undergone {{rapid growth in}} recent years and is projected to further expand in the coming decades. Accounting for almost 40 percent of all nuclear reactors either under construction or that have been approved globally, the expansion of China’s <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacities</b> has largely been driven by increasing demands for energy to support continued economic growth. Constraints include human resources, fuel supply, {{and the extent to which}} China can develop indigenous <b>nuclear</b> power <b>capacities.</b> The role of civil–military integration in this industry is yet to be determined partly as a result of the deliberate decision by Beijing to keep its nuclear weapons segment separate from its civilian operations...|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 2009 as an E.ON UK and RWE npower joint venture. The company announced its intention to install about 6,000 MWe of new <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacities</b> adjacent to the existing Wylfa and Oldbury nuclear power stations. [...] Horizon initially evaluated building either Areva 1,650 MWe EPR reactors or Westinghouse 1,100 MWe AP1000 reactors between 2020 and 2024.|$|R
25|$|Britain's {{fleet of}} {{operational}} reactors consists of 14 advanced gas-cooled reactors on six discrete sites, {{along with two}} Magnox units at Wylfa, and one PWR unit at Sizewell B. Overall, the installed <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity</b> in the United Kingdom is between 10 and 11 GW. In addition, the UK experimented with Fast Breeder reactor technologies at Dounreay in Scotland, however the last fast breeder (with 250MWe of capacity) was shut down in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Confrontation {{with the}} US and NATO during the Cold War mainly {{took the form}} of {{threatened}} mutual deterrence with nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union invested heavily in the Army's <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity,</b> especially in the production of ballistic missiles and of nuclear submarines to deliver them. Open hostilities {{took the form of}} wars by proxy, with the Soviet Union and the US supporting loyal client régimes or rebel movements in Third World countries.|$|E
25|$|Installed <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity</b> {{initially}} rose relatively quickly, {{rising from}} less than 1 gigawatt (GW) in 1960 to 100 GW in the late 1970s, and 300 GW in the late 1980s. Since the late 1980s worldwide capacity has risen much more slowly, reaching 366 GW in 2005. Between around 1970 and 1990, more than 50 GW of capacity was under construction (peaking at over 150 GW in the late 1970s and early 1980s) — in 2005, around 25 GW of new capacity was planned. More than two-thirds of all nuclear plants ordered after January 1970 were eventually cancelled. A total of 63 nuclear units were canceled in the USA between 1975 and 1980.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, {{after five}} decades of {{sustained}} and generous government financial support, <b>nuclear</b> power’s <b>capacity</b> was just 3,310 MW, less than 3% of India’s total power generation capacity.|$|R
25|$|The Soviet Union {{developed}} {{a new series of}} long-range missiles, called the SS-9 (NATO codename Scarp). A question developed concerning the extent of their capability to carry nuclear weapons; at issue was whether the missile were a Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) or not. The CIA information was that these missiles were not 'MIRVed' but Defense intelligence considered that they were of the more potent kind. If so, the Soviet Union was possibly aiming at a first strike <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity.</b> The Nixon administration, desiring to employ the existence of such Soviet threat to justify a new American antiballistic missile system, publicly endorsed the Defense point of view. Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security advisor, asked Helms to review the CIA's finding, yet Helms initially stood by his analysts at CIA. Eventually, however, Helms compromised.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear power arguably {{began in}} Illinois with the Chicago Pile-1, the world's first {{artificial}} self-sustaining nuclear chain {{reaction in the}} world's first nuclear reactor, built on the University of Chicago campus. There are six operating nuclear power plants in Illinois: Braidwood; Byron; Clinton; Dresden; LaSalle; and Quad Cities. With {{the exception of the}} single-unit Clinton plant, each of these facilities has two reactors. Three reactors have been permanently shut down and are in various stages of decommissioning: Dresden-1 and Zion-1 and 2. Illinois ranked first in the nation in 2010 in both <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity</b> and nuclear generation. Generation from its nuclear power plants accounted for 12 percent of the Nation's total. In 2007, 48% of Illinois's electricity was generated using nuclear power. The Morris Operation is the only de facto high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents [...] {{have long}} made {{inflated}} {{projections of the}} expected growth of nuclear power, but major accidents and high costs have kept growth much lower. [...] In 1973 and 1974, the International Atomic Energy Agency predicted a worldwide installed <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity</b> of 3,600 to 5,000 gigawatts by 2000. The IAEA's 1980 projection was for 740 to 1,075 gigawatts of installed capacity by the year 2000. [...] Even after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the Nuclear Energy Agency forecasted an installed <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity</b> of 497 to 646 gigawatts for the year 2000. [...] The actual capacity in 2000 was 356 gigawatts. [...] Moreover, construction costs have often been much higher, and times much longer than projected, failing to meet optimistic projections of “unlimited cheap, clean, and safe electricity.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Units 2 and 3 {{are two of}} six {{operating}} {{nuclear energy}} sources in New York State. New York {{is one of the}} five largest states in terms of <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity</b> and generation, accounting for approximately 5% of the national totals. Indian Point provides 39% of the state's <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity.</b> Nuclear power produces 34.2% of the state’s electricity, higher than the U.S. average of 20.6%. As of 2015, Indian Point generates approximately 10% of the state's electricity needs, and 25% of the electricity used in New York City and Westchester County. Its contract with Consolidated Edison is for just 560 megawatts. [...] The New York Power Authority, [...] which built Unit 3, stopped buying electricity from Indian Point in 2012. NYPA supplies the subways, airports, and public schools and housing in NYC and Westchester County. Entergy sells the rest of Indian Point's output to utilities in upstate NY and elsewhere in New England. [...] Although many states with similarly sized nuclear industries are net electricity exporters, New York has historically been an electricity importer due to its high consumption. In 2013, New York had the fourth highest average electricity prices in the United States. Half of New York's power demand is in the New York City region; about two-fifths of generation originates there.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} year, a cross-party {{committee}} inquiry {{concluded that the}} UK “will {{not be able to}} meet its climate change targets without new nuclear build”. A report published by the committee found that unless planned nuclear power plants are built on time, it will be [...] "extremely challenging, if not impossible" [...] for the country to meet its legally binding carbon reduction targets. Such a failure to build the new <b>nuclear</b> <b>capacity</b> by 2025 would also force a greater reliance on imported gas, and would affect energy security.|$|E
2500|$|New nuclear {{projects}} were proceeding in some countries. KPMG reports 653 new nuclear facilities planned or proposed for completion by 2030.

The Conservative Government of the United Kingdom is planning a major nuclear expansion despite widespread public objection. So is Russia. India are also pressing ahead with a large nuclear program, as is South Korea. Indian Vice President M Hamid Ansari said in 2012 that [...] "nuclear energy is the only option" [...] for expanding India's energy supplies, and Prime Minister Modi announced in 2014 that India intended to build 10 more nuclear reactors in a collaboration with Russia.|$|E
