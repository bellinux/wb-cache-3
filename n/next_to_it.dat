5|$|She first reconstructed the Church of St. George {{built by}} Đurađ II Balšić on Beška island on Lake Skadar and in 1439/1440 built as her {{endowment}} the Church of Holy Mother <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> She {{was buried in}} its western vault, near the southern wall of the church. The purpose of her endowment was to be her crypt and {{to serve as the}} spiritual center which would continue the orientation of the Serbian culture toward Byzantine Orthodox spirituality in this historically last period of Serbian medieval statehood. In this way Jelena confirmed her loyalty to the tradition of the Nemanjić dynasty and her father Prince Lazar in the period when she was able to make a political choice between Islam and militant Catholicism. Jelena's efforts had an additional dimension taking into consideration that her work is a testimony of the presence of the Byzantine hesychasm in the Serbian Despotate.|$|E
