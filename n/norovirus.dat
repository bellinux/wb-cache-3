5|$|<b>Norovirus</b> is {{the leading}} cause of {{gastroenteritis}} among adults in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. <b>Norovirus</b> is the cause of about 10% of cases in children.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus, <b>norovirus,</b> adenovirus, and astrovirus {{are known}} to cause viral {{gastroenteritis}}. Rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of gastroenteritis in children, and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world.

40|$|International audienceThe close genetic {{relationship}} of <b>noroviruses</b> and sapoviruses found in {{animals and humans}} has raised the question whether these viruses have a zoonotic potential. Transmission from animals to humans and vice versa would have far-reaching consequences for epidemiology and food safety. So far animal noro- and sapoviruses have not been found in humans. However detection of human <b>noroviruses</b> in animals as well as simultaneous presence of animal and human viruses in bivalve molluscs suggest a risk of transmission. Furthermore, antibodies against animal <b>noroviruses</b> were detected in humans as well as antibodies against human <b>noroviruses</b> in swine. Experimental infection of gnotobiotic calves and pigs with human <b>noroviruses</b> demonstrated that virus replication and seroconversion can occur. Accordingly the possible role of noro- and sapoviruses as zoonotic agents needs to be further investigated...|$|R

40|$|Prompted by the {{discovery}} of new gastrointestinal viruses, the NIH, NIAID and WHO investigated the etiology of acute diarrhea that occurred from 1976 - 1979 in a global cohort of infants and young children. Rotaviruses {{were found to be}} major pathogens worldwide, whereas the Norwalk virus could not be detected using a radioimmunoassay. The aim {{of this study is to}} re-evaluate the role and diversity of rotaviruses and <b>noroviruses</b> in the original cohort using more sensitive current technologies. Stools collected from Asia, Africa, and South America (n =  485) were evaluated for viral genotypes by RT-PCR and sequencing. Rotaviruses were detected in 28. 9 % and <b>noroviruses</b> in 9. 7 % of the specimens, with G 1 rotaviruses and GII <b>noroviruses</b> accounting for the majority of each respective virus. Various strains in this study predated the currently assigned dates of discovery for their particular genotype, and in addition, two <b>noroviruses</b> (KL 45 and T 091) could not be assigned to current genotypes. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated a relative constancy in circulating rotavirus genotypes over time, with several genotypes from this study becoming established in the current repertoire of viral species. Similarly, GII <b>noroviruses</b> have maintained dominance, with GII. 4 <b>noroviruses</b> continuing as a predominant genotype over time. Taken together, the complex molecular epidemiology of rotaviruses and <b>noroviruses</b> circulating in the 1970 's is consistent with current patterns, an important consideration in the design of multivalent vaccines to control these viruses...|$|R
40|$|<b>Noroviruses</b> are {{the most}} common cause of {{epidemic}} gastroenteritis. Genotype II. 3 is one of the most frequently detected <b>noroviruses</b> associated with sporadic infections. We studied the evolution of the major capsid gene from seven archival GII. 3 <b>noroviruses</b> collected during a cross-sectional study at the Children's Hospital in Washington, DC, from 1975 through 1991, together with capsid sequence from 56 strains available in GenBank. Evolutionary analysis concluded that GII. 3 viruses evolved at a rate of 4. 16 × 10 − 3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year (strict clock), which is similar to that described for the more prevalent GII. 4 <b>noroviruses.</b> The analysis of the amino acid changes over the 31 -year period found that GII. 3 viruses evolve at a relatively steady state, maintaining 4 % distance, and have a tendency to revert back to previously used residues while preserving the same carbohydrate binding profile. In contrast, GII. 4 viruses demonstrate increasing rates of distance over time because of the continued integration of new amino acids and changing HBGA binding patterns. In GII. 3 strains, seven sites acting under positive selection were predicted to be surface-exposed residues in the P 2 domain, in contrast to GII. 4 positively selected sites located primarily in the shell domain. Our study suggests that GII. 3 <b>noroviruses</b> caused disease as early as 1975 and that they evolve via a specific pattern, responding to selective pressures induced by the host rather than presenting a nucleotide evolution rate lower than that of GII. 4 <b>noroviruses,</b> as previously proposed. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of prevalent <b>noroviruses</b> is relevant to the development of effective prevention and control strategies...|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as <b>norovirus</b> and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{pathogens}} {{related to}} shellfish-borne gastroenteritis outbreaks are <b>noroviruses.</b> These viruses show persistence in oysters, which suggests an active mechanism of virus concentration. We investigated whether Norwalk virus or viruslike particles bind specifically to oyster tissues after bioaccumulation or addition to tissue sections. Since <b>noroviruses</b> attach to carbohydrates of the histo-blood group family, tests using immunohistochemical analysis {{were performed to}} evaluate specific binding of virus or viruslike particles to oyster tissues through these ligands. Viral particles bind specifically to digestive ducts (midgut, main and secondary ducts, and tubules) by carbohydrate structures with a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue in an alpha linkage (same binding site used for recognition of human histo-blood group antigens). These data show that the oyster can selectively concentrate a human pathogen and that conventional depuration will not eliminate <b>noroviruses</b> from oyster tissue...|$|R

5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as <b>norovirus</b> are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects.|$|E

Direct evidence of HBGA receptor recognition in viral infection and tropism was obtained from human volunteer challenge studies on the prototype Norwalk virus, in which the infection rates of the volunteers matched well with the HBGA-binding profiles of the challenge virus [1, 2]. Similar evidence was also obtained from investigation of outbreaks of gastroenteritis related to other genotypes of <b>noroviruses</b> [3, 4], although conflicting results also were reported.

25|$|A {{non-functional}} fucosyltransferase FUT2 provides high {{protection from}} the most common <b>norovirus</b> GII.4.

The ABH antigen produced is thought to act as receptors for human <b>norovirus.</b> Homozygous carriers of any nonsense mutation in the FUT2 gene are called non-secretors, as no ABH antigen is produced. Approximately 20% of Caucasians are non-secretors due to the G428A and C571T nonsense mutations in FUT2 and therefore have strong although not absolute {{protection from the}} <b>norovirus</b> GII.4.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the efficacy of a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) method of detecting <b>noroviruses</b> in artificially and naturally contaminated shellfish. We used 58 fecal samples that tested positive for <b>noroviruses</b> with electron microscopy (EM) to develop an NASBA assay for these viruses. Oligonucleotide primers targeting the polymerase coding region were used to amplify the viral RNA in an isothermal process that resulted in the accumulation of RNA amplicons. These amplicons were detected by hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes that were highly specific for genogroup I (GI) and genogroup II (GII) of <b>noroviruses.</b> The expected band of 327 bp appeared in denaturing agarose gel without any nonspecific band. The specific signal for each amplicon was obtained through Northern blotting in many repeats. All fecal samples of which 46 (79. 3 %) belonged to GII and 12 (20. 6 %) belonged to GI were positive for <b>noroviruses</b> by EM and by NASBA. Target RNA concentrations as low as 5 pg/ml were detected in fecal specimens using NASBA.
