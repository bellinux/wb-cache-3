40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and quantify the temporal sequence <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> mesenchymal cells during natural growth and mandibular advancement in the condyle and the glenoid fossa. One hundred fifty 35 -day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 10 experimental groups (10 rats each) and 10 control groups (5 rats each). The experimental groups were fitted with appliances that positioned the mandible forward. One hour before the rats were killed, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was intravenously injected into them. Sections were cut and stained with anti-BrdU antibody to evaluate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> mesenchymal cells. Cellular uptake of BrdU was quantified with the Leica Qwin (Leica Microsystem Imaging Solutions, Cambridge, United Kingdom) system. The results showed that the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> mesenchymal cells during natural growth were highest in the posterior region of the condyle and the anterior region of the glenoid fossa. In the experimental groups, the posterior region had the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> cells for both the condyle and the glenoid fossa, with the condyle having 2 to 3 times more replicating cells than the glenoid fossa. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> mesenchymal cells, which is genetically controlled, influences the growth potential of the condyle and the glenoid fossa. Mandibular protrusion leads to an increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> cells in the temporomandibular joint. Individual variations in the response to growth modification therapy could be a result of the close correlation between mesenchymal cell numbers and growth. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to quantify the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> mesenchymal cells and to correlate it with the amount of new bone formed in the glenoid fossa during stepwise advancement. We randomly divided 250 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 35 days old, into 10 control groups (n = 5) and 20 experimental groups (n = 10). Fifty rats from the stepwise experimental group received initial advancement of 2 mm and another 1. 5 mm of advancement on day 30 by the addition of veeners. On days 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, 33, 37, 44, 51, and 60, the rats were killed. One hour before that, the rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) intravenously. We cut 7 -μm tissue sections through the glenoid fossa sagittally and stained them with anti-BrdU antibody to evaluate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> mesenchymal cells. During the first advancement, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> cells in the posterior region of the glenoid fossa showed a significant increase compared with natural growth, but a significant decrease compared with 1 -step advancement. On the second advancement, however, an increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> cells was observed on day 37 with a subsequent and significant increase in bone formation on day 44. Mandibular advancement conducted in a stepwise fashion increases the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> mesenchymal cells in the glenoid fossa. However, a minimum threshold of strain must first be exceeded before these mesenchymal cells can differentiate to ultimately form new bone. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Random genetic drift also reduces the variance.

40|$|Abstract Background Studies of {{association}} methods using DNA pooling of {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) have focused primarily {{on the effects of}} "machine-error", <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicates,</b> {{and the size of the}} pool. We use the non-centrality parameter (NCP) for the analysis of variance test to compute the approximate power for genetic association tests with DNA pooling data on cases and controls. We incorporate genetic model parameters into the computation of the NCP. Parameters involved in the power calculation are disease allele frequency, frequency of the marker SNP allele in coupling with the disease locus, disease prevalence, genotype relative risk, sample size, genetic model, number of pools, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicates</b> of each pool, and the proportion of variance of the pooled frequency estimate due to machine variability. We compute power for different settings of <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicates</b> and total number of genotypings when the genetic model parameters are fixed. Several significance levels are considered, including stringent significance levels (due to the increasing popularity of 100 K and 500 K SNP "chip" data). We use a factorial design with two to four settings of each parameter and multiple regression analysis to assess which parameters most significantly affect power. Results The power can increase substantially as the genotyping number increases. For a fixed number of genotypings, the power is a function of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicates</b> of each pool such that there is a setting with maximum power. The four most significant parameters affecting power for association are: (1) genotype relative risk, (2) genetic model, (3) sample size, and (4) the interaction term between disease and SNP marker allele probabilities. Conclusion For a fixed number of genotypings, there is an optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicates</b> of each pool that increases as the number of genotypings increases. Power is not substantially reduced when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicates</b> is close to but not equal to the optimal setting. </p...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{hypothesis}} testing {{is widely used}} to evaluate scientific studies involving statistical tests. However, {{for many of these}} tests, exact p-values are not available and thus p-values are often approximated using Monte-Carlo tests such as permutation tests or bootstrap tests.

The estimates are then used as input for procedures which correct for the multiplicity, for instance by controlling the Familywise Error Rate or the False Discovery Rate. This article introduces QuickMMCTest, a new heuristic method to assess the statistical significance of multiple hypotheses. Moreover, this article compares QuickMMCTest to three other methods in a simulation study, namely to a naive approach which draws a constant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicates</b> or permutations for each hypothesis, to the recent MCFDR algorithm and to the MMCTest algorithm.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> mesenchymal cells and to correlate it to the amount of bone formation in the condyle during stepwise advancement of the mandible. Two hundred and fifty female Spraque-Dawley rats, 35 days old, were randomly divided into 10 control groups (n = 5) and 20 experimental groups (n = 10). Fifty rats from the stepwise experimental group relieved a two-mm advancement initially and veneers were added on day 30 with another 1. 5 mm advancement. The rats were sacrificed after 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, 33, 37, 44, 51, and 60 days. One hour before death, all rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) intravenously. Tissue sections of seven μm were cut through the condyle in the sagittal plane and stained with anti-BrdU antibody to evaluate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> mesenchymal cells. Haematoxylin stain was applied to observe cellular response. The results indicated that during the first advancement, replicating mesenchymal cells in the posterior region of the condyle showed the highest increase on days 7 and 14 when compared with the control. Such an increase preceded the highest level of bone formation between days 30 and 37 of advancement. In response to the second advancement, another increase <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> cells was evident on day 44, along with a significant increase in bone formation observed on day 60. We concluded that forward positioning of mandible in a stepwise manner delivers a mechanical strain that solicits an increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>replicating</b> mesenchymal cells in the condyle. The increase in the population size of the osteoprogenitor cells subsequently leads to more bone formation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
