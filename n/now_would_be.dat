500|$|... "The Stolen Eagle" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer and co-creator Bruno Heller and directed by Michael Apted, who also directed the following two episodes. Heller said {{the era of the}} Roman Empire was [...] "pivotal in Western history. If things hadn't turned out the way they did at that particular point, the world that we live in <b>now</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very different." [...] He decided {{to tell the story of}} the series from the perspectives of two common soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo. According to Heller, [...] "They are the only two ordinary soldiers mentioned by Caesar in his book, so the idea was to do a sort of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern take. I essentially took the seed of that idea to try to tell a big historical epic, but from the street level, the everyman's point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|HUD {{tried again}} to {{implement}} a regulatory prohibition of seller-funded down payments when it re-proposed, in May 2007, its failed 1999 proposal. [...] There were some 15,000 comments from the public, the majority of which were brief statements of opposition written [...] "in a standard similar format and wording". [...] While the period for public comment was still open, the Committee on Financial Services held a hearing on down payment assistance, a primary topic at which was the HUD proposal. [...] Nehemiah's president gave testimony at this hearing, saying [...] "mend it, don't end it" [...] and, in a written statement, adding that the proposal [...] "makes no sense as rational behavior or measured action". [...] In October 2007, HUD pronounced its proposed change as [...] "final", meaning that it <b>now</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> implemented, with an effective date of October 31, 2007. [...] However, Nehemiah sued HUD in a federal district court, citing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act. [...] In particular, Nehemiah alleged that (i) HUD failed to provide a [...] "reasoned analysis" [...] for its change in policy, (ii) HUD ignored reasonable alternatives (such as charging mortgage-insurance premiums that varied according {{to the risk of}} default), (iii) HUD relied on data that was not provided to the public, and (iv) HUD's secretary (Alphonso Jackson) had prejudged the outcome before all public comments had been received. [...] At about the same time, another provider of seller-funded down-payment assistance (AmeriDream) filed a similar action in a different court. [...] On October 31, that other court issued a temporary order barring HUD from implementing the regulation until a final disposition had been reached. [...] The court in Nehemiah issued its final ruling in February 2008, finding that Nehemiah prevailed on some (but not all) of its allegations. [...] The court ordered HUD to vacate the regulation.|$|E

2500|$|When Haig's forces {{began to}} advance towards the Hindenburg Line Haig {{received}} a supposedly [...] "personal" [...] telegram from the CIGS Henry Wilson (31 August), warning {{him that he}} was not to take unnecessary losses in storming these fortifications. Haig, surmising that the War Cabinet were not forbidding him to attack but might dismiss him if the assault failed, telegraphed Wilson back the following day that they were a [...] "wretched lot" [...] (Wilson replied that the Government were worried about needing to retain troops in the UK because of the police strike) and wrote that attacking the Germans <b>now</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> less costly than allowing them time to regroup and consolidate. Byng, Horne and Rawlinson also wanted to attack rather than let the Germans consolidate. The advance up to the Hindenburg Line was difficult as many formerly British trenches in front of it had been converted to German use.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{after two}} or three broadsides {{exchanged}} with Alliance, less than 20 minutes after the first shot, Captain Piercy was astonished to see his opponent (with just one of the little [...] shots from the Countess of Scarborough stuck in its tough timberwork) move away to rejoin Pallas, which was still waiting for an opportunity to be useful. Landais later claimed that his opponent had sailed away under cover of smoke. Piercy, his ship relatively unharmed, and out of range of any of the four Americans, headed straight for the main battle, {{to see if he could}} help Serapis, but Jones’s close-quarters policy meant that to intervene <b>now</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> madness. Quite possibly shots fired by the Countess of Scarborough at the Bonhomme Richard would hit Serapis, or worse still, massive [...] shots from Serapis could accidentally hit the Countess of Scarborough. Instead, Piercy simply gave the impression that he was going to intervene, trying to attract the attention of Alliance and Pallas. Cottineau saw the potential danger (or responded to a request by Landais) and quickly steered towards the Countess of Scarborough, so Piercy slowly retreated, sailing with the wind.|$|E

When the Third and Fourth Armies reached the Hindenburg Line (18 September) Haig received a congratulatory note from Wilson saying [...] "you must be a famous general", to which he replied that he was not (as this would have meant currying favour with Repington and the Northcliffe Press) but [...] "we have a number of very capable generals". Milner visited GHQ, and warned him that manpower would not be available for 1919 if squandered now.|$|E

2500|$|A {{session of}} the Revolutionary Congress convened by Aguinaldo voted {{unanimously}} to cease fighting and accept peace {{on the basis of}} McKinley's proposal. The revolutionary cabinet headed by Apolinario Mabini was replaced on May 8 by a new [...] "peace" [...] cabinet headed by Pedro Paterno and Felipe Buencamino. After a meeting of the Revolutionary Congress and military commanders, Aguinaldo advised the commission that he was being advised by a new cabinet [...] "which is more moderate and concilatory", and appointed a delegation to meet with the Philippine Commission. At this point, General Antonio Luna, field commander of the revolutionary army, arrested Paterno and most of his cabinet. Confronted with this development, Aguinaldo withdrew his support from the peace cabinet, and Mabini and his original cabinet returned to power. Schurman, after proposing unsuccessfully to the Commission that they urge McKinley to revise his plan to increase Filipino participation, cabled the suggestion to the President as his own. McKinley instructed Secretary of State John Hay to cable Schurman that he wanted peace [...] "preferably by kindness and conciliation", but the preference was accompanied by a threat to [...] "send all the force necessary to suppress the insurrection if Filipino resistance continued." [...] McKinley also polled {{the other members of the}} Commission, receiving a response that [...] "indecision <b>now</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fatal" [...] and urging [...] "prosecution of the war until the insurgents submit." ...|$|E

In neither house did any member of the opposition vote against the bill [...] the against vote came entirely from Labor detractors. [...] Upon the second moving of the Referendum Bill, Frank Tudor resigned from Hughes' cabinet. A group of 15 representatives and 12 senators, led by Frank Brennan and Myles Ferricks, opposed the bill at every stage {{on the grounds that it}} was a question of conscience on which no majority, no matter how large, had a right to impose its will on the minority.
