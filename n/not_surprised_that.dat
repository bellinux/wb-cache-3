Over the next few days the IPCC told reporters that Tomlinson's family were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> he had had a heart attack. When journalists asked whether he had been in contact with police officers before his death, they were told the speculation would upset the family.|$|E

They are <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> it is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth– something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. In smoking an illegal substance, Rastas protest {{the rules and regulations}} of Babylon. Rastas have advocated the legalisation of cannabis. The Rasta usage of ganja has attracted much popular, scholarly, and legal debate.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} from The Worst era, Lamounier {{was asked to}} comment on Sepultura's well-publicized break-up, when Max Cavalera left the band in January 1997. Lamounier declared he was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> things turned out {{the way they did}} as, in his words, [...] "with what I knew of them, I think it's quite normal that one brother should betray another in that family, they don't measure the consequences to get what they want. So, a brother backstabbing the other, deceiving their mother, cheating a friend... For money, I'll bet they're capable of anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Described as [...] "the {{slightly}} broken sister who's {{one step}} away from a vodka bottle", Rainie's storylines have often centred on her addictions to drugs and alcohol. During her seven episode guest stint in 2010, Rainie {{was involved in a}} highly criticised crack cocaine storyline with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). It was branded [...] "inappropriate" [...] and [...] "horrid" [...] by the Daily Record. EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy (who plays Sonia Fowler) also criticised the storyline, saying she was [...] "shocked", but Franks defended the storyline, though she herself was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> viewers had complained.|$|E
500|$|Several film reviewers drew precise {{parallels}} between the film and certain superhero comic books, like Powers, Watchmen, Fantastic Four, and The Avengers. Indeed, the producers of the 2005 adaptation of Fantastic Four were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to The Incredibles. Bird was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> comparisons arose due to superheroes being [...] "the most well-trod turf on the planet," [...] but noted {{that he had not}} been inspired by any comic books specifically, only having heard of Watchmen. He did comment that it was nice to be compared to it, since [...] "if you're going to be compared to something, it's nice if it's something good".|$|E

In view of the artistically affected family environment - father musician, mother painter, aunt Louise Japha (1826-1910) pianist, sister Agnes Witting (1863-1937) singer, brother Walther Witting painter - it does <b>not</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> Alexander Witting also painted sometimes and regularly made music, even beyond the narrow circle of family or colleagues.|$|R

After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she {{received}} $1,600 after legal fees. Eminem was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring {{to her as a}} [...] "lawsuit queen", and alleging that [...] "That's how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don't remember her working a day in her life." [...] She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.|$|E
500|$|Daily Mirror critic Gavin Martin {{commented that}} the song has Rihanna [...] "stealing not just Beyoncé's bootylicious crown but also her husband Jay Z for a frisky {{exchange}} against sibilant drum cracks." [...] Sputnikmusic's Steve M. felt {{that it could be}} a major hit on radio partly because of Jay Z's guest rap. Reem Buhazza of The National similarly felt that [...] "Talk That Talk", along with [...] "You da One" [...] and [...] "Roc Me Out", is part of [...] "the winning combination of made-for-radio pop sensibility". David Griffiths from 4Music found the song to be compelling and viewed it as another successful collaboration between Rihanna and Jay-Z. Lansky from MTV Buzzworthy was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> another collaboration between the two was a success. MTV News' Jocelyn Vena called it [...] "big and hard with just enough brightness" [...] and felt that the song discusses sexual intercourse more appropriately than [...] "Cockiness (Love It)"; in the latter, Rihanna expresses her desire to have sex while singing the lyrics [...] "Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion".|$|E
500|$|It {{had been}} {{unlikely}} that Hershiser would ever became a successful pitcher. He {{was unable to}} make his high school varsity team until he was a junior, and he went undrafted as a high schooler. He {{failed to make the}} Bowling Green State University team as a freshman, and after graduating, he struggled through two years in both Double A and Triple A baseball. Drysdale said that he enjoyed rooting for Hershiser because his jersey number, 55, like Drysdale's own number, 53, indicated that Hershiser had been a long shot to make the majors (lower numbers were generally assigned to better prospects in those days). [...] After the record was broken, Drysdale said he was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> his record was broken. Even though Hershiser had the second-best (behind Dwight Gooden) career ERA among active pitchers, he believed that someone would surpass the record because he did not feel he was that great a pitcher, saying, [...] "I think someone's going to break it from me because I know I'm not any big deal".|$|E

James Bond, unlike Sherlock Holmes, {{does not fit}} snugly into the short story length: there is something grandiose and intercontinental about his adventures that require elbow room and such examples of the form as we have tend to be eccentric or muted. These are no exception." [...] The critic for The Times Literary Supplement wrote that the book was [...] "slight and predictable, and usual sex and violence yield to a plausible use of ballistics and marine biology". Writing in The Listener, Anthony Burgess thought that [...] "in their fascinated poring on things...remind us that the stuff of the anti-novel needn't necessarily spring from a thought-out aesthetic", going on to note that [...] "it is the mastery {{of the world that}} gives Fleming his peculiar literary niche". On a personal note, Burgess added [...] "I admired all the Bond books and I'm sorry there'll be no more. A sad farewell to Fleming".|$|E

He considered Super Ethical Reality Climax among the best activities in the main game, and was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> Genki Apocalypse was [...] "the most enjoyable" [...] in the pack. Sanchez was frustrated by the charging enemies in Super Ethical PR Opportunity, and thought Sad Panda Skyblazing was the [...] "craziest" [...] and [...] "most unique" [...] of the four activities, fitting in with Saints Row: The Third [...] "insane nature". He {{did not feel that}} the game needed {{to be included in the}} original release, but thought there should have been at least five different opportunities to do each new activity. Similarly, Petit of GameSpot also thought only Sad Panda Skyblazing matched the main game in [...] "zaniness", and said the pack felt [...] "mundane" [...] overall. She said that the story is more minor in the pack and that it was less funny than the main game. Petit was frustrated by the labyrinth-like design of some of the Genki Apocalypse levels, and was uninterested in Super Ethical PR Opportunity by the time the activity ended. Rock Paper Shotgun John Walker wanted something more expansive for the first pack, and expected something more original and strange along the lines of Saints Row 2 [...] "shit spraying" [...] activity. UGO Paul Furfari wrote that the lack of content is less disappointing if the player thinks of Genkibowl as [...] "a small booster pack".|$|E

The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way – and at no point – glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. We feel that Phil's decline will highlight the destructive nature of drugs, and rather than encourage drug use, will act as a deterrent."

[...] I'm <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> {{there have been so}} many complaints about seeing this on one of our favourite soaps. The episode showed the brutal reality of addiction.

Ricciardo stated that it was [...] "really nice" [...] to be standing on the podium in Monaco and said third-place was the best his team could achieve. In the subsequent press conference, Rosberg said the victory was made more [...] "special" [...] because Hamilton had the momentum heading into the race and revealed that he was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> he was not called into the pit lane following Sutil's crash. Hamilton revealed that he remained in a certain engine mode and that there was a tight battle between himself and teammate Rosberg of which he felt certain would continue until the late stage of the season.
