40|$|Turbulence-driven {{secondary}} motion (known as {{secondary flow}} of Prandtl's second kind) {{is the result}} of the anisotropy of Reynolds stresses. It is associated with internal or external turbulent flow in the vicinity of streamwise corners. In the last six decades the flow along the streamwise internal corner has attracted the attention of many researchers, but it is only recently at the University of Melbourne that an experimental investigation on a flow over an external corner has been undertaken. Although the turbulence-driven secondary motions are generally much smaller than those resulting from skewing of the mean spanwise vorticity (known as secondary flow of Prandtl's first kind), they have a pronounced effect on peripheral wall shear stress distributions and heat transfer rates in the corner region. In the present study the details of turbulence-driven secondary motion over the external corner are explored experimentally and a counter-rotating helical streamwise vortex pair symmetrically placed around the corner bisector is found. As expected, all mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles on both surfaces at the same spanwise distance from the corner agree quite well, having <b>nominal</b> <b>deviation.</b> The secondary flow is observed to be directed away from the corner bisector and then flow back towards the wall. It is also revealed that far from the corner, the flow develops as a nominal two-dimensional flat-plate boundary-layer flow...|$|E

This overdue time trend analysis looks at admis-sion names from 3 years in a busy Southern England tertiary NICU. There is evidence of potential harm (educational and societal) related to unusual names. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that NICU babies’ naming practices have veered from the norm in 25 years. METHODS Children’s names were divided into quintiles ranked by popularity: names 1 st– 5 th most popular (A), 6 th– 10 th (B), 11 th– 20 th (C), 20 th– 40 th (D) and 41 st onwards (E). Using the ONS registry of UK births 1 we derived expected frequencies for each quintile. Names were extracted from ward admission books for 3 months from 1987, 1996 and 2011. Each name was allocated to a quintile according to its popularity for that year. Quintile frequen-cies were calculated and compared using the χ 2 test with expected frequencies for each year and over time from 1987 to 2011. RESULTS In male infants, there was a signifi cantly greater use of popular names than expected from 1987 to 1996 (p= 0. 005, 0. 025, respec-tively) and an abrupt change towards the use of less common names from 1987 to 2011 (p= 0. 008). A less marked pattern was observed in girls, {{with none of the}} trends achieving statistical signifi cance (p= 0. 069 for 1987 – 2011; fi gure 1 A,B). This backs up our hypothesis that naming has steered from the most popular to the more unusual over the past 25 years. In keeping with national patterns, 2 we found no alteration in admission patterns by social class to account for the changes. CONCLUSION There is evidence for change in naming pat-terns; the harm associated with certain name patterns should not be underestimated.

40|$|Despite {{increasing}} {{capital mobility}} {{and the subsequent}} difficulty in controlling exchange rates, intermediate exchange-rate regimes have remained widespread, especially in emerging and developing economies. This piece of evidence hardly fits the "impossible Trinity" theory arguing that it becomes difficult to control the exchange rate without a "hard" device when capital flows are freed. Calvo and Reinhart (2000) have suggested several explanations for such "fear of floating": exchange rate pass-through, liability dollarization, dollar invoicing of domestic and external transactions, and an underdeveloped market for currency hedging make it more desirable to stabilize the nominal exchange rate. However, the New-Keynesian model, which has become the main workhorse for studying exchange-rate regime choice since the 1990 s, typically opposes fixed nominal pegs to free-floating regime, without considering intermediate regimes. We intend to fill this gap here by comparing the performance of "extreme" regimes to that of an intermediate regime where monetary authorities care both about inflation and about <b>nominal</b> exchange-rate <b>deviations</b> from the steady state, when a small economy is hit by several types of shocks. Without nominal wage rigidities, our results {{are in line with}} the New-Keynesian literature arguing in favor of inflation-targeting regimes. However, when nominal wage rigidities are taken into account, we find the intermediate regime to be appropriate for an economy that is mainly hit by productivity and foreign-interest shocks, which is often the case in emerging and developing economies. The free-floating regime (with inflation targeting) seems more adequate if the economy experiences mostly demand shocks and foreign prices shock. Finally, the fixed peg regime is always dominated by either the free-floating or the intermediate regime. A fully-fledged analysis of intermediate regimes should of course account for the fear-of-floating-type advantages of such regimes, as well as for their shortcomings in terms of costly reserve-accumulation and/or recurrent crises. Our results however suggest that, by concentrating on two extreme regimes (fixed nominal pegs and free floats), by neglecting wage rigidities and/or by assuming that floating countries can engineer an "optimal" interest-rate feedback rule, the existing New-Keynesian literature may have exaggerated the merits of free-floating regimes to the detriment of "soft" pegs.

The model predicts a close association between relative technology shocks and bilateral real exchange rate movements. Empirical results based on the data for Group of Seven countries {{are consistent with the}} predicted theoretical correlations. Using Johansen and Juselius (1990) multivariate cointegration tests the study finds that a statistically significant relationship exists between bilateral real exchange rates and international productivity differentials in the traded and nontraded sectors.
