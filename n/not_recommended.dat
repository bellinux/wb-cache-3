5|$|Pyridostigmine {{decreases}} {{the degradation of}} acetylcholine after release into the synaptic cleft, and thereby improves muscle contraction. An older agent, guanidine, causes many side effects and is <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> 4-Aminopyridine (dalfampridine), an agent related to 3,4-aminopyridine, causes more side effects than 3,4-DAP and is also <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b>|$|E

5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium is <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> for muscular paralysis {{as it may}} {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis. Antipyretic agents are <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E

5|$|Tonsillectomy {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, the benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent {{a person who is}} a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms is <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> Treating people who are carriers of GAS is <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E
5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following a seizure {{may be useful to}} help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|Although some guides {{indicate}} {{the species is}} edible with suitable preparation (such as boiling), it is generally <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other toxic Gyromitra species that contain the compound gyromitrin. When boiled in water, or digested in the body, this compound is readily hydrolyzed to the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine—used as a propellant in some rocket fuels.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning up any spill {{immediately}} and thoroughly. Spills may be cleaned by sprinkling cat litter, sand or other absorbent material {{directly on the}} spill. Once fully absorbed, while wearing protective gloves, the material may be scooped into a plastic bag, sealed and disposed. The spill area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water. The soapy water is <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> to be drained in a storm drain.|$|E
