40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} linearization methods of the non-linear state equation. The linearization is developed {{from the point of}} view of the application in the theoretical electrotechnics. Some aspects of these considerations can be used in the control theory. In particular the main emphasis is laid on three methods of linearization, i. e. : Taylorâ€™s series expansion, optimal linearization method and global linearization method. The theoretical investigations are illustrated using the non-linear circuit composed of a solar generator and a DC motor. Finally, the global linearization method is presented using several examples, i. e. the asynchronous slip-ring motor and <b>non-linear</b> <b>diode.</b> Furthermore the principal theorem concerning the BIBS stability (bounded-input bounded state) is introduced...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A coupled {{finite element}} method (FEM) and circuit {{simulation}} approach for analyzing piezoelectric energy harvesters is presented. The advantage of the proposed method is that the mechanical analysis of the generator can be done using available FEM packages, while the circuit analysis can be performed using standard circuit simulation software (e. g., SPICE). The electromechanical coupling between the two physical domains is achieved by applying equivalent piezoelectric loads in the mechanical model, and equivalent electrical voltages in the electric model. This approach allows for the modeling of complex mechanical geometries and sophisticated, non-linear circuits. The solutions of two example problems are presented: (1) a beam generator with a resistive load, which is compared to an existing analytical solution, and (2) a plate generator with a <b>non-linear</b> <b>diode</b> bridge circuit. Though relatively easy to implement, the explicit solution technique {{presented in this article}} can be computationally expensive for complicated models with long simulation time-histories.

Measurements are shown to be strongly correlated with the contact behavior, either ohmic or Schottky. The ZnO nanowires were obtained by metallo-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and contacted using electronic-beam lithography. Depending on the contact geometry, good quality ohmic contacts (linear I V behavior) or <b>non-linear</b> (<b>diode</b> like) Schottky contacts were obtained. Current voltage and KPFM measurements on both types of contacted ZnO nanowires were performed in order to investigate their behavior. A clear correlation could be established between the I V curve, the electrical potential profile along the device and the nanowire geometry. Some arguments supporting this behavior are given based on a depleted region extension.

50|$|An {{important}} consideration in non-linear analysis {{is the question}} of uniqueness. For a network composed of linear components there will always be one, and only one, unique solution for a given set of boundary conditions. This is not always the case in non-linear circuits. For instance, a linear resistor with a fixed current applied to it has only one solution for the voltage across it. On the other hand, the <b>non-linear</b> tunnel <b>diode</b> has up to three solutions for the voltage for a given current. That is, a particular solution for the current through the diode is not unique, there may be others, equally valid. In some cases there may not be a solution at all: the question of existence of solutions must be considered.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Within the field of millimetric RADAR mixer receiver protection, there exists a need to characterize and explain the behaviour of diode power samplers at 35 GHz. Such characterisation is important {{in being able to}} extend capability to higher frequencies, notably 94 GHz, to optimise performance and thereby fulfill more demanding specifications, and to improve production yields. No published data on this subject is known to exist. Specifically, this thesis seeks to allocate measured values to an equivalent circuit for a combined loop antenna, Schottky Barrier diode, co-axial line, frequency dependant lossy termination, and a simplified P. I. N. diode load. Using an HP 8510 B network analyser these measured values are obtained using a 4. 666 : 1 scaled model at 7. 5 GHz for the antenna and line. Measured values for the Schottky diode were obtained using various techniques from d. c. to 22 GHz, again with an HP 8510 B. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} reconciling diode and transmission line measured values with those predicted for this co-axially mounted 'seven dot chip' structure. In this application, the diode is often exposed to comparatively high powers and high junction voltages. Previous authors do not account for the increase of diode series resistance with high junction voltage; this is believed to be an unacceptable simplification in this context. Runge-Kutta analysis of the composite antenna, transmission line, and <b>non-linear</b> <b>diode</b> model has been used to equate modelled and practical 35 GHz characteristics for rectified current as a function of P. I. N. diode load, and input power. Sensitivity of the model to variations in most diode and line parameters has been evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Non-linear {{models for}} {{microwave}} and millimetre wave devices are commonly based on DC and S-parameter measurements, {{due to the}} absence of vectorial large-signal measurements in the past.

40|$|Abstractâ€“â€“A Power quality {{problem is}} an {{occurrence}} manifested as a nonstandard voltage, current or frequency {{that results in}} a failure or a mis-operation of end user equipments. Utility distribution networks, sensitive industrial loads and critical commercial operations suffer from various types of outages and service interruptions which can cost significant financial losses. With the restructuring of power systems and with shifting trend towards distributed and dispersed generation, the issue of power quality {{is going to take}} newer dimensions. In developing countries like India, where the variation of power frequency and many such other determinants of power quality are themselves a serious question, it is very vital to take positive steps in this direction. This paper presents a study on the modeling of a STATCOM (Static Synchronous Compensator) used for reactive power compensation on a distribution network. This paper deals with the simulation of distribution static synchronous compensator (DSTATCOM) for improving power quality of a distribution system feeding linear as well as non-linear loads. Nowadays, there are an increasing number of non-linear loads which inject harmonics into the system. A three-phase insulated gate bipolar transistor- (IGBT-) based current controlled voltage source inverter with a DC bus capacitor known as a DSTATCOM is used for power factor correction, harmonic compensation and for providing required reactive power to the load. A model of DSTATCOM connected to a power distribution system feeding linear and <b>non-linear</b> loads (<b>diode</b> bridge rectifier with R and R-C) is developed for predicting the behavior of system under transient conditions.

40|$|Thermal IR imagers (bolometer arrays with resistive, {{ferroelectric}} or {{diode detector}} elements) require sophisticated circuitry {{to extract the}} signal out of the noisy background. Suitable models for circuit optimization with simulation tools like SPICE or SPECTRE are therefore inevitable. SPICE has the capability to model electrical and thermal circuits in the same model description. The models described here have a common thermal section, but differ in their electrical description. The thermal SPICE model uses a capacitor to model the thermal capacity of the sensing element, resistors for heat conductance due to radiation and along the supporting legs. The incoming radiation injects a current, as does the power dissipated in the sensor layer, resulting in a temperature rise of the sensor. Electrically the bolometer resistor is modeled via a non-linear dependent current source, changing with temperature, and emitting heat during readout. Noise is injected via dependant noise current sources, including white resistive and 1 /f excess noise of the detector resistor and band limited thermal conductance noise of the detector. In the <b>diode</b> bolometer a <b>non-linear</b> temperature controlled <b>diode</b> model replaces the resistor. Shot and flicker noise sources are added. The pyroelectric detector is described by a non linear temperature dependant capacitor and a parallel resistor caused by dielectric losses.

40|$|The project {{investigates the}} theory and design of {{varactor}} diode frequency multiplier circuits. Special consideration is given to multipliers which use series-tuned transmission-line cavities for filtering and impedance matching and an assessment is made of the merits of these cavities. Practical multiplier circuits are constructed in microstripline and are tested {{with the objective of}} verifying the analytical predictions. The theory of the series-tuned cavity is given and its performance is predicted by computer plots of the insertion loss when it is used between a 50 -Î© source and a 50 -Î©, load. These predicted results are verified on experimental series-tuned cavities in which the transmission lines are of two types, namely, coaxial lines and microstriplines, and the predictions are used in due course {{in the design of the}} multiplier circuits. A new method of analysis for frequency multiplier circuits is introduced in which the device equation is written in terms of a Chebyshev expansion. The coefficients of the terms in the device equation are then given by the results of a spectrum test on the device and this has the considerable advantage that the device law will include the effects of parasitics caused by the test circuit which will be similar to those which occur when the device is used in a multiplier circuit. The method can be used to analyse both shunt mode and series mode multipliers and is used here on three particular circuits: the shunt-diode doubler, the shunt-diode triplet and the shunt-diode triplet with idler. Expressions are obtained for the power delivered to the load resistance and the input and output capacitances of the diode. The main achievement of the analysis is that it produces a method for finding the conditions for matching a <b>non-linear</b> reactive <b>diode</b> to a source and a load so that the harmonic power delivered to the load at the required output frequency can be maximised. Measurements on practical shunt-diode doublers using microstrip technology are reported and they indicate that the predictions given by the analysis of doubler circuit operation are of the correct order. The foundations for the design of microstrip series-tuned cavity multipliers have been laid and further investigations, especially with regard to multipliers with idlers, would be of value...|$|R
40|$|Custom Power is the {{application}} of power electronics {{to improve the quality}} of power distribution for sensitive industrial plants. Industries reporting production stops due to voltage disturbances, like short interruptions and voltage dips, include paper mills, semiconductors facilities and other industries with fully automated production. Voltage dips are sudden drops in voltage, with duration between half a cycle and some seconds, mostly caused by clearing of short-circuit faults in the power system. Power electronic converters connected in shunt or series with the grid and equipped with energy storage can provide protection of sensitive processes against voltage dips. This thesis focuses on the control of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) connected in series or in shunt with the grid for mitigation of voltage dips. In both configurations, the core of the controller is the current controller. Since most voltage dips are unbalanced and have short duration, decisive factors for successful compensation are high speed of response and capability of handling unbalances. Three different algorithms for current control of VSC under unbalanced voltage conditions are presented and analyzed in detail. These algorithms include time delay compensation and reference voltage limitation with feedback, to improve the current control during overmodulation. Stability analysis of all three controllers is carried out. Different methods for sequence component detection are presented and compared, based on their transient performance. Simulations and experimental results on a 69 -kVA prototype are presented and discussed for all three controllers. For use in a series-connected VSC, the three current controllers are completed with an outer voltage loop, thus realizing three cascade controllers that are presented and analyzed in detail. For all three controllers, stability analysis and simulation results with balanced and unbalanced voltage dips are also presented. The three controllers have been tested on a prototype series compensator and experimental results are presented in this thesis. Design and testing of the protection system for the series-connected VSC is also described in detail. Experimental results with <b>non-linear</b> load (<b>diode</b> rectifier) are shown. Finally, a similar cascade controller for voltage dip compensation with shunt-connected VSC is presented and tested via simulations. To improve the performance, a modified configuration including an LCL-filter between the VSC and the grid is proposed. It is also shown that by adding an active damping term in the inner current controller, undesired resonances between the filter components can be overcome and satisfactory mitigation of voltage dips can be achieved. A drawback is the high amount of injected current required if the grid is strong at the point of connection of the VSC...|$|R
