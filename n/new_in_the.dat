5|$|In 1905 Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, {{convinced}} Smyth to {{join the}} Princeton faculty, where Smyth remained until retiring in 1934. He strengthened the graduate program in the Department of Geology, which awarded only two advanced degrees before 1912; during his 29 years, another 31 degrees were awarded. Among his students were Arthur Francis Buddington and Albert Orion Hayes. His courses in petrology and chemical geology introduced students to subjects that were relatively <b>new</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E

25|$|The Fifth {{generation}} {{was equipped with}} an interchangeable extruder with some self-diagnostics capabilities. It was <b>new</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market and supposed to help printer maintenance but reliability problem occurred with very short lifespan on the extruder, requiring frequent replacement at high cost. This led to a class action lawsuit which was dismissed Ultimately, Makerbot replaced the failing extruder with a new version.|$|E

25|$|After {{attending}} {{a conference on}} tuberculosis, Dr. Meyers learned of a procedure that was <b>new</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. This operation required the removal of ribs and the upper lobe of her more infected lung, followed by another operation to remove {{the rest of the}} lung. Madonna Swan {{was one of the first}} patients to undergo this new procedure and much was learned about the treatment of TB from her experiences. Following the successful removal of lung and ribs, they were able to treat her remaining lung with an antibiotic designed to kill the TB bacteria (INH, Isoniazid).|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} movable type was not <b>new</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15th century; movable type {{printing}} had been invented in China during the Song dynasty, {{and was later}} used in Korea during the Goryeo Dynasty, where metal movable-type printing technology was developed in 1234. In Europe, sporadic evidence that the typographical principle, {{the idea of creating}} a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany (Prüfening inscription) to England (letter tiles) to Italy. However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.|$|E

After {{the introduction of the}} next generation series, Boeing introduced the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) series. The BBJ1 was similar in dimensions to the 737-700 but had additional features, including stronger wings and landing gear from the 737-800, and had increased range (through the use of extra fuel tanks) over the other 737 models. The first BBJ rolled out on August 11, 1998 and flew {{for the first time on}} September 4.|$|E
25|$|Historically, refugee {{populations have}} often been portrayed as a {{security}} threat. In the U.S and Europe, {{there has been much}} focus on the narrative that terrorists maintain networks amongst transnational, refugee, and migrant populations. This fear has been exaggerated into a modern-day Islamist terrorism Trojan Horse in which terrorists hide among refugees and penetrate host countries. 'Muslim-refugee-as-an-enemy-within' rhetoric is relatively new, but the underlying scapegoating of out-groups for domestic societal problems, fears and ethno-nationalist sentiment is not <b>new.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1890s, the influx of Eastern European Jewish refugees to London coupled with the rise of anarchism in the city led to a confluence of threat-perception and fear of the refugee out-group. Populist rhetoric then too propelled debate over migration control and protecting national security.|$|E
25|$|The park holds {{a remnant}} of the Nigerian lowland forests that once formed a {{continuous}} 50–100km wide belt from the Niger River west to the Dahomey Gap in Benin. To the south and southeast the forest was separated from the coast by mangrove and swamp forests, while to the north it merged into the Guinean Forest-Savanna Mosaic ecoregion. Human pressure is not <b>new.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Okomu park there is an extensive layer of charcoal and pottery below the forest, indicating that it was cleared and then regenerated over the last 700 years. By {{the start of the}} 20th century the forest survived only in disconnected blocks, which were under intense pressure from human activity. The British colonial administration set up a series of forest reserves to manage what remained, including controlled extraction of valuable trees such as African mahogany.|$|E

After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something <b>new</b> <b>in</b> <b>the.</b> He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of the decade, sales were strong, thanks in no small part to the company's history of {{building}} small cars, which came into vogue in 1961. In both 1960 and 1961, Ramblers ranked in third place among domestic automobile sales, up from third on the strength of small-car sales, even in the face of a lot of new competition. Romney's strategic focus was very successful as reflected in the firm's healthy profits year after year. The company became completely debt-free. The financial success allowed the company to reach an agreement on August 26, 1961 with the United Auto Workers for a profit sharing plan that was <b>new</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> automobile industry. Its new three-year labor contract also included generous annual improvement pay increases, as well as automatic cost-of-living raises. However, in 1962, Romney resigned to run for Governor of Michigan. His replacement was Roy Abernethy, AMC's successful sales executive.|$|E

That August he was transferred to the newly activated 9th Field Artillery at Schofield Barracks, in what was then the Territory of Hawaii. His only child, daughter Frances Lyon, was born there on 20 July 1917. The 9th Field Artillery had a battalion of 4.7-inch guns and one of 155mm guns.
