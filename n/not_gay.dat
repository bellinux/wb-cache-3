5|$|On May 21, 2009, Reed caused {{controversy}} in Atlanta's LGBT community when {{he stated that}} he supported civil unions for gays, but <b>not</b> <b>gay</b> marriage. In December 2012, however, Reed announced his support for marriage equality for same-sex couples.|$|E
5|$|Once more {{in nearly}} a two to one margin, the gay rights {{ordinance}} was defeated in Eugene. A poll taken after the vote showed that liberal voters who were <b>not</b> <b>gay</b> simply declined {{to show up and}} vote, and those who opposed the ordinance were much more motivated.|$|E

5|$|Frank {{begins to}} {{question}} his sexuality when {{he realizes that}} he has a crush on Jamie. He even tries to, unsuccessfully, rival Liz to go on a date with Jamie. Later, Frank realizes that the only man he is attracted to is Jamie and decides that he is in fact <b>not</b> <b>gay.</b>|$|E
5|$|Homosexuality {{addressed}} by television started much later than films. Local talk {{shows in the}} late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts (usually <b>not</b> <b>gay</b> themselves) to discuss the problems of gay men in society. Lesbianism was rarely included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama The Eleventh Hour in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and in distress, calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for women. When she realizes this, however, {{she is able to}} pursue healthy heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{meets with}} Principal Clemmons and finds Veronica in the closet. Veronica talks to Mr. Wu {{about one of}} his students, Peter, who had {{feelings}} for Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Wu is <b>not</b> <b>gay.</b> That night, Veronica has a dream about Peter, who “asks” her why he would even {{want to go to}} a baseball stadium. Veronica talks to Beaver, who was pushed into a wall by Cervando, a PCHer who died in the bus crash. Keith solves a case for Principal Clemmons about students who get diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder from the same doctor for better grades. Angie wins the experiment competition, and we learn that Angie was one of the students who was diagnosed with GAD for money. Principal Clemmons revokes exceptions for GAD students. Veronica has a dream about Cervando, who says that the perpetrator was probably in the vicinity of the bus crash. Veronica learns that the “I am God” image is actually an album cover. Keith tells Veronica that the perpetrator was probably targeting Dick and Beaver. Veronica has another, more frightening dream.|$|E

5|$|Unbeknownst to Whitney, Chad {{previously}} began {{a sexual}} relationship with the tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson at an unspecified time around the Vendetta plot, and he continues the affair after their reunion and wedding. Chad is unaware that Vincent is Eve's child with Julian and his half-brother, making Vincent his half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. He is also initially oblivious to the fact that Vincent is intersex, and that Valerie Davis, the executive assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, is his split personality. While confessing his affair to his friends Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald and Noah Bennett, Chad repeatedly insists that he is <b>not</b> <b>gay,</b> and that his relationship with Vincent is based solely on sex. Whitney becomes increasingly suspicious of Chad's fidelity after discovering she is pregnant with their second child. Furious with Chad for continuing to sleep with Whitney, Vincent engineers a scenario in which Whitney sees Vincent and Chad having sex {{in the back of a}} gay bar; Whitney leaves Chad immediately and he distances himself from Vincent. The estranged couple start to reconcile as they try to help Theresa and Ethan Winthrop reunite, but that possibility is cut short on August 28, 2007, when Chad is killed by Alistair while trying to protect his best friend Ethan. Chad dies professing his love for Whitney and their children.|$|E

60|$|Dan was {{certainly}} <b>not</b> so <b>gay</b> {{as he used}} to be; he was glad to find that he was <b>not</b> so <b>gay.</b> There had been a sort of mercy in the suddenness of the shock; it benumbed him, and the real stress and pain came during the long weeks that followed, when nothing occurred to vary the situation in any manner; he did not hear a word about Alice from Boston, nor any rumour of her people.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{movie is}} <b>not</b> all about <b>gay</b> characters, we are <b>not</b> {{focusing}} on <b>gay</b> issues, {{we are not}} saying, 'let's {{come out of the}} closet,' so obviously, we don't want the movie to have a 'gay' label," [...] he said in an interview.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to this, Daniel Dennett has stated: There {{was also a}} negative response, largely objecting to the term that had been chosen by me: bright, which seemed to imply that others were dim or stupid. But the term, modeled on the highly successful hijacking of the ordinary word [...] "gay" [...] by homosexuals, {{does not have to}} have that implication. Those who are <b>not</b> <b>gays</b> are <b>not</b> necessarily glum; they're straight. Those who are not brights are not necessarily dim.|$|R
25|$|However, most {{educational}} institutions, including {{privately owned}} schools {{open to the}} general public, are public services. They are subject to human rights acts and are strictly required to not discriminate against staff or students based on all the prohibited grounds, including sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS (and transsexuality and transgenderism, see Grounds of prohibited discrimination above). They are strictly liable for harassment, name-calling and bullying of students and staff by staff on these grounds. In addition, {{as a result of}} the Jubran decision, they are liable for most such behaviour by students. They may be liable for anti-gay bullying even if the victim is <b>not</b> <b>gay,</b> nor believed to be (e.g. when a bully knowingly makes a false claim that a girl is a lesbian so that she will be ostracized or bullied by others or pressured to have sex with a boy to prove otherwise).|$|E
500|$|Most of New Directions, minus Kurt and Sam, {{meet for}} coffee and {{speculate}} about the absent pair.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, AIDS {{was known as}} gay-related immune deficiency, because the disease had first been {{identified}} among primarily homosexual communities in New York City and San Francisco. At {{the start of the}} HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States, the disease was thought to be a [...] "homosexual problem" [...] and was largely ignored by policy makers. White's diagnosis demonstrated to many that AIDS was not exclusive to LGBT, minority, and poor people. In his advocacy for AIDS research, White always rejected any criticism of homosexuality, although <b>not</b> <b>gay</b> himself.|$|E

500|$|Departmental ego and pride, {{according}} to Shilts, also confounded research as the Centers for Disease Control and the National Cancer Institutes battled over funding and who might {{get credit for}} medical discoveries that were {{to come from the}} isolation of HIV, blood tests to find HIV, or any possible vaccine. Once AIDS became known as a [...] "gay disease" [...] there was particular difficulty for many doctors in different specialties to get other medical professionals to acknowledge that AIDS could be transmitted to people who were <b>not</b> <b>gay,</b> such as infants born from drug-using mothers, children and adults who had hemophilia (and later, their wives), Haitians, and people who had received blood transfusions.|$|E
500|$|Smithers' unrequited {{love for}} Mr. Burns is a long-running gag on The Simpsons; the {{producers}} once joked {{that he was}} <b>not</b> <b>gay,</b> but [...] "Burns-sexual". Rolling Stone described the character's sexual orientation as the show's [...] "worst-kept secret", noting how in one episode he had a vacation at an all-male resort, and in another he wore [...] "rainbow-striped short shorts" [...] in Springfield's gay district. In September 2015, in an interview to promote the 27th season, executive producer Al Jean announced that [...] "we actually do a lot with Smithers this year", adding that two episodes would deal with the character's sexuality, including {{one in which he}} becomes tired of Burns not appreciating him.|$|E
500|$|After {{successfully}} pitching {{the show}} to ITV, Red Productions joined Davies in casting the show and initially approached Jonathan Creek star Alan Davies to portray Bob. Although he was <b>not</b> <b>gay,</b> Alan Davies [...] accepted the role and spent several weeks researching first-hand Manchester's gay scene with series director Joe Wright. His only objection to the role was Bob being a fan of Manchester United F.C., the team Shindler had named Red Productions for, because of his prolific support of Arsenal F.C. The part of Rose was given to Lesley Sharp, her first leading role after her portrayal of secondary characters in past Red shows Playing the Field and Clocking Off, and Jessica Stevenson was cast as Holly by ITV Head of Drama Nick Elliott {{on the basis of}} her performance in the Channel 4 comedy Spaced.|$|E

500|$|Ellen {{goes out}} to dinner with her old friend Richard, a {{reporter}} who is in town to cover a story. His producer, Susan, joins them for dessert and she and Ellen hit it off. Ellen goes back to Richard's hotel room. He comes on to her and, uncomfortable, Ellen leaves. She runs into Susan in the hall and returns with her to her room. They continue to enjoy each other's company until Susan tells Ellen that she's gay and that she thought Ellen might be too. Ellen denies it and suggests that Susan is trying to [...] "recruit" [...] her. Susan sarcastically says that she'll have to call [...] "national headquarters" [...] and let them know Ellen got away. ("Damn, just one more and I would have gotten that toaster oven.") An agitated Ellen leaves Susan's room and returns to Richard's room, determined to have sex with him to prove to herself she is <b>not</b> <b>gay.</b>|$|E
500|$|The idea of Ann {{making out}} with Chris Traeger {{was not part}} of the {{original}} screenplay, but was added after the first cast read-through of the script. The writing staff felt that while Ben was immediately connected to Leslie and the other characters through his role in eliminating wasteful spending at Pawnee, Chris still needed something to more strongly connect to the cast, and the subplot with Ann was determined to be a funny way to do it. In one scene, after Ben explains the need for severe budget cuts at Pawnee, Ron asks Leslie, [...] "What's a <b>not</b> <b>gay</b> way to ask him to go camping with me?" [...] That line was not in the first draft of the script, but was added during filming as a possible alternative line for the editors to choose from later. The staff found it so funny, however, that they chose to use it and the original line was never filmed.|$|E
500|$|During a {{court hearing}} for the murder, Parsons said, [...] "Why are we doing this? I did it and {{everyone}} knows I did it." [...] He pleaded guilty to motor vehicle theft, aggravated robbery and first-degree murder on September 18, 1987. Parsons' sentence was decided by a jury. Parsons {{said that he was}} defending himself with a four-inch knife when Ernest grabbed his leg and thought that Ernest's multiple wounds were [...] "superficial." [...] Parsons was unable to present evidence to corroborate his claim of a sexual advance by Ernest. Ernest's family and friends stated in court that Ernest was <b>not</b> <b>gay</b> or bisexual. Prosecution witnesses testified of Parsons' homosexual activity in jail. According to forensic psychiatrist David Tomb from the University of Utah, the descriptions of Parsons' sexual history indicated that he [...] "may have been the one initiating the contact and became angry when [...] turned him down." [...] A medical examiner testified that Ernest appeared to have been stabbed while sleeping and was unable to defend himself. On February 18, 1988, a jury of six men and six women sentenced Parsons to death. He was sent to Utah State Prison.|$|E
