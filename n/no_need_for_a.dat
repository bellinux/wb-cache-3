5|$|The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-211 was a {{prototype}} high-altitude Soviet fighter aircraft built during World War II. It was {{a version of}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210, itself a variant of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, fitted with a Shvetsov ASh-82F radial engine. Its development was quite prolonged, although successful, but by the time it finished its manufacturer's trials in early 1944 there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> high-altitude fighter and it was not worth reducing the production of existing fighters to convert a factory over to the I-211.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 20,000 tickets, {{out of a}} total capacity of 52,063. The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park debenture holders, hospitality, sponsors, media and segregation areas. In excess of 1,000 unused debentures were distributed to each club. The allocation was enough to provide for the season ticket holders of each club, with Hearts having 10,000 and Hibs 7,500 approximately, although both clubs anticipated that there would be little or <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> general public sale. Hearts decided to sell tickets using their loyalty points system, while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during the sales process. Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{disagreed}} {{about its}} age, {{and the existence}} of an older church on the same site. The tower has been dated by its architecture to between 1230 and 1240, but other historians question this date and suggest the tower and the body of the church both date to the 14thcentury. The porch appears to be a 17thcentury addition. There is a tomb of Margaret deCamois in the nave. It has been suggested that its location there, rather than the chancel as would be expected for the family of the lord of the manor (which her surname suggests she was), may indicate that the church was built on the site of an earlier, smaller, church and the tomb was in the chancel of that church. Local historian Roger Chatterton-Newman disagrees, saying there would be <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> church on the site any earlier.|$|E

5|$|Irish {{zoologist}} Nicholas Aylward Vigors {{established the}} genus Platycercus in 1825, {{based on the}} distinctive architecture of the feathers in the tail and wing, including P. flavigaster and P. brownii within it. English naturalist James Francis Stephens named it Platycercus xanthogaster in 1826, though there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new binomial name. Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews noted that the name Platycercus flaviventris was commonly used in the 19th century, but highlighted the priority of both P. brownii and P. caledonicus over this, positing the last as the most senior name. He believed the specimens used for P. brownii had come from Derwent in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The War Department {{approved}} Krueger's {{transfer to}} SWPA, {{but did not}} approve MacArthur's request for Third Army headquarters. There were only three American divisions in SWPA: the 32nd Infantry Division at Rockhampton, Queensland, the 41st Infantry Division in the Buna area in Papua, and the 1st Marine Division in Melbourne, Victoria. The 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division were scheduled to arrive in 1943, and other divisions would follow in 1944, but {{for the time being}} there were much fewer troops than an army would normally control. The War Department therefore saw <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> full strength army headquarters. Instead, Krueger had to make do with him a skeleton staff of a new Sixth Army, which was activated in January 1943, with less than half the establishment strength of an army headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge across the line, with both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths. The line is due to reopen in 2020.|$|E

5|$|On April 4, 1991 H. John Heinz III, {{one of the}} US Senators from Pennsylvania, {{was killed}} when his {{chartered}} plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear. Under the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the legislature of each state {{has the power to}} permit the governor to fill the vacant seat until a special election can be held. In Pennsylvania, this power had been delegated, and Governor Robert P. Casey signed a writ on May 13, 1991, declaring November 5 the date for a special election and temporarily appointing Harris Wofford to fill Heinz's now-vacant seat. Under Pennsylvanian law, there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> primary in such a situation; instead, both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidate, who would run in the special election. John S. Trinsey Jr., a member of the Pennsylvanian electorate and potential candidate, challenged the constitutionality of this law, claiming that it violated his rights under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments.|$|E

There are individuals who are regarded as elders within the community. This is an honorific title bestowed upon those who have attained a good reputation among Rastas because of their exemplary conduct. Although respected figures, they do not necessarily have any administrative functions or responsibilities among Rastafari. Elders are often in communication with each other through a network.|$|E

25|$|The {{apparent}} secrecy {{surrounding the}} report {{written by the}} investigation panel from the Department of Civil Aviation attracted strong criticism. After the Minister, Mr Drakeford, announced to the House of Representatives that there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> public inquiry into the disaster because he and his Department already knew the cause, he was attacked for presuming to know all the reasons when the Coroner's inquest was still in progress. An editorial in the Brisbane Courier-Mail claimed the Minister was trying to avoid public inquiries into aviation accidents. The Attorney-General's decision to withhold the Coroner's report also attracted strong criticism.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{showed that}} there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> life force in order to prepare organic substances. This idea, however, was initially met {{with a high degree}} of skepticism, and only 20 years later, with the synthesis of acetic acid from carbon by Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe, was the idea accepted. Organic chemistry has since developed into an independent area of research dedicated to the study of carbon-containing compounds, since that element in common was detected in a variety of nature-derived substances. An important factor in the characterization of organic materials was on the basis of their physical properties (such as melting point, boiling point, solubility, crystallinity, or color).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} oversights of the entire system {{was the lack of}} {{adequate}} air-sea rescue organisation. The RAF had started organising a system in 1940 with High Speed Launches (HSLs) based on flying boat bases and at a number of overseas locations, but it was still believed that the amount of cross-Channel traffic meant that there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rescue service to cover these areas. Downed pilots and aircrew, it was hoped, would be picked up by any boats or ships which happened to be passing by. Otherwise the local life boat would be alerted, assuming someone had seen the pilot going into the water.|$|E
