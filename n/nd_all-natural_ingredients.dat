5000|$|TBC did {{not plan}} to be cast as a Belgian style brewery when they {{developed}} their first beer, the Belgian Strong Golden Ale; rather, they wanted to enter the market with something notable and different. [...] The stated goal of TBC is to produce balanced, full-flavored, yet highly drinkable Belgian and American style ales. So far, TBC is distributing across North Carolina, primarily in the Triangle Area (Durham, Orange, and Wake Counties) {{but as far as}} Asheville and Charlotte. [...] TBC brews using the four <b>all-natural,</b> traditional <b>ingredients</b> of beer: water, yeast, hops, and malted barley. The use of adjunct grains and spices is limited to particular styles where they are a traditional ingredient or enhancement rather than an adulterant. TBC does not pasteurize any of its beers - the only preservatives are the hops and the alcohol itself. While TBC's brews can be served alone, one main belief of the brewery is that beer can be better than wine as an accompaniment to food. [...] So far, TBC has produced only various ales, and has no current plans for lagers. TBC also produces a small amount of cask ale in firkins for use at special events. Although TBC currently has no bottling or canning capacity, as of the beginning of Summer, 2008, TBC is hand-filling and bottle-conditioning its Golden Ale and Imperial Amber for distribution to select stores.|$|R
