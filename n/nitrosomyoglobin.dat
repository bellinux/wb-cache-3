50|$|Nitrite further {{breaks down}} in the meat into nitric oxide (NO), which then binds to the iron atom {{in the center of}} myoglobin's heme group, {{reducing}} oxidation and causing a reddish-brown color (<b>nitrosomyoglobin)</b> when raw, and the characteristic cooked-ham pink color (nitrosohemochrome or nitrosyl-heme) when cooked. The addition of ascorbate to cured meat reduces formation of nitrosamines (see below), but increases the nitrosylation of iron.|$|E
50|$|Prosciutto is {{sometimes}} cured with nitrites (either sodium or potassium), which are generally {{used in other}} hams to produce the desired rosy color and unique flavor, but only sea salt is used in Protected Designation of Origin hams.Such rosy pigmentation is produced by a direct chemical reaction of nitric oxide with myoglobin to form <b>nitrosomyoglobin,</b> followed by concentration of the pigments due to drying. Bacteria convert the added nitrite or nitrate to nitric oxide.|$|E
5000|$|Corned beef is a salt-cured beef product. The term {{comes from}} the {{treatment}} of the meat with large grained rock salt, also called [...] "corns" [...] of salt. It features as an ingredient in many cuisines. Most recipes include nitrates or nitrites, which convert the natural myoglobin in beef to <b>nitrosomyoglobin,</b> giving a pink color. Nitrates and nitrites reduce the risk of dangerous botulism during curing by inhibiting the growth of Clostridium botulinum spores. Beef cured with salt only has a gray color and is sometimes called [...] "New England corned beef". Often, sugar and spices are also added to recipes for corned beef.|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus xylosus, a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus {{is usually}} {{used as a}} starter culture in meatproducts. It {{contributes}} to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite through its nitrate reductase activity that is crucial forcolor development. Nitrite is reduced to nitric oxide (NO), which binds to the meat pigment metmyoglobin toform the stable red <b>nitrosomyoglobin.</b> However, {{the safety of the}} use of nitrite regarding human health has beenquestioned. Therefore, alternatives to substitute nitrite are under investigation. The aim was to evaluate theability of S. xylosus nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to produce NO, based on an assay in which metmyoglobin isconverted to <b>nitrosomyoglobin.</b> A mutant strain deleted for nos (Δnos) has been generated. The ability of theΔnos mutant to form <b>nitrosomyoglobin</b> was sharply decreased compared to the wild-type and the noscomplemented mutant, demonstrating the contribution of S. xylosus NOS in the production of NO. The NOSpathway needs to be further understood and could constitute a natural solution to substitute nitrite in meatproducts...|$|E
40|$|The colour and lipid {{oxidative}} {{stability of}} sliced cooked ham stored at 4 A degrees C were studied {{in relation to}} dark storage duration, lighting and packaging conditions. Colour stability was monitored by instrumental colour measurement (CIE L*a*b* colour space) whereas lipid stability {{was measured by the}} determination of the 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). A significantly higher discoloration observed in products wrapped in foil and kept in light than products wrapped in foil and kept in dark. Colour loss was estimated by loss of redness (a*), a*/b*, <b>nitrosomyoglobin,</b> chroma (C); or increase of lightness (L*), MetMb, hue angle (HA degrees). Colour loss was more dependent upon photochemical process than dark storage duration and packaging types. Lipid oxidation was not significantly affected by light exposure. However lipid oxidation was significantly affected by dark storage duration as noticed from better lipid stability of products stored for short duration in dark. Better colour stability was observed on products packed in MAP with less residual oxygen...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed at}} substituting nitrite with carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) in cooked or fermented meat batter products by investigating color and color stability in myoglobin solutions, model meat systems, and full-scale hotdog and salami sausages of pork and beef. For cooked model meat systems and hotdogs at 75 to 80 °C core temperatures, direct flushing with a 1 % CO gas mixture {{during the last}} stage of the batter chopping produced an initial red color equal to nitrite or more intense than with nitrite. For fermented model meat systems and salami sausages with a final pH of 4. 7, pretreatment and storage of ground raw meat in a 1 % CO mixture, and later use of the pretreated meat in batters, also formed an initial red color in the final products. The color stability during air and light display of cooked and fermented meat products with CO was inadequate compared to products with nitrite, although the red color of CO products was largely maintained by anaerobic packaging and storage. Spectra of carboxy- and <b>nitrosomyoglobin</b> at pH 4. 7 demonstrated higher absorbance for carboxymyoglobin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{colouring}} agents, as food additive, {{is believed}} to be necessary for producers. Because of the toxic effects of nitrite, to replace the use of nitrite mostly natural additives. Tomato industries yield a high amount of by-products mainly tomato peel and seeds. Since tomato peel is rich in lycopene, it can be added directly in 0 %, 3 % and 6 % (w/w) in meat mixture used in beef sausage manufacture. This study is designed to investigate the chemical properties of nitrosomyoglobinand oxidation level, sensorial properties and microbiological analyses of beef sausage which have been produced by both reducing the nitrite level and adding tomato peel powder. All samples have been stored at- 18 °C for 3 months. As the level of nitrite was reduced, the oxidation level of the beef sausage was increased significantly. Addition of tomato peel decreased the level of oxidation when compared to the samples which did not contain tomato peel. According to this result it can be stated that tomato peel retards the oxidation reaction. <b>Nitrosomyoglobin</b> (NOMb) content of the samples was decreased along with the decreased level of nitrite. Hardness values of treated samples were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than those of control samples. According to sensorial evaluations, tomato peel improved the consumer acceptability as well. Addition of tomato peel increased the colour scores and beef sausage were found to be more aceptable by the panellists.

40|$|Staphylococcus xylosus {{is used as}} {{a starter}} culture in {{fermented}} meat products and contributes to color formation by the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Nitrite is a food additive that is chemically turned to nitric oxide (NO) in meat but its safety has been questioned. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the ability of NO synthase (NOS) of S. xylosus C 2 a to produce NO. For this purpose, a nos deletion mutant (Δnos) in S. xylosus was constructed and NO production was evaluated in a test based on its ability to form <b>nitrosomyoglobin</b> and nitrosoheme. Production of NO was abrogated in the Δnos mutant under aerobic conditions and reduced about 35 - 40 % comparing to the wild type C 2 a under limited oxygenation. This mutant was sensitive to oxidative stress. The expression of genes encoding catalase was modulated in the mutant with an up-regulation of katA and a down-regulation of katB and katC. The Δnos mutant displayed high colony pigmentation after prolonged growth on agar medium. Finally, the Δnos mutant showed no growth in minimal medium. Growth was not restored in the minimal medium by complementation with nos, but was restored by either addition of phenylalanine or complementation with pdt, a gene that encodes a prephenate dehydratase involved in phenylalanine biosynthesis and co-transcribed with nos. Our findings clearly demonstrate NOS-mediated NO production in S. xylosus, a meat-associated coagulase-negative Staphylococcus...|$|E
40|$|Influence of Achyranthes japonica Nakai Extract (AJNE) on {{properties}} of pork sausages were {{studied in the}} present investigation. AJNE was added to sausages alone or in combination with ascorbic acid to obtain a comparative analysis on {{properties of}} control and ascorbic acid added-sausages. Results showed that addition of 0. 05 % AJNE led to a decrease in color L* and whiteness (W), {{and an increase in}} color b* of pork sausage samples (p< 0. 05). Although color a* of pork sausages containing AJNE was not significantly different, ascorbic acid added-sausages were highest amongst other treatments (p< 0. 05). Sausages containing AJNE had lower non-heme iron values and peroxide value (POV) than control sausages (p< 0. 05); however, high <b>nitrosomyoglobin</b> content was observed in AJNE added-sausages (p< 0. 05). Ascorbic acid led to a decrease in residual nitrite concentration of sausages (p< 0. 05), but no difference was found in AJNE added-sausages. Free radical scavenging analysis showed that AJNE did not affect 1, 1 -diphenyl - 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity of sausages, whereas ascorbic acid added-sausages showed relatively higher activity among the samples (p< 0. 05). Addition of AJNE had no influence on texture properties of sausages. In sensory evaluation, AJNE treatment had significant effects on color (p< 0. 05), but no significant effects on aroma, flavor, springiness, juiciness, and overall acceptability. In conclusion, the addition of AJNE, as a natural supplement may offer natural antioxidants for pork sausages, and appears to be particularly effective in inducing changes in non-heme iron concentration, POV value and nitrosomyglobin content...|$|E
40|$|Myoglobin is {{the most}} {{important}} red pigment in meat, but also the content of hemoglobin and cytochrome C partially influence the meat colour [1]. Myoglobin is a compact globular protein consisting of globin and an iron containing heme group (Fe-protoporphyrin IX) as chromophore. The colour of myoglobin is determined by the redox state of heme and by the type of ligand bound at its sixth’ coordination place, and is found in meat in three main forms: deoxymyoglobin (MbFe(II)), oxymyoglobin (MbFe(II) O 2) and metmyoglobin (MbFe(III)) [2]. For the production of meat products, traditionally nitrite or nitrate is added, whereby <b>nitrosomyoglobin</b> (MbFe(II) NO) is formed. As a result the typical red cured colour of meat products is attained [3]. Colour, a crucial factor for consumer’s buying decision of meat and meat products, can be affected by several factors [1, 2]. In order to investigate the colour formation in meat and meat products in detail, it is of primary interest to have a reliable method for the determination of the total heme content. In this study, the method for extracting heme from meat samples, more specific dry fermented sausages, has been optimized and validated prior to further analysis by HPLC-UV. Chromatographic analysis was based on the method described by Wakamatsu et al. (2009) [4]. The separation was carried out by isocratic elution using methanol/ammonium acetate (80 : 20, v/v, pH = 5. 16) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Forty microliters of each sample was injected. Detection of heme was carried out at the wavelength of 400 nm. The influence of different factors was investigated to find suitable conditions for the heme extraction. The procedure of extraction was based on the method described by Lombardi-Boccia et al. (2002) using acidified acetone as extraction solvent. This ensures the extraction of heme from all heme proteins, in the form of acid hematin (hemin) [5]. In this study the effects of extraction solutions (combinations of water, HCl and acetone) and operational parameters, such as homogenization time (30 s versus 5 min using an ultra-turrax T 25 homogenizer, IKA®, Staufen, Germany) and shaking (0 h versus 1 h using a nutating mixer, VWR International, West Chester, PA, USA) were studied. Also double and single extraction of the meat samples were examined. The optimal extraction of heme was obtained with an acidified acetone solution of 78 % acetone and 1. 375 % HCl, 5 min homogenization and no additional shaking. The recoveries obtained after double extraction were better than the values yielded after single extraction, indicating that a double extraction is more acceptable for the determination of heme in meat products. The optimized extraction method is a valuable tool for assessing the total heme concentration in salami samples by HPLC. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Fillet {{quality of}} farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is {{affected}} by {{a broad range of}} preand post-mortem factors. This thesis focuses mainly on the impact of pancreas disease (PD), salt composition and salting method on pigment concentration and colour of raw and coldsmoked salmon fillets, but fillet composition, texture and drip losses are as well considered. The fish material used to study effects of PD on fillet quality was sampled from commercial farming locations to obtain a broad overview and identify potential common properties of PD affected salmon (Paper I). The farming locations participated in a cohort study reported by Jansen et al. (2010), hence the salmon were sampled from populations with a well documented disease history. Salmon from seven farms were diagnosed with PD (diagnosed 0 - 12 months prior to slaughtering); salmon from one farm were infected with salmonid alpha virus (SAV) without an outbreak of PD, whereas salmon from two farms had no records of PD diagnosis and worked as control farms. To obtain knowledge on underlying causes to quality deviations of PD affected salmon, individuals with different PD pathology within a population diagnosed with PD at time of slaughtering was investigated (Paper II). Anecdotal information indicates that PD may cause poor general muscle quality and in particular pale and irregular colouration. Salmon diagnosed with PD at slaughter, or six months prior to slaughter confirmed this. Changes in quality in the order of their appearance were decreased CF, depleted muscle glycogen, increased drip loss of raw muscle, paler colour, depleted protein and finally harder texture in smoked salmon fillets. Salmon infected with salmonid alphavirus (SAV) without a PD outbreak and salmon diagnosed one year before slaughtering, had similar quality as unaffected fish, although paler colour might occur even after one year recovery. Within a population of farmed Atlantic salmon diagnosed with PD at time of slaughtering, a large variation was observed among individuals in pathological profile, gene expression profile in heart tissue, and fillet quality characteristics. Deteriorated quality and dysfunction of the digestive system was most pronounced in fish with severe loss of pancreas. Dry salting significantly reduced the stability of carotenoids in the fillet surface of coldsmoked salmon fillets as compared to injection salting (Paper IV). The salt content in pre rigor injection salted fillets was similar as those salted post rigor (2. 4 % versus 2. 6 %, respectively), whereas the fillet colour was more translucence. However, injection salting of pre rigor fillets can be recommended. Moreover, state of rigor mortis at time of salting had no effect on the carotenoid stability. Low correlations between colorimetric parameters and content of carotenoids in the fillet surface, illustrated that additional factors affects the visual appearance of cold smoked salmon. Nitrite salt curing (Paper III) improved the colour of cold-smoked salmon fillets (more reddish, darker and less yellowish). However, only slight higher carotenoid stability during processing was observed. The improved colour was most probably related to formation of <b>nitrosomyoglobin.</b> Salmon fillets treated with nitrite (fine refined salt added 0. 6 % sodium nitrite) had a relatively high amount of residual nitrite, however higher contents of Nnitrosoamines were not observed. It is concluded that salmon diagnosed with PD at slaughter, or six months prior to slaughter showed deteriorated fillet quality, whereas salmon infected with salmonid alphavirus (SAV) without a PD outbreak and salmon diagnosed one year before slaughtering, had similar quality as unaffected fish. Moreover it is concluded that nitrite salt improved the appearance of cold-smoked salmon fillets and dry salting reduced the stability of carotenoids in the fillet surface as compared to injection salting...|$|E
