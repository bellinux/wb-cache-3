5000|$|Typically, the {{disconnect}} tone {{is a few}} cycles of the reorder or busy tone (e.g. in US), or between five and fifteen seconds of the <b>Number</b> <b>Unobtainable</b> <b>tone</b> (e.g. in UK). On some telephone exchanges in the UK, the following audio message is looped for fifteen seconds, interspersed with Special Information Tones (SIT), to advise the remote party has hung up: [...] "(SIT) The other person has hung up". On iPhones, the tone is 3 bursts of 425 Hz tones each lasting 0.2 seconds.|$|E
50|$|A {{problem was}} {{discovered}} very {{late in the}} development of the TXE4 in that an equipment number could be threaded with the wrong directory number by mistake on the cyclic stores. Even worse it could be the directory number of another equipment number leading to multiple directory numbers. This would cause <b>Number</b> <b>Unobtainable</b> (NU) <b>tone</b> when the incorrectly threaded number was dialled and the double threading number received incorrect calls. The exchange had no way of detecting this but the programming of one of the MCUs allowed a separate programme to run to detect this problem and print out the locations of the duplicates. This had to be done on a regular basis. Eventually, after many more diagnostic routines had been added, this became known as Tester 299A, even though it was only software.|$|R
40|$|We use {{hydrodynamic}} cosmological simulations in a 9. 6 Mpc box {{to explore}} {{the evolution of the}} intergalactic medium (IGM) transmissivity from z= 2 through the epoch of reionization. Reionization is achieved through an ultraviolet background (UVB) that includes evolving stellar and QSO source populations. We construct and analyze noiseless synthetic HI Lya absorption spectra along lines of sight through our continuously evolving box and find a smooth evolution of the effective optical depth under a power law up to the epoch of reionization. Crossing into the epoch of reionization, both the mean transmitted flux (MTF) and variance to the mean transmitted flux sharply deviate from a smooth evolution and hence such observables have large margins of error. Despite the statistical uncertainty in inferring the reionization profile from spectra, the end of an opacity phase transition of the IGM correlates well with the redshift when both the mean and variance of the transmitted flux rapidly deviate from the post-reionization profile. However, an <b>unobtainable</b> <b>number</b> of lines of sight is needed to allow an estimate of the MTF with less than 10 % relative margin of error. In addition to optical transmission, we compare the predicted dark gap length distribution with observations. We show that this statistic is sensitive to spectral resolution at reionization redshifts, but overall in agreement with results by Songaila and Cowie (2002). Finally, we derive a positive correlation between the mean optical depth within a gap {{and the size of the}} gap, in attempt to relate "transmission statistics" to "dark gap statistics" in high redshift studies of the IGM.
