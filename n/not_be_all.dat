25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> that he appears. Hokuto jokes {{about him being}} a member of the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what was being said. This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E
500|$|... "It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] was {{regarded}} by reviewers {{as the best}} segment in the episode. Canning wrote, [...] "this segment may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> that gory, but it's funny and, quite honestly, it will just make you feel good", and Bentley described it as [...] "a dead-on comedy assault of the Charlie Brown animated Halloween special." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concurred, writing that it [...] "succeeds because it offers sly cultural commentary." [...] Show Patrol wrote [...] "The nostalgia factor makes “Grand Pumpkin” {{the best of these}} amusing bits for me, but they all lack that trademark “Simpsons” brand of satirical smartness." [...] Hal Boedecker of the Orlando Sentinel gave the episode a 4/5 and called the final segment a [...] "witty parody of Charlie Brown's Halloween classic. [...] The best gag, though, is a subtle one. Marge plays a trombone, a loving salute to the way the Peanuts specials portrayed adult voices." ...|$|E

2500|$|In general, I may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> of R as {{for example}} {{for an open}} disc in R2. The proof of this theorem follows from the theory of [...] {{ordinary}} differential equations, by noticing that the geodesic equation is a second-order ODE.

2500|$|The {{operations}} need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> explicitly stated. A {{basis is}} any set {{from which the}} remaining operations {{can be obtained by}} composition. A [...] "Boolean algebra" [...] may be defined from any of several different bases. Three bases for Boolean algebra are in common use, the lattice basis, the ring basis, and the Sheffer stroke or NAND basis. These bases impart respectively a logical, an arithmetical, and a parsimonious character to the subject.|$|E

2500|$|... "In the past, {{there was}} no {{requirement}} for reporting or tracking LPAI H5 or H7 detections in wild birds so states and universities tested wild bird samples independently of USDA. Because of this, the above list of previous detections might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> inclusive of past LPAI H5N1 detections. However, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recently changed its requirement of reporting detections of avian influenza. Effective in 2006, all confirmed LPAI H5 and H7 AI subtypes must be reported to the OIE because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains. Therefore, USDA now tracks these detections in wild birds, backyard flocks, commercial flocks and live bird markets." ...|$|E
2500|$|Israeli {{newspapers}} {{commented that}} the situation must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> that bad if Palestinians refused the aid.

[...] On 17 June 2010, Palestinian authorities accepted the delivery of the cargo under UN supervision and coordination. However, Israel stated it [...] "will not transfer to Gaza the weapons and military equipment it had found aboard the Mavi Marmara".|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Deftones" [...] {{was created}} by Carpenter, who wanted to pick [...] "something that would just stand out but you know, <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> cheese-ball at the same time."

Carpenter said the name is intentionally vague to reflect the band's tendency to not focus on just one style of music. The name is also a pun on the term [...] "tone deaf." ...|$|E
