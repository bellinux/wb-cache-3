40|$|Introduction: Dogs are {{the major}} {{reservoir}} of rabies virus in Nigeria; transmission to humans is via a bite by rabid dog.

Methods: We used the dog brain specimen result register of Rabies Laboratory of NVRI, from “January, 2006 ” to “December, 2008 ” and traced dog bite cases.

Since the use of transparent bottles for packaging blackleg vaccines {{was accompanied by a}} drastic change in pH compared to amber coloured bottles, it is suggested that the use of transparent bottles to package the vaccines should be discouraged. Also, prior to bottling, it is suggested that the pH should be adjusted to 7. 7 - 8. 0, to modulate any pH drops that may occur subsequently, during storage...|$|R
30|$|Perhaps government- or industry-supported {{training}} {{could address}} issues like diagnosis, injection procedures and dosing practices {{at the same}} time as advising on sourcing genuine products. Various schemes across Africa (e.g. Allport et al. 2005) have proposed that community animal health workers can provide some level of veterinary care in the absence of more formal, professionalised services. In the specific area of this study, schemes in the recent past offered short courses in veterinary training to pastoralists at the <b>National</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Research <b>Institute</b> in Vom. However, these have ceased in recent years because of ethnic-religious clashes in the region, with Vom seen as an unsafe area for Fulani at the time this fieldwork was carried out. Rebuilding the tenuous and frayed ties between pastoralists, veterinary professionals, the pharmaceutical industry and regulators should be an urgent priority.|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{antimicrobial resistance}} in bacteria {{of animal origin}} is recognised {{as a public health}} threat. Resistant pathogens directly affect infected host and can lead to therapeutic failures whereas commensal flora may serve as a reservoir and vector of resistance genes in a populatton. The incidence of resistant non-pathogenic bacteria may also indirectly indicate the intense of antimicrobial use in animal husbandry. A five-year resistance monitoring project covering an indicator E. coli was run at the <b>National</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Research <b>Institute</b> since autumn 2003. The study was designed to collect yearly up to 1000 samples from healthy bovine animals, pigs, broilers, turkeys and geese at slaughter.

40|$|Reports {{of large}} scale {{mortality}} of day-old-chicks were received at the <b>National</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Research <b>Institute,</b> Vom, Nigeria in 2007 to 2008.

Our investigation revealed that Escherichia coli and Salmonella organisms were isolated in the outbreaks. A pattern of antibiotic resistance that seems to be increasing was also found. Considering the role of chickens and its products in the human food chain in Nigeria; and the close interaction between poultry and man, these resistant organisms may pose dangers to humans through the food chain or zoonotic infection and precipitate a similar pattern of resistance in man. We advocated for informed use of antibiotics in the food animals, especially poultry...|$|R
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} caused {{infection and}} spread throughout Nigeria in 2006. Carcass samples (lung,liver, spleen, heart, trachea and intestine) {{from the different}} regions of Nigeria were processed for virus isolation. Infective allantoic fluids were tested for avian influenza viruses (AIV) and Newcastle disease virus using monospecific antisera. Thirty-five isolates were generated and characterized molecularly using the haemagglutinin gene. The molecular analysis indicated that different sublineages of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 viruses spread throughout Nigeria. We compared the Nigerian isolates with others from Africa and results indicated close similarities between isolates from West Africa and Sudan. Some of the analysed viruses showed genetic drift, {{and the implications of}} these for future epidemiology and ecology of avian influenza in Africa require further evaluation. The spread of primary outbreaks was strongly linked to trade (legal and illegal), live bird markets, inappropriate disposal, and poorly implemented control measures. No strong correlation existed between wild birds and HPAI H 5 N 1 in Nigeria.

40|$|When a swine {{epizootic}} {{occurred in}} groups of pigs in south western Nigeria in 2001, a need for detailed investigation and confirmatory diagnosis arose at the University of Ibadan. A class of epizootiology {{students at the university}} was involved in the investigation. Comprehensive information about the nature and causation of the disease was provided. Four diagnostic techniques were used for confirmatory diagnosis, including Indirect Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (I-ELISA), immunoblotting, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and virus isolation. Only immunoblotting assay was used at the University of Ibadan, while samples were sent to the <b>National</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Research <b>Institute</b> (NVRI) in Vom, Nigeria for I-ELISA and to two reference laboratories for African swine fever in South Africa and Madrid, Spain for PCR and virus isolation respectively. The results obtained from these laboratories using the other three diagnostic techniques were compared with that of the immunoblotting assay.
