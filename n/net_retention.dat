50|$|The three {{putative}} radical SAM methyltransferases encoded {{within the}} pathway are interesting for both mechanistic and biosynthetic reasons. Radical SAM methyltransferases {{are likely to}} methylate substrates by an unusual mechanism. Biosynthetically, β-methylations of amino acids are highly unusual in natural products. Polytheonamide B, a peptide natural product produced by a marine symbiont, is the only other structurally characterized example of direct β-methylation of a peptide natural product. The proposed methyl transfer from a SAM-utilizing enzyme was supported by earlier feeding studies with labeled methionine; labeled methionine is used because methionine is converted into SAM within cells. Even further, this study used stereospecifically labeled methionine (methyl-(2H-3H)-(2S, methyl-R)-methionine) to show that methylation occurred with a <b>net</b> <b>retention</b> of stereochemistry at the methyl group. The author speculated that <b>net</b> <b>retention</b> indicated a radical mechanism with a B12 intermediate. Radical transfer with a cobalmin B12 cofactor and SAM has been shown with the few characterized radical SAM methyltransferases.

Methods: Thirty-six historical FLT-PET data with concurrent arterial sampling were available for this study. A population average of baseline scans blood data was constructed using leave-one-out cross-validation for each scan and used in conjunction with individual blood samples.

During filling and through-flow, when the lake is inundated by river water, floating grasses (Paspalum repens) and phytoplankton grow rapidly, causing depletion of inorganic N and P between inflow and outflow, although phytoplankton biomass does not accumulate because of flushing. Inundation of the surrounding forest has no quantifiable effects on concentrations of major ions or macronutrients.

The downward movement of dolomite, kieserite and a mixture of CaCO 3 and kieserite was investigated by monitoring the leachates and exchangeable cation composition from single and combined horizon columns, reconstructed from an acid brown forest soil profile (0 - 15 cm). Upon entering the soil, Mg ions from kieserite displaced base cations and acidity (H and Al ions) from exchange sites, which subsequently moved down with the mobile SO 42 - anions. Total leaching during the initial SO 42 - pulse was similar with the CaCO 3 + kieserite mixture. Compared to the single kieserite treatment, the joint application of CaCO 3 greatly increased the proportion of Ca in the leachates from all horizons. It also decreased the leaching of acidity from the surface Oe horizon and prevented pH from dropping under this layer. With both treatments, the redistribution of magnesium with SO 42 - anions resulted in a rapid increase in exchangeable Mg contents throughout the studied columns. Due to the important charge increase in the Oe horizon and to kinetic restraints imposed on dissolution, downward movement of Ca and Mg ions from dolomite was very limited. Mg was however much more mobile than Ca. In the CaCO 3 + kieserite and dolomite treatments, the migration of alkalinity and base cations with time {{was associated with a}} decrease in exchangeable acidity and an increase in ECEC in the two upper soil layers.

No significant (p< 0. 05) differences were, however, observed in specific growth rate and body condition factor of fish fed either 10 or 15 % of alfalfa meal. The diet containing 20 % of alfalfa meal showed poorest (p< 0. 05) growth performance and nutrient ultization. Inclusion of alfalfa meal over 5 % in diets significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced feed intake in fish compared to the control diet. Diets containing 15 or 20 % alfalfa meal however, did not show any significant (p< 0. 05) difference in feed consumption of fish. The efficiency of feed utilization decreased linearly when the level of alfalfa meal in diets increased over 5 %. No significant (p< 0. 05) differences were, however, observed in the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of diets containing 10 or 15 % of alfalfa meal. Similar results were observed for protein efficiency ratio (PER). <b>Net</b> protein <b>retention</b> (NPR) and apparent <b>net</b> energy <b>retention</b> (ANER) values however, differed significantly (p< 0. 05) at all inclusion levels. Body moisture content of fish increased whereas fat and gross energy contents decreased when the level of alfalfa meal in diets was either 15 or 20 %. No significant differences were however observed in the body moisture, fat and gross energy contents of fish fed either 15 or 20 % of alfalfa meal. The level of alfalfa meal in fish diets did not affect body crude protein and ash contents. The {{results of the present study}} indicated that up to 5 % level of alfalfa meal could be used in the diets for Oreochromis niloticus...|$|R
40|$|The study {{evaluated}} the growth performance and body composition of Oreochromis niloticus fed isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets containing {{different types of}} lipids (corn oil, olive oil, cod liver oil and beef tallow) at 14 % level {{for a period of}} 65 days. Significant (p< 0. 05) difference were observed in the body weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), condition factor, feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), <b>net</b> protein <b>retention</b> (NPR), apparent <b>net</b> energy <b>retention</b> (ANER) and hepatosomatic index (HIS) values. The diet containing a mixture of all the 4 dietary lipids in equal proportions (3. 5 g of each lipid per 100 g of diet) produced the best results (SGR, 1. 73 %; condition factor, 2. 95; FCR, 1. 27, PER, 2. 06; NPR, 29. 30 % and ANER, 20. 21 %) whereas the diet containing beef tallow showed the poorest performance (SGR, 1. 50 %; condition factor, 2. 76; FCR, 1. 53; PER, 1. 73; NPR, 26. 26 % and ANER, 18. 53 %). The growth performance of fish fed on diet containing beef tallow was however, significantly (p< 0. 05) better than that of lipid free diet. The diets containing corn oil, olive oil, and cod liver oil did not show any significant difference in the growth performance of fish. The hepatosomatic index (HIS) value increased in fish fed diets containing lipids (maximum 1. 55 % in case of corn oil) as compared to those fed lipid free diet (1. 31 %), No significant differences were observed in the feed consumption of fish fed different diets. The type of dietary lipid significantly affected the body composition of fish. The data on the body composition of fish is very much correlated with the growth performance data. The fish fed on diets containing lipids showed higher body fat and crude protein but lower moisture and gross energy contents as compared to those fed lipid free diet. The fish fed on diet containing beef tallow however showed similar body protein and ash contents as those fed lipid free diet. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that diet supplemented with a mixture of different types of lipids will produce the best growth response in Oreochromis niloticus...|$|R
