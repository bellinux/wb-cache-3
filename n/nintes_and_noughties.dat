In the late nineties <b>and</b> early <b>noughties,</b> these writings helped shape debates in Australia about the transformation of the labour market. Standing, who spent three years at Monash University and is now professor of economic security at the University of Bath, examined various forms of security available to the workforce – job security, income security, employment security and so forth – and in so doing provided researchers in Australia with useful categories for understanding the economic restructuring of the 1980 s and 1990 s. For Standing, it is the absence of these forms of security that defines a new class, the precariat. In this book, he explores the spread of neoliberalism and the labour market dislocation and increased casualisation that followed as part of the collateral damage wrought by globalisation.

50|$|Litton has a résumé {{that might}} {{be said to have}} grown and {{developed}} both musically (he has been a practitioner since the start of his jazz piano career in the early 1980s) and musicologically (he is often called on to give talks with demonstrations on the development and changing styles of jazz - ragtime in particular). His playing style is influenced by the likes of Jelly Roll Morton, Willie 'The Lion' Smith and Teddy Wilson to name just a few. An early career breakthrough came through playing with Kenny Ball from 1983 - 1985 on his British and Russian tours and for recording sessions with George Chisholm. By 1987 James Asman was writing of Litton in the Jazz Rag magazine that he possessed an 'ability to play jazz piano in a way that sparkles and swings in sympathy with the clarinettist …. setting him amongst the very best his country has to offer'. The 1990s, saw, inter alia, the release of Litton's First Piano Album. Jazz Journal specifically commented that he had matured and developed his skills and his appreciation of all styles of jazz music whilst remaining true to his, and its, roots. Such development has been a constant theme in Litton's career <b>and</b> the <b>noughties</b> gave reviews praising his knowledge of the styles and the historical development of jazz including Dixieland. This current decade shows Litton continuing {{at the top of his}} jazz piano métier, whether combining immaculate solo virtuosity with accompanist skills, keeping the wonderful music from the 30s and 40s alive at the launch of a new jazz club venue, or playing with the Buck Clayton Legacy Band.|$|R
40|$|Radical {{forms of}} direct action and protest have {{undertaken}} a new cycle {{in the past}} three years. Climate camp protests re-emerged at Drax (2006), and against the third runway at Heathrow Airport (2007 -present); juxtaposed with resurgence in anti-capitalist/global justice protests from the late 1990 s <b>and</b> early <b>noughties</b> <b>and</b> the recent G 20 Meltdown (2009) in central London. Drawing on the work of Halloran, Murdock and Elliott's (1971) use of Lang and Lang's (1958) notion of an inferential structure – where news reports often frame protest stories as violent or potentially violent - this study will argue that journalist continual use of this structure, through set linguistic patterns, influences how the mainstream media construct our cultural understanding of protest movements. Historically journalist reports on (UK based) protest events by following an established news agenda, and this work will show how journalists covering these events follow an established news agenda. The G 20 protest were no exception, the usual formulaic build-up in coverage focus on the threat of, or potential for violence. The Sunday Mirror newspaper headline two days prior to the event proclaimed 'Anarchy in the UK; Exclusive the London summit 2009 countdown as world leaders head for G 20 summit rioters come out of retirement secret plans to 'take over' city (29 / 04 / 09 : 9); and The Guardian newspaper revels 'Police tactics queried as Met says G 20 protests will be 'very violent' (28 / 04 / 09 : 1). At the Heathrow Climate camp (August 2007), news reports repeat the language of earlier protests. Echoing Halloran, Elliott and Murdock’s findings protestors identities are framed with a context of what Hall would argue (1968, 1971) as 'scoundrels', 'deviants' and 'violent' (Halloran et al, 1971). In 1968 The Times newspaper carried the headline, 'Militant Plot Feared in London' (1968); whereas the Evening Standard coverage of the Heathrow climate camp ran with Extremist to Hijack Climate Camp Demo' 'Militants in Plot to Paralyse Heathrow' (2007) However, the emergence of citizen journalism, Web 2. 0 and new technologies, this paper will show, it is becoming increasingly difficult for journalists to repeat the patterns that shape the identity of protesters. G 20 Meltdown and Heathrow Climate camp protest flagged up important shifts in the relationship between mainstream media organisations and protest groups. At both events protesters engaged with new technologies to produce their own news reports. To counter this approach, journalists increasingly are 'embedded' with protest movements. These two factors, citizen journalism and embedded journalism have, I would argue, led to an opening up of relationship between protest movements and journalist. Journalist will now struggle to follow the inferential structure in light of clear evidence of state and protest violence. Moreover, it shifts the cultural perception of protest groups and the wider field of new social movements. This paper will argue that such use of new technologies and forms of communication raises questions around traditional forms of reporting. The new forms of communication initially offer a balance between protesters and gatekeepers in the style of reporting; but does dispensing with the journalist rely too heavily on the protester for footage? In other words how does, or does, web 2. 0 mean changes the pattern of protest reporting...|$|R

40|$|Looking at the Dot. Com {{boom and}} bust {{witnessed}} in the United States between 1995 and 2003, this paper will give an interpretation of Marx’s mature economic theory with a particular emphasis upon the role of labour-time in his wider theory of capitalist production and breakdown, situating this conceptual apparatus {{in the context of}} radically different conditions of work and capitalist production. This will be done by building up an analysis of the position of labour-time in the creation of absolute and relative surplus-value and the determination of the make-up of the organic composition of capital with specific reference to the circumstances which saw a financial bubble develop around the so-called New Economy of fledgling tech, telecommunications, ICT and internet start-ups in the US during the late nineties <b>and</b> early <b>noughties.</b> Utilising quantitative <b>and</b> qualitative data including government statistics and ethnographic accounts to illustrate the operation of Marxian analytical categories, the paper will assess the usefulness of Marx’s conceptualization of labour-time and crisis to an analysis of the US economy over the period described, and gauge to what extent it requires recalibration to adequately grasp the changes in the organization of capitalist production identified in the research. Whilst much of the evidence provided will reveal that Marx’s theorization is still of considerable exactitude and relevance to contemporary capitalism, there nonetheless remain certain aspects of the New Economy that his economic work are at a loss to comprehend. On the one hand, the Marxist tradition is still a valuable framework through which to view the global economy. Yet, on the other, contemporary capitalism possesses many qualities that require that tradition to be updated in order to help us understand and interpret changes {{in the way in which}} wealth is generated. Chief among these is the increasingly immeasurable nature of labour-time in the context of primarily intangible and immaterial processes of production. It is argued that autonomist Marxism presents a strong example of the way in which Marx's original categorizations can be reconfigured to form a theoretical perspective adequate to these new circumstances, which can be combined critically and fruitfully with the earlier theoretical paradigm to illuminate contemporary conditions of labour and capitalism...|$|R
40|$|The debates {{relating}} to social class {{and whether it}} is still a useful concept in describing a lived reality of the British population has never been far away from media, political and academic dispute. Thatcher's Britain throughout the 1980 s attempted to dilute class meaning with what was called 'a home owning democracy' and thus end class collective politics through easily available credit for the working class while simultaneously attacking trade union organization, recruitment and political action. During the late 1990 s <b>and</b> into the <b>noughties</b> a 'New Labour' administration attempted to exacerbate the end of class politics through an agenda of a 'cultural distinction' to class identity. Class struggle, class politics and class identity is embedded deep within the cultural norms practices, and history of British democracy. Consequently it is difficult if not impossible to prise class inequality in the UK away from and out of national, local and personal politics (Savage et al. 2015 : 393 - 8). This paper focuses upon the sense that class politics, and cultural class distinction, within the UK had the biggest influence in determining a working-class 'Leave Vote' in the 2016 referendum within the UK. This paper explores accounts and narratives from working-class 'leave' voters though an ethnographic study of the political and social viewpoints of working-class communities of East London, and of ex-mining towns of Nottinghamshire. Framing into fuller context the anger and apathy of being 'left out', arguing that being 'left out' has been part of working-class political narratives for over 30 years. Going beyond frustration and apathy, {{a significant part of the}} narrative of working people was of 'not existing', suggesting certain important linkages with ongoing debates about new ways of conceptualizing class differences and class structures.

40|$|It's 4 pm on a Saturday {{afternoon}} in suburbia. Twenty women and men, some in brightly coloured uniforms and stockings, some in regular 'civilian' clothes, are rolling bags and boxes into a recreation centre, {{waiting for the}} basketball games to finish. As soon as the last buzzer goes off, they begin taking over the space, setting out chairs around the outside of an oval track upon which a crew in striped ref uniforms- "Team Zebra"- are taping down raised rope to mark the boundary. The group load consignment beer into the bar area, set up sound equipment borrowed from friends, organize scores of volunteers to staff the door and 'merch' booth. One woman, lanyard denoting her "Attila -Head Bouting Wench" flapping around her neck, is rushing around, briefing the hired security staff on the liquor licensing, making sure the trackside floor seating - the "suicide zone"- is the correctly insurable distance from the track, and overseeing the placement of chairs to ensure adherence to council guidelines on fire exits and wheelchair accessibility. In another room, a family are preparing for their daughter's wedding. By 6 pm the crowd has lined up out the door, the music is pumping, the beer is chilled, and there are 28 uniformed women on old-fashioned quad rollerskates slowly skating circles around the track. They chat casually to one another, stretch out their muscles, practice moves on one another. As the spectators slowly file in- families gathered together in the seating, over 18 's only in the suicide zone, young men with beers in the licensed stands- the atmosphere builds with the crowd eagerly anticipating the night's smashes and crashes. An announcer's voice booms out over the PA: "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to rollllllllller derrrrrrrrrrbyyyyyyy!" The first lineup gather on the starting line- five in red, five in black- and when the whistle blows, they begin the strategic and physical manoeuvring of heavy blocks and quick agility {{that will help them}} win the game. They use their hips, bottoms and shoulders to throw each other off balance; falls and pile-ups are common {{and by the end of}} the game many are sporting rips in their stockings and bruises on areas not covered by their safety equipment. After the game, skaters cross the floor to hug members of the other team, and all line up to high five one another as each team do a victory lap for a bout well-fought. Brave members of the crowd line up to talk to their favourite player, and after all the spectators have left, the skaters begin the process of restoring the venue to its usual state before heading to the requisite after party. The neighbouring wedding has concluded and the party which has dwindled to ten curiously peer in the doors of the now-deserted stadium. The sport of flat track roller derby is complicated, with two half-hour periods broken into jams which last a maximum of two minutes. Each team fields a line-up of five skaters in each jam- one jammer who scores the points, three blockers who hit other skaters and play both offense and defence, and one pivot who plays as a blocker while communicating strategy. In a jam, the first whistle allows the blockers to start skating and the two whistles shortly after allow the jammers to sprint towards the pack; the first jammer through the pack without a penalty is the lead jammer, and has the power to end the jam at any point before the two minutes is up. On each following pass, jammers score one point by passing each opposing player's hips; the blockers use their bodies to legally knock the opposing jammer down or out of bounds while trying to help their jammer past the opposing blockers unscathed. It's fast-paced, physically aggressive, and wildly entertaining. Roller derby started as a profitable spectator sport in 1930 s America, the brainchild of businessman and promoter Leo Seltzer. The rules evolved over the course of the twentieth century and the various incarnations of the sport from the original endurance races to include co-ed teams, staged fights, and pre-written WWF-style storylines. With the advent of television, broadcasting bouts brought a greater audience, but eventually the live immediacy of the sport was choked and it waned in popularity in the 1970 s. The current revival grew out of the alternative music and punk communities of the West coast of America, and Austin, Texas is widely regarded as the birthplace of modern roller derby, starting the first team in the early <b>noughties</b> <b>and</b> continuing to be the headquarters of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) today 1 • It has evolved from a burlesque- and punk-inspired performance to a legitimate sport boasting over 1000 leagues and is being considered for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic Games 2 • Most modern roller derby leagues operate with a grassroots, do-it-yourself (DIY) ethic where members participate in all aspects of management and production. This is embodied in the WFTDA's central governing philosophy of" for the skater, by the skater" 3, which means that "[f]emale skaters are primary owners, managers, and/or operators of each member league and of the association" 4. Aside from bouts- the publicly-spectated events described above- the women spend between two and five times a week training together, as well as fundraisers, league meetings, informal social events and countless hours spent behind the scenes in organizational roles. League members participate in every aspect of management and event production, including financial planning, media relations, coaching, writing policy, and so on. In his study of the importance of do-it-yourself (DIY) in the roller derby revival Beaver states "the DIY ethic is about non alienated self-activity" 5, and this can be seen in both the on- and off track interactions of roller derby participants. They physically work together on the track, and off the track collaborate in the running of the league. The collectivity of the roller derby community leads Beaver to assert that "rollergirls subscribe to a 'do-it ourselves ethos"' 6, and this networking and formation of friendships are central motivators for participating in roller derby. Thus, derby is both an 'alternative' sport, and a subculture dominated and defined by women. Within the subculture, the physicality of sporting elements combined with the gendered dimensions of a female-dominated space allow for experimentation with "doing gender" 7, and the participants engage with this on several levels. Firstly, they adopt pseudonyms, which are often word plays and puns playing on sexual, aggressive and/or ironic themes, such as 'Storm in a D-Cup' or 'Lawrence of a Labia'. In addition, the standards of dress and presentation within the roller derby space- both bouting and training spaces, those in which participants are on skates- embrace an aesthetic which draws on punk, vintage, pinup, rockabilly, camp, and sexual subcultures. While this is partly a function of wearing protective gear including knee and elbow pads, wrist guards, helmets and mouthguards, it is also a conscious and public engagement with gendered identities and the creation of what Finley deems an "alternative femininity" 8, one which takes elements of marginalized femininities and reappropriates them as sources of empowerment. These outward signifiers of resistance are an important element in the self-promotion of leagues as well as the interpretation of roller derby by the mainstream media and the wider community. Despite elements of empowerment and collective action, roller derby is not immune to the discourses and cultural values of the wider socio-political landscape in which it exists. Internal political differences and personal disagreements certainly occur within the community and in extreme cases cause members to leave the subculture or split leagues. The internal dynamics of roller derby leagues highlight the tensions between a mainstream culture in which women are not often offered routes to collective action and diverse support networks, and a subculture that encourages agency, participatory democracy, and collaborative decision-making. Many, if not all leagues, struggle with balancing off-track politics in a tight-knit community and a competitive on-track sport which has to fight to maintain its credibility; however, the continued exponential growth. of the sport stands testament to the abilities of participants to overcome such obstacles through their passion and dedication to the subculture, the athletics, the 'revolution'...|$|R
40|$|Housing is {{typically}} the greatest investment, {{and the most}} valuable asset, of any household. Overall, it dominates the household portfolios and is crucial in the accumulation of wealth over time. Since housing assets can serve as collateral, people are granted large mortgages, and thus even modest returns yield great wealth boosts due to the sheer magnitudes of the investments. Naturally, owning a home also produces housing benefits of great value to the owner-occupier. Everyone needs {{a place to live}} and owning a home secures a steady flow of dwelling services that would otherwise have had to be bought in the rental market. It is no surprise then that Norwegian households' asset portfolios are undiversified: using data from the Income Distribution Survey 2002 from Statistics Norway, we find that the average portfolio has a housing-to-wealth ratio of 1. 175, a stocks-to-wealth ratio of 0. 089, and a debt-to-wealth ratio of 0. 264. These figures mirror findings in similar surveys of other economies. Breaking the average holdings down to age cohorts shows that young households hold much more housing and debt relative to their wealth than older households. It is also evident that wealth accumulates a great deal over the life-cycle: when population average wealth is normalised to unity, the cohort relative wealth goes from 0. 074 for the youngest households, via 2. 233 for 55 - 66 year olds, and finally down to 1. 177 for households with head older than 80. The absence of equity holdings are further notable throughout the study: even the portfolios of the wealthiest quartile contain only 10 % stocks. Our key motivation is then the apparent question; is this behaviour optimal and can the allocations be rationalised by formal models? If not, what are then the theoretical recommendations? For our model experiments, the return on risk-free holdings (i. e., bank deposits, loans and bonds) is estimated by an average of Norwegian real bond rates over 1992 - 2006 less 28 % tax, and amounts to a rate of 0. 03 annually. Stock return is set to the price appreciation (less 28 % tax) plus the dividend rate on the Oslo stock exchange, less inflation, over the same time period. Housing return is similar as it also consists of a capital gain component and a dividend stream. While the former is easily observed by the house price index from Statistics Norway, the latter is not readily available due to lack of observations. However, with justification in rental data and in theory of the benefit to the owner-occupier, we settle on the before-tax, real risk-free rate as proxy for housing dividend. We further elect to follow advice from the literature on the riskiness of single-home housing investments, and set the standard deviation equal to 60 % of that in the stock market. The latter is found be 0. 2 annually for the 1992 - 2006 period. The reason for not simply using the risk exhibited by the house price index as our measure is that this aggregates market transactions and thus cannot capture the risk of buying a single house. We find mean rates of returns from housing and stocks of 0. 11 and 0. 188 respectively, with a correlation of 0. 33. Real prices on stocks and housing have appreciated tremendously since the early 1990 s. In fact, real prices were fairly stable [...] or even decreasing [...] over most of the 20 th century, before going through a boom-bust period in the mid-to-late eighties, and then literally taking off around 1993. Since then, real prices have grown by roughly 490 % and 260 % respectively, and the returns to equity- and house owners have clearly been enormous over these years. Our first attempt at explaining or rationalising the observed household behaviour mentioned above is the employment of a static mean-variance model of portfolio choice. We assume that the investor only cares about the expected return and variance of the portfolio and that the objective is to minimise this variance given a requirement on the expected return (this is of course equivalent to maximising expected return given some risk tolerance). There are two risky assets, housing and stocks, and one risk-free asset, simply called "risk-free. " The two-fund separation theorem ensures that any investor household will choose a combination of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio. While the latter is determined by the properties of the assets available to all investors, each investor will put a weight on the risky- and the risk-free portfolio according to his or her level of risk aversion. The solution to such a setup will then be a set of shares of housing, stocks and risk-free. With return estimates based on observed asset performances over 1992 - 2006 we find that the holdings of stocks and housing should be virtually equal in magnitude (the market portfolio composition of risky assets). The less risk averse the household is, the more stocks, housing and debt should it take on. More risk averse households on the other hand, should hold less of the risky assets and positive amounts of the risk-free asset (i. e., bank deposits or bond holdings). Since this result is very far from the observed holdings, we seek an alternative solution by using different return estimates. Reliable data on equity dividend and on house- and stock prices are available from 1966, so we collect asset properties for the 1966 - 1991 period and calculate a new set of estimates. The resulting portfolio model solution is uplifting: the framework now prescribes far less stocks relative to housing, which we know is closer to actual allocations. For example, with a risk aversion coefficient equal to 3 we find an "optimal" housing share of 1. 129, a share of stocks of 0. 484, and a residual risk-free share of - 0. 613. This is not very far from the observed, average household portfolio barring the weight on stocks (which is much lower in the data). Further, {{there seems to be a}} clear relationship between age and level of risk aversion. That is, for both sets of results, the high-risk aversion portfolios match the observed holdings of older households better, while the model portfolios with lower risk aversion coefficients are better fits with younger households' allocations. We have mentioned that younger households have the largest shares of housing in their overall portfolio, and that the share tends to decline with age. If we now, as an extension of the applied portfolio model, assume that the amount of housing is fixed and determined by the households' demand for housing service consumption, it may be interesting to find the optimal portfolios given the housing share of each cohort. That is, what are the optimal shares of stocks and risk-free when the household is already equipped with a certain expected return and risk from the housing holdings? Unfortunately, our analytical results make no sense in this case due to the absence of a credit constraint: the model prescribes outrageously high portfolio shares of stocks and debt. However, by imposing a limitation on how much the households are allowed to borrow ("no more than minus the housing holdings") in a simple numerical procedure in Excel, we obtain far more reasonable results. But, with the 1992 - 2006 estimates the model recommends an equity share (which is never higher than 0. 12 in the data) between 0. 75 and 1 for all cohorts and a debt share consistently greater than that in the data. When we instead assume that the 1966 - 1991 estimates hold, the match with data is almost perfect: low portfolio shares of stocks throughout and a share of risk-free virtually in sync with the Norwegian observations from 2002. It thus seems like people either disregard the tremendous returns of the nineties <b>and</b> early <b>noughties</b> as extraordinary <b>and</b> unsustainable, or that they enjoy even greater utility from housing than what we have accounted for in our efforts. In any event, the older return estimates are better able to explain the observed 2002 holdings than estimates based on asset returns seen in the years around the observation itself. Our second main exercise is the employment of a dynamic life-cycle model. This approach allows a far richer economic environment to be constructed for the household as we now can consider intertemporal investment-consumption choice and explicitly model the consequences of decisions. It is then assumed that the household receives utility from regular consumption and from housing consumption, and that the objective is, at all stages of life, to maximise the present value of the remaining lifetime utility. While there are still two risky assets and one risk-free asset, we are now adding a stream of labour income which is to be optimally allocated between investment/savings and immediate consumption. As the lifetime optimisation problem is virtually impossible to solve analytically, we resort to the well-known numerical method of value function iterations. This procedure basically entails approximating an unknown function (the present value of remaining lifetime utility [...] the value function) by identifying the values of the choice variables that yield the greatest lifetime utility at any point in time, and for all possible past investment decisions. Using this function we next find consumption- and investment rules that prescribe optimal actions given any previous set of allocations and asset returns, and thus solve the household's problem. It is further assumed that the representative household begins life at age 20, dies at age 80, and that every period in the model corresponds to five years. For computational tractability we abstract from income/human capital uncertainty and simply set the household's income equal to the (normalised) average Norwegian income in 2002 for every period/age. Since the solution is that of a representative household, we simulate the "lives" of 400 individual households, find the average allocations and interpret these as our solution. With the 1992 - 2006 asset return estimates we find that the household should invest quite heavily in housing from the get-go by taking on the maximum amount of debt (relative to the housing investment), while equity investment and regular consumption are chiefly postponed till age 35. From then on however, consumption levels grow tremendously and lie far above labour income throughout. While equity holdings also grow over the life-cycle and stabilise nicely between housing holdings and labour income, debts are responsibly paid down by the simulated households. Moreover, as the stock holdings accumulate and debts are abolished, housing stays fairly constant over time. A possible explanation is that households are using the capital gains from their housing asset to increase consumption, pay down the mortgage and invest in the stock market, rather than reinvesting it back into more housing. This makes perfectly good sense in our model, but may not be too reasonable in the real world. With the 1966 - 1991 asset return estimates we find mostly the same average profiles except for holdings of stocks and housing being consistently greater than with the 1992 - 2006 estimates. This sounds a bit curious since the former asset returns are lower than the latter: why would the households invest more now? One rationale is that the amounts invested in various assets must be higher when expected returns are lower in order for the household to attain a comfortable level of precautionary savings, and to be able to push up future consumption. On the other hand, lower returns on savings also means that future consumption is more expensive, thus households should save less and "eat" more. As our model output shows that regular consumption is pushed forward but attains lower overall levels over the life-cycle compared to the output with the 1992 - 2006 estimates, both above effects are recognised. In the final periods of these exercises, equity investments drop to zero since we assume that there is no value in leaving anything behind. But what if we instead say that the household draws utility, while alive, from bequeathing its end-of-life worth to a younger generation? Solving this modified problem we find, as expected, that the simulated households consume less and save more at the end of their lives. Such a specification is of course much closer to reality since it is commonly assumed that bequest motives exist, and because of the inherent uncertainty of the time of death (which we characteristically have abstracted from in our theoretical escapades). Finally, we compare the performance of the (bequest) model, with the two sets of estimates, to the observed Norwegian life-cycle holdings, surveyed in 2002. We find that the newer estimates allocations lie much closer to the actual holdings than those of the older estimates. This is immediately interesting because the static portfolio model produced the exact opposite conclusion: older estimates were able to better explain observed behaviour than newer ones. Even though predicted stock holdings are still wildly out of tune with observations, the dynamic model solved with the 1992 - 2006 estimates can explain the broad features of households' behaviour...|$|R
