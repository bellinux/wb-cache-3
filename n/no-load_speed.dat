50|$|A blade grinder may be {{considered}} a type of hammermill. A blade grinder resembles a meat grinder in that both have propeller-shaped cutting blades. However, meat grinders (and food mills) use a scissor cutting action as the blades rotate against a perforated metal plate. Meat grinder blades rotate at a much slower speed than blade grinders, which may rotate at speeds as high as 20,000 to 30,000 rpm; {{an example is the}} Preethi Steele mixer-grinder, whose <b>no-load</b> <b>speed</b> is 23500 rpm and loaded speed is 11500rpm.|$|E
50|$|During normal {{operation}} in synchronization with the electricity network, power plants are governed with a five percent droop speed control. This means the {{full load speed}} is 100% and the <b>no-load</b> <b>speed</b> is 105%. This {{is required for the}} stable operation of the network without hunting and drop-outs of power plants. Normally the changes in speed are minor. Adjustments in power output are made by slowly raising the droop curve by increasing the spring pressure on a centrifugal governor. Generally this is a basic system requirement for all power plants because the older and newer plants have to be compatible in response to the instantaneous changes in frequency without depending on outside communication.|$|E

5000|$|Beyond {{the error}} {{inherent}} in the constant air-gap assumption, the circle diagram introduces errors due to rotor reactance and rotor resistance variations caused by magnetic saturation and rotor frequency over the range from <b>no-load</b> to operating <b>speed.</b>|$|R
50|$|In operation, the {{squirrel-cage}} motor {{may be viewed}} as a transformer with a rotating secondary. When the rotor is not rotating in sync with the magnetic field, large rotor currents are induced; the large rotor currents magnetize the rotor and interact with the stator's magnetic fields to bring the rotor almost into synchronization with the stator's field. An unloaded {{squirrel-cage motor}} at rated <b>no-load</b> <b>speed</b> will consume electrical power only to maintain rotor speed against friction and resistance losses. As the mechanical load increases, so will the electrical load - the electrical load is inherently related to the mechanical load. This is similar to a transformer, where the primary's electrical load is related to the secondary's electrical load.|$|E
50|$|Each motor {{ships with}} a torque based {{performance}} chart showing {{the relationship between}} torque and speed, {{which is the most}} important performance indicator for a motor. The <b>no-load</b> <b>speed</b> is the number of rotations per minute of the motor shaft when voltage is applied between the terminals with no load to the motor. No-load current is the current discharged when voltage is applied between the terminals with no load to the motor. Stall torque is when the motor rotation stalls upon increasing the load to the rotating motor, while stall current is when the motor rotation stalls upon increasing the load to the rotating motor. The physics formula E = M (electrical energy input equals mechanical energy output) demonstrates the conservation of energy principle at work in a Mabuchi motor (voltage x current) divided by (efficiency expressed as a percentage) equals (speed in revolutions per minute x torque mN.m g.cm).|$|E
50|$|The winding {{specifications}} affect motor performance the most. Changing {{the number}} of turns per slot or the diameter of magnet wire produces results that differ greatly from each other. Environmental temperature affects the magnetic forces of magnets and the winding resistance, and so indicates changes in motor performance. Changing anisotropic magnets from wet to dry results in decreasing stall torques and increasing <b>no-load</b> <b>speed</b> due to the magnetic force being weakened. Magnets are held in a housing for their full capability, while using a thin-wall housing will result in magnetic force leaking through the housing wall. That is where magnet yokes are used to prevent magnetic leakage, thus maintaining the full capacity of the magnets. Phase refers to positional relations between the center line of each polar magnet and the switching position of commutator segments and brushes. Lagging in phase causes inefficiency, electrical noise, and shortened life. To avoid these situations, improved motors are assembled with forward brush-shifting that offsets the armature reaction during load operation to keep them on neutral electrically.|$|E

Ultrasonic motors offer {{the advantage of}} low speed, high torque operation {{without the need for}} gears. They can be made compact and lightweight and provide a holding torque in the absence of applied power, due to the traveling wave frictional coupling mechanism between the rotor and the stator. This report covers modeling, simulation, fabrication and testing of ultrasonic motors. Design of experiments methods were also utilized to find optimal motor parameters.

40|$|Abstract|A {{transducer}} for an ultrasonic motor {{using two}} sandwich-type vibrators {{has been proposed}} and de-signed. The vibrators cross {{at right angles with}} each other at the tip. The transducer has two vibration modes; one is a symmetrical mode and the other is anti-symmetric. The normal direction motion of the transducer tip is ex-cited by the symmetrical mode. The lateral motion of the tip is excited by the anti-symmetrical mode. The trans-ducer is designed so that these vibration modes are degen-erated.

50|$|Series wound {{electric}} motors respond to increased load by slowing down; the current increases and the torque rises {{in proportion to}} the square of the current since the same current flows in both the armature and the field windings. If the motor is stalled, the current is limited only by the total resistance of the windings and the torque can be very high, and there is a danger of the windings becoming overheated. The counter-EMF aids the armature resistance to limit the current through the armature. When power is first applied to a motor, the armature does not rotate. At that instant, the counter-EMF is zero and the only factor limiting the armature current is the armature resistance. Usually the armature resistance of a motor is low; therefore the current through the armature would be very large when the power is applied. Therefore the need can arise for an additional resistance in series with the armature to limit the current until the motor rotation can build up the counter-EMF. As the motor rotation builds up, the resistance is gradually cut out. The speed-torque characteristic is an almost perfectly straight line between the stall torque and the <b>no-load</b> <b>speed.</b> This suits large inertial loads as the speed will drop until the motor slowly starts to rotate and these motors have a very high stalling torque.|$|E

The motor uses a composite stator, consisting of a metallic flextensional mode converter, or "cymbal," bonded to a 2 -mm-square piezoelectric plate. The cymbal converts contour-mode vibrations of the plate into oscillations in the cymbal, perpendicular to the stator plane. These are further converted into rotational movement in a rotor pressed against the cymbal by means of an elastic-fin friction drive to produce the required rotary actuation. The motor operates on a single-phase electrical supply, and direct control of the output speed and torque can be achieved by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of the supply voltage. Noncontact optical techniques were used to assess the performance of the developed micro-motor.

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{provides an}} overview of GE's H System{trademark} technology, and specifically, the design, development, and test activities associated with the DOE Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS) program. There was intensive effort expended in bringing this revolutionary advanced technology program to commercial reality. In addition to describing the magnitude of performance improvement possible through use of H System{trademark} technology, this paper discusses the technological milestones during the development of the first 9 H (50 Hz) and 7 H (60 Hz) gas turbines. To illustrate the methodical product development strategy used by GE, this paper discusses several technologies that were essential to the introduction of the H System{trademark}. Also included are analyses of the series of comprehensive tests of materials, components and subsystems that necessarily preceded full scale field testing of the H System{trademark}. This paper validates one of the basic premises with which GE started the H System{trademark} development program: exhaustive and elaborate testing programs minimized risk at every step of this process, and increase the probability of success when the H System{trademark} is introduced into commercial service. In 1995, GE, the world leader in gas turbine technology for over half a century, in conjunction with the DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory's ATS program, introduced its new generation of gas turbines. This H System{trademark} technology is the first gas turbine ever to achieve the milestone of 60 % fuel efficiency. Because fuel represents the largest individual expense of running a power plant, an efficiency increase of even a single percentage point can substantially reduce operating costs over the life of a typical gas-fired, combined-cycle plant in the 400 to 500 megawatt range. The H System{trademark} is not simply a state-of-the-art gas turbine. It is an advanced, integrated, combined-cycle system in which every component is optimized for the highest level of performance. The unique feature of an H-technology combined-cycle system is the integrated heat transfer system, which combines both the steam plant reheat process and gas turbine bucket and nozzle cooling. This feature allows the power generator to operate at a higher firing temperature than current technology units, thereby resulting in dramatic improvements in fuel-efficiency. The end result is the generation of electricity at the lowest, most competitive price possible. Also, despite the higher firing temperature of the H System{trademark}, the combustion temperature is kept at levels that minimize emission production. GE has more than 3. 6 million fired hours of experience in operating advanced technology gas turbines, {{more than three times the}} fired hours of competitors' units combined. The H System{trademark} design incorporates lessons learned from this experience with knowledge gleaned from operating GE aircraft engines. In addition, the 9 H gas turbine is the first ever designed using ''Design for Six Sigma'' methodology, which maximizes reliability and availability throughout the entire design process. Both the 7 H and 9 H gas turbines will achieve the reliability levels of our F-class technology machines. GE has tested its H System{trademark} gas turbine more thoroughly than any previously introduced into commercial service. The H System{trademark} gas turbine has undergone extensive design validation and component testing. Full-speed, no-load testing of the 9 H was achieved in May 1998 and pre-shipment testing was completed in November 1999. The 9 H will also undergo approximately a half-year of extensive demonstration and characterization testing at the launch site.

The stall torque and <b>no-load</b> <b>speed</b> attained for a rectangular beam with an as-pect ratio of 1. 44 and pretwist helix angle of 17. 7 were 0. 17 mNm and 840 rpm with inputs of 184. 4 kHz and 149 mW, respectively. Operation in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions was obtained by choosing either 70. 37 or 184. 4 kHz for the operating frequency. The effects of rotor preload and power input on motor performance were investigated experimentally. The results suggest that motor efficiency is higher at low power input, and that effi-ciency increases with preload to a maximum beyond which it begins to drop. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} surface acoustic wave (SAW) device to an ultrasonic linea motor. A merit of SAW device is high energy density and small size. But driving frequency is around 10 MHz or higher. In spite {{of the difficulty of}} high frequency, the high energy density is attractive for actuator application. The SAW linear motor's <b>no-load</b> <b>speed</b> and maximum output force were 1. 1 m/sec and 3. 5 N using a silicon slider. The silicon slider dimensions were 4 x 4 x 0. 3 mm 3. We made a lot of 30 micron diameter projections on the silicon surface. The acceleration was 1000 m/sec 2 and response frequency was 130 kHz or more. The 40 nm step motion was achieved. The SAW motor is expected to be high speed, quick response, and high resolution micro actuator much more. The most significant problem was the high voltage of the driving. For the previous experiments, we required more than 100 V, due to the primitive design of the driving electrode. Our new designed electrode proved that the driving voltage was reduced less than 10 V to excite the traveling wave. ...|$|E
