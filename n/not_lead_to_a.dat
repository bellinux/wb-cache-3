5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of {{manpower}} led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E
5|$|Later in the game, non-rotatable gems can be found, and {{the player}} is punished for {{rotations}} that do <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> match {{by having the}} enemy's gauge fill faster. The amount of damage that the player can take or deliver {{is dependent on the}} monster used in battle, and using a beast in battle earns experience points which can increase the power of that summon. Each monster has a corresponding color, and matching gems that are the same color as your chosen monster or the enemy makes your gauge fill faster or theirs slower. Enemy monsters can change gems on the board to skulls, which cause damage to the player if they are not lined up within a certain number of moves. After being defeated in a battle, enemy monsters are added to the list of creatures that the player chooses from when they start a stage. New monsters can also be found hidden in the stages, along with items that can be used during battles.|$|E
5|$|When Karmal took power, {{he began}} {{expanding}} the support {{base of the}} PDPA. Karmal tried to persuade certain groups, which had been referred to class enemies of the revolution during Taraki and Amin's rule, to support the PDPA. Karmal appointed several non-communists to top positions. Between March and May 1980, 78 out of the 191 people appointed to government posts were not members of the PDPA. Karmal reintroduced the old Afghan custom of having an Islamic invocation every time the government issued a proclamation. In his first live speech to the Afghan people, Karmal called {{for the establishment of}} the National Fatherland Front (NFF); the NFF's founding congress was held in June 1981. Unfortunately for Karmal, his policies did <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> notable increase in support for his regime, and it did not help Karmal that most Afghans saw the Soviet intervention as an invasion.|$|E

5|$|The frogs {{may move}} up to 100m during amplexus before the female lays her eggs. During the laying of the eggs, the pair of frogs remain in amplexus and the male is assumed to {{fertilise}} the eggs with his sperm. Males are also seen to paddle their rear legs during this time, which is speculated to accelerate fertilisation. The egg-laying and fertilisation process takes around five minutes. An average of 5,000 eggs are deposited amongst aquatic vegetation in a gelatinous mass; however, a clump of 11,682 has been recorded. The female moves around while depositing, {{leaving a trail of}} eggs that sometimes entangles upon itself. Initially, the mass floats, but sinks up to 12 hours after laying, or when disturbed. The eggs are distinct from those of other frog species; they are 2–2.5mm wide upon deposition and are bicoloured, black at one end and white at the other. They immediately begin to expand, quickly reaching around 4mm across, before sinking. When first laid, they float with the black pointing up, but after sinking, the orientation becomes disordered. Two to five days later, the tadpoles hatch out, but the process can take only a few hours on occasions. The hatching rate varies between 46 and 77%, and peaks at 22°C. Hatching is less likely in acidic waters, although alkaline conditions do <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lower rate compared to neutral conditions. Given the large number of eggs that hatch per female and given the scarcity of mature frogs, tadpole survival rates are believed to be very low.|$|E

25|$|In fact, {{adding the}} cosmological {{constant}} to Einstein's equations does <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> static universe at equilibrium because the equilibrium is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe that contracts slightly will continue contracting.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Nick Szabo {{proposed}} {{a challenge to}} build a macroscale replicator from Lego robot kits and similar basic parts.

25|$|At each {{position}} of the rotors, an electric current would or would not flow {{in each of the}} 26 wires, and this would be tested in the bombe's comparator unit.

25|$|The 15-minute network {{television}} program, The Liberace Show, began on July 1, 1952, but did <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> regular network series. Instead, producer Duke Goldstone mounted a filmed version of Liberace's local show performed before a live audience for syndication in 1953 {{and sold it}} to scores of local stations. The widespread exposure of the syndicated series made the pianist more popular and prosperous than ever. His first two years' earnings from television netted him $7 million and on future reruns, he earned up to 80% of the profits.|$|E
25|$|The Standing Commission for Linguistic Supervision is {{a federal}} {{institution}} responsible for collecting and reporting language complaints. It can give its opinion to the responsible public authorities, but its opinions are not binding. In its recommendations 26.125A, 26.033 and 23.062 (all published in 1994), the agency argued that language facilities should <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> generalised system of bilingualism of public services in which both languages would hold equal status. Only the regional governments can provide a supreme binding political interpretation for the language laws {{and the application of}} language facilities, which can only be annulled by the Council of State.|$|E
50|$|On 13 December 1869 the Swansea Vale Railway Board had formal {{discussions with}} representatives of the Midland Railway; the {{negotiation}} was successful, but did <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> immediate arrangement. Nevertheless in August 1870 the Midland Railway agreed to lend £10,000 to the Swansea Vale Railway; the sum was later raised to £20,000.|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} to notice that, in some cases, the causality sequence could not be represented by changes in the A-matrix block.

Instead, a secondary sequence {{can be observed in}} changes on the intermediate demand block of waste treatment inputs.|$|R
25|$|One {{example of}} a hidden benefit {{involves}} Malarus cyaneus, the superb fairy-wren. In M. cyaneus, the presence of helpers at the nest does <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increase in chick mass. However, the presence of helpers does confer a hidden benefit: it increases the chance that a mother will survive to breed in the next year.|$|R
