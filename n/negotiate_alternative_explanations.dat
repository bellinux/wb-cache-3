40|$|Delusions can {{be viewed}} as {{explanations}} of experiences,. By definition, the experiences are insufficient to merit the delusional explanations. So why have delusions been accepted rather than more realistic explanations? The authors report a study of <b>alternative</b> <b>explanations</b> in 100 individuals with delusions. Patients were assessed on the following criteria: symptom measures, the evidence for the delusions, the availability of <b>alternative</b> <b>explanations,</b> reasoning, and self-esteem. Three quarters of the patients did not report any <b>alternative</b> <b>explanation</b> for the experiences on which the delusions were based. These patients reported significantly more internal anomalous experiences and had a more hasty reasoning style than patients who did have <b>alternative</b> <b>explanations</b> available. Having doubt in a delusion, without an <b>alternative</b> <b>explanation,</b> was associated with lower self-esteem. Clinicians will need to develop plausible and compelling alternative accounts of experience in interventions rather than merely challenge patients' delusional beliefs...|$|R
