5|$|Burton {{fails to}} {{complete}} the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains {{that he tried to}} stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Dean dropped heavy {{rainfall}} across Puerto Rico, peaking at 12.7inches (322mm) in Salinas. Winds were generally light across the island. The passage of Dean resulted in widespread flooding in {{eastern and southern}} Puerto Rico, collapsing two bridges and one road. Several highways were under water, and one car was swept away by the floodwaters. The four inside the vehicle were later rescued and unharmed. Throughout the island, about 1,320houses were flooded, and two houses experienced collapsed roofs. The rains left various towns without power or water. By the <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm passed the island, more than 16,000 were without power, while almost 70,000 lacked potable water.

5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Davies' {{next project}} was The Grand, a period soap drama {{set in a}} Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was {{designed}} to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9pm on a Friday <b>night.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), who kills her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{immediate}} {{impact on the}} pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar. The Boar's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One <b>night,</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, The Rock's return {{generated}} {{a lot of}} buzz, an average of 4.7 million people watched that episode of Raw, but 7.4 million tuned in just during The Rock’s promo.

In that same year, The Rock wrestled his first match in years at 2011 Survivor Series in Madison Square Garden. The event sold out in less than 90 minutes.

5|$|On 11 March 1970 a large protest {{took place}} outside the North Vietnamese and PRGSV embassies, as protesters demanded Viet Cong troops {{withdraw}} from Cambodia. The protests turned chaotic, as protesters looted both embassies {{and set them}} on fire, alarming Sihanouk. Sihanouk, who was in Paris at the time, contemplated between returning to quell the situation, and visiting Moscow, Beijing, and Hanoi. He opted for the latter, thinking that he could persuade its leaders to recall Viet Cong troops to their jungle sanctuaries, where they had originally established themselves between 1964 and 1969. Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk's wife Monique, was summoned to the National Assembly to answer corruption charges. On that <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol's troops instead. On 18March 1970 the National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk, allowing Lon Nol to assume emergency powers.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{ended the}} month with a five-game series, {{continuing}} into June, against the New York Mets. Although Buchanan's second major-league {{start in the}} series opener was a quality start, the Phillies offense managed one run for a 4–1 loss.

Burnett threw seven innings and allowed five runs, after which six relievers threw a combined seven scoreless innings.
