5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announces to {{the staff}} of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) that she is {{participating}} in a charity which provides gifts to underprivileged children who write letters to Santa. She buys far more than what is requested in the letter, wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment in the letter, however, the door is answered by two adults who take the gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving no help from the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have it shut down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity.

5|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley) is {{recruiting}} {{for the new}} all-girl show choir {{directed by}} Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), and asks Santana (Naya Rivera)—a member of the school's existing glee club, New Directions—to join. Santana balks at leaving Brittany behind, and when she and Brittany {{go out on a}} dinner date, Santana tries to recruit her, but Brittany is unwilling to leave her New Directions friends. She tells Santana of Rory's supposed magical powers, and Santana later coerces Rory into telling Brittany that Santana has wished for her to join Shelby's glee club. Brittany believes she must obey that wish, but her third wish is that doing so does not hurt anybody's feelings. New Directions co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) tries to persuade Brittany not to leave: he tells her that leprechauns are <b>not</b> <b>real</b> and that she is being stupid. Brittany, insulted, quits anyway.|$|E

Tom answers {{the door to}} Stevie, who asks Tom {{to come back to}} work. He is alarmed to see Tom call Gerri; Stevie says that Gerri was killed in a car accident, and that Tom went back to work too soon. Stevie heads to the bathroom to get Tom's medication, but freezes when he sees the corpse of Migg in the bath. Tom tells him not to worry, and that Migg is <b>not</b> <b>real.</b> He invites Stevie to stay for coffee, saying Gerri is just boiling the kettle.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are <b>not</b> <b>real,</b> {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to {{pay a visit to}} Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may have gone back to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E

5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a hike in the local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and <b>not</b> <b>real.</b> However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E

25|$|Infants now combine {{different}} vowels and consonants into syllable strings. At this stage, infants {{also produce}} various stress and intonation patterns.

25|$|In the 12th century, Arzachel {{departed}} from the ancient Greek idea of uniform circular motions by hypothesizing that the planet Mercury moves in an elliptic orbit, while Alpetragius proposed a planetary model that abandoned the equant, epicycle and eccentric mechanisms, though {{this resulted in a}} system that was mathematically less accurate. Alpetragius also declared the Ptolemaic system as an imaginary model that was successful at predicting planetary positions but <b>not</b> <b>real</b> or physical.

25|$|A {{color space}} maps {{a range of}} {{physically}} produced colors from mixed light, pigments, etc. to an objective description of color sensations registered in the human eye, typically in terms of tristimulus values, but not usually in the LMS color space defined by the spectral sensitivities of the cone cells. The tristimulus values associated with a color space can be conceptualized as amounts of three primary colors in a tri-chromatic, additive color model. In some color spaces, including the LMS and XYZ spaces, the primary colors used are <b>not</b> <b>real</b> colors {{in the sense that}} they cannot be generated in any light spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} {{in people}} with DLB most commonly involve perception of people or animals that are not there, and may reflect Lewy bodies or AD pathology in the temporal lobe. Delusions may include reduplicative paramnesia and other elaborate misperceptions or misinterpretations. These hallucinations are not necessarily disturbing, and in some cases, the person with DLB may have insight into the hallucinations and even be amused by them, or be conscious they are <b>not</b> <b>real.</b> People with DLB also may have problems with vision, including double vision, and misinterpretation of what they see, for example, mistaking a pile of socks for snakes or a clothes closet for the bathroom.|$|E

25|$|When {{households}} are not charged for the reactive power they consume {{there is almost}} no monetary incentive for them to install power factor correction equipment. This is generally the case today, as household electric meters do not measure apparent power but only real power. Adding power factor correction merely affects the reactive power supplied or drawn and <b>not</b> <b>real</b> power, so utility costs are unaffected. However if there are high-resistance lines connected between the utility meter and a relatively high load then the power as measured by the meter can be reduced by a small amount with power factor correction. Any such savings are usually insignificant.|$|E
25|$|On July 9, 2008, Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton {{posted a}} video to YouTube, {{claiming}} that they had discovered {{the body of a}} dead Sasquatch in a forest in northern Georgia. Tom Biscardi was contacted to investigate. Dyer and Whitton received $50,000 from Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. as a good faith gesture. The story was covered by many major news networks, including BBC, CNN, ABC News, and Fox News. Soon after a press conference, the alleged Bigfoot body was delivered in a block of ice in a freezer with the Searching for Bigfoot team. When the contents were thawed, observers found that the hair was <b>not</b> <b>real,</b> the head was hollow, and the feet were rubber. Dyer and Whitton admitted that it was a hoax after being confronted by Steve Kulls, executive director of SquatchDetective.com.|$|E
