50|$|In 1960, Deutsche Bundesbahn built a wagon repair shed in {{the area}} of the former Bingerbrück harbour. The 3,000 square-metre shed was crossed by three {{parallel}} tracks, which were connected at both ends to the rail <b>network.</b> The <b>wagon</b> repair shed was closed after 18 years, in 1978, as a result of the centralisation of maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Alfred Eugene Jackson {{was born}} on January 11, 1807 in Davidson County, Tennessee. He {{attended}} Washington College (presumably Washington College Academy, a predecessor of Tusculum College, {{both of which were}} founded by Samuel Doak) and Greeneville College, now Tusculum College. After college he became a farmer and merchant of produce and manufactured wares, and distributed those goods from North Carolina to the Mississippi River through an extensive transportation <b>network</b> of <b>wagons</b> and boats that he established.|$|R
50|$|The RCH {{went on to}} set {{technical}} standards for various items, such as goods wagons, to promote standardisation across the rail <b>network.</b> If a <b>wagon</b> was described as an RCH wagon, this meant it had been built to comply with RCH standards.|$|R
50|$|From 1965, {{instead of}} {{converting}} wagons to BMF, BB/BP wagons were instead upgraded to BMX. This code signified fitting of ride control {{and other features}} required for operation on the standard gauge <b>network,</b> and these <b>wagons</b> could have bogies switched fairly quickly between gauges.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} the mill to be successful, it was {{essential}} to establish an efficient means for bringing the cane harvest in from surrounding farms to be crushed. Tramway <b>networks</b> carrying <b>wagons</b> drawn by steam locomotives had been used effectively in other Queensland sugar districts since the 1880s, so possible routes for a tramway network were surveyed {{as part of the}} planning for the Moreton Mill. A two-foot (610mm) gauge was chosen for the sake of economy, speed not being an important factor in the running of the tramway, though the wagons were at first pulled by horses. In 1897 the first tramlines were constructed and the first harvest was crushed at the mill.|$|R

50|$|A {{dispute over}} a second planned Arnold movie then {{resulted}} in Bartlett leaving Nickelodeon {{to write and}} produce a TV movie for Cartoon <b>Network</b> called Party <b>Wagon</b> (also produced by Snee-Oosh), a story originally intended as a pilot for an ongoing series. It ended up being the first Cartoon Network movie-length pilot to be broadcast, but not picked up until Underfist: Halloween Bash, which was created by Maxwell Atoms, who created The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and Evil Con Carne.|$|R
50|$|However, Hey Arnold!: The Movie {{received}} a poor reception, and grossed $15.2 million worldwide, {{leading to the}} cancellation of The Jungle Movie and leaving the cliffhanger of the television series unresolved. Despite this, Nickelodeon still wanted to make The Jungle Movie, desiring to put Bartlett into an exclusive contract where he could only work for them. However, during the period, Bartlett {{was working on a}} pilot/TV movie for Cartoon <b>Network,</b> called Party <b>Wagon,</b> so he declined the offer and left the network.|$|R
50|$|Since 1997 Regental Bahnbetriebs has {{operated}} all {{the lines of}} the Bavarian Forest railway under contract to the Deutsche Bahn (DB Regio Bayern). Under this contract it has run since 2001 under the trade name Oberpfalzbahn not only its own route from Bad Kötzting to Lam, but also the Schwandorf-Cham-Furth im Wald, Cham-Waldmünchen and Cham-Bad Kötzting lines. In addition, the goods traffic branch Regental Cargo also belongs to the Regental Bahnbetriebs-GmbH. Regental Cargo runs goods trains countrywide, has its centre of operations at Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg (with a satellite depot at Zwickau) and is part of the goods <b>wagon</b> <b>network</b> Eccocargo.|$|R
25|$|To get to {{the rich}} new lands of the West Coast, there were two options: some sailed around the {{southern}} tip of South America during a six-month voyage, but 400,000 others walked there on an overland route of more than 2,000 miles (3,000km); their wagon trains usually left from Missouri. They moved in large groups under an experienced wagonmaster, bringing their clothing, farm supplies, weapons, and animals. These wagon trains followed major rivers, crossed prairies and mountains, and typically ended in Oregon and California. Pioneers generally attempted to complete the journey during a single warm season, usually over the course of six months. By 1836, when the first migrant wagon train was organized in Independence, Missouri, a wagon trail had been cleared to Fort Hall, Idaho. Trails were cleared further and further west, eventually reaching {{all the way to the}} Willamette Valley in Oregon. This <b>network</b> of <b>wagon</b> trails leading to the Pacific Northwest was later called the Oregon Trail. The eastern half of the route was also used by travelers on the California Trail (from 1843), Mormon Trail (from 1847), and Bozeman Trail (from 1863) before they turned off to their separate destinations.|$|R
500|$|The ice trade, {{also known}} as the frozen water trade, was a 19th-century industry, {{centering}} on the east coast of the United States and Norway, involving the large-scale harvesting, transport and sale of natural ice for domestic consumption and commercial purposes. Ice was cut from the surface of ponds and streams, then stored in ice houses, before being sent on by ship, barge or railroad to its final destination around the world. <b>Networks</b> of ice <b>wagons</b> were typically used to [...] distribute the product to the final domestic and smaller commercial customers. The ice trade revolutionized the U.S. meat, vegetable and fruit industries, enabled significant growth in the fishing industry, and encouraged the introduction of a range of new drinks and foods.|$|R
25|$|Sergeant Rutledge (Ford Productions-Warner Bros, 1960) was Ford's last cavalry film. Set in the 1880s, {{it tells}} the story of an African-American cavalryman (played by Woody Strode) who is wrongfully accused of raping and murdering a white girl. It was erroneously marketed as a {{suspense}} film by Warners and was not a commercial success. During 1960, Ford made his third TV production, The Colter Craven Story, a one-hour episode of the <b>network</b> TV show <b>Wagon</b> Train, which included footage from Ford's Wagon Master (on which the series was based). He also visited the set of The Alamo, produced, directed by, and starring John Wayne, where his interference caused Wayne to send him out to film second-unit scenes which were never used (nor intended to be used) in the film.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the gold}} rush wound down in the 1860s, the {{majority}} of the work force found jobs in the railroad industry. Chinese labor was integral to the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad, which linked the railway network of the Eastern United States with California on the Pacific coast. Construction began in 1863 at the terminal points of Omaha, Nebraska and Sacramento, California, and the two sections were merged and ceremonially completed on May 10, 1869, at the famous [...] "golden spike" [...] event at Promontory Summit, Utah. It created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the American West. This <b>network</b> caused the <b>wagon</b> trains of previous decades to become obsolete, exchanging it for a modern transportation system. The building of the railway required enormous labor in the crossing of plains and high mountains by the Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad, the two privately chartered federally backed enterprises that built the line westward and eastward respectively.|$|R
50|$|The rest of {{the film}} focuses on the British {{invasion}} of Zululand and the lead-up to the Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army, laden with an immense <b>network</b> of supply <b>wagons,</b> invades Zululand and marches {{in the direction of}} Ulundi, the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts. Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana, ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night, Colonel Durnford and an escort of fifty mounted Basutos approach the camp. Lord Chelmsford then orders Durnford to return to his unit, bringing them to the camp immediately to reinforce Colonel Pulleine. Lt. Vereker should join Durnford as aide-de-camp.|$|R
