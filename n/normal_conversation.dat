5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander {{maintain}} that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to {{bear the brunt of}} the captain's rages. Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his officers and crew, Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume <b>normal</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Normal</b> <b>conversation</b> {{is usually}} at middle or high pitch; low pitch {{occurs at the}} end of utterances other than yes–no questions, while high pitch occurs {{at the end of}} yes–no questions. Very high pitch is for strong emotion or emphasis. Pitch can {{indicate}} attitude: for example, Great uttered in isolation can indicate weak emotion (with pitch starting medium and dropping to low), enthusiasm (with pitch starting very high and ending low), or sarcasm (with pitch starting and remaining low).|$|E

50|$|Diagram-based notations are {{the clearest}} {{way to show}} juggling {{patterns}} on paper, but as {{they are based on}} images, their use is limited in text-based communication. Ladder diagrams track the path of all the props through time, where the less complicated causal diagrams only track the props that are in the air, and assumes that a juggler has a prop in each hand. Numeric notation systems are more popular and standardized than diagram-based notations. They are used extensively in both a written form and in <b>normal</b> <b>conversations</b> among jugglers.|$|R
25|$|According {{to later}} reports, between 1901 and 1903 Scriabin envisioned writing an opera. He {{talked a lot}} about it and expounded its ideas in the course of <b>normal</b> <b>conversation.</b> The work would center around a nameless hero, a philosopher-musician-poet. Among other things, he would declare: I am the apotheosis of world creation. I am the aim of aims, the end of ends. The Poem Op. 32 No. 2 and the Poème Tragique Op. 34 were {{originally}} conceived as arias in the opera.|$|E
25|$|Coprolalia {{encompasses}} {{words and}} phrases that are culturally taboo or generally unsuitable for acceptable social use, when used out of context. The term is not used to describe contextual swearing. It is usually expressed out of social or emotional context, and may be spoken in a louder tone or different cadence or pitch than <b>normal</b> <b>conversation.</b> It can be a single word, or complex phrases. A person with coprolalia may repeat the word mentally rather than saying it out loud; these subvocalizations can be very distressing.|$|E
25|$|The {{high point}} of Arabic word use in Spanish was in late medieval times and has {{declined}} since then, but hundreds are still used in <b>normal</b> <b>conversation.</b> A larger majority of these words are nouns, {{with a number of}} verbs and adjectives derived directly from these nouns, e.g. alquilar (to rent) and alquilado (rented) from alquiler (rent), most of which are excluded from this list. There are also one preposition: hasta ("until"), and one adverb he. There has been little influence on the basic grammatical structure of the language.|$|E
40|$|A {{random sample}} of {{patients}} aged 70 and over from a general practice were interviewed in their own homes. Information was sought on their hearing difficulty and mental state: standardised measures of anxiety, depression, and memory loss were used. Of the 657 subjects interviewed, 33 % reported having difficulty hearing <b>normal</b> <b>conversations</b> and 6 % reported experiencing "much difficulty. " Hearing difficulty was associated with both depression and anxiety, but the associations weakened when adjustment was made for physical disability. The association with memory loss disappeared when adjusted for physical disability. There was a close relationship both with age and physical disability...|$|R

Jerome is rehearsing Nan in her role as the perfect female companion. He has re-programmed her to respond to the name Zoe, and has changed her appearance to match. In fact in this act Nan/Zoe is now played by the actress who played the real Zoe in Act 1. However she still has the same humorous flaws, movements and habits. She has also been programmed to respond to certain trigger words using phrases and actions which Jerome anticipates will be useful – but comedy results from the unexpected use of the trigger words in <b>normal</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Erickson {{believed}} that the unconscious mind was always listening and that, {{whether or not the}} patient was in trance, suggestions could be made which would have a hypnotic influence, as long as those suggestions found resonance at the unconscious level. The patient could be aware of this or could be completely oblivious that something was happening. Erickson would see if the patient would respond to one or another kind of indirect suggestion and allow the unconscious mind to participate actively in the therapeutic process. In this way, what seemed like a <b>normal</b> <b>conversation</b> might induce a hypnotic trance, or a therapeutic change in the subject. According to Weitzenhoffer, [...] " [...] conception of the unconscious is definitely not the one held by Freud." ...|$|E

40|$|Communication is {{critical}} for normal, everyday life. During a conversation, information is conveyed {{in a number of}} ways, including through body, head, and facial changes. While much research has examined these latter forms of communication, the majority of it has focused on static representations of a few, supposedly universal expressions. <b>Normal</b> <b>conversations,</b> however, contain a very wide variety of expressions and are rarely, if ever, static. Here, we report several experiments that show that expressions that use head, eye, and internal facial motion are recognized more easily and accurately than static versions of those expressions. Moreover, we demonstrate conclusively that this dynamic advantage is due to information that is only available over time, and that the temporal integration window for this information is at least 100 ms long...|$|R
2500|$|Where {{classical}} hypnosis is authoritative {{and direct}} and often encounters {{resistance in the}} subject, Erickson's approach is permissive, accommodating and indirect. For example, where a classical hypnotist might say [...] "You are going into a trance", an Ericksonian hypnotist {{would be more likely}} to say [...] "you can comfortably learn how to go into a trance". In this way, he provides an opportunity for the subject to accept the suggestions they are most comfortable with, at their own pace, and with an awareness of the benefits. The subject knows they are not being hustled and takes full ownership of, and participates in, their transformation. [...] Because the induction takes place during the course of a <b>normal</b> <b>conversation,</b> Ericksonian hypnosis is often known as Covert or Conversational Hypnosis.|$|E

2500|$|The main town, St Anne, {{historically}} {{known as}} La Ville ("The Town"), {{is often referred}} to as [...] "St Anne's" [...] by visitors and incomers, but rarely by locals (who, in <b>normal</b> <b>conversation,</b> still most frequently refer to the area centred on Victoria Street simply as [...] "Town"). The town's [...] "High Street", which formerly had a small handful of shops, is now almost entirely residential, forming a T-junction with Victoria St at its highest point. The town area features an imposing church and an unevenly cobbled main street: Victoria Street (Rue Grosnez – the English name being adopted on the visit of Queen Victoria in 1854). There are a primary school, a secondary school, a post office, and hotels, as well as restaurants, banks and shops.

50|$|The {{language}} {{in this play}} moves from fast to slow. It goes from fast paced dialogues to slower monologues. In the <b>normal</b> <b>conversations</b> the characters are often interrupting each other. Quickly moving through their conversations as if they know what the other is going to say. It slows back down when one character really has something important to say. Sherman also uses singing within the dialogues. Those lines give a little insight on what is to come. The singing also attempts to hint at Reuben {{to see what he}} is missing. “So baby love me/ Love me tonight…Tomorrow was made for some/but tomorrow may never come” (Sherman 81). This is first heard when Reuben and Sarah are having dinner {{and it seems to be}} foreshadowing their romantic relationship.
