40|$|In recent decades, {{stands of}} Greek fir (Abies cephalonica Loudon)  are declining and high tree {{mortality}} {{has been observed}} in some years.  The exact causes of fir decline and mortality have not been established although many have been proposed (drought, climatic change, air pollution and attacks by pathogens or insects). This study has focused on the effects of mistletoe (Viscum album L.) on fir crown condition by assessing the mistletoe infestation level {{and its effects on}} fir defoliation. In the fir forests of Central Greece, the tree crown condition and the extent of mistletoe infestation were assessed and their relationships with tree height, altitude and aspect were investigated. The role of mistletoe on overall fir mortality was investigated by assessing standing trees that had died recently.  The leaf water potential and chlorophyll fluorescence of mistletoe and fir were also measured during one growth season. The results showed that mistletoe infestation is related to crown defoliation. Altitude and tree height were not related with mistletoe infestation while infestation levels were lower on <b>northern</b> <b>exposures.</b> Mistletoe showed significantly lower water potentials and higher photochemical efficiencies than fir branches. </p...|$|R

The paper gives the overview of geological composition of municipal territory (through listed lithological elements, with lithological map), as well as the basic types of groundwater aquifers (intergranular, fissured and karstic). Geomorphological part of the paper offers the hypsometrical analysis (hilly areas at the altitudes from 200 to 500 m a. s. l. are dominant), as well as the relief exposures (northwestern, western and <b>northern</b> <b>exposures</b> are dominant), with the accompanying maps. Apart from that, there is a genetic overview of relief: it was formed by fluvial processes (dominant type), mass-movements, and karstic process. In the conclusion, the potential use of particular geomorphological units is described, with the practical suggestions. The dominant river valleys are in the function of transport infrastructure, while hills are favorable for fruit-growing. Landslides are the main limiting factor in the areas of contacts between valley slopes and alluvial plains. Gulling character of most river courses, as well as dangers from floods, are the limitations as well...|$|R

25|$|After {{a one-year}} hiatus, CTV revived the series in 1997 with {{international}} investment (from the BBC, ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG, and TF1), and it ran for two further seasons, until 1999. In the United States, seasons {{three and four}} were packaged together as a single 26-episode season for syndication. Despite critical acclaim and a consistently warm reception by American audiences, Due South never became a huge hit in the United States; however, {{it was one of}} the most highly rated regular series ever broadcast by a Canadian network. The show remains popular in the United Kingdom, and became one of the few non-British shows to have a prime-time weeknight slot on BBC One. In the UK, Due South was broadcast on Tuesdays from May 9, 1995, earning critical acclaim with comparisons to <b>Northern</b> <b>Exposure</b> and ratings of over eight million, until a switch in June to Fridays, being pulled from the schedule in July, and returned to Tuesdays in September. Season two was broadcast on Saturday nights from July 27, 1996 and fared similarly well, but was pulled from the schedules in October with five episodes of the season remaining. These were shown in January 1997. The BBC co-financed the third season but struggled to find a suitable slot on Saturday nights for it, and only five episodes of the series were shown in May and June 1998 with the remainder in daytime slots over Christmas 1998. The final season, broadcast from May to November 1999, was moved to BBC Two and consistently performed well, with ratings of over two million viewers, regularly appearing in the top-ten weekly shows for the channel. Upon the end of the series in 1999, BBC Two immediately began to screen repeats, and the series was also rescreened on ITV3 in 2006, and again on BBC Two from October 18, 2010.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Natural or {{artificial}} regeneration, rehabilitation, and conversion from coppice to {{high forest}} are important practices in Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) forests in Turkey. Studies {{of the seeds}} of this species have increased in number because mast years are infrequent and seed germination is inhibited by dormancy. In this study we quantified the effects of tree age (40 - 59, 60 - 79 and 80 - 99 years), stand exposure (north, west, east and south) and elevation (600 and 800 m a. s. l.) on seed characteristics (germination, moisture content, and weight) of Oriental beech. Material and Methods: The seeds {{used in this study}} were collected from natural beech forest at Kumluca, Bartin, in the western Black Sea region of Turkey. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory and the greenhouse of Bartin University. Results: Seed germination and moisture content varied significantly by elevation, and seed germination was strongly influenced by elevation. Moisture content was 14 % at 600 m and 16 % at 800 m. The effects of elevation and tree age on 100 seed weights were not significant but exposure had a significant effect. The highest 100 seed weight was recorded for trees on southern exposures and the highest germination percentage of 82 % was recorded for trees on <b>northern</b> <b>exposures.</b> Conclusions: In conclusion, since oriental beech seedlings are produced by generative propagation method, seeds should be harvested in optimum distribution area of beech, from average ages and phenotypically plus tree...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the {{vascular}} flora and the local climate along an altitudinal gradient in the Lefka Ori massif Crete and to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on the plant diversity of the sub-alpine and alpine zones. It provides a quantitative/qualitative analysis of vegetation-environment relationships for four summits along an altitude gradient on the Lefka Ori massif Crete (1664 - 2339 m). The GLORIA multi-summit approach was used to provide vegetation and floristic data together with temperature records for every summit. Species richness and species turnover was calculated together with floristic similarity between the summits. 70 species were recorded, 20 of which were endemic, belonging to 23 different families. Cretan endemics dominate at these high altitudes. Species richness and turnover decreased with altitude. The two highest summits showed greater floristic similarity. Only 20 % of the total flora recorded reaches the highest summit while 10 % is common among summits. Overall there was a 4. 96 degrees C decrease in temperature along the 675 m gradient. Given a scenario of temperature increase the ecotone between the sub-alpine and alpine zone would be likely to have the greatest species turnover. Southern exposures are likely to be invaded first by thermophilous species while <b>northern</b> <b>exposures</b> are likely to be more resistant to changes. Species distribution shifts will also depend on habitat availability. Many, already threatened, local endemic species will be affected first...|$|R
40|$|The N–S {{trending}} {{belt with}} Grenvillian-age rocks developed in central western Argentina represents {{the basement of}} an allochthonous terrane derived from Laurentia during the Early Paleozoic. The Las Matras pluton (36846 0 S, 67807 0 W) {{is located at the}} southern extension of this belt in the Las Matras Block. It consists of a low-Al tonalitic to trondhjemitic facies characteristic of an arc magmatism. Isotopic studies yielded Grenvillian Rb–Sr (1212 ^ 47 Ma) and Sm–Nd (1188 ^ 47 Ma) ages which, due to the undeformed and non-metamorphosed character of the pluton, are interpreted to represent a crystallization age of around 1200 Ma. Although this age is slightly older than available dates from other exposures of the same belt, and the undeformed feature is also distinctive for Las Matras, the depleted Sr and Nd isotopic signatures of the pluton agree with those from other magmatic rocks involved in that belt. The differences found between Las Matras and the <b>northern</b> <b>exposures</b> indicate that this belt with Grenvillian-age rocks comprises regions of non-homogeneous evolution. Although the correlation of the Lower Paleozoic platform carbonates from the sedimentary cover of the Grenvillian-age basement rocks suggests the surroundings of the Southern Grenville Province (Texas and northern Mexico) as the probable detachment site for the Argentine belt, comparison of magmatic and tectonic processes involved in these basement rocks does not indicate similar evolutions.
