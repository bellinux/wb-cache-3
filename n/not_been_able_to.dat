5|$|Betty Dean Sanders {{was born}} on May 28, 1934, to Ollie Mae Sanders and Shelman Sandlin. Sandlin was 21 years old and Ollie Mae Sanders was a teenager; the couple was unmarried. Throughout her life, Betty Sanders {{maintained}} {{that she had been}} born in Detroit, Michigan, but early records—such as her high-school and college transcripts—show Pinehurst, Georgia, as her place of birth.

5|$|In French drawings, Vengeur {{is often}} {{depicted}} as flying the Tricolour, {{which had been}} recently ordered by the Convention to be flown as battle ensign; however, {{due to a lack}} of bunting in Brest, Villaret had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> distribute this flag to all his ships, and thus Vengeur probably still flew the white flag with a canton of three equal columns of red, white, and blue.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} {{statistical}} analysis will be strongly affected by any errors {{in identifying the}} inventory of glyphs, {{as well as by}} divergence from a purely syllabic representation, such as a glyph for reduplication.

5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford many live instruments {{around the time of}} his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, and used the sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E

The Soviets had constructed three heavily fortified defensive belts to slow and weaken the attacking armoured forces.

5|$|Human {{activities}} have had {{positive effects on}} some species of cockatoo and negative effects on others. Many species of open country have benefited greatly from anthropogenic changes to the landscape, with the great increase in reliable seed food sources, available water and have also adapted well to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to be restricted to Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered greatly from habitat destruction; in the main, {{they appear to have}} a more specialised diet and have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> incorporate exotic food into their diet.
