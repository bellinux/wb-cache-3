40|$|We studied methane <b>emission</b> by <b>bubbling</b> from Gatun Lake, Panama, at water {{depths of}} less than 1 m to about 10 m. Gas bubbles were {{collected}} in floating traps deployed during 12 - to 60 -hour observation periods. Comparison of floating traps and floating chambers showed that about 98 % of methane <b>emission</b> occurred by <b>bubbling</b> and only 2 % occurred by diffusion. Average methane concentration of bubbles at our sites varied from 67 % to 77 %. Methane <b>emission</b> by <b>bubbling</b> occurred episodically, with greatest rates primarily between the hours of 0800 and 1400 LT. Events appear to be triggered by wind. The flux of methane associated with bubbling was strongly anticorrelated with water depth. Seasonal changes in water depth caused seasonal variation of methane <b>emission.</b> <b>Bubble</b> methane fluxes through the lake surface into the atmosphere measured during 24 -hour intervals were least (10 - 200 mg/m 2 /d) at deeper sites (greater than 7 m) and greatest (300 - 2000 mg/m 2 /d) at shallow sites (less than 2 m) ...|$|R

We {{analyze the}} effect of various {{combinations}} of state and <b>national</b> <b>emissions</b> policies on <b>national</b> <b>emissions</b> of a global pollutant, specifically, greenhouse gas emissions. We highlight {{the effect of}} unintended increases in out-of-state emissions on the efficacy of overlapping state policies. We show that emission taxes do not necessarily prevent a completely offsetting increase in out-of-state emissions when states add a state-level emissions tax to the <b>national</b> <b>emissions</b> tax. In particular, states small relative to their market {{will be unable to}} reduce <b>national</b> <b>emissions</b> with a state-level CO 2 tax or a system of tradable permits. However, under a national cap-and-trade regime that allows states to be carved out, a state of any size can reduce <b>national</b> <b>emissions</b> by setting a tighter state cap. This combination yields a lower total cost than the equivalent combination of national and state CO 2 taxes (if one exists) but increases the cost to consumers outside the market...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} of the gas bubble size to the size distribution critically influences the effectiveness of electrochemical processes. Several optical and acoustical techniques {{have been used to}} characterize the size and <b>emission</b> frequency of <b>bubbles.</b> Here, we used zero-dimensional (0 D) ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs) buried under a microbath to detect the <b>emission</b> of individual <b>bubbles</b> electrically and to generate statistics on the <b>bubble</b> <b>emission</b> time. The <b>bubble</b> size was evaluated via a simple model of the electrolytic current. We suggest that energy lost during water electrolysis could be used to generate electric pulses at an optimal efficiency with an array of 0 D ISFETs.

40|$|National {{hazardous}} {{air pollutant}} (HAP) emission inventories {{have been developed}} for the <b>National</b> <b>Emissions</b> Inventory (NEI) for 1990, 1996, and 1999. In developing aircraft, commercial marine vessels, locomotive, and other nonroad HAP emissions estimates for the 1999 NEI, all of the emission estimating methods were revised to incorporate better activity data (or fuel usage used as a surrogate for activity) and the latest emission factors or speciation profiles 1. These improvements to the 1999 nonroad emission inventory were also applied to the 1990 and 1996 HAP emission inventories, making the inventories comparable and allowing for a historical comparison of HAP emissions throughout this period. This paper discusses the changes made to the nonroad HAP inventories, and evaluates the <b>national</b> <b>emission</b> trends for each source category. The paper will also quantify the significance that State-submitted data have in NEI, highlighting the need for states and local agencies to provide complete and accurate emission estimates for these source categories using comparable emission estimating methods.
