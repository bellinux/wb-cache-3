40|$|Consumers {{are getting}} more {{demanding}} and more price-conscious nowadays and this force the retailers {{to have a more}} responsive supply chain {{at the same time as}} keeping the costs as low as possible. Therefore, the logistics performance is getting increasingly important for a retail company that wants to be successful by responding to the consumers’ demands. Measuring the logistics performance internally within the company is commonly used but it could also be beneficial to do an external comparison such as a benchmarking. By performing a benchmarking it is possible to borrow ideas from other companies and adapt them to gain competitive advantage. One retail company that works with the improvement of their logistics performance is ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food.</b> ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> has continuously improved their logistics performance during the last years and strives to increase their performance and competitiveness even further. To succeed with this, ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> is thrived to discover potential areas of improvement by increasing their understanding of how good their logistics performance is compared to other retail companies. Therefore, the aim of the study is to increase ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food’s</b> understanding of their current logistics performance and by this making them aware of potential areas of improvement. This was done in two steps. The first step was to understand how ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> currently is measuring and following up their logistics performance compared to the literature in order to investigate if the company is covering the critical and most relevant KPIs and aspects when managing their logistics performance. The other step was to perform a benchmarking involving six leading retail companies, including ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food,</b> to understand how the logistics performance currently look like at ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> compared to the other benchmarked companies. Findings indicated that ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> does all in all manage their logistics performance in a good way and as the literature recommends. However, the company has some potential areas of improvement such as increasing the employees’ involvement in their logistics performance by making the logistics KPIs more accessible for them. The most important findings from the benchmarking process was that ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food</b> is managing their inventories good since they has a competitive inventory turnover value compared to the other benchmarked companies. On the other hand, the company’s total logistics costs as a percentage of sales is higher than the majority of the benchmarked companies and this KPI is therefore not as competitive as the inventory turnover. From the findings it can be concluded that ICA <b>Non</b> <b>Food’s</b> higher value on total logistics costs as percentage of sales compared to the majority of the other benchmarked companies, is not due to their inventory management since they performed well with their KPI inventory turnover. Instead the value could be high due to other factors such as high outbound transportation costs that they should try to reduce...|$|R

This Research was conducted in Sub District Purbalingga and Padamara, Purbalingga regency with respondent SMEs food processing. Analysis of the determination of marketing mix that includes product, price, advertising and distribution using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Sampling was purposive random sampling method with a population of 64 SMEs so drawn sample of 20 respondents.

(2) Price priority for the new <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> grease products which was by determining the moderate prices to compete the competitors' prices while still maintained a high quality. (3) Product priority for new <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> grease product which was producing a qualified product which could withstand the wear of the engine, green colour of the product, a 350 g size packs with a rectangular shape packaging labels.

In Exp. 1 during the experimental period (d 0 to 14), pigs fed plasma had increased ADG and ADFI compared to pigs fed the control diet. Pigs fed the irradiated AP 920, as well as source 1 and source 2 regular (nonirradiated) <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> plasma had increased ADG compared to the control diet. Furthermore, pigs fed irradiated AP 920, regular AP 820, regular and irradiated source 1 <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> and regular source 2 <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> animal plasma had improved ADFI compared to pigs fed the control diet. No differences in F/G were observed between treatments. No differences were detected between pigs fed diets that contained irradiated plasma compared to those fed it in the regular form. For the overall experiment (d 0 to 24), pigs fed irradiated AP 920 had a tendency for improved F/G compared to pigs fed the control diet. In Exp. 2 during the experimental period (d 0 to 14), pigs fed diets containing plasma had improved ADG and F/G compared to pigs fed the control diet. Pigs fed irradiated AP 820 <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> plasma had higher ADG compared to pigs fed regular AP 820. For the overall experiment (d 0 to 24), pigs fed diets containing irradiated AP 820 had increased ADG, final body weight, and ADFI compared to pigs fed regular AP 820. Since irradiation of <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> plasma (low initial bacteria) did not improve growth performance while irradiation of feed grade plasma (initially high bacteria) improved performance, the initial bacteria level of animal plasma appears to influence growth performance of nursery pigs...|$|R
