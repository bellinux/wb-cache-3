Drosophila Numb protein regulates this process through its preferential segregation into the differentiating daughter cell. How Numb restricts the proliferation and self-renewal potentials of the recipient cell remains enigmatic. Here, we show that phosphorylation at conserved sites regulates the tumor suppressor activity of Numb. Enforced expression of a phospho-mimetic form of Numb (Numb-TS 4 D) or genetic manipulation that boosts phospho-Numb levels, attenuates endogenous Numb activity and causes ectopic neuroblast formation (ENF). This effect on neuroblast homeostasis occurs only in the type II neuroblast lineage. We identify Dronc caspase as a novel binding partner of Numb, and demonstrate that overexpression of Dronc suppresses the effects of Numb-TS 4 D in a non-apoptotic and possibly <b>non-catalytic</b> manner. <b>Reduction</b> of Dronc activity facilitates ENF induced by phospho-Numb.

Premix of petroleum gas, air and NH 3 were burned in a porous gas burner to generate the needed flue gas. Four kinds of pulverized coal were fed as reburning fuel at constant rate of 1 g/min. The coal reburning process parameters including 15 %~ 25 % reburn heat input, temperature range from 1100 °C to 1400 °C and also the carbon in fly ash, coal fineness, reburn zone stoichiometric ratio, etc. were investigated. On the condition of 25 % reburn heat input, maximum of 47 % NO reduction with Yanzhou coal was obtained by pure coal reburning. Optimal temperature for reburning is about 1300 °C and fuel-rich stoichiometric ratio is essential; coal fineness can slightly enhance the reburning ability. The temperature window for {{ammonia injection}} is about 700 °C~ 1100 °C. CO can improve the NH 3 ability at lower temperature. During advanced reburning, 72. 9 % NO reduction was measured. To achieve more than 70 % NO <b>reduction,</b> Selective <b>Non-catalytic</b> NOx <b>Reduction</b> (SNCR) should need NH 3 /NO stoichiometric ratio larger than 5, while advanced reburning only uses common dose of ammonia as in conventional SNCR technology.

This paper presents results of experimental tests concerning N 2 O formation in the selective <b>non-catalytic</b> NOx emission <b>reduction</b> process (SNCR) in a stoker boiler (WR 25 type). Obtained results lead to an unambiguous conclusion that there is a dependency between the NOx and N 2 O concentrations in the exhaust gas when SNCR process is carried out in a coal-fired stoker boiler. Fulfilling new emission standards in the analysed equipment will require 40 – 50 % reduction of NOx concentration.

The hybrid technology was expected to provide a cost-effective method of reducing NO{sub x} while balancing capital and operation costs. An existing urea based SNCR system was modified with an expanded-duct catalyst to provide increased NO{sub x} reduction efficiency from the SNCR while producing increased ammonia slip levels to the catalyst.

Early system limitations, due to gas temperature stratification, restricted the Hybrid NO{sub x} reduction capabilities to 48 % with an ammonia slip of 6. 1 mg/Nm{sup 3 } (8 ppm) at the catalyst inlet.

40|$|Direct N 2 O {{emissions}} from fossil fuel combustion have previously {{been reported to}} be equivalent to 25 - 40 % of the NO x levels. At these levels, fossil fuels have been suggested to be a major anthropogenic source of N 2 O. Recent tests have shown these measurements to be in error, most of the N 2 O having been formed by reaction between NO x, SO 2, and H 2 O in the sample containers. Time resolved measurements of gas samples stored in Tedlar bags, supported by chemical kinetic calculations, indicate that the majority of N 2 O forms over a time period of 6 hours. The conversion of NO x to N 2 O in the sample containers is shown to depend on the amount of SO 2 present. This sampling artifact raises questions about the validity of the existing data base, collected by grab sampling methods. As a result, a continuous infrared analyzer, developed primarily for characterization of N 2 O {{emissions from}} full scale combustion sources, was used to perform on line N 2 O measurements at several full scale utility combustion systems. A variety of conventional and advanced utility combustion systems (firing pulverized coal, oil, and gas) were tested. The measurements from conventional systems (natural gas, oil, and pulverized coalfired) indicate that the direct N 2 O emission levels are generally less than 5 ppm and are not related to the NO x levels in the flue gas. However circulating fluidized bed units produced elevated N 2 O emissions. At one circulating fluidized bed combustor firing a bituminous coal, N 2 O levels ranged from 84 to 126 ppm as the load was varied from 100 % to 55 %, respectively. The N 2 O emissions from the circulating fluidized bed appeared to be inversely related to the bed temperature. However, temperature is not the only parameter affecting N 2 O emissions from fluidized beds; all three of the units studied operated at similar temperatures during full load operation, but the N 2 O emissions ranged between 25 and 84 ppm.

40|$|A novel {{study on}} biomass-air {{gasification}} using a horizontal entrained-flow gasifier and catalytic processing {{of the product}} gas has been conducted. The {{study was designed to}} investigate the effect of catalyst loading on the product gas. The use of a horizontal entrained-flow gasifier reactor was used to assess the effect of the gasifier reactor orientation on the gasification process. Both experimental and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches were employed. The gasification tests were conducted at 800 oC and equivalence ratio of 0. 23 while the product gas was catalysed at 350 - 400 oC and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 8000 h- 1. Preparation and characterisation of wood powder and catalysts were performed using classical methods. Moreover, the syngas and tar composition were analysed using a gas chromatograph (GC) and GC-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) respectively. The research findings showed that maximum fuel conversion and cold gas efficiency using a horizontal entrained-flow gasifier were 99 % and 70 % respectively. The gasifier length can also be reduced from the common 1000 - 2000 mm to 500 mm. The catalysis study showed that pumice and kaolin have limited catalytic effect on the product gas. However, doping with CeO 2, ZrO 2, CuO and NiO improved the syngas heating value, coking resistance and tar conversion. A notable increase in syngas LHV was achieved using ceria doped pumice (8. 97 MJ/Nm 3) and copper doped pumice (8. 66 MJ/Nm 3) compared to 6. 67 MJ/Nm 3 of non-catalytic test. For the tested catalysts, CeO 2 doped pumice exhibited highest coking resistance. Furthermore, catalytic tar conversion was mainly through cracking and partial oxidation reactions. The lowest tar yield was found to be 3. 55 g/Nm 3 using kaolin-ceria-zirconia catalyst compared to 14. 92 g/Nm 3 of <b>non-catalytic</b> gasification. Tar <b>reduction</b> using untreated pumice was through adsorption and ranged 4 - 6 g/Nm 3. In general, {{the results of this study}} suggest that there exist a sensitivity to the gasifier orientation on the overall gasification process. It has also shown that metal oxides have both beneficial and detrimental effects of syngas composition. Although syngas heating value increased with increasing catalyst loading, H 2 showed a decreasing trend highlighting that further catalyst modification is required. Furthermore, pumice and kaolin can be utilised as catalyst support in the gasification technology.
