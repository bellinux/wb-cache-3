500|$|The troops arrayed {{to oppose}} the British were {{primarily}} from regiments of the Continental Army, although there were {{a large number of}} militia units from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania in the field as well. [...] A significant number of the Continentals had participated in the Siege of Boston, after which they had moved to join troops already in New York preparing its defenses. [...] Some troops had participated in the expeditions against Quebec begun in fall 1775. [...] That attempt ended in June 1776 after a disastrous retreat to Fort Ticonderoga prompted by the arrival of a large British force at Quebec City, and some of those troops were then rushed south to assist in New York. [...] The American defense of Long Island became complicated when Major General Nathanael Greene fell ill on August 15. [...] He had directed the defense work on Long Island, and was thus the general most familiar with the terrain. [...] Washington replaced him on August 20 with Major General John Sullivan, lately returned from Ticonderoga. [...] After sending reinforcements onto Long Island on August 25, Washington replaced Sullivan with the ranking major general, Israel Putnam.

2500|$|The {{pronunciation}} of wh {{is extremely}} variable, but its most common pronunciation (its canonical allophone) is the labiodental fricative, IPA [...] (as found in English).
