5|$|Although {{the film}} was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> success, former Research Fellow at Australia's National Film & Sound Archive Robert Cettl, in his 2009 book Terrorism in American cinema: an {{analytical}} filmography, 1960–2008 argues that the film reveals an alarmingly realist insight into US-Middle Eastern politics and terrorism since the 2000s, dealing with an al-Qaeda-esque terrorist organization and the conspiracy theories that some believe the US government is using the Middle East as a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{effective}} anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs from the first nine Vals missed Enterprise. However, at 16:44, an armor-piercing, delayed-action bomb penetrated the flight deck near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. Incoming sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list, but it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> breach of hull integrity.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes rarely kill healthy adult red foxes, {{and have}} been {{observed}} to feed or den alongside them, though they often kill foxes caught in traps. Coyotes may kill fox kits, but this is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> source of mortality. In southern California, coyotes frequently kill gray foxes, and these smaller canids tend to avoid areas with high coyote densities.|$|E

5|$|Fallout from {{atmospheric}} {{nuclear testing}} prior to 1980 contributed {{a small amount}} of californium to the environment. Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. Californium is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|Mammals {{are rarely}} {{consumed}} by river otters, and are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> dietary component. Mammals preyed upon by otters are characteristically small or are a type species found in riparian zones. The few occurrences of mammals {{found in the}} river otter's diet include: muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus); meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus); eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus); and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus).|$|E

5|$|There are no {{personal}} taxes in Nauru. The {{unemployment rate is}} estimated to be 90%, and of those who have jobs, the government employs 95%. The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, {{in the absence of an}} alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance. Tourism is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> contributor to the economy.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> characteristic, Mahone is {{depicted}} as remarkably good at unarmed combat (probably due to his military background). It is surprising when Lincoln attempts to kill him, he rapidly masters him and tries to choke him; Lincoln only manages to master him by squeezing his previous gunshot wound, only to be overcome again and have Mahone's gun on him. When one of Lechero's men attempts to stab Michael {{at the beginning of}} season three, Mahone stops him and breaks his neck in seconds. He is also the only one T-Bag believed could kill Sammy, but when the tunnel crumbles on top of Sammy Mahone rapidly masters his men. In season four when Christina Rose orders her bodyguard to kill Mahone, he beats both of them down within seconds.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> chemical environmental pollutant. The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which {{is comparable to the}} LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen is {{the final}} game in the series, {{released}} on May 30, 2001 for the Game Boy Color. Developed by David A. Palmer Productions and published by Activision, it was created as both a sequel and homage to the series as a whole, and {{does not have an}} episode number. Id was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> partner in development, though it retained editorial control over the game, and Adrian Carmack contributed some artwork. The idea for a Game Boy Color Keen game came from John Carmack and id, who approached Activision, which in turn proposed Palmer as the developer.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the seaside}} location, few {{residents}} {{make their living}} on the sea, and fishing is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> industry. In the early 1970s, when fish stocks ran low, a system of rotating access was developed to preserve this sector. This innovative system was part of Elinor Ostrom's research on economic governance which led to her 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics. In 2007, locals protested the establishment of some larger chain supermarkets and clothing stores, which have opened branches in Alanya.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood next {{turned his}} {{attention}} towards Breezy (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films {{over the next ten}} years and would become an important figure in his life. Kay Lenz got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley, came in $1million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. Breezy was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Halfbeaks are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, {{for example in}} South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E

5|$|Independence, however, did {{initiate}} {{the abolition of}} slavery in Spanish America, as it was seen as part of the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies. In areas where slavery was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for compensated emancipation. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.|$|E
5|$|The International Crisis Group {{writes that}} the AFL was reduced {{practically}} {{to the point of}} non-existence by Fall 2001, by which time a total of 4,000 personnel had been retired. The Second Liberian Civil War, originated in clashes in April 1999 but was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> threat to Taylor until 2000–01. However, on the government side the AFL played only a minor role; irregular ex National Patriotic Front of Liberia militias backed by more privileged Taylor partisans such as the Anti-Terrorist Unit saw most of the fighting.|$|E
5|$|The general {{election}} {{resulted in a}} victory for Tony Blair's Labour Party, which adopted a pro-EU stance. Their victory was considered a landslide, thus making the Referendum Party's role in the election fairly irrelevant. The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a drop from the 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British party politics in 1832. Their representation in the House of Commons fell by over half, from 343 to 165; their lowest representation in the House since 1906. The reasons for their electoral decline were many {{and the impact of}} the Referendum Party was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> factor.|$|E
