25|$|R v Pearson; Ex parte Sipka was an {{important}} Australian court case decided in the High Court of Australia on 24 February 1983. It concerned section 41 of the Australian Constitution, {{and the question of}} whether four people eligible to vote in New South Wales could be prevented from voting at the federal level by a federal law which closed registration to vote on the day that the writs of election were issued. The court decided that they could, adopting a <b>narrow</b> <b>interpretation</b> of section 41, and therefore finding that there is no express constitutional right to vote in Australia.|$|E
500|$|During {{his early}} years on the Supreme Court, Black helped reverse several earlier court {{decisions}} taking a <b>narrow</b> <b>interpretation</b> of federal power. Many New Deal laws {{that would have been}} struck down under earlier precedents were thus upheld. In 1939 Black was joined on the Supreme Court by Felix Frankfurter and William O. Douglas. Douglas voted alongside Black in several cases, especially those involving the First Amendment, while Frankfurter soon became one of Black's ideological foes. [...] From 1946 until 1971, Black was the Senior Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.|$|E

Fellow academics Jennifer Clarke, Patrick Keyzer and James Stellios argue that the court's <b>narrow</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the provision is consistent with the intention of the Constitution's drafters, who never intended for it to be a protection of individual rights, while Kevin Booker and Arthur Glass say the provision has [...] "symbolic value".

The <b>narrower</b> <b>interpretations</b> thus held that non-digital forms of CMI were already covered under the Copyright Act, and therefore were not within {{the scope of}} the DMCA. Broader interpretations, upheld by the Third Circuit in this decision, held that §1202 applied to all CMI enumerated in §1202(c), including those unrelated to technology or digitization.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyze method of legal interpretation which is conducted by judge in handling corruption cases. Data were collected by interviewing judge and analysing judge verdict on corruption cases. Research result showed that common methods of legal interpretation are wide and <b>narrow</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Wide legal interpretation is intepretation which considers norms and moral turpidute based on unwitten legal sources. <b>Narrow</b> legal <b>interpretation</b> views corruption merely based on written legal sources. The application of both legal interpretations brings implication. If judge employs <b>narrow</b> legal <b>interpretation,</b> judge tends to pass non guilty verdict. Meanwhile, if judge applies wide legal interpretation, judge is likely to pass guilty verdict. This research recomends the importance of progressive interpretation for corruption case.

2500|$|Fourth, Marshall {{supported}} the Court's opinion textually by invoking the Necessary and Proper Clause, which permits Congress {{to seek an}} objective that is within its enumerated powers {{so long as it}} is rationally related to the objective and not forbidden by the Constitution. In liberally interpreting the Necessary and Proper clause, the Court rejected Maryland's <b>narrow</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the clause, which purported that the word [...] "necessary" [...] in the Necessary and Proper Clause meant that Congress could only pass those laws that were absolutely essential in the execution of its enumerated powers. The Court rejected this argument, on the grounds that many of the enumerated powers of Congress under the Constitution would be useless if only those laws deemed essential to a power's execution could be passed. Marshall also noted that the Necessary and Proper Clause is listed within the powers of Congress, not the limitations.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court's {{due process}} {{jurisprudence}} {{over the next}} three decades was inconsistent, but it took a narrow view of states' police powers in several major labor cases after Lochner.

Children's Hospital (1923), the Supreme Court held that minimum wage laws violated the due process clause, but Chief Justice William Howard Taft strongly dissented, suggesting that the Court instead should have overruled Lochner. The doctrine of substantive due process was coupled with a <b>narrow</b> <b>interpretation</b> of congressional power under the commerce clause. Justices James McReynolds, George Sutherland, Willis Van Devanter, and Pierce Butler emerged during the 1920s and 1930s as the foremost defenders of traditional limitations on government power on the Supreme Court, so were collectively dubbed by partisans of the New Deal the [...] "Four Horsemen of Reaction".

2500|$|Although {{the text}} of the Act gives Parliament residuary powers to enact laws in any area that has not been {{allocated}} to the provincial governments, subsequent jurisprudence has limited the scope of the [...] "peace, order, and good government" [...] power. The limitation on the scope of this clause stems from the <b>narrow</b> <b>interpretation</b> of its branches and the expansive interpretation of provincial powers under section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Particularly limiting is the breadth of provincial power over property and civil rights under s. 92(13). Although the Emergency Branch and the National Concern Branch may be viewed as delimited federal competencies like the enumerated clauses under section 91 (see e.g. AG Canada v AG Ontario (Labour Conventions), [...] AC 326 (PC)), the clause remains residuary. The powers under POGG must be interpreted in light of the subsequent jurisprudence on the limitations of the clause and the expansive powers of the provinces under their enumerated heads of power. If a matter does not fall within one of the enumerated classes in section 92, section 91, or the emergency or national concern branches, then it falls within the narrowly defined residual branch of POGG. The POGG power is best understood as a narrowly defined residual power limited to the following three branches.|$|E
