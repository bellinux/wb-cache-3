5|$|On 30 January 1963, a B-52E of the 6th Bomb Wing from Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico, {{crashed in}} snow-covered {{mountains}} in <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> after turbulence tore off the vertical fin. The ECM operator and tail gunner were killed {{but at least}} three crew (pilot, radio operator and one other crew member) survived. Three Lockheed T-33 Shooting Stars and, later, three Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports, circled the area trying to locate survivors; the pilots reported that they saw two other survivors after the first man walked to safety.|$|E
5|$|These {{efforts were}} {{transferred}} {{to the authority of}} the U.S. Army in June 1942, and became the Manhattan Project. Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., was appointed its director in September 1942. The weapons development portion of this project was located at the Los Alamos Laboratory in <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico,</b> under the directorship of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. The University of Chicago, Columbia University and the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley conducted other development work.|$|E
5|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{was viewed as}} radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay {{was found to be}} full of minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact. Shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the K–Pg boundary. Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts. The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact, and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby—as did the discovery that the K–Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E

5|$|A long-distance {{communication}} system that used {{smoke and mirrors}} existed in the region, and direct lines of sight have been established between Pueblo Alto, Huérfano Mountain in <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico,</b> and Chimney Rock Pueblo in southern Colorado. Messages could have been relayed between these three points within minutes. On the mesa behind Chaco Canyon is an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl, then northward along {{the east side of}} Pueblo Alto before joining with the Great North Road. The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along Escavada Wash. It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods, construction timber, and people throughout the San Juan Basin. Several road segments appear to be related to a row of Chetro Ketl's exterior rooms, which are thought to have been community storage space.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the {{political}} landscape that had prevented {{the creation of the}} Pajarito National Park was starting to change. John F.

25|$|A small Hispano {{group of}} Sephardic Jews in <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> {{may be one}} of the oldest groups of {{practicing}} Jews in North America, dating back to the early Spanish settlers of Jewish descent who had been forcibly converted to Catholicism as Conversos or New Christians, or both after 1492. Some families of Conversos began to settle in Mexico City in the 1530s and 1540s. Some converted back to Judaism; others maintained some Jewish beliefs and practices in secret. After the Spanish Inquisition came to the New World in 1571, the conversos were threatened with death if it was found they were practicing Judaism.|$|E
25|$|The New Mexico Campaign was a {{military}} operation of the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War from February to April 1862 in which Confederate Brigadier General Henry Hopkins Sibley invaded the <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> Territory {{in an attempt to}} gain control of the Southwest, including the gold fields of Colorado and the ports of California. Historians regard this campaign as the most ambitious Confederate attempt to establish control of the American West and to open an additional theater in the war.

25|$|In 2008, a gene {{mutation}} that is typically {{found only in}} Ashkenazi Jews, and is linked to a virulent form of breast cancer in women, was discovered in a cluster of Hispanic Catholic women in southern Colorado, many of whom trace their family's roots to <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b> It was conclusively shown {{to be related to}} Jewish ancestry, given the history {{of the people in the}} area, and many families reported knowledge of a high incidence of cancer. After testing and notification of families, researchers worked with the extended families on genetic counseling and to develop health strategies for monitoring, early detection and treatment, as they were faced with the higher risk associated with the gene.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The 1890 s in <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> were {{a time of}} {{considerable}} political, cultural, and social upheaval as the question of statehood – which would remain unresolved until 1912 – roiled the population. In 1892 Eusebio Chacón’s two novellas, El Hijo de la Tempestad and Tras la Tormenta la Calma, appeared in “El Boletín Popular,” one of <b>Northern</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico’s</b> largest Spanish-language newspapers. “El Boletín Popular’s” positive stance towards statehood offers a political lens through which we might read Chacón’s fiction as a proactive instantiation of nuevomexicano cultural tradition. In his introductions to the novellas Chacón denies any Anglo literary influence, suggesting not only the presence of external social and political forces pressing upon the creation of his literature, but, most importantly, highlighting his desire to transcend literatura recreativa (literature as entertainment). His two novellas manifest a cultural politics from which the issue of New Mexican statehood becomes challenged and contested...|$|R
