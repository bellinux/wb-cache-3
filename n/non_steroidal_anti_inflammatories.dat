40|$|BackgroundCardiac tamponade (CT) {{occurs in}} about 1 % to 2 % of {{patients}} after cardiac surgery. In order {{to know which}} patients should be closely followed up, {{it is important to}} determine predictive factors for late CT. Methodsin the POPE study, 196 patients with a moderate to large persistent pericardial effusion persisting more than 7 days after cardiac surgery (grades 2, 3, or 4 on a scale of 0 to 4, as measured by echocardiography) were consecutively included. The main result showed the absence of effectiveness of a <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drug {{to reduce the size of}} the effusions. As Twenty patients (10. 2 %) required pericardial drainage 22. 5 ± 8. 7 days after surgery, we looked for predictive factors for late CTs by comparing baseline characteristics of the CT (n= 20) and non CT groups (n= 176). ResultsThe incidence of late CTs was higher with higher grades of pericardial effusion at baseline: 2. 9 % for grade 2, 14 % for grade 3, and 24. 3 % for grade 4 (P 2. 5 were of 2. 56 ± 1. 0 and 47. 8 %in the non CT group versus 3. 25 ± 1. 03 and 88. 9 % in the late CT group (p= 0. 05 and 0. 02 respectively).

40|$|Abstract: Background: Osteitis pubis {{represents}} a non-infectious {{inflammation of the}} pubic symphysis causing varying degrees of lower abdominal and pelvic pain. Although, the disease is believed to affect mainly young athletic patients, it is also encountered in other specific patient groups. Both conservative and surgical treatment options are available. While for elite athletes surgical treatment is indicated, leading to fast pain relief and mobilization, for non-athletic patients no clear indication can be established. Methods: Eight non-athletic women with osteitis pubis, referred to our Department for treatment, were evaluated. All were initially treated conservatively with bed rest, per os <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy. Results: Seven patients improved significantly with conservative treatment while one displayed no improvement and was treated surgically with arthrodesis. Conclusion: We conclude that, for non-athletic female patients suffering from osteitis pubis, surgery is rarely required and that conservative treatment by means of <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drugs and physical modalities {{represents a}} fair option regarding pain and limitation of everyday activity...|$|R

40|$|Summary Cats {{are popular}} pets but until {{recently}} their perioperative and trau-matic pain was seriously underestimated and under treated. There are several causes of this under treatment. First, {{it may be}} difficult to detect pain in cats, be-cause they do not demonstrate overt pain-associated behaviour. Secondly, there are relatively few analgesic drugs with market authorisation for cats. Thirdly, cats have an unfortunate reputation for toxicity from analgesic drugs, particularly opioid-induced mania and classical <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drug toxicity. Fourthly, cats are deficient in some metabolic pathways used to metabolise analgesic drugs in other species; this may lead to genuine toxicity or to lack of effect. Recently, understanding of feline behaviour and physiology has improved, leading to better clinical management of this enigmatic species. Behavioural methods are proving to be the best means of assessing pain, and knowledge of unique feline physiology has enabled rational treatment protocols to be developed specifically for cats. 2004 ESFM and AAFP.

40|$|Introduction: Prostaglandins are {{important}} inflammatory mediators that their synthesis is mediated by cyclooxygenase enzyme. Therefore, <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drugs (NSAIDs) that can prohibit this enzyme, {{are widely used}} for pain control after root canal treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of Celecoxib in control of acute apical inflammation following root canal treatment in cats. Methods and Materials: In this experimental animal study, 24 canines and 4 premolar (as negative control) teeth of 6 cats were studied. The cats were divided into two experimental groups: the first group received 2. 5 mg/kg Celecoxib orally one hour before treatment and the second group did not receive any drug. After root canal treatment, animals were sacrificed by vital perfusion technique at different intervals (8, 12 or 24 hours). The samples then evaluated histologically according to three inflammatory factors: intensity of inflammatory cells, edema and vasodilatation. The results were analyzed statistically using the Kruskal-wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Results: There were significant differences between two groups in the three inflammatory criteria at 8 hours after the treatment (p valu...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{low back}} pain: A randomised, controlled, {{prospective}} trial of ketoprofen and McKenzie physiotherapy within {{three weeks of}} onset. Aims: (1) To establish whether McKenzie physiotherapy is beneficial compared with a <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drug {{in the treatment of}} acute low back pain. (2) To investigate the mode of action of McKenzie lumbar spine treatment. Method: Patients with acute back pain of less than three weeks standing aged between 18 and 55 years were admitted to the trial. On attending clinic the patient underwent interview and examination by a doctor. Those patients without evidence of nerve root entrapment; underlying pathological lesion or psychological abnormality (illness behaviour) completed formal psychometric testing and social enquiry. The St Thomas back disability questionnaire was used throughout the study and was the principle outcome measure. Patients underwent randomisation into study and control groups. They both had information leaflets; and a supply of back disability questionnaires with stamped addressed envelopes to return to the study office at weekly intervals. Both groups were seen again on the seventh week after the onset of the back pain. Study Group Patients were assessed by one of two research physiotherapists and underwent a treatment regimen according to the McKenzie principles. Control Group Patients were given a 28 day course of <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drug. At follow up clinic repeated clinical examination and questioning recorded the following outcomes: disability; analog pain score; return to work; patient's appraisal of change in condition and personal responsibility for pain control. Further postal follow up occurred at six months and one year. Initial psychological factors explained much of the disability seen seven weeks after the onset of back pain. An analysis of covariance employing psychological information showed that physiotherapy was significantly more effective in reducing disability at the seventh week only when the 8. 5 % of patients who the physiotherapists were unable to diagnose on their first assessment were excluded from analysis. The physiotherapy patients were away from work significantly longer than the patients who had drug treatment. At six months and one year a tendency to less frequent attacks in the physiotherapy group was not significant owing {{to the power of the}} study. Physiotherapy patients became significantly more responsible for their pain than the drug patients when assessed by means of a pain locus of control questionnaire.

40|$|Background. Hyperleukocytosis {{is defined}} as a white blood cell (WBC) count in excess of 100, 000 per mm 3. Hyperleukocytosis can cause leukostasis syndrome, the {{accumulation}} of leukemic blast cells within the capillary lumen, resulting in neurologic and pulmonary manifestations that can lead to intracranial haemorrhage and respiratory failure. Objective. Identify a correct diagnostic approach, as the diagnosis of leukostasis in a patient suffering from acute leukemia with hyperleukocytosis is made only clinically. A full blood cell count and a peripheral blood smear are essential for diagnosing leukostasis. Case report.

Therefore, a complete, comprehensive and holistic approach toward its understanding and treatment is the need of the age. In this series, Uttar Vasti, a unique panchakarma procedure, is studied for its role in yonivyapads. A research study was conductedto evaluate the efficacy of Uttar Vasti with Trivrit and Lasuna oil in Primary dysmenorrhea. Thirty-six diagnosed cases of Udavartini Yonivyapad, viz., primary (spasmodic) dysmenorrhea, were selected and randomly allocated into two groups. The effect of Uttar Vasti was compared with the commonly used <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drug (control group).

Gene expression signatures were derived for disease from both blood (n= 344) and post-mortem brain (n= 690), and for drugs from immortalised human cell lines exposed to drugs of interest as part of the Connectivity Map platform. Using this novel approach to combine datasets we find striking overlap between AD gene expression in blood and NSAID induced changes in KEGG pathways of Ribosome and Oxidative Phosphorylation.

Capsule endoscopy has been compared to traditional small bowel series, computerized tomography studies and push enteroscopy. The diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy has consistently been superior in the diagnosis of small bowel disease compared to the competing methods (small bowel series, computerized tomography, push enteroscopy) of diagnosis. For this reason capsule endoscopy has enjoyed a meteoric success. Image quality has been improved with increased number of pixels, automatic light exposure adaptation and wider angle of view. Further applications of capsule endoscopy of other areas of the digestive tract are being explored. The increased transmission rate of images per second has made capsule endoscopy of the esophagus a realistic possibility. Technological advances that include a double imager capsule with a nearly panoramic view of the colon and a variable frame rate adjusted to the movement of the capsule in the colon have made capsule endoscopy of the colon feasible. The diagnostic rate for the identification of patients with polyps equal to or larger than 6 mm is high. Future advances in technology and biotechnology will lead to further progress.

The gastroprotective effects of AG involved the participation of nitric oxide and increased levels of endogenous sulfhydryl compounds, which are defensive mechanisms of the gastrointestinal mucosa against aggressive factors. The ability of AG to heal gastric ulcers was evaluated after 14 consecutive days of treatment. The results showed that single oral administrations of AG (250 mg/kg/once daily) potently stimulates gastric epithelial cell proliferation that contributes to the accelerated healing of gastric ulcers induced by acetic acid. In addition, no subacute toxicity (body weight gain, vital organs, and serum biochemical parameters) was observed during treatment with AG. Phytochemical investigation of AG led to the isolation of myricetin- 3 -O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside, quercetin- 3 -O-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, quercetin- 3 -O-beta-D-galactopyranoside, quercetin, amentoflavone, methyl gallate, gallic acid, and pterogynidine. We also established the phytochemical profile of AG with the quantification of total phenolic compounds. These compounds may contribute to the observed antiulcerogenic effects of AG...|$|R
40|$|The {{action of}} various <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drugs (NSAID) {{that are also}} potent {{uncoupling}} agents for oxidative phosphorylation has been studied by measuring light scattering by rat liver mitochondria in different media. These drugs all induce a pseudo energized high amplitude swelling, except gold salts and salicylates. The amplitude of this swelling is not very dependent on the concentration of the drugs, but the rapidity of the swelling is closely concentration dependent. Swelling can be induced even with gold salts if p chloromercuribenzoate (p CMB) or Mersalyl {{is present in the}} medium, and the rate of swelling initiated by the other NSAID is considerably enhanced. Iodoacetamide and N ethylmaleimide could not replace p CMB or Mersalyl in this respect. This difference is probably related to the fact that when the first two thiol inhibitors bind to the mitochondrial membrane, they increase the anionic charges and mental age this membrane. These data also show the importance of thiol groups for the NSAID induced swelling. This swelling is pseudo energized (i. e. appears without any substrate), which suggests that the phenomenon is related only to the physicochemical changes induced in the membrane by the drugs. This phenomenon is critically affected by the ionic composition of the medium, and in the monovalent cationic as well as an anionic selectivity has been found for it. This selectivity can be explained by way of electrostatic forces and gives information on the structure of the membrane, mainly the possible presence of highly polarizable groups. These results suggest that the overall effect of NSAID on mitochondrial metabolism might be related to their activities on ion transport across the mitochondrial membrane.

40|$|Abstract Background Total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) {{is often}} associated with a severe local inflammatory reaction which, unless controlled, leads to persistent pain up to one year after surgery. Standard and accelerated rehabilitation protocols are currently being implemented after TKA, but no consensus exists regarding the long-term effects. Biophysical stimulation with pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) has been demonstrated to exert an anti-inflammatory effect, to promote early functional recovery and to maintain a positive long-term effect in patients undergoing joint arthroscopy. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether PEMFs can be used to limit the pain and enhance patient recovery after TKA. Methods A prospective, randomized, controlled study in 30 patients undergoing TKA was conducted. Patients were randomized into experimental PEMFs or a control group. Patients in the experimental group were instructed to use I-ONE stimulator 4 hours/day for 60 days. Postoperatively, all patients received the same rehabilitation program. Treatment outcome was assessed using the Knee Society Score, SF- 36 Health-Survey and VAS. Patients were evaluated pre-operatively and one, two, six and 12 months after TKA. Joint swelling and <b>Non</b> <b>Steroidal</b> <b>Anti</b> <b>Inflammatory</b> Drug (NSAID) consumption were recorded. Comparisons between the two groups were carried out using a two-tail heteroschedastic Student’s t-test. Analysis of variance for each individual subject during the study was performed using ANOVA for multiple comparisons, applied on each group, and a Dunnet post hoc test. A p value[*] Results Pre-operatively, no differences were observed between groups in terms of age, sex, weight, height, Knee-Score, VAS, SF- 36 and joint swelling, with the exception of the Functional Score. The Knee-Score, SF- 36 and VAS demonstrated significantly positive outcomes in the I-ONE stimulated group compared with the controls at follow-ups. In the I-ONE group, NSAID use was reduced and joint swelling resolution was more rapid than in controls. The effect of I-ONE therapy was maintained after use of the device was discontinued. Conclusions The results of the study show early functional recovery in the I-ONE group. I-ONE therapy should be considered after TKA to prevent the inflammatory reaction elicited by surgery, for pain relief and to speed functional recovery.

40|$|<b>Non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drugs (NSAIDs) {{are known}} to cause ulcers of the stomach {{and to a lesser}} degree, the duodenum. Consumption of NSAIDs has been {{associated}} with the infrequent occurrence of ulcers at other locations, such as the jejunum, ileum and colon. Several studies have suggested that consumption of NSAIDS also constitutes a risk factor for the development of erosive oesophagitis, including oesophageal strictures. It is now documented that NSAIDS are associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It was found recently that GERD is associated with a variety of laryngeal conditions and symptoms, of which "reflux laryngitis" is the most common. AIM OF THE WORK: is to study the effect of NSAIDs on the development of laryngitis in patients with GERD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: study included 60 patients, 42 males and 18 females aged between 26 ­ 52 years old (mean 37. 9), a detailed history was taken from all patients. All the sixty patients were suspected to have GERD based on symptoms including acid reflux, Group I: - 40 patients were receiving daily-recommended doses of NSAIDs for at least one month for a diagnosed rheumatological disease, Group II: - 20 patients who were diagnosed as GERD, and were not receiving any NSAIDs for at least one month prior to the present study. The sixty patients were subjected to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Patients who were diagnosed as GERD with or without oesophagitis were subjected to ENT fibro-optic laryngoscopy. RESULTS: 42 % of all patients with GERD have hoarseness of voice, 30 % have recurrent chocking, 53 % have excessive throat cleaning. Postglottic oedema, arytenoid oedema, vocal fold oedema, were all significantly higher in group I than in group II. CONCLUSION: The chronic use of NSAIDs can be considered as a risk factor for developing GERD, erosive oesophagitis with or without subsequent posterior laryngitis. Laryngoscopy may have a predictive value for the occurrence of GERD in those patients. Patients who were on regular use of NSAIDS, and are symptomatic for GERD are recommended to start medical treatment for GERD to guard against erosive oesophagitis and/or posterior laryngitis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere is {{a paucity}} of {{research}} in the peri-operative care of the scoliosis patient. We therefore postulated that there would be large differences in hospital care. We assessed this diversity using an online survey, with particular reference to pain control, thromboprophylaxis and blood conservation strategies. Anaesthetists specialising in scoliosis surgery in the U. K. were contacted via email, asking them if they would fill in a short email survey. Non responders were contacted a total of three times over a 6 month period. Of the 24 centres practicing paediatric and adolescent scoliosis surgery we received completed questionnaires from anaesthetists working in 21, a response rate of 88 %. Blood Conservation 20 centres (95 %) routinely cross-match blood. 17 centres (81 %) routinely use cell salvage with a further 3 (14 %) using it for specific cases only. Only 4 centres (19 %) advocated normovolaemic heamodilution, with no centres surveyed using pre donated blood. Peri-operatively, 17 centres (81 %) routinely used anti-fibrinolytics, all of whom use Tranexamic acid. Reported dosing regimes showed an even wider variation than previously reported (1) with loading doses varying between 2 - 100 mg/kg and infusions varying from 3 - 10 mg/kg/hr. Thromboprophylaxis 3 centres (14 %) used TEDS only, 3 centres (14 %) TEDS and foot pumps, 6 centres (29 %) Foot pumps alone and 8 centres (38 %) used no mechanical devices. Low molecular weight heparin was only used as part of a thromboprophylaxis regime in 6 centres (29 %) with some centres prescribing it the night before, others post operatively on the day of surgery, some 24 hours post surgery and one centre on day 2. Pain Control Epidural analgesia is routinely used in 8 centres (38 %), of which 3 centres (14 %) place 2 catheters and 2 centres (10 %) use patient controlled epidural analgesia, all continuing use into the post operative period. 4 centres (19 %) use clonidine as an adjunct. Paravertebral blocks are used in 9 centres (43 %), some with postoperative infusions. Three centres each (14 %) use intercostal nerve blockade or spinal opiods. All respondents use patient controlled analgesia (PCA), most commonly morphine but also fentanyl and oxycodone. Ketamine infusions are used in three centres (14 %). <b>Non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drugs were avoided by three centres (86 %). Regular paracetamol was prescribed routinely in 12 centres (57 %) and all but 2 (90 %) centres use remifentanyl peri-operatively.

INTRODUCTION: Postmenopausal {{osteoporosis}} {{is associated}} with significant morbidity, mortality, reduction in quality of life, and increasing health care costs OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to identify the risk factors associated with the occurrence of osteoporosis, in Kenyan Asian women seen at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya {{since there is no}} literature on the prevalence of all these risk factors for osteoporosis in a similar middle aged population sample of Kenyan Asian women. METHOD: The study was of a retrospective design and used recall as a basis of data collection. A socio-demographic questionnaire was completed and anthropometric measurements, of height, weight, waist and hip circumference taken. Bone mineral density (BMD) had been measured previously using Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) at the lumbar spine, T 11 to L 4. Nutrient intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and physical activity was determined using the Epic Physical Activity Questionnaire 2 (EPAQ 2). BMD scans had been done on all study participants from January 2004 to December 2004 and the subjects were aware of their bone status. RESULTS: Risk factors that were identified by being associated with the development of osteoporosis in Asian women were age (p< 0. 001), waist size (p< 0. 001), hip size (p< 0. 001) and BMI (p< 0. 001), low physical activity (p= 0. 001) and use of prescription drugs. Seventy two percent of the study sample was using prescription drugs and the effect on bone mass was most likely detrimental. Anti-hypertensive (p= 0. 002), <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drugs (p= 0. 003) and anti-diabetic drugs (p= 0. 033) had a significant negative association with bone health. Energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate intake in all the groups was above the EAR and comparatively similar. The intake of all the micronutrients in the study group was above the DRI. There were no statistical significant differences in most of the trace element intake between the two groups, apart from iodine, biotin and manganese. No dietary risk factors were identified which impacted adversely on bone health in this group. The impact of gynaecologic history (parity, oral contraceptive use, age of menarche) on BMD was uncertain. The educational level of the study sample was high as 50 % of the subjects were graduates and had a relatively better diet. CONCLUSION: As Kenyan Asian women age they experience the menopausal transition and the risk of developing osteoporosis increases. No nutritional factors were identified that were adversely associated with BMD. Low level of physical activity, prescription drugs for chronic diseases like hypertension, asthma, diabetes and arthritis, age, weight and body mass index were identified and found to be adversely associated with bone mineral density. Early detection, and implementation of patient education, physical activity, and a diet rich in all nutrients, will help to slow down the progression of osteoporosis...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} dissertation, efforts {{were applied to}} {{determine}} <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drugs in binary combinations using simple, sensitive and economic isocratic stability indicating HPLC methods. Eight stability indicating HPLC methods {{have been developed for}} the following binary combinations of the <b>non</b> <b>steroidal</b> <b>anti</b> <b>inflammatory</b> drugs i. e., i) Ketorolac Tromethamine- Gatifloxacin, ii) Ketorolac Tromethamine- Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride, iii) Ketorolac Tromethamine- Ofloxacin, iv) Ketorolac Tromethamine- Dexamethasone, v) Piroxicam- Paracetamol, vi) Naproxen Sodium- Esomeprazole, vii) Naproxen Sodium- Sumatriptan Succinate, and viii) Gatifloxacin- Flurbiprofen Sodium etc. For combination of ketorolac and gatifloxacin a fast, sensitive and accurate stability indicating reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of gatifloxacin and ketorolac tromethamine in combined dosage form. Chromatographic separations were achieved on BDS Hypersil C 8 column (250 X 4. 6 mm, 5 Æ’ÃŠm) with mobile phase consisted of methanol and phosphate buffer (pH 3. 0) in the ratio of (55 : 45 v/v) at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL min- 1. The analytes were detected at 270 nm using ultraviolet detection. The retention times of gatifloxacin and ketorolac tromethamine were found to be 2. 460, 6. 366 mins respectively. The method was linear in the concentration ranges of 30 - 90 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for gatifloxacin and 50 - 110 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for ketorolac tromethamine. The correlation coefficients were found to be. 0. 9998 and. 0. 9999 for gatifloxacin and ketorolac tromethamine respectively. The method resulted in good separation of both the analytes with acceptable tailing and resolution.

Detection was performed at 243 nm using diode array detector. The method was validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Response was a linear function of concentration over the range of 20 - 140 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for both analytes (correlation coefficients. 0. 999). The method was resulted in good separation of both the analytes and their stress induced degradation products with acceptable tailing and resolution. The peak purity index for both the analytes after all types of stress was. 0. 9999 indicating complete separation of both analytes peaks from the stress induced degradation products. The method can therefore be regarded as stability-indicating. The developed method can be applied successfully for simultaneous determination of moxifloxacin and ketorolac in pharmaceutical formulations and their stability studies. For combination of ketorolac and ofloxacin a simple, specific and accurate stability Indicating liquid chromatographic method was established for simultaneous determination of ofloxacin and ketorolac tromethamine in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations. Optimum chromatographic separations among ofloxacin, ketorolac and stress-induced degradation products have been achieved within 15 min by using a BDS Hypersil C 8 column (250 X 4. 6 mm, 5 Æ’ÃŠm) as the stationary phase with methanol and phosphate buffer pH 3. 0 (55 : 45 v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0. 8 mL min- 1. Detection was performed at 270 nm using a diode array detector. The method was validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The response was a linear function of concentration over the range of 12. 84 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for ofloxacin and 20. 140 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for ketorolac tromethamine. The method resulted in excellent separation of analytes and their stress induced degradation products with acceptable tailing and resolution. The peak purity index for both the analytes after all types of stress was. 0. 999 indicating complete separation of both analyte peaks from the stress induced degradation products. The method can therefore be regarded as stability-indicating. The developed method can be applied successfully for simultaneous determination of ofloxacin and ketorolac in pharmaceutical formulations and their stability studies. For combination of ketorolac and dexamethasone a simple, sensitive, specific, precise and accurate stability indicating reverse phase liquid chromatographic method was established for simultaneous determination of ketorolac tromethamine and dexamethasone in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations. Optimum chromatographic separations among the ketorolac tromethamine, dexamethasone and stress-induced degradation products were achieved within 17 minutes by use of BDS Hypersil C 8 column (250 X 4. 6 mm, 5 Æ’ÃŠm) as stationary phase with methanol and 18 mM phosphate buffer pH 2. 8 (62 : 38 v/v, respectively) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL min- 1. Detection was performed at 254 nm using diode array detector. The method was validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Response was a linear function of concentration over the range of 100 - 700 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for ketorolac tromethamine and 10 - 70 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for dexamethasone (correlation coefficients. 0. 998). The method was resulted in good separation of both the analytes and their stress induced degradation products with acceptable tailing and resolution. The peak purity index for both the analytes after all types of stress was. 0. 9999 indicating complete separation of both analytes peaks from the stress induced degradation products. The method can therefore be regarded as stability-indicating. The developed method can be applied successfully for simultaneous determination of ketorolac tromethamine and dexamethasone in pharmaceutical formulations and their stability studies. For combination of piroxicam and paracetamol a fast, simple, specific and accurate stability indicating liquid chromatographic method was described for simultaneous determination of piroxicam and paracetamol in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations. Optimum chromatographic separations among the piroxicam, paracetamol and stress-induced degradation products were achieved within 6 min by using Hypersil BDS C 8 column as stationary phase with acetonitrile and 0. 02 M phosphate buffer pH 3. 0 (60 : 40, v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL min- 1 with detection using diode array detector at 254 nm. ICH guidelines were used to validate the developed method. Linearity was from 1. 6 - 6. 4 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for piroxicam and 26 - 104 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for paracetamol. All the analytes including the degradation products were separated with acceptable peak tailing and resolution. The peak purity index for both the analytes after all types of stress was. 0. 999 indicating complete separation of both analytes peaks from the stress induced degradation products. The developed method can be successfully used for simultaneous determination of piroxicam and paracetamol in pharmaceutical formulations and stability studies. For combination of naproxen and esomeprazole a simple, economic and sensitive HPLC method was described for the concurrent determination of naproxen and esomeprazole in pharmaceutical formulations. Isocratic chromatography was performed with C- 18 column and mixture of phosphate buffer (pH 6. 1) and acetonitrile in ratio of (40 : 60, v/v) at 1. 5 mL min- 1. The eluents were monitored at 302 nm using UV detector. The method was isocratic in the range of 9. 38 to 300 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for naproxen and 0. 5 to 16 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for esomeprazole. Validation of the method was performed by testing parameters like linearity, accuracy, precision, robustness, specificity, LOD and LOQ values. In the specificity the drugs were subjected to forced degradation studies like acidic, basic, oxidative and thermal stresses. Both the analytes were separated within three minutes. As the method separated the degradation products produced during forced degradation studies from the active analytes so it can be used not only for regular determination of naproxen and esomeprazole but also for their stability studies. For combination of naproxen and sumatriptan a simple, sensitive and cheap high performance liquid chromatographic method was described for the simultaneous determination of naproxen sodium and sumatriptan succinate in pharmaceutical formulations. Isocratic chromatography was performed on C- 18 column using a mixture of phosphate buffer (pH 6. 1) and acetonitrile in the ratio of (40 : 60, v/v) at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL min- 1. The detection was carried out at a wavelength of 302 nm using UV detector. The method was linear in the concentration range of 9. 38 to 300 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for naproxen sodium and 1. 7 to 54. 5 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for sumatriptan. The method was validated by performing its linearity, accuracy, precision, robustness, specificity and LOD/LOQ values. In the specificity the drugs were subjected to forced degradation studies like acidic, basic, oxidative and thermal stresses. The total eluting time for the two components was less than three minutes. As the method separated the degradation products produced during forced degradation studies from the active analytes so it can be used not only for routine determination of naproxen sodium and sumatriptan but also for stability studies. For flurbiprofen and gatifloxacin combination a stability indicating RP-HPLC method was presented for determination of gatifloxacin and flurbiprofen in binary combination. Gatifloxacin, flurbiprofen and their degradation products were detected at 254 nm using BDS Hypersil C 8 (250 X 4. 6 mm, 5 Æ’ÃŠm) column and mixture of 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3. 0) and methanol 30 : 70 v/v as mobile phase. Response was linear over the range of 15 - 105 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for gatifloxacin (r 2. 0. 998) and 1. 5 - 10. 5 Æ’ÃŠg mL- 1 for flurbiprofen (r 2. 0. 999). The developed method efficiently separated the analytical peaks from degradation products (peak purity index. 0. 9999).
