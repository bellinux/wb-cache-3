40|$|Mutants. Conditional lethal mutants of {{bacteriophage}} [phi]X 174 ([phi]X) {{have been}} selected. These include nonsense mutants of the am (amber <b>nonsense</b> <b>triplet</b> - UAG) and op (opal <b>nonsense</b> <b>triplet</b> - UGA) types. Mis-sense mutants of the ts (temperature-sensitive) and ss (solvent-sensitive) types {{have also been}} isolated. The ss mutants are abnormally sensitive, during plaque formation, {{to the presence of}} solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide, ethylene glycol, or urea in the growth medium. Host range mutants are also described. Double and triple mutant strains have been constructed from specific single mutants. Cistrons. Complementation studies (principally with am and ts mutants) have defined seven complementation groups or cistrons. It is believed that these represent the genes for seven essential [phi]X-coded proteins. At least six of these cistrons are homologous, by complementation, to cistrons of the related phage S 13. Functions. Studies of abortive infection by conditional lethal mutants under restrictive conditions have been performed in order to elucidate the functions of the mutant cistrons. Properties of phage particles produced by mutants have been examined in order to identify cistrons which code for components of the phage coat. The cistron functions deduced from these studies are: cistron I - lysis of the host. Mutants in this cistron produce progeny at a normal rate, and for an extended time, but are not able to lyse the host cell. cistron II - spike component. This cistron codes for a protein which is a component of the spikes which project from the 12 vertices of the isometric [phi]X capsid. cistron III - spike component. This cistron codes for a second protein component of the phage spike and contains the serum-blocking antigen of the phage particle. cistron IV - phage coat. This cistron codes for a protein of the phage coat which is probably, by elimination, the main structural component of the capsid. cistron V - ?. The function of this cistron product is not known. cistron VI - RF replication. The product of this cistron is necessary for replication of the double-stranded form of [phi]X-DNA (RF). cistron VII - spike component. The product of this cistron is believed to be a component of the phage spike which determines the host range of the particle. These physiological studies suggest that assembly of phage, or defective phage particles is necessary for the synthesis of viral single-stranded DNA. RF replication (which requires cistron VI function and cistron V function are also necessary for single-strand synthesis. Recombination experiments (involving both two and three factor crosses) indicate that the order of the cistrons is II-III-VII-V-I-IV-VI, possibly joined end to end to form a circular map. It is of interest that cistrons which code for the spike components (II, III, and VII) appear to be contiguous on the map. A polar am mutant in cistron IV is deficient also in cistron VI function. This is interpreted to mean that reading proceeds from left to right on the map as shown (5 ' to 3 ' direction of the viral DNA and [phi]X mRNA) ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{constructed}} an opal suppressor {{system in}} Escherichia coli to complement an existing amber suppressor system {{to study the}} structural basis of tRNA acceptor identity, particularly the role of middle anticodon nucleotide at position 35. The opal suppressor tRNA contains a UCA anticodon and the mRNA of the suppressed protein (which is easily purified and sequenced) contains a UGA <b>nonsense</b> <b>triplet.</b> Opal suppressor tRNAs of two tRNA(Arg) isoacceptor sequences each gave arginine in the suppressed protein, while the corresponding amber suppressors with U 35 in their CUA anticodons each gave arginine plus a second amino acid in the suppressed protein. Since C 35 but not U 35 {{is present in the}} anticodon of wild-type tRNA(Arg) molecules, while the first anticodon position contains either C 34 or U 34, these results establish that C 35 contributes to tRNA(Arg) acceptor identity. Initial characterizations of opal suppressor tRNA(Arg) mutants by suppression efficiency measurements suggest that the fourth nucleotide from the 3 ' end of tRNA(Arg) (A 73 or G 73 in different isoacceptors) also contributes to tRNA(Arg) acceptor identity. Wild-type and mutant versions of opal and amber tRNA(Lys) suppressors were examined, revealing that U 35 and A 73 are important determinants of tRNA(Lys) acceptor identity. Several possibilities are discussed for the general significance of having tRNA acceptor identity in the same positions in different tRNA acceptor types, as exemplified by positions 35 and 73 in tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Lys) ...|$|E
40|$|CLCN 5 chloride-channel {{mutations}} in six new North American families with X-linked nephrolithiasis. BackgroundX-linked nephrolithiasis, or Dent's disease, encompasses several clinical syndromes of {{low molecular weight}} (LMW) proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and renal failure, and is associated with {{mutations in}} the CLCN 5 gene encoding a kidney-specific voltage-gated chloride channel. Some patients from Europe have rickets, and all symptomatic patients confirmed by mutation analysis have been male. MethodsWe analyzed the CLCN 5 DNA sequence in six new families with this disease. ResultsIn three probands, a single-base substitution yielded a <b>nonsense</b> <b>triplet</b> at codons 28, 34, and 343, respectively, and in two families, {{one of which was}} Hispanic, we found single-base deletions at codons 40 and 44, leading to premature termination of translation. In the sixth family, a single-base change from C to T predicted substitution of leucine for serine at codon 244, previously reported in two European families with prominent rickets, though this patient of Ashkenazi origin did not have rickets. Each of these mutations was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis, or repeat sequencing and CFLP. The R 34 X mutation occurred in a Canadian infant with severe rickets. The family with the R 28 X nonsense mutation included one woman with recurrent kidney stones and another woman with glomerular sclerosis. In another family, a woman heterozygous for the W 343 X mutation also had nephrolithiasis. ConclusionsThese studies expand the range of mutations identified in this disease, and broaden the phenotypic range to include clinically affected women and the first North American case with severe rickets...|$|E
40|$|The unnatural {{amino acid}} p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO 2 -Phe) {{is a useful}} {{biochemical}} probe of protein structure and activity. 1 - 4 When introduced into proteins either chemically or by in vitro biosynthe-sis, 3 - 6 the pNO 2 -Phe group can quench the intrinsic fluorescence of nearby tryptophan (Trp) residues. The ability to genetically encode this amino acid in vivo would greatly facilitate the generation of pNO 2 -Phe mutants for both biochemical and cellular studies of protein structure and function. Previously, it was shown that unnatural amino acids can be site-specifically introduced into proteins in bacteria and yeast in response to unique <b>triplet</b> (<b>nonsense)</b> and quadruplet (frameshift) codons. 7 - 12 Here we use this methodol-ogy to genetically encode pNO 2 -Phe in bacteria with high fidelity and efficiency. In addition, we illustrate {{the use of the}} pNO 2 -Phe/ Trp pair as a distance probe in a coiled-coil protein. pNO 2 -Phe was incorporated into proteins in Escherichia col...|$|R
