5|$|Catholic {{communities}} were already established in Greece since the 13th century (Athens, Cyclades, Chios, Crete). Jewish communities also {{existed in the}} country, those arriving after the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492) joining the earlier Romaniotes, Jews who had been living there since the times of Apostle Paul. Muslim families were still living in Greece during Otto's reign, since hostility was mainly against the Ottoman state and its depressive mechanisms and <b>not</b> <b>against</b> Muslim people.|$|E
5|$|Hermano Pule {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop José Seguí in Manila rebuking the acts of the Tayabas friars, and accusing them of beatings and threatening the excommunication of cofradía members. He also challenged the friars' authority to do such acts because the aims of the cofradía were never against the Catholic faith. On January 29, 1841, Pule {{sent a letter}} to the Bishop of Nueva Cáceres restating that the cofradía was <b>not</b> <b>against</b> canon law. The letter was forwarded to the juez provisor of the bishopric, who then endorsed it to Fr. Antonio Mateo and Fr. Manuel Sancho, who rejected Pule's petition.|$|E
5|$|In December, Hitler {{ordered his}} final, desperate {{attack in the}} west - through the snow-covered forests of the Ardennes. Poor weather kept the promised air support grounded, but early {{on the morning of}} New Year's Day, long after it was tactically useful or relevant, the Luftwaffe {{launched}} Operation Bodenplatte ('Baseplate') - <b>not</b> <b>against</b> the devastating strategic bombers, but on the frontline fighter airbases.|$|E

5|$|Jackson's next {{fight was}} <b>not</b> <b>against</b> the new UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, Rashad Evans, as the pre-fight reports suggested. UFC President Dana White {{indicated}} that the original plan was for Jackson to receive an immediate title shot, but Evans requested time off to recover from injuries he sustained from his fight against Forrest Griffin. Instead, Jackson faced Keith Jardine at UFC 96, and was victorious by unanimous decision. He was then scheduled to face Rashad Evans at UFC 98, but it was later revealed on March 11, 2009 that Jackson needed surgery to repair torn ligaments in his jaw, effectively cancelling the bout against Evans.|$|E
5|$|The League soon sent envoys to its neighbors, Stefan I Crnojević and Đurađ Branković. Branković, a lord of Serbian Despotate, who {{was also}} in dispute with Venice over the Principality of Zeta, {{expressed}} his willingness to help Skanderbeg against the Republic but <b>not</b> <b>against</b> the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians sent an ambassador to Skanderbeg offering him 1,000 ducats to lay aside all claims to Dagnum in return that the Albanians would protect the country and keep the roads free from violence. Skanderbeg, however, {{refused to accept the}} offer and hostilities continued. Alongside the Spani family, the Dushmani family was against the war with Venice and did not participate in it.|$|E
5|$|The three-pronged {{government}} {{lasted only}} from May to December 1992, as Panić and Ćosić decided to challenge Milošević in institutionally-revised elections in December that same year. The December election {{ended up as}} a failure for the opposition to Milošević, as Ćosić {{pulled out of the}} campaign in the last moment due to health problems. Multiple politicians of the opposition parties criticized the US-instigated fossil-fuel sanctions {{in the midst of a}} cold 1992-93 winter, saying that they actually further helped sympathy for Milošević and <b>not</b> <b>against</b> him.|$|E

5|$|Constant news of Ottoman {{campaigns against}} Bosnia and Morea but <b>not</b> <b>against</b> Albania {{seemed to suggest}} to Skanderbeg that Mehmed II had been {{considering}} an armistice with Skanderbeg. The latter took advantage of this lull in the fighting by preparing for his voyage to Italy and by securing his northern frontiers from a possible attack by Skanderbeg's elusive ally in northern Albania, Lekë Dukagjini, who {{had been trying to}} expand his realm by reaching an agreement with the Turks. In order to curb his ambitions, Skanderbeg seized Shat Fortress and presented it as a gift to Venice. Skanderbeg then established an alliance with Venice against Dukagjini, while Dukagjni was strengthening his Turkish alliance. The new pope issued a bull against Dukagjini, giving him fifteen days to break his alliance with the Ottomans and to reconcile with Skanderbeg, or be subject to interdiction; Dukagjini conceded and chose the former option. He then reestablished his alliance with Skanderbeg and Venice and accepted all of its losses.|$|E
5|$|His 1964–65 tour of {{the subcontinent}} {{on the way back}} to Australia was even worse, a far cry from his leading role in the {{previous}} tour to the subcontinent. After making 40 and 0 in the First Test win in Madras, he was unable to bat either innings in the Second Test in Bombay after being hospitalised due to persistent vomiting, injury as Australia ceded their series lead. He missed the remainder of the series, the Third Test in Calcutta and a one-off Test in Pakistan. Upon his return home, he has a shortened domestic season before Australia left for the West Indies. In five domestic matches, he scored 357 runs at 59.50, including a 133 <b>not</b> <b>against</b> South Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 194950, {{none of the}} Harveys played {{together}} at first-class level; Merv had retired, Mick had moved to Queensland looking for more opportunities, while Neil was in South Africa with the Australian team. Ray and Mick played in one match each for the season, but <b>not</b> <b>against</b> the other. In 1950-51, Ray was selected in two matches for Victoria, both when Neil and the other Test players were competing against England. Both of these were against Tasmania, so he did not meet Mick. However, there were no international fixtures coinciding with Victoria’s two matches with Queensland, and Neil met Mick {{in both of these}} matches. In 1951-52, Ray was able to gain selection more regularly for Victoria. All of these came when Neil and the other Test players were playing for Australia; when they available for Victoria, Ray was not selected. Ray played in both of Victoria's matches against Queensland, for whom Mick played in the first match.|$|E

5|$|The {{involvement}} {{of those in}} Hamilton's circle such as Schuyler, William Duer, James Duane, Gouverneur Morris, and Rufus King as speculators was not favorable to those against the report, either, though Hamilton personally did not own or deal {{a share in the}} debt. Madison eventually spoke against it by February 1790. Although he was <b>not</b> <b>against</b> current holders of government debt to profit, he wanted the windfall to go to the original holders. Madison did not feel that the original holders had lost faith in the government, but sold their securities out of desperation. The compromise was seen as egregious to both Hamiltonians and their dissidents such as Maclay, and Madison's vote was defeated 36 votes to 13 on February 22.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Byrne's early life beyond {{the fact that he}} was born in Ireland in 1806. His first fight, in 1825, was a loss to Mike Larking; it lasted 138 rounds spread over two and a half hours—despite the fact that at this time a round could vary in length, and usually only ended when a man was knocked down. His second fight was a draw against Jack Manning in 1826, earning Byrne £100. Next was Byrne's first match against the Scottish boxer Alexander McKay, which Byrne won easily in five rounds, earning him a further £100. This match was McKay's first ever prize-fight. This victory was soon {{followed}} by a win against Bob Avery, earning a further £50, then another win over Phil Samson in 1829, earning him £200. By the standards of the day these latter sums were enormous; it is therefore surprising that he was then offered £200 for a rematch, regardless of whether he won or <b>not,</b> <b>against</b> the less experienced McKay, whom he had beaten so easily on the first occasion. As of 2008 that would be the equivalent of about £13,600.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{conditions}} to allow a currency war were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and at no point were there enough states simultaneously wanting to devalue for a currency war to break out. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving <b>not</b> <b>against</b> other countries but against market forces that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved {{to the view that}} it was best to leave the running of their economies to the markets and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.|$|E
