25|$|The {{process of}} making the large open end (bell) of a brass {{instrument}} is called metal beating. In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes sheet metal into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and butts the seam, using a <b>notching</b> <b>tool.</b> The seam is brazed, using a torch and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A lathe is used to spin the bell head and to form a bead {{at the edge of}} bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a hand torch to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.|$|E
5000|$|To record data, {{the paper}} stock between {{a hole and}} the nearest edge was removed by a special <b>notching</b> <b>tool.</b> The holes were {{assigned}} a meaning dependent upon a particular application. For example, one hole might record {{the answer to a}} yes/no question on a survey, with the presence of a notch meaning [...] "yes". More-complex data was encoded using a variety of schemes, often using a superimposed code which allows more distinct categories to be coded than the number of holes available.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of tools {{by means of}} morphological attributes has been a widespread method in lithic studies to categorize retouched artifacts of different archaeological periods. This procedure facilitated the exchange of information between separate researchers and improved the comparison between different assemblages. In these classifications, denticulates and <b>notched</b> <b>tools</b> have been regularly interpreted as analogues and chronologically unvaried in different and vast territories. Based on the definitions of Bordes, the denticulate category has been filled with every kind of tools bearing concavities. In this paper a new quantitative approach to the systematic of denticulates and <b>notched</b> <b>tools</b> is proposed. The new methodology {{is based on the}} measurement of the lengths of notches and in their distribution on the perimeter of the blank. The analyses of lithic series of Abric Romaní rock-shelter (Spain) and Grotta Maggiore di San Bernardino (Italy) permitted the {{identification of}} 11 redundant forms: 8 denticulates and 3 <b>notched</b> <b>tools.</b> Moreover, by using Kuhn’s indexes of reduction, some local manufacturing trends are highlighted, questioning the presumed geographical uniformity of these categories of artifacts...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of assemblages from the French sites of Pech de l'Aze I, La Quina, and Combe-Capelle has, a model of stone-tool resharpening is proposed for Middle Paleolithic <b>notched</b> <b>tools.</b> This model {{is based on the}} observation that tools with a larger number of notches have greater mean blank lengths irrespective of their typological designation. This pattern is then used to help investigate the relationship between raw material availability and tool reuse. Our results indicate that the number of notches found on a tool is a function of both the size of the tool blank and the availability of raw material...|$|R
40|$|The {{ornamental}} stone {{industry is}} continuously seeking new cost effective methods to improve present day techniques of : (a) diamond wire cutting; (b) dense drilling followed by mechanical wedging or light blasting and (c) jet cutting, for extracting primary {{blocks from the}} quarry face and for splitting and squaring them to appropriate commercial sizes. Among the techniques proposed adn tested notching a borehole followed by wedging or decoupled blasting {{seems to be a}} commercially feasible technique provided that a suitable notching method becomes available. Notching can be used in soft non-abrasives stones such as marbles for splitting and squaring blocks and in hard and abrasive rocks (granites), where the diamond wire cutting technique can not be used effectively, for extraction from the bench face and for splitting and squaring. For marbles and many sandstones a detachable type <b>notching</b> <b>tool</b> fitted to a 7 / 8 '' hexagon drill still can be used with a hand held or mechanically mounted rock drill in which the rotation mechanism has been removed. In granites and other abrasive rocks having fracture toughness values twice as big as those of marbles a two stage linear explosive (hybrid explosive) is proposed for extraction of the rock from the quarry face and for secondary treatment. Laboratory and field tests in three different types of marble blocks and in granite blocks in the laboratory proved the cost effectiveness of the proposed techniques, which are also environmentally friendly since they produce less dust and reduce noise duration in comparison to present day practice...|$|E

40|$|The site of Les Fendeux (Coulanges) {{is in the}} {{north-east}} of the Allier département within 2 km of the Loire. This vast open-air site (3 hectares — approximately 7 1 / 2 acres), {{is located}} on the southern slope of a small plateau and was the subject of rescue excavations in 1998 - 1999. There are several different occupation periods: Middle Palaeolithic, Middle Neolithic, Middle Bronze Age, late La Tène, Gallo-Roman and Carolingian. The lithic remains dating to the Middle Palaeolithic period (n = 1082) were found in sandy sediments resulting from the erosion of the upper slopes, a few centimetres to one metre thick, which cover the more recent occupations. This site is characterised by the exploitation of Jurassic flint nodules, according to various systems of flaking (discoid, Levallois, recurrent centripetal). There are three different systems of discoid flaking; two are similar and include the majority of cores. In the first method the cores are partially exploited, in the second the cores are exploited on one face and in the third on two faces. There are relationships between the partial discoid and the bifacial discoid flaking systems. There are very few Levallois flakes (IL = 6. 9) and only one operational scheme seems present on this site: that of centripetal recurrent Levallois flaking. Centripetal recurrent flaking (non-Levallois) is characterised by the lack of preparation of the core face before the detachment of flakes which are more or less parallel, or at an angle to the intersection of the two faces of the core. The majority of the retouched tools (n = 98) are mainly composed of side scrapers (mostly simple), <b>notched</b> <b>tools,</b> denticulates and a small number of bifaces. The typology of the Les Fendeux assemblage is similar to the Acheulean-tradition Mousterian (MTA), which is very widespread in this area. Le site des Fendeux est un vaste gisement de plein air, localisé sur le versant sud d'un petit plateau. Ce site, dont le ou les niveaux ont été perturbés par des colluvionnements, se caractérise par l'exploitation sur place de galets de silex jurassique (chaule), selon différents systèmes de débitage (Discoïde, Levallois, récurrent centripète). L'outillage, essentiellement composé de racloirs, d'encoches et denticulés et de quelques bifaces, permet de rapprocher l'industrie du Moustérien de tradition acheuléenne.

5000|$|During this time, the Acheulean {{industry}} of Kalambo Falls was superseded by the Sangoan culture. This shift {{is considered by}} Clark as a result to an ecological shift to a cooler and wetter climate. It is {{at this time in}} the Archaeological record that the large, Acheulean handaxe disappears and is replaced by the core axe and chopping tools characteristic of Sangoan technologies. Heavy woodworking <b>tools</b> and small, <b>notched</b> and denticulated <b>tools,</b> collected by Clark, were dated to have been made before 41,000 BC. This rapid change is predicted to be a result of population movement during this time period, as the [...] "Acheulean man" [...] who lived in open settlements were replaced by a culture associated with Homo rhodesiensis found at Broken Hill, the Sangoan culture. Evidence of Sangoan habitation has been collected from less open Rock Shelters and Cave areas, possibly due to the persisting, wetter climate.|$|R
40|$|Chipping, {{adhesive}} wear, {{abrasive wear}} and crater wear are prevalent {{for both the}} polycrystalline diamond (PCD) and the carbide tools during high speed turning of TiCp/TiBw hybrid reinforced Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (TC 4) matrix composite (TMCs). The combined effects of abrasive wear and diffusion wear caused the big crater on PCD and carbide tool rake face. Compared to the PCD, bigger size of crater {{was found on the}} carbide tool due to much higher cutting temperature and the violent chemical reaction between the Ti element in the workpiece and the WC in the tool. However, the marks of the abrasive wear looked much slighter or even could not be observed on the carbide tool especially when low levels of cutting parameters were used, which attributes to much lower hardness and smaller size of WC combined with more significant chemical degradation of carbide. When cutting TC 4 using PCD <b>tool,</b> <b>notch</b> wear was the most significant wear pattern which was not found when cutting the TMCs. However, chipping, adhesive wear and crater wear were much milder when compared to the cutting of titanium matrix composite. Due to the absence of abrasive wear when cutting TC 4, the generated titanium carbide on the PCD protected the tool from fast wear, which caused that the tool life for TC 4 was 6 – 10 times longer than that for TMCs...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} image {{processing}} methods for quantitative {{study of how}} the bone marrow microenvironment changes (characterized by altered vascular structure and hematopoietic cell distribution) caused by diseases or various factors. We develop algorithms that automatically segment vascular structures and hematopoietic cells in 3 -D microscopy images, perform quantitative analysis of {{the properties of the}} segmented vascular structures and cells, and examine how such properties change. In processing images, we apply local thresholding to segment vessels, and add post-processing steps to deal with imaging artifacts. We propose an improved watershed algorithm that relies on both intensity and shape information and can separate multiple overlapping cells better than common watershed methods. We then quantitatively compute various features of the vascular structures and hematopoietic cells, such as the branches and sizes of vessels and the distribution of cells. In analyzing vascular properties, we provide algorithms for pruning fake vessel segments and branches based on vessel skeletons. Our algorithms can segment vascular structures and hematopoietic cells with good quality. We use our methods to quantitatively examine the changes in the bone marrow microenvironment caused by the deletion of Notch pathway. Our quantitative analysis reveals property changes in samples with deleted <b>Notch</b> pathway. Our <b>tool</b> is useful for biologists to quantitatively measure changes in the bone marrow microenvironment, for developing possible therapeutic strategies to help the bone marrow microenvironment recovery...|$|R
40|$|Environmentally {{friendly}} {{renewable energy}} {{technologies such as}} wind and solar energy systems are among the fleet of new generating technologies driving the demand for distributed generation of electricity. Power Electronics has initiated the next technological revolution and enables the connection of distributed generation (DG) systems to the grid. The challenge is to achieve system functionality without extensive custom engineering, yet still have high system reliability and generation placement flexibility. Nowadays, it is a general trend to increase the electricity production using DG systems. If these systems are not properly controlled, their connection to the utility network can generate problems on the grid side. Therefore, considerations about power generation, safe running and grid synchronization must be done before connecting these systems to the utility network. This thesis introduces a new grid-synchronization, or more visibly a new “power signal processor ” adaptive <b>notch</b> filtering (ANF) <b>tool</b> that can potentially stimulate much interest {{in the field and}} provide improvement solutions for grid-connected operation of DG systems. The processor is simple and offers high degree of immunity and insensitivity to power system disturbances, harmonics and other types of pollutions that exist in the grid signal. The processor is capable of decomposing three-phase quantities into symmetrical components, extracting harmonics, tracking the frequency variations, and providing means for voltage regulation and reactive power control. In addition, this simple and powerful synchronization tool will simplify the control issues currently challenging the integration of distributed energy technologies onto the electricity grid. All converter-interfaced equipments like FACTS (flexible ac transmission systems) and Custom Power Controllers will benefit from this technique. The theoretical analysis is presented, and simulation and experimental results confirm the validity of the analytical work...|$|R
