5|$|Al-Tabari's account does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or the Sassanians; {{focusing}} on the tribes and their relations, it is immersed in legends. Although the account is certainly based {{on the story of}} Zenobia, it is probably conflated with the story of a semi-legendary nomadic Arab queen (or queens). Al-Zabba' fortress was probably Halabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|As the two grew older, {{the letters}} became fewer and farther between. There {{was also a}} great deal that they kept to themselves. Jefferson said nothing about his {{construction}} of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a small}} peak of {{brightness}} {{near the}} outer edge of the Lassell ring, located at 57,200km from Neptune and less than 100km wide, which some planetary scientists call the Arago ring after François Arago, a French mathematician, physicist, astronomer and politician. However, many publications do <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Arago ring at all.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Louis Bosc did <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> earlier {{works when}} {{describing}} it as Lycoperdon heterogeneum, although he also suggested {{it should be}} placed in its own genus. Jean Poiret transferred Persoon's S.callostoma to Lycoperdon in 1817, while including Bosc's L.heterogeneum separately. In the same year, Nees von Esenbeck noted Bosc's belief that the species deserved its own genus and created Mitremyces, without referencing Desvaux's prior assignment to Calostoma. An 1825 paper by Edward Hitchcock referred to the species with the entirely novel binomial name Gyropodium coccineum; although Hitchcock claimed this name was established by Lewis Schweinitz, he admitted that no such description had been previously published, and the name and its claimed origin are considered doubtful.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Diefenbaker did <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> elder Atherton's initial {{approach}} but {{wrote that he}} was in Australia at a parliamentary conference {{at the time of the}} Canoe River crash. An Australian lawyer pointed out the case to Diefenbaker; he thought it interesting but noted that he was not a member of the Law Society of British Columbia. Diefenbaker wrote that he planned to meet Edna in Hawaii on his way back from Australia. Instead she wired him, requesting that he meet her in Vancouver.|$|E

5|$|KSE's lease of the {{warehouse}} was terminated in 1999. KSE subsequently returned the licensed unit, while moving the three unregistered units to an unused car park in Bangkok's Prawet District, which was owned by its parent company. The car park was fenced, but the fence had been breached and nearby residents regularly entered to play football in its empty areas. KSE notified the OAEP of its transfer of the licensed unit, but did <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> other three, which remained orphan sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{canonical}} {{literature of}} Jainism does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> worship of Ganesha. However, Ganesha is worshipped by most Jains, {{for whom he}} appears to have taken over certain functions of the god of wealth, Kubera. Jain ties with the trading community support the idea that Jainism took up Ganesha worship as a result of commercial connections. The earliest known Jain Ganesha statue dates to about the 9th century. A 15th-century Jain text lists procedures for the installation of Ganapati images. Images of Ganesha appear in the Jain temples of Rajasthan and Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|The early Ottomans {{preserved}} the imarat al-arab at least during the 16th century, {{during which the}} title {{was referred to as}} amir ʿarab-i Shām. However, the rights and role of the amir al-arab and his status in the Ottoman administration in Ottoman Syria are not well-defined in the contemporary sources, according to historian Muhammad Adnan Bakhit. The provincial records of Damascus Eyalet (Province of Damascus), whose jurisdiction extended throughout Syria until the mid-16th century, do <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> emirate's function. Moreover, Bakhit asserts that it is unclear if the sultan's ratification was required for the Bedouin tribes or the provincial government to recognize the amir al-arab.|$|E
50|$|Hej, mitt vinterland {{is a song}} {{written by}} Britt Lindeborg. While <b>not</b> <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> holiday, the song is {{generally}} associated with Christmas. In 1963 it was recorded by Lena Conradson.|$|R

5|$|The {{events leading}} to the {{destruction}} of the royal palace did not cause the destruction of the whole city. The Shattiwaza treaty, which describes the events of the first Syrian war, mentions that Qatna was invaded and destroyed, and its people were deported during the war. However, Idanda's successor, Akizzi, was ruling {{in the second half of}} the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten's reign following the first Syrian war, or shortly before the second Syrian war. This discrepancy can be explained if the treaty did <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> events in a chronological order; many scholars, such as Wilhelm, believe that the author of the document organized the text according to the principle of association, rather than following the sequence of events.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{book of the}} Ecclesiastical History of the English People, {{completed}} by the Northumbrian monk Bede in 731, celebrates the monastery at Ely and focuses on Æthelthryth's piety and the translation of her relics. Bede does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> matrilinear succession established at Ely by Æthelthryth, where power passed in turn to Seaxburh before subsequently transferring to Seaxburh's daughter Eormenhild and to her granddaughter, Werburh. He praises the virtues of Æthelthryth, a princess who was married twice but still preserved her virginity. Seaxburh receives little praise from Bede, as she had borne children before becoming a nun. He only mentions Seaxburh's marriage to Eorcenberht, succession as abbess and translation of her sister's relics.|$|E
5|$|The {{veracity}} of Hahn's claim was questioned {{as early as}} 1876, and the illustration appears to be plagiarised from the plate by François-Nicolas Martinet which was published at least 50 years earlier. After King Maximilian died in 1825, his collection was auctioned off, but no Mascarene parrot was mentioned in the inventory list of species. Hahn did <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> date in which he actually saw the bird {{which could have been}} long before 1834. However, the fact that Martinet's image was copied and that no mounted specimen exists (though such a rare bird would probably have been preserved) makes Hahn's account dubious. He may instead have based his account on other sources or even hearsay.|$|E

5|$|Violent anti-church clashes in Tavastia, central Finland, {{mentioned}} {{in a letter}} by Pope Gregorius IX in 1237, {{have been attributed to}} Thomas' harsh methods of Christianization, but without direct evidence for that conjecture. The letter, addressed to the Archbishop of Uppsala, does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Bishop or Diocese of Finland in any way. Information about the uprising had also originated from the temporarily sidelined Archbishop, who seems to have used the occasion to remind the Pope about Uppsala's earlier contributions to the missionary work in the north. The Pope had clearly not known where Tavastia exactly was, and eloquently urged the Archbishop to send in a crusade.|$|E
5|$|When {{approaching}} investors {{prior to}} filming, Six did <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> mouth-to-anus {{aspect of the}} plot, fearing it would put off potential backers. The financiers of The Human Centipede did not discover the full nature of the film until it was complete. The film received generally mixed reviews from mainstream film critics, but it won several accolades at international film festivals. The film was released in the United States on a limited theatrical release on 30 April 2010. A sequel, entitled Full Sequence, also {{written and directed by}} Six, was released in 2011.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after 538, Troglita {{was sent to}} the Eastern frontier, where by 541 he was {{appointed}} dux Mesopotamiae, {{one of the most important}} military commands of the region. From this position, he arrested a member of the embassy sent by the Ostrogothic king Witiges to the Persians to incite them to attack Byzantium. When war broke out, according to Corippus John scored a number of successes against the Persian army: he defeated the general Nabedes near Nisibis, led his army in a successful night attack against the Persian force besieging Theodosiopolis, and then defeated another Persian army besieging Dara, capturing its general, Mihr-Mihroe. Procopius, however, gives a different account of the first battle, indicating that Troglita had to be saved from a sudden Persian attack by Belisarius, and does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> other two incidents at all. Nevertheless, Corippus maintains that John was congratulated for his performance by Urbicius, one of Emperor Justinian's advisors who had been sent to supervise the war.|$|E

50|$|Sofia Ahlbom {{was also}} active as a {{professional}} photographer. In 1864, it is mentioned {{that she had been}} a successful photographer for several years prior, but it does <b>not</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> exact year when she debuted as such.|$|R

5|$|From May until August 1910, {{the forest}} reserve supervisor, Fremont Nathan Haines, managed the park's {{resources}} {{as the first}} acting superintendent. In August 1910, William Logan was appointed the park's first superintendent. While the designation of the forest reserve confirmed the traditional usage rights of the Blackfeet, the enabling legislation of the national park does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> guarantees to the Native Americans. It is {{the position of the}} United States government that with the special designation as a National Park the mountains ceded their multi-purpose public land status and the former rights ceased to exist as it was confirmed by the Court of Claims in 1935. Some Blackfeet held that their traditional usage rights still exist de jure. In the 1890s, armed standoffs were avoided narrowly several times.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} medieval period, {{large-scale}} conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and {{large numbers of}} converts are recorded {{within a year of}} the mission's arrival in Kent. By 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism. A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler Thomas Elmham, gives the date of the king's conversion as Whit Sunday, or 2June 597; {{there is no reason to}} doubt this date, but there is no other evidence for it. A letter of Gregory's to Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598 mentions the number of converts made, but does not mention any baptism of the king in 597, although it is clear that by 601 he had been converted. The royal baptism probably took place at Canterbury but Bede does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> location.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1360s {{the region of}} Vidin {{resisted}} the forceful conversion to Catholicism undertaken by the Hungarian authorities and remained Orthodox. The subjugation of Vidin to the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1381 led to a conflict with the Patriarchate of Tarnovo but {{after the fall of}} Tarnovo and the dissolution of the Bulgarian Patriarchate, Ivan Sratsimir tried to negotiate with the Ottomans to place some of the former eparchies of Tarnovo in his jurisdiction. In 1395 he sent there a delegation led by the heir to the throne Constantine and Joasaph of Bdin to bring the relics of Saint Philotea to Vidin. According to Joasaph the mission was successful and the relics remained in Vidin for the next two centuries. However, he does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> diplomatic results.|$|E
