5|$|The European <b>nightjar,</b> Eurasian <b>nightjar</b> or just <b>nightjar</b> (Caprimulgus europaeus) is a crepuscular and {{nocturnal bird}} in the <b>nightjar</b> family that breeds across most of Europe and {{temperate}} Asia. The Latin generic name refers to the old myth that the nocturnal <b>nightjar</b> suckled goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six subspecies differ clinally, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards {{the east of the}} range. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.|$|E
5|$|The nightjars, Caprimulgidae, are a {{large family}} of mostly nocturnal insect-eating birds. The largest and most {{widespread}} genus is Caprimulgus, characterised by stiff bristles around the mouth, long pointed wings, a comb-like middle claw and patterned plumage. The males, and sometimes females, often have white markings in the wing or tail. Within the genus, the European <b>nightjar</b> forms a superspecies with the rufous-cheeked <b>nightjar</b> and the sombre <b>nightjar,</b> African species with similar songs. It is replaced further east in Asia by the jungle <b>nightjar</b> which occupies similar habitat.|$|E
5|$|In cold or inclement weather, several <b>nightjar</b> {{species can}} slow their {{metabolism}} {{and go into}} torpor, notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks. The European <b>nightjar</b> has been observed in captivity {{to be able to}} maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, <b>nightjars</b> {{have been}} {{divided into three}} subfamilies: the Caprimulginae, or typical <b>nightjars</b> with about 80 species, and the Chordeilinae, or nighthawks of the New World with about 19 species. The two groups are similar in most respects, but the typical <b>nightjars</b> have rictal bristles, longer bills, and softer plumage. In their {{pioneering}} DNA-DNA hybridisation work, Sibley and Ahlquist found that the genetic difference between the eared <b>nightjars</b> and the typical <b>nightjars</b> was, in fact, greater than that between the typical <b>nightjars</b> and the nighthawks of the New World. Accordingly, they placed the eared-nightjars in a separate family: Eurostopodidae, but the family {{has not yet been}} widely adopted.|$|R

5|$|<b>Nightjars</b> have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} tapetum lucidum (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including <b>nightjars,</b> are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, <b>nightjars</b> have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of <b>nightjars</b> is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, European <b>nightjars</b> appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and <b>nightjars</b> do not echolocate.|$|R
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{range of the}} European <b>nightjar</b> comprises Europe north to around latitude 64°N and Asia north to about 60°N and east to Lake Baikal and eastern Mongolia. The southern limits are northwestern Africa, Iraq, Iran and the northwestern Himalayas. This <b>nightjar</b> formerly bred in Syria and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the European <b>nightjar</b> include {{a single species}} of biting louse found on the wings, and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European <b>nightjar.</b> Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>nightjar</b> {{species are}} known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, {{possibly}} because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the European <b>nightjar</b> showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E
5|$|The potoos (sometimes called poor-me-ones) {{are large}} near {{passerine}} birds {{related to the}} <b>nightjars</b> and frogmouths. They are nocturnal insectivores which lack the bristles around the mouth found in the true <b>nightjars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nighthawks {{are similar}} in most respects to the <b>nightjars,</b> but have shorter bills and plumage that is less soft. Nighthawks are less {{strictly}} nocturnal than many <b>nightjars</b> and may be seen hunting when there is still light in the sky.|$|R
50|$|The eared <b>nightjars</b> {{are found}} from China through Southeast Asia to Australia. Tropical populations are mostly sedentary, {{but the two}} Australian species (spotted and white-throated <b>nightjars)</b> are partial migrants. These are birds of open {{woodland}} or forest clearings and edges.|$|R
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} dry, open country with some trees and small bushes, such as heaths, forest clearings or newly planted woodland. The male European <b>nightjar</b> occupies a territory {{in spring and}} advertises his presence with a distinctive sustained churring trill from a perch. He patrols his territory with wings held in a V and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Wing clapping also occurs when the male chases the female in a spiralling display flight. The European <b>nightjar</b> does not build a nest, and its two grey and brown blotched eggs are laid directly on the ground; they hatch after about 17–21 days and the downy chicks fledge in another 16–17 days.|$|E
5|$|A 20-day study held by BirdLife International {{discovered}} 265 {{species of}} birds in the park. Of these, the yellow-bellied form of forest robin is widespread. In the study, a pair of Ja River scrub warblers was discovered in a 1 hectare patch of Rhynchospora marsh; its population must be small as there are few such marshes in Nki. Three species of forest <b>nightjar</b> have been observed in the park; Bate's and brown nightjars are common in southeastern Cameroon, while a rarer and unidentified third species' call has been heard twice. It is likely that this is Prigogine's <b>nightjar,</b> as its voice is identical {{to that of the}} only known specimen of this species which was found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Two small owls, Sjostedt's and African barred owlets coexist in Nki, due to similar habitat requirements.|$|E
5|$|The European <b>nightjar</b> {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, {{including}} moths, beetles, mantises, dragonflies, cockroaches and flies. It will pick glowworms off vegetation. It consumes grit to aid with digesting its prey, but any plant material and non-flying invertebrates consumed are taken inadvertently while hunting other food items. Young chicks have been known to eat their own faeces.|$|E
5000|$|Caprimulgus <b>nightjars</b> {{are found}} around the world, and like other <b>nightjars</b> they usually nest on the ground. They are mostly {{active in the}} late evening and early morning or at night, and feed {{predominantly}} on moths and other large flying insects.|$|R
50|$|The order Caprimulgiformes {{contains}} several {{families of}} nocturnal insectivores, {{these are the}} frogmouths, the potoos, the oilbird and the <b>nightjars.</b> The latter family is normally split into two subfamilies, the American nighthawks, Chordelinae, and the typical <b>nightjars</b> Caprimulginae. The eared <b>nightjars</b> are sometimes considered a subfamily Eurostopodinae of the Caprimulgidae but some studies have them as a sister group, while others treat them as a clade within the caprimulgids; others consider that the genus Eurostopodus may not be monophyletic.|$|R
50|$|Antrostomus <b>nightjars</b> {{are found}} in the New World, and like other <b>nightjars</b> they usually nest on the ground. They are mostly active in the late evening and early morning or at night, and feed {{predominantly}} on moths and other large flying insects.|$|R
5|$|Birds {{named for}} Ridgway include the buff-collared <b>nightjar,</b> Caprimulgus ridgwayi (once known as Ridgway's whip-poor-will); the {{turquoise}} cotinga, Cotinga ridgwayi; the Caribbean subspecies of the osprey, Pandion haliaetus ridgwayi; a Big Island subspecies of the elepaio, Chasiempis sandwichensis ridgwayi; Ridgway's hawk, Buteo ridgwayi; {{and many other}} species and subspecies. The monotypic genus Ridgwayia is named for him; it consists of Aztec thrush, R. pinicola.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the European {{population}} of the European <b>nightjar</b> range from 470,000 to more than 1million birds, suggesting a total global {{population of}} 2–6million individuals. Although {{there appears to be}} a fall in numbers, it is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The huge breeding range and population mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Like other nightjars, it {{will sit}} on roads or paths {{during the night}} and hover to {{investigate}} large intruders such as deer or humans. It may be mobbed by birds while there is still light, and by bats, other <b>nightjar</b> species or Eurasian woodcocks during the night. Owls and other predators such as red foxes will be mobbed by {{both male and female}} European nightjars. Like other aerial birds, such as swifts and swallows, nightjars make a quick plunge into water to wash. They have a unique serrated comb-like structure on the middle claw that is used to preen and perhaps remove parasites.|$|E
50|$|The <b>nightjars</b> have {{a global}} distribution, being found {{on all the}} continents other than Antarctica. They are also absent from some {{extremely}} arid deserts, such as the Sahara Desert and the deserts of central Asia, and polar regions of the far north. They are also found in some island groups such as Madagascar, the Seychelles, New Caledonia and the islands of Caribbean. The nighthawks have a New World distribution, and the eared <b>nightjars</b> are Asian and Australian, whereas the typical <b>nightjars</b> are global in distribution.|$|R
40|$|Prey are {{typically}} assumed to avoid their predators. However, habitat selection patterns of prey might depend upon {{their ability to}} use particular landscape elements to manage their escape options from predator encounters. During two breeding seasons, I studied habitat use and behaviour of red-necked <b>nightjars</b> (Caprimulgus ruficollis) foraging under the risk of predation by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in southwestern Spain. <b>Nightjars</b> exhibited nearly invariable foraging site choice and body positioning behaviour based on the architecture of vegetation near foraging sites. <b>Nightjars</b> actively chose to sit 120 cm-tall shrubs or trees while facing away from vegetation cover. Vegetation behind <b>nightjars</b> significantly increased their aerial escape opportunities from terrestrial attacks during their peak activity period, when <b>nightjars</b> reveal visible feather bands during their foraging sallies {{from the ground and}} their cryptic colouration may not always match the background. Spatial overlap of <b>nightjars</b> and foxes along roads suggests that microhabitat selection by these birds may in part depend on the chance of escape from predator encounters rather than on the probability of encountering predators. I conclude that the interplay between high escape efficiency and visibility have probably contributed to the evolution of foraging site selection by caprimulgids using bare grounds and cattle, horse and camel trails as the natural counterpart of roads.

5|$|The grasslands, heathland, {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as barn owls (Tyto alba) and <b>nightjar,</b> with butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), corky fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) which support populations of dormouse (Gliridae), common lizards, siskin, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple hairstreak butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian <b>nightjar</b> use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|The European <b>nightjar</b> {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a perch. It hunts by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. Its eyes are {{relatively}} large, each with a reflective layer, which improves night vision. It appears not to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not echolocate. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|Some animals, {{such as the}} horned lizards of North America, {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under {{the edge of the}} body. The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the roundtail horned lizard, which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood, Pararge aegeria, minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European <b>nightjar</b> select a resting position facing the sun. The elimination of shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Where bracken is {{dominant}} it excludes most specialist heathland/moorland {{bird species}} of conservation concern, {{although there are}} a few species that may benefit from a certain proportion of bracken. Deeper bracken stands provide a good food site for many resident or breeding birds, such as threatened ground-nesting species skylark, yellowhammer, curlew and lapwing. Some British birds such as the whinchat and the <b>nightjar</b> use bracken as their preferred habitats. The <b>nightjar</b> may lay its eggs on the bare ground under the bracken. The skylark often nests in bracken and uses it for cover. Small stands of bracken provide nesting, feeding and roosting habitat for a variety of smaller birds, including the willow warbler (which will also use bracken to construct its nest), the tree pipit, the yellowhammer, the ring ouzel, the woodcock and the twite.|$|E
