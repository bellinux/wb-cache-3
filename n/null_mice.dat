2500|$|Signalling by type I {{and type}} II OSM receptors {{have now been}} shown to be qualitatively distinct. These {{differences}} in signaling character, in addition to the tissue distribution profiles of OSMRb and LIFRb, offer another variable in the distinction between the common and specific cellular effects of OSM with respect to LIF. [...] All IL-6 cytokines whether they homo- or heterodimerise gp130 seem to activate JAK1, JAK2 and to a lesser degree Tyk2. It should be noted however that JAK1, JAK2, and tyk2 are not interchangeable in the gp130 system, this has been demonstrated with the use of JAK1, Jak2 or Tyk2 deficient cell lines obtained from mutant mice. Cells from JAK1 deficient mice show reduced STAT activation and generation of biological responses in response to IL-6 and LIF. In contrast, fibroblasts derived from JAK2 <b>null</b> <b>mice</b> can respond to IL-6, with demonstratable tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130, JAK1 and TYK2. Thus it seems JAK1 is the critical JAK required for gp130 signalling. Activation of the same Jaks by all three receptor combinations (gp130/gp130, gp130/LIFR, gp130/OSMR) raises the question of how IL6, LIF and OSM can activate distinct intracellular signaling pathways. Selection of particular substrates, i.e. STAT isoform, depended not on which Jak is activated, but instead are determined by specific motifs, especially tyrosine-based motifs, within each receptor intracellular domain.|$|E

The expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-β 1 (Tgf-β 1) and muscle segment homeobox- 1 (Msx- 1) is modified in the palates of these knockout mice, and the cell proliferation defect {{is caused by the}} change in EGF expression.

These actions reflect GH stimulation of IGF-I production in liver and extrahepatic tissues, representing respectively the endocrine and autocrine/paracrine arms of the IGF system.

In an effort to address this issue, we studied the GH responsiveness of <b>mice</b> harboring a <b>null</b> mutation of the acid-labile subunit (ALS). <b>Null</b> ALS <b>mice</b> have a substantial reduction in endocrine IGF-I but, unlike other models of plasma IGF-I deficiency, have no obvious additional endocrine defects.

Food-entrained circadian rhythms are characterized by increased locomotor activity in anticipation of food availability (food anticipatory activity).

Here we show that serotonin 2 C receptor (5 -HT 2 CR) <b>null</b> mutant <b>mice</b> subjected to a daytime restricted feeding schedule exhibit enhanced food anticipatory activity compared to wild-type littermates, without phenotypic differences in the impact of restricted feeding on food consumption, body weight loss, or blood glucose levels.

Bovine colostrum and fresh unpasteurised bovine milk {{were found to be}} rich sources of TGFB 1 and TGFB 2; however, feeding Tgfb 1 <b>null</b> mutant <b>mice</b> colostrum for 2 days failed to raise serum levels of TGFB 1. Administration of rhLTGFB 1 (approximately 150 microg in total) over 14 days to Tgfb 1 <b>null</b> mutant <b>mice</b> resulted in detectable TGFB 1 in serum; however, mean levels remained 10 -fold less than in Tgfb 1 heterozygous mice.

Despite the increased serum TGFB 1, administration of rhLTGFB 1 to Tgfb 1 <b>null</b> mutant <b>mice</b> failed to improve these fertility parameters.

40|$|Development of the lip and palate {{involves}} a complex {{series of events}} that requires the close co-ordination of cell migration, growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Palatal shelf elevation is considered to be driven by regional accumulation and hydration of glycosoaminoglycans, principally hyaluronan (HA), which provides an intrinsic shelf force, directed by components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). During embryogenesis, the extracellular and pericellular matrix surrounding migrating and proliferating cells is rich in HA. This would suggest that HA may be important in both shelf growth and fusion. TGFβ 3 {{plays an important role in}} palatogenesis and the corresponding homozygous null (TGFβ 3 -/-) mouse, exhibits a defect in the fusion of the palatal shelves resulting in clefting of the secondary palate. TGFβ 3 is expressed at the future medial edge epithelium (MEE) and at the actual edge epithelium during E 14. 5, suggesting a role for TGFβ 3 in fusion. This is substantiated by experiments showing that addition of exogenous TGFβ 3 can ‘rescue’ the cleft palate phenotype in the <b>null</b> <b>mouse.</b> In addition, TGFβ 1 and TGFβ 2 can rescue the <b>null</b> <b>mouse</b> palate (in vitro) to near normal fusion. In vivo a TGFβ 1 knock-in mouse, where the coding region of the TGFβ 3 gene was replaced with the full-length TGFβ 1 cDNA, displayed complete fusion at the mid portion of the secondary palate, whereas the anterior and posterior regions failed to fuse appropriately.

Study with single RGC axon labeling demonstrates continuous increase in the size and decrease in the density of axonal arborization between P 4 and P 16 (Dhande et al., 2012).
