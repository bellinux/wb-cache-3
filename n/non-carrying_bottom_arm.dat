40|$|Experimental, {{numerical}} {{and analytical}} investigations {{have revealed that}} Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strips with larger cross section height improve {{the effectiveness of the}} Near Surface Mounted (NSM) technique for the flexural strengthening of existing reinforced concrete (RC) beams. However, this height is limited to the concrete cover thickness of the longitudinal steel bars, since the application of strips of cross section height larger than the cover thickness requires that the <b>bottom</b> <b>arm</b> of the steel stirrups be cut. This work aims to assess the influence, in terms of shear resistance, of cutting the <b>bottom</b> <b>arm</b> of steel stirrups to install NSM strips for the flexural strengthening of RC beams. The obtained results showed that, for monotonic loading, cutting the <b>bottom</b> <b>arm</b> of steel stirrups led to a decrease of the beam’s load carrying capacity of less than 10 %. Due to the high effectiveness of the adopted NSM flexural strengthening systems, shear can be a predominant failure mode for these beams. To avoid this type of failure mode, strips of wet lay-up CFRP sheets with U configuration were used, resulting in effective strengthening solutions for RC beams. In the present paper the experimental program is described, and the obtained results are presented and discussed.

40|$|We {{show that}} major {{chromosomal}} rearrangements can occur upon T-DNA transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana. In the ACL 4 line, two T-DNA insertion loci were found; {{one is a}} tandem T-DNA insert in a head-to-head orientation, {{and the other is}} a truncated insert with only the left part of the T-region. The four flanking DNA regions were isolated and located on the Arabidopsis chromosomes; for both inserts, one side of the T-DNA maps to chromosome 2, whereas the other side maps to chromosome 3. Both chromosome 3 flanking regions map to the same location, despite a 1. 4 -kb deletion at this point, whereas chromosome 2 flanking regions are located 40 cM apart on the <b>bottom</b> <b>arm</b> of chromosome 2. These results strongly suggest a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 2 and 3, with the breakpoints located at the T-DNA insertion sites. The interchanged fragments roughly correspond to the 20 -cM distal ends of both chromosomes. Moreover, a large inversion, spanning 40 cM on the genetic map, occurs on the <b>bottom</b> <b>arm</b> of chromosome 2. This was confirmed by genetic analyses that demonstrated a strong reduction of recombination in the inverted region. Models for T-DNA integration and the consequences for T-DNA tagging are discussed in light of these results...|$|R

40|$|A cross axis {{wind turbine}} is disclosed, which {{comprises}} of cross axis arrangement. The wind turbine {{consists of three}} vertical blades and six horizontal blades arranged in cross axis orientation. The six horizontal blades serve as the radial arms that link the three vertical blades and the hubs through connectors to form the cross axis wind turbine (CAWT). Three horizontal axis blades that make up as the upper radial arm connects the top part of the vertical blades to the hub through the top connectors. The other three horizontal axis blades that make up as the lower radial <b>arm</b> connects the <b>bottom</b> part of the vertical axis blades to the hub through the bottom connectors. To avoid air flow blockage or interference between the top radial <b>arm</b> and the <b>bottom</b> radial <b>arm,</b> the horizontal axis blade radial arm at the top part of the turbine is offset at an angle of 30 Â° {{with respect to the}} <b>bottom</b> radial <b>arm.</b> In the present invention, the air stream can be channeled {{from the bottom of the}} turbine through the <b>bottom</b> radial <b>arm,</b> and the air streams that did not interact with the <b>bottom</b> radial <b>arm</b> will eventually interact with the top radial arm.

40|$|Near {{surface mounted}} (NSM) {{technique}} {{has proved to}} be a very effective technique for the flexural strengthening of RC beams. Due to the relatively small thickness of the concrete cover that several beams present, cutting the <b>bottom</b> <b>arm</b> of steel stirrups for the installation of NSM laminates might be a possible strategy, whose implications on the beam’s load carrying capacity need to be assessed. When steel stirrups are cut, however, the shear resistance can be a concern. This also happens when a strengthening intervention is carried out to increase the flexural resistance of a beam, since in certain cases it is also necessary to increase the shear resistance in order to avoid the occurrence of brittle shear failure. The present work assesses the effectiveness of a technique that aims to increase both the flexural and shear resistance of RC beams that have the <b>bottom</b> <b>arm</b> of the steel stirrups cut for the application of NSM laminates. This assessment is performed by experimental and numerical research. The main results of the experimental program are presented and analyzed, and the innovative aspects of a constitutive model implemented in a computer program are described, being their virtues and deficiencies discussed.

40|$|Seed {{germination}} {{is partially}} controlled by plant hormone gibberellins (GAs). Chemical mutagenesis yielded an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant gm 11, {{which has an}} absolute gibberellin requirement for seed germination. This mutant exhibited phenotypes of GA-rescuable dwarfs, including dark-green leaves, and reduced fertility. However, with repeated GA treatment, gm 11 develops into fertile plants with a nearly wild type phenotype. Bulked-segregant analysis mapped gm 11 to the <b>bottom</b> <b>arm</b> of chromosome 1, and subsequent next-generation mapping revealed that the mutation is a G → A transition in At 1 g 79460 (GA 2), creating a premature stop codon. This gene encodes an ent-kaurene synthase (KS) which catalyzes the conversion of copalyl diphosphate to ent-kaurene in the GA biosynthesis pathway. Further genetic analysis suggests that gm 11 is allelic to ga 2 and has been named ga 2 - 11. This work demonstrated a genetic finding useful for further understanding the molecular process underlying dormancy and germination...|$|R
40|$|The major {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate interactions between the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. raphani (Xcr) and Arabidopsis thaliana which are largely unexplored as a model pathosystem, and to identify genetic loci conferring resistance to this pathogen. Xcr is genetically close to X. campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) and both pathogens infect common Brassicaceae species including A. thaliana, but cause distinct diseases - leaf spot and black rot, respectively. Phenotypic variation was identified among interactions between 22 A. thaliana accessions of wide geographic origin and Xcr and Xcc strains representing known host genotype specific races. Accessions were identified showing broad resistance and broad susceptibility to multiple Xcr and Xcc strains as well as accessions that differentiate between Xcr races. Genetic mapping of resistance to a strain of Xcr race 2 in a multi-parent recombinant inbred population revealed two major effect loci: RXCR 1 at the <b>bottom</b> <b>arm</b> of chromosome 3, and RXCR 2 at the <b>bottom</b> <b>arm</b> of chromosome 5. RXCR 1 was confirmed by fine-mapping and loss- and gain-of-function experiments, as a single gene encoding a kinase-like protein conferring resistance in the accession Columbia. Columbia is resistant to strains of all three known Xcr races, but RXCR 1 is insufficient on its own to explain the broad resistance. A summary of phenotypic and genetic analyses of interactions between Xcr and A. thaliana is presented in a gene-for-gene model. X. campestris strains associated with outbreaks of a leaf spot and blight disease of brassica crops in Mauritius, were characterized. These strains were similar to reference Xcc strains in pathogenicity tests and molecular analyses. The presence of Xcr in these outbreaks was not confirmed. Whole-genome sequencing data was used to identify genes that may contribute to the distinct modes of pathogenesis of Xcr and Xcc as well as variation in host specific races within each pathovar. Genes differentially present/absent between nine Xcr and 23 Xcc strains were identified and include genes predicted/known to encode type III effectors some of which have been previously described to have an effect on Xcc pathogenicity. Candidate avirulence determinants of Xcr and Xcc races were also identified...|$|R
