5|$|The {{bridge is}} both a {{connector}} and a viewing platform for the park. It was designed to link the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and the entire Loop to the west with the Lake Michigan lakefront to the east. It was also {{designed to be a}} berm <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> blocking noise on the eight-lane Columbus Drive from the Park's outdoor band shell (Jay Pritzker Pavilion), by deflecting traffic sounds upward.|$|E
25|$|The <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> may be {{constructed}} on private land, {{on a public}} right-of-way, or on other public land. Because sound levels are measured using a logarithmic scale, a reduction of nine decibels is equivalent to elimination of approximately 86 percent of the unwanted sound power.|$|E
25|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>barriers</b> can be {{effective}} tools for noise pollution abatement, but certain locations and topographies are not suitable for use of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> Cost and aesthetics {{also play a role}} in the choice of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> In some cases, a roadway is surrounded by a noise abatement structure or dug into a tunnel using the cut-and-cover method.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the test}} methods used for {{determining}} the acoustic performance of the <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> in Korean standards address the sound-proof panels but refer to <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> as a whole system or their in-situ performances less. Many new types of trains with different operating speeds have been developed and produced, and civil appeals against railway noise are becoming quite extensive. Considering these latest changes of circumstances, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the current standards and specifications pertaining to railway <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> In this paper, criteria for the measurements and evalua-tions of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and sound-proof panels are examined and experimental studies are introduced. In order to suggest more efficient methods for reasonable evaluations of the <b>noise</b> <b>barriers,</b> frequency spectrums of the noise source, the power of the actual railway vehicles, are investigated and introduced...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} acoustical wave propagator (I_AWP) technique with high-order absorbing boundary {{technique is}} introduced {{to evaluate the}} acoustical wave interaction for <b>noise</b> <b>barriers,</b> providing the dual benefit of preserving high numerical accuracy (boundary conditions have been properly treated) and obtaining high computational efficiency (using a larger time step in the calculation). The aim {{is to establish a}} framework for effective design of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> based on (a) in the time-domain, the evolution of wave propagation and analyses of acoustical-structure interaction, then a good understanding of time-domain acoustical wave diffraction (one key noise abatement mechanism) can be achieved, and (b) in the frequency-domain, the effects of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> with different structures and noise sources at different locations on sound pressure distribution, especially <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> with a simple smart structure (membranes) are investigated in detail. These investigations produce a database for effective and optimal design of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> More importantly, the outcome can provide a deep insight to the acoustical performance of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> in reducing <b>noise</b> pollution in urban environments and other applications...|$|R
25|$|South of King Street, the Creek {{is visible}} on the west side, {{as far south as}} the rail lines. Past the CPR rail lines, the Creek diverges west into Rosedale Park, while the {{expressway}} hugs {{the east side of the}} valley. On the east side of the valley at this point is Red Hill and the Red Hill residential area is isolated from the expressway by a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier.</b>|$|E
25|$|Noise {{barriers}} {{force the}} pollution plumes {{coming from the}} road to move {{up and over the}} barrier creating the effect of an elevated source and enhancing vertical dispersion of the plume. The deceleration and the deflection of the initial flow by the <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> force the plume to disperse horizontally. A highly turbulent shear zone characterized by slow velocities and a re-circulation cavity is created in the lee of the barrier which further enhances the dispersion; this mixes ambient air with the pollutants downwind behind the barrier.|$|E

She put him and his sister in the car she was driving at the time, a silver 1998 two-door Acura Integra, and headed for Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue. She later stated that around the 2600 block of 112th Street N.E. in that city, a long undeveloped section of the road that follows a tall concrete <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> around the curve of the Washington State Route 520 expressway, just west of its interchange with Interstate 405, she ran out of gas.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, {{the first}} <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> were {{constructed}} on {{the portion of}} I-270 passing near Gahanna. <b>Noise</b> <b>barriers</b> have been slowly added around {{the length of the}} 55 mi long belt as development has crowded up to the noisy road.|$|R
2500|$|Roadside <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> {{have been}} shown to reduce the near-road air {{pollution}} concentration levels. Within 15–50 m from the roadside, air pollution concentration levels at the lee side of the <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> may be reduced by up to 50% compared to open road values.|$|R

25|$|In January 2010, the TPA {{announced}} that it would spend $8 million CAD on upgrades to the airport. The upgrades include a new $2.3 million CAD Equipment Maintenance Building, apron paving, equipment upgrades and a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> to deflect plane maintenance noise out over the lake. The expense would be recouped from the Airport Improvement Fee charged to passengers. In February 2010, Air Canada filed suit against the TPA to get access to the airport, access it had lost when Porter had evicted Jazz in 2006. On March 29, 2010, the Federal Court ruled that Air Canada would have a hearing in July 2010 of its objections to the TPA process. On March 7, 2010, {{the first half of the}} Porter's new terminal opened. The new terminal, estimated to cost $50 million CAD, was completed in early 2011. The opening of the new terminal was met by new protests by Community Air activists protesting the proposed increase in flights.|$|E

It is a connecting link between Millennium Park and destinations to the east, such as the nearby lakefront, other parts of Grant Park and a parking garage. BP Bridge uses a concealed box girder design with a concrete base, and its deck is covered by hardwood floor boards. [...] It is designed without handrails, using stainless steel parapets instead. The total length is , with a five percent slope on its inclined surfaces that makes it barrier free and accessible.

40|$|A {{social survey}} on {{community}} response to road traffic noise {{was carried out}} at sites with and without <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> along Kyushu Highway. The reduction of general annoyance and activity interference by the <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> were found while the distributions of responses regarding the demographic parameters were almost the same at both sites. By applying path analysis to the social response and noise data, the effect of TV/radio disturbance on annoyance is found stronger at the sites with <b>noise</b> <b>barriers,</b> while the effects of LAeq and sensitivity to noise are larger the sites without <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> This suggests that the listening effect is increased because of visually concealing the noise source at the site with barriers and that the attitude toward the source is emphasized as the respondents directly saw the source...|$|R

2500|$|Noise {{barriers}} {{have been}} built in the United States since the mid-twentieth century, when vehicular traffic burgeoned. [...] I-680 in Milpitas, California was the first <b>noise</b> <b>barrier.</b> [...] In the late 1960s, analytic acoustical technology emerged to mathematically evaluate the efficacy of a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> design adjacent to a specific roadway. By the 1990s, noise barriers that included use of transparent materials were being designed in Denmark and other western European countries. Below, a researcher collects data to calibrate a roadway noise model for Foothill Expressway.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{case studies}} across the U.S. soon {{addressed}} dozens of different existing and planned highways. [...] Most were commissioned by state highway departments and conducted {{by one of}} the four research groups mentioned above. The U.S. National Environmental Policy Act effectively mandated the quantitative analysis of noise pollution from every Federal-Aid Highway Act Project in the country, propelling <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> model development and application. [...] With passage of the Noise Control Act of 1972, demand for <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> design soared from a host of noise regulation spinoff.|$|E
40|$|The issue {{connected}} with effectiveness of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> {{has been the}} subject of numerous considerations among acousticians. On the one hand, <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> are still the most popular and the most frequently used protection against traffic noise, on the other hand, however, the excessive number of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and the results of research focusing on effectiveness of the existing barriers make us reflect whether it is reasonable to use them. Very often low effectiveness of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> is related to a badly conducted designing process. This article presents the basic mistakes made by noise barriers’ designers and the consequences thereof. Next, the paper describes the appropriate approach to the process of the noise barriers’ design which consists in the use of computer methods and conducting of a detailed analysis of the acoustic field’s distribution both behind the barrier and on the facades of the acoustically protected buildings...|$|R
40|$|Ensuring {{sufficient}} visibility on planned roads {{by sight}} distance testing {{is an integral}} part of every project, but problems with visibility can emerge when <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> are erected on existing roads. Namely, in order to provide sufficient noise protection, high <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> are often placed at minimum distance from the carriageway edge, and additional visibility testing in most cases is not carried out...|$|R
40|$|Despite of a {{broad range}} of {{applications}} of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers,</b> little is known about environmental interactions. From the building physical point of view concerning urban development, these interactions frequently prevent the aeration of neighboring urban areas and cause the deflection or redirection of air flows. In order to investigate the interaction of air flow and <b>noise</b> <b>barriers,</b> measurements of sound and wind were carried out at various <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> along roads. The measured wind velocity and wind directions as well as the observed air flows by means of the motion of soap bubbles were compared to the results of fluid mechanical simulations. In addition, the residents of the investigated buildings were interviewed. The investigation results showed that in the vincinity (close-up range) of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> no relevant influence of the wind direction, the wind force or the air flow on sound propagation could be identified. This influence, however, is increased with a rising distance...|$|R
2500|$|The {{acoustical}} {{science of}} <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> design {{is based upon}} treating an airway or railway as a line source. The theory is based upon blockage of sound ray travel toward a particular receptor; however, diffraction of sound must be addressed. Sound waves bend (downward) when they pass an edge, such as the apex of a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier.</b> Barriers that block line of sight of a highway or other source will therefore block more sound. Further complicating matters is the phenomenon of refraction, the bending of sound rays {{in the presence of}} an [...] atmosphere. Wind shear and thermocline produce such inhomogeneities. The sound sources modeled must include engine noise, tire noise, and aerodynamic noise, all of which vary by vehicle type and speed.|$|E

2500|$|When {{wind speed}} {{increases}} with altitude, wind blowing towards the listener {{from the source}} will refract sound waves downwards, resulting in increased noise levels downwind of the barrier.

40|$|Noise is everywhere. Noise is a {{sound that}} makes people {{stressful}} and irritate. It often couses sleep disorders and also health problems like different cardiovascular disorders, hearing loss…In most cases traffic noise is the most disturbing. There are different ways to prevent people from traffic noise like building <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and insulation of facades. However <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and insulation of facades do not prevent noise formation, but are lowering existing noise. Another disadvantage is expensive construction of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and fascade insulations. Way to prevent formation of noise is construction of low-noise road surfaces. In the paper we have presented different properties that effect on formation tyre – road noise, noise comparison of different surfaces and latest findings in building low-noise road surfaces...|$|R
