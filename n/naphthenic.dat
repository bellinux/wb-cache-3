2500|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the oil sands development, there have been several leaks into the Athabasca River polluting it with oil and tailing pond water. The close proximity of the tailing ponds to the river drastically increases the likelihood of contamination due to ground water leakages. In 1997, Suncor admitted that their tailing ponds had been leaking [...] of toxic water into the river a day. This water contains <b>naphthenic</b> acid, trace metals such as mercury and other pollutants. The Athabasca River is the largest freshwater delta in the world but with Suncor and Syncrude leaking tail ponds the amount of polluted water will exceed 1 billion cubic meters by 2020.|$|E

2500|$|Large {{volumes of}} {{tailings}} are {{a byproduct of}} bitumen extraction from the oil sands and managing these tailings {{is one of the}} most difficult environmental challenges facing the oil sands industry. Tailings ponds are engineered dam and dyke systems that contain solvents used in the separation process as well as residual bitumen, salts and soluble organic compounds, fine silts and water. The concentrations of chemicals may be harmful to fish and oil on the surface harmful to birds. These settling basins were meant to be temporary. A major hindrance to the monitoring of oil sands produced waters has been the lack of identification of individual compounds present. By better understanding the nature of the highly complex mixture of compounds, including <b>naphthenic</b> acids, it may be possible to monitor rivers for leachate and also to remove toxic components. Such identification of individual acids has for many years proved to be impossible but a breakthrough in 2011 in analysis began to reveal what is in the oil sands tailings ponds. Ninety percent of the tailings water can be reused for oil extraction. By 2009 as tailing ponds continued to proliferate and volumes of fluid tailings increased, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board issued Directive 074 to force oil companies to manage tailings based on new aggressive criteria. [...] The Government of Alberta reported in 2013 that tailings ponds in the Alberta oil sands covered an area of about [...] The Tailings Management Framework for Mineable Oil Sands is part of Alberta’s Progressive Reclamation Strategy for the oil sands to ensure that tailings are reclaimed as quickly as possible.|$|E

A batch, fluidized bed CREC riser simulator reactor was used at 673 and 723 K and contact times varied from 3 to 15 s. Cis-decalin was much more reactive. Despite differences induced and measured in their accessibility indices, the catalysts led to similar activity profiles, suggesting that diffusion restrictions do not prevail. Products were C 1 -C 12 hydrocarbons while coke was very low. Isomerization, cracking, hydrogen transfer, ring opening, ring contraction and alkylation reactions occurred and products from the various reactions were observed at very short reaction times.

30|$|Crude oil is {{a complex}} mixture of hydrocarbons, {{consisting}} of waxes, asphaltenes, resins, aromatics, and <b>naphthenics.</b> Wax precipitation has a substantial effect on oil production and transportation. Wax precipitation can result many problems, such as decreased production rates of crude oil, increased power requirements, and failure of facilities. Wax is the high molecular weight paraffin fraction of crude oil and can be separated by reduction in oil temperature below the pour point of crude oil. The solubility of high molecular weight waxes in crude oil decreases with decreasing temperature. In the transportation of waxy crude oil in a cold environment at temperatures below the oil pour point, the temperature gradient of the oil creates a concentration gradient of the dissolved waxes due to their difference in solubility. The driving force, created by the concentration gradient, transfers the waxes from the oil toward the pipe wall where they precipitate and form a solid phase. The solid phase reduces the available area for oil flow, and in turn causes {{a drop in the}} pipe flow capacity. In order to predict the wax precipitation conditions, a reliable thermodynamic model is necessary. Several thermodynamic models for estimation of wax precipitation {{have been reported in the}} literature (Barker and Henderson 1969; Chen et al. 2009). A literature review (Dalirsefat and Feyzi 2007) indicates that the models for wax precipitation have been developed by two different approaches. The first important approach for modeling of wax precipitation uses a cubic equation of state (EOS) for vapor–liquid equilibrium and an activity coefficient model for solid–liquid equilibrium. These models are based on solid solution (SS) theory which assumes that all the components in the solid phase are miscible in all proportions (Won 1968, 1989; Hansen et al. 1988; Pedersen et al. 1991; Zuo et al. 2001; Ji et al. 2004). Chen et al. (2009) proposed new correlations for the melting points and solid–solid transition temperatures of treated paraffin based on the experimental results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). They first estimated the required thermodynamic properties of pure n-paraffin and then a new approach based on the UNIQUAC equation was described. Finally, the impact of pressure on wax phase equilibrium was studied. The second approach based on a multi-solid (MS) phase model uses only an EOS for all phases in equilibrium. In fact, an EOS is used directly for vapor–liquid equilibrium, and solid phase is described indirectly from the EOS by fugacity ratio. The multi-solid (MS) phase model assumes that each pure or pseudo-component precipitate constitutes a separate solid phase which is not miscible with other solid phases (Lira-Galeana et al. 1996; Pan and Firoozabadi 1997; Nichita et al. 2001; Escobar-Remolina 2006; Dalirsefat and Feyzi 2007). The thermodynamic models are developed based on complex properties, such as interaction coefficient, critical properties, acentric factor, solubility parameter, and molecular weight. They are not specified for long chain waxes in crude oil. In order to develop a thermodynamic model for modeling wax phase behavior in crude oils, a powerful method is necessary. The perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theoretical (PC-SAFT) equation of state is especially useful for modeling phase behavior of complex structure, such as wax in crude oil. Recently, the asphaltene precipitation in Iranian crude oils was investigated by using the PC-SAFT equation of state (Sedghi and Goual 2014; Punnapala and Vargas 2013; María 2014; Panuganti et al. 2012; Leekumjorn and Krejbjerg 2013; Jafari Behbahani et al. 2011 a, b, c, 2012, 2013 a, b, c, 2014 a, b, c, 2015). The effect of wax inhibitors on pour point and rheological properties of Iranian waxy crude oils were investigated (Jafari Ansaroudi et al. 2013; Jafari Behbahani 2008, 2014 a, b). In this work, a PC-SAFT model has been proposed to predict the wax appearance temperature and the amount of precipitated wax. A new approach for estimation of PC-SAFT parameters of wax precipitation in crude oil has been proposed in this work. In order to compare the performance of the PC-SAFT model, the wax precipitation experimental data obtained in this work and reported in the literature were correlated using previous models such as solid solution and multi-solid phase models. Also, the pour points and viscosity of the studied crude oil were measured at different concentrations of flow improvers.|$|R
