40|$|In 2015, the EU {{connected}} 12. 8 GW of new {{wind energy}} capacity, or 44 % of total power capacity installations, for a cumulative wind capacity of 141. 6 GW {{at the end}} of the year. The total <b>net</b> <b>installed</b> <b>power</b> capacity (including wind energy) increased by 11 GW, reaching 908 GW. Since 2000, 30 % of new generating capacity installed has been wind power [1]. In 2015, wind energy generated 279 TWh of electricity meeting over 9. 3 % of EU power demand [2]. The EU programmes Horizon 2020, FP 7, and Eureka funded wind Research and Innovation (R&I) projects that started in 2015 with 91. 9 million EUR (100 million USD). In addition, two demonstration projects totaling 1, 182. 9 million EUR (199 million USD) of public funding under the NER 300 programme reached final investment decision in 2015. NER 300 is a financing instrument managed jointly by the European Commission, European Investment Bank, and Member States. JRC. C. 7 -Knowledge for the Energy Unio...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{emission}} levels from construction equipment {{are an important}} factor in the determination of the level of noise exposure of construction workers and the neighbourhood. This paper presents: (1) an investigation of the noise {{emission levels}} generated from typical earthwork construction equipment, that is, excavators and compactors; (2) a comparison between the noise emission level obtained from local equipment and the noise emission level given by the United Kingdom standard BS 5228 : 2009. Noise emission levels of 50 excavators and 25 compactors with various power levels and ages were obtained from on-site measurements. About 74 % and 48 % of the excavators measured in this study were shown to have noise emission levels below the limits specified by the Department of Environment (DOE) Malaysia and European Directive 2005 / 88 /EC respectively, while 52 % of compactors achieved levels below the EC limits. There is also a strong relationship between the mean sound pressure level and the age factor but an insignificant relationship with increases in <b>net</b> <b>installed</b> <b>power.</b> A comparison of measured data with BS 5228 data indicated that statistically only new data in BS 5228 : 2009 have insignificant differences from measured data. With these results new data in BS 5228 : 2009 can be used with confidence by environmental impact assessment (EIA) practitioners during the prediction of noise at the planning stage...|$|E

50|$|In North America, Enel Green Power has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 786 MW across four technologies. In the United States Enel Green Power owns more than 60 hydroelectric plants (313 MW of installed capacity), 21 wind farms (378 MW of <b>net</b> <b>installed),</b> and 2 geothermal plants (47 MW of <b>net</b> <b>installed).</b> In Canada {{it has a}} biomass plant (21 MW of <b>net</b> <b>installed</b> capacity) and a wind farm (27 MW of <b>net</b> <b>installed</b> capacity). EGP started operations of the first hybrid solar-geothermal plant at the Stillwater site in Nevada. 17 MW of geothermal are also in development in Cove Fort. Enel Green Power completed {{at the end of}} 2011 the 200 MW Caney River wind farm in Kansas, and initiated construction of the 150 MW Rocky Ridge plant in Oklahoma. In 2016, Enel Green Power began construction of the Rock Creek 300 MW wind farm in Atchison County, Missouri.|$|R
