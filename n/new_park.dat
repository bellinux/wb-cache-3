The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} finds in the Taynton Limestone Formation, in 1939 Sidney Hugh Reynolds {{referred}} remains to Megalosaurus {{that had been}} found in the older Chipping Norton Limestone Formation dating from the early Bathonian, about thirty single teeth and bones. Though the age disparity makes it problematic to assume an identity with Megalosaurus bucklandii, in 2009 Benson could not establish any relevant anatomical differences with M. bucklandii among the remains found at one site, the <b>New</b> <b>Park</b> Quarry, and therefore affirmed the reference to that species. However, in another site, the Oakham Quarry, the material contained one bone, an ilium, that was clearly dissimilar.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1999, the St. Louis Cardinals began {{pushing for the}} {{construction}} of a new Busch Stadium as part of a broader trend in Major League Baseball toward stadium building. In early 2002, plans for a <b>new</b> <b>park</b> were settled among state and local leaders and Cardinals owners. According to an agreement in which the state and city would issue bonds for construction, the Cardinals agreed to build a multipurpose development known as St. Louis Ballpark Village on part of the site of Busch Memorial Stadium. The new stadium opened in 2006, and groundbreaking for Ballpark Village took place in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1905 {{the area}} was home to the Amphitheatre Auditorium, which claimed the second largest stage in the United States and showcased many of the day's best actors. The structure, located {{at the corner of}} 4th and Hill Streets, was razed after its owner, William Norton, Jr., died. Another form of {{entertainment}} in {{the area was}} baseball, with the game first being played by 1860 and an early ballpark at Fourth and Ormsby emerging after the Civil War. By 1875, a <b>new</b> <b>park</b> had been built near St. James Court.|$|E

5|$|Galen Clark was {{appointed}} by the commission as the Grant's first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners {{had the authority to}} evict homesteaders (which included Hutchings). The issue was not settled until 1872 when the homesteader land holdings were invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Clark and the reigning commissioners were ousted in 1880, this dispute also reaching the Supreme Court in 1880. The two Supreme Court decisions affecting management of the Yosemite Grant are considered important precedents in land management law. Hutchings became the <b>new</b> <b>park</b> guardian.|$|E
5|$|Having {{obtained}} the Saltwellgate estate, the council contacted local ornithologist and landscaper John Hancock {{and asked him}} to submit designs for the <b>new</b> <b>park.</b> When Hancock refused, citing the pressure of his existing work, the park committee retained Edward Kemp at four guineas a day until his plans were submitted and approved in February 1876. Kemp's plans were implemented {{over a period of years}} by borough surveyor James Bowyer at a cost of around £11,000. Original plans to officially open the park on Whit Monday 1876 were not realised, and the park was never officially opened, but nonetheless, public usage began in late 1876.|$|E
5|$|The station depot {{remained}} in {{use by the}} Erie until October 1960, when that was folded into the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, which itself would fold in April 1976, as it was absorbed into the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). Conrail maintained passenger services until 1983, when that job {{was taken over by}} Metro-North Railroad. On April 18, 1983, the last passenger train left the Harriman station, as Conrail and Metro-North abandoned the tracks in favor of using the Graham Line (a high-speed freight line) for passenger and freight service. At that time, a <b>new</b> <b>park</b> & ride off of New York State Route 17 in Harriman opened for the newly realigned passenger service along the ex-Graham Line.|$|E

5|$|Although {{reasonably}} well used, it was unpopular with the public, who objected to being obliged to pay tolls to use it. On 4 July 1857, {{almost a year}} before the bridge's opening, a demonstration against the tolls attracted 6,000 residents. Concerns were raised in Parliament that poorer industrial workers in Chelsea, which had no large parks of its own, would be unable to afford to use the <b>new</b> <b>park</b> in Battersea. Bowing to public pressure, shortly after the bridge opened Parliament declared it free to use for pedestrians on Sundays, and in 1875 it was also made toll-free on public holidays. Additionally, because the main lights were only turned on when Queen Victoria was staying in London, it was poorly used at night. Despite this, the new Battersea Park was extremely popular, particularly the sporting facilities; on 9 January 1864 the park staged the world's first official game of association football.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester was {{involved}} in a brief skirmish with the Scots on 23June, the day before the main battle. While the king considered whether to camp for the night or to engage the Scots immediately, Gloucester and Hereford – either through insubordination or a misunderstanding – charged directly into the place called the <b>New</b> <b>Park,</b> where the Scots were encamped. The English immediately ran into difficulties, and Hereford's cousin Henry de Bohun was killed by King Robert the Bruce. It was perhaps during the subsequent retreat that Gloucester was thrown off his horse, but managed to escape unharmed. The next day the English were still not entirely decided on the course of action. While Gloucester took the part of certain experienced captains, recommending that Edward avoid battle that day, the younger men surrounding the king labelled this lethargic and cowardly, and advised attack. According to the Vita Edwardi, when Edward grew angry and accused Gloucester of treason, the earl forcefully replied that he would prove his loyalty on the field of battle.|$|E
5|$|In , the Dodgers {{moved from}} the Los Angeles Coliseum, which had a 250-foot left field line, to pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium. The <b>new</b> <b>park</b> had a large foul {{territory}} and a comparatively poor hitting background. Koufax was an immediate beneficiary of the change, lowering his home ERA from 4.29 to 1.75. On June 30 against the expansion New York Mets, Koufax threw his first no-hitter. In the first inning of that game, Koufax struck out three batters on nine pitches to become the sixth National League pitcher and the 11th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish a nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning. With the no-hitter, a 4-2 record, 73 strikeouts, and a 1.23 ERA for June, he was named Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award. It {{would be the only}} time in his career he earned this distinction.|$|E

5|$|In 1942 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought 1,261acres (510ha), {{including}} the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000. Ricketts Glen State Park opened in 1944. The state bought {{a total of}} 16,000acres (6,500ha) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about 10,000acres (4,000ha) from the Ricketts family and about 3,000acres (1,200ha) acquired from others. A 1947 newspaper article estimated that the <b>new</b> <b>park</b> would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. The Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls was built at this time.|$|E
5|$|Innovation Park and Ignition Park, dual-certified {{technology}} parks, {{have already}} attracted technology businesses to South Bend. Located {{across the street}} from the University of Notre Dame, Innovation Park was completed in 2009 and houses innovative researchers from companies and the university. Ignition Park, located just south of the downtown area, is planned to become home to 3 million square feet of high tech space on 140 acres of land previously owned by the Studebaker Corporation. The first tenant, Data Realty, moved into the location in the fall of 2012. The second building in the <b>new</b> <b>park</b> will be used as a research and testing facility for massive turbo machinery as part of a partnership between the city, General Electric, Great Lakes Capital, Indiana Michigan Power, University of Notre Dame, and the state of Indiana. This project began construction in 2015 and is expected to have an economic impact of $15 million annually.|$|E
5|$|Like Yellowstone National Park before it, Yosemite National Park was {{at first}} {{administered}} by various units of the United States Army. Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the <b>new</b> <b>park</b> on May 19, 1891, and set up Camp A.E. Wood (now the Wawona Campground) in Wawona. Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park. Approximately 100,000 sheep were illegally led into Yosemite's high meadows each year. The Army lacked legal authority to arrest the herders, but instead escorted them several days' hike from their flock, which left the sheep vulnerable. By the late 1890s sheep grazing {{was no longer a}} problem, but at least one herder continued to graze his sheep in the park into the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Pennsylvania {{released}} $700,000 {{to design}} repairs {{on the remaining}} towers and plan development of the <b>new</b> <b>park</b> facilities in June 2005. In late 2005, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) put forward an $8million proposal for a new observation deck and visitors' center, with plans to allow access to the bridge and a hiking trail giving views of the fallen towers. The Kinzua Sky Walk was opened on September 15, 2011 in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Sky Walk consists of a pedestrian walkway to an observation deck with a glass floor {{at the end of}} the bridge that allows views of the bridge and the valley directly below. The walkway cost $4.3million to construct, but is estimated to bring in $11.5million in tourism revenue for the region.|$|E
5|$|The Stonesfield Slate {{material}} {{contains no}} neck vertebrae; {{but a single}} broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the <b>New</b> <b>Park</b> Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous, with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the diapophysis, the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a hyposphene–hypantrum complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the <b>New</b> <b>Park</b> Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests {{the presence of a}} crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing {{more than half of the}} total vertebral height.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began on}} 23 June as the English army {{attempted}} to force {{its way across}} the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of <b>New</b> <b>Park.</b> Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − {{at the back of his}} army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.|$|E
