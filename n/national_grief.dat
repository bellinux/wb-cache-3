25|$|As {{with the}} century just past, {{the first major}} event {{of the new century}} at the church was an {{observance}} of <b>national</b> <b>grief.</b> On the evening of September 11, 2001, it was opened to all members of the community for impromptu services in the wake of that day's terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.|$|E
500|$|In {{the cities}} where the train stopped, 1.5million people viewed Lincoln in his coffin. Aboard {{the train was}} Clarence Depew, {{president}} of the New York Central Railroad, who said, [...] "As we sped over the rails at night, the scene was the most pathetic ever witnessed. At every crossroads the glare of innumerable torches illuminated the whole population, kneeling on the ground." [...] Dorothy Kunhardt called the funeral train's journey [...] "the mightiest outpouring of <b>national</b> <b>grief</b> the world had yet seen." ...|$|E
500|$|The brief pause from {{politics}} out of <b>national</b> <b>grief</b> at Taylor's death did not abate the crisis. Texas {{had attempted to}} assert its authority in New Mexico territory, and the state's governor, Peter H. Bell, had sent belligerent letters to President Taylor. Fillmore received another such after becoming president. [...] He reinforced federal troops in the area, and warned Bell to keep the peace. By July 31, Clay's bill was effectively dead, as all the significant provisions had been deleted by amendment other than the organization of Utah Territory—one wag put it that the [...] "Mormons" [...] were the only remaining passengers on the Omnibus. Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas then stepped to the fore, with Clay's agreement, proposing to break the Omnibus into individual bills that could be passed piecemeal. Fillmore endorsed this strategy, with the Omnibus to become (as it proved) five bills.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the assassination, Lyndon B. Johnson made an address to Congress saying that [...] "No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long." [...] The wave of <b>national</b> <b>grief</b> following the assassination gave enormous momentum to Johnson's promise to carry out Kennedy's plans and his policy of seizing Kennedy's legacy to give momentum to his legislative agenda.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{before the}} end of the war, {{memorials}} became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of <b>national</b> <b>grief.</b> To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word [...] "cenotaph", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means [...] "empty tomb".|$|E
2500|$|The brief pause from {{politics}} out of <b>national</b> <b>grief</b> at Taylor's death did not abate {{a crisis that}} developed over the land acquired after the Mexican–American War in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Aside from the issue of slavery in the territories, Taylor had faced four other major issues: demands that California be admitted to the Union, disputes over the Texas-New Mexico border, growing Northern opposition to the Washington D.C. slave trade, and Southern dissatisfaction with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. California, which extend across the western third of Mexican Cession, and whose population had grown larger than that of Delaware or Florida, was seeking immediate statehood. Texas claimed all of the Mexican Cession east of the Rio Grande, including parts of the former Mexican state of New Mexico that it had never exercised [...] "de facto" [...] control over, complicating the establishment of territorial governments there. The Washington, D.C. slave trade angered many in the North, who viewed the presence of slavery in the capital as a blemish on the nation. Disputes around fugitive slaves had grown since 1830 due to the improving means of transportation, as escaped slaves used improved roads, railroads, and ships to escape. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 had granted jurisdiction to all state and federal judges over cases regarding fugitive slaves, but several Northern states, dissatisfied {{by the lack of}} due process in these cases, had passed personal liberty laws that made it more difficult to return alleged fugitive slaves to the South. All of these issues would remain unsolved when Fillmore took office.|$|E

2500|$|In 1885, Gordon {{achieved}} the martyrdom {{he had been}} seeking at Khartoum as the British press portrayed him as a saintly Christian hero and martyr who had died nobly resisting the Islamic onslaught of the Mahdi. As late as 1901 {{on the anniversary of}} Gordon's death, The Times wrote in a leader (editorial) that Gordon was [...] "that solitary figure holding aloft the flag of England {{in the face of the}} dark hordes of Islam". Gordon's death caused a huge wave of <b>national</b> <b>grief</b> all over Britain with 13 March 1885 being set aside as a day of mourning for the [...] "fallen hero of Khartoum". In a sermon, the Bishop of Chichester stated: [...] "Nations who envied our greatness rejoiced now at our weakness and our inability to protect our trusted servant. Scorn and reproach were cast upon us, and would we plead that it was undeserved? No; the conscience of the nation felt that a strain rested upon it". Baring [...] who deeply disliked Gordon [...] wrote that because of the [...] "national hysteria" [...] caused by Gordon's death, that saying anything critical about him at present would be equal to questioning Christianity. Stones were thrown at the windows at 10 Downing Street as Gladstone was denounced as the [...] "Murderer of Gordon", the Judas figure who betrayed the Christ figure Gordon. The wave of mourning was not just confined to Britain. In New York, Paris and Berlin, pictures of Gordon appeared in shop windows with black lining as all over the West the fallen general was seen as a Christ-like man who sacrificed himself resisting the advance of Islam.|$|E

60|$|The {{boat was}} almost as large {{as those of the}} Hudson, but it was not so lavishly splendid, though it had {{everything}} that could minister to the comfort and self-respect of the passengers. These were of all nations, but chiefly Americans, with some French Canadians. The former gathered on the forward promenade, enjoying what little of the landscape the growing night left visible, and the latter made society after their manner in the saloon. They were plain-looking men and women, mostly, and provincial, it was evident, to their inmost hearts; provincial in origin, provincial by inheritance, by all their circumstances, social and political. Their relation with France was not a proud one, but it was not like submersion by the slip-slop of English colonial loyalty; yet they seem to be troubled by no memories of their hundred years' dominion of the land that they rescued from, the wilderness, and that was wrested from them by war. It is a strange fate for any people thus to have been cut off from the parent-country, and abandoned to whatever destiny their conquerors chose to reserve for them; and if each of the race wore the sadness and strangeness of that fate in his countenance it would not be wonderful. Perhaps it is wonderful that none of them shows anything of the kind. In their desertion they have multiplied and prospered; they may have a <b>national</b> <b>grief,</b> but they hide it well; and probably they have none.|$|E

50|$|The Montville Memorial Precinct is {{important}} in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being associated with Australia's involvement in two world wars and with the <b>national</b> expressions of <b>grief</b> that followed.
