5|$|Jared {{tells the}} police that he was with Ricko; {{when he tries to}} suggest Tracy's death may have been an accident, the police show him the photos of Tracy's {{battered}} body. Jared aggressively confronts Ricko at the beach and Ricko confesses that Tracy's death was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> He had found her walking on the beach after the rape and she asked him to take her home. He agreed, but wanted to have sex with her first. She tried to fight him off and bit him in the process, which enraged him enough to beat her to death.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. State Department, after {{closing the}} NTSB {{investigation}} {{on the grounds}} that it was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident,</b> pursued an ICAO investigation instead. Commentators such as Johnson point out that this action was illegal, and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO, the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being subpoenaed that might have embarrassed the administration or contradicted its version of events. Unlike the NTSB, ICAO can subpoena neither persons nor documents and is dependent on the governments involved—in this incident, the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea—to supply evidence voluntarily.|$|E

25|$|Antikainen was {{allegedly}} {{killed in a}} plane crash near Arkhangelsk in October 1941. As he had openly critizised the Soviet leaders, some believe that his death was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> According to the memoir of the exile Austrian communist Ruth von Mayenburg, Antikainen stayed at the Hotel Lux in Moscow and jumped out of the window as the NKVD officers were breaking his door. It is also claimed that he was assassinated by the later head of the Soviet Union Yuri Andropov, because Antikainen tried to take his place in the Komsomol of the Soviet Karelo-Finnish Republic.|$|E

He is {{the brother of}} Lynette, who has a mental illness and {{eventually}} commits suicide, but only he knows that it was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> because of a letter that she left him. He {{is one of the}} few noughts to get into Sephy's elite school, proving his intelligence, but he suffers discrimination against him. After losing contact with Sephy, he works for the LM and helps them kidnap her. He, however, gets his old feelings back and ends up sleeping with her and then letting her escape. Callum is the father of Sephy's child, but he is hanged for his involvement in Sephy's kidnap before Callie Rose is born.|$|E
25|$|Although the McDaniels {{continue}} to believe Ben's body is {{in an area of}} the cave beyond the reach of current search capabilities, they have also entertained the possibility that his death was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> but the result of foul play. A private investigator they hired believes that his body may have been removed before any authorities were contacted, or that he may even have been murdered on land and the narrative of his disappearance fabricated as a cover story. The family believes that the suspicious, supposedly accidental, death of Vortex Spring's owner late in 2011 is related to the case. They have also criticized the local police investigation as inadequate, particularly a lie detector test passed by the employee who was the last person known to have seen Ben alive.|$|E

Once Usher begins working for them, they release the tapes anyway, which costs Conway the election. Underwood is now President-elect, but his past comes back to haunt him once again when Hammerschmidt begins investigating Zoe Barnes' death, convinced it was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> Underwood and Claire nip any potential story in the bud by convincing Stamper to [...] "confess" [...] to murdering Barnes.|$|E
500|$|Andrews found Cardozo's {{reasoning}} too narrow, {{and felt}} that the focus {{should be on the}} unreasonable act: driving down Broadway at high speed is negligent whether or <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> occurs. Such an act is wrong to the public at large, not only to those who might be injured. [...] "Due care is a duty imposed on each one of us to protect society from unnecessary danger, not to protect A, B or C alone... In an empty world, negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between man and those whom he might reasonably expect his act would injure. Rather, a relationship between him and those whom he does in fact injure. If his act has a tendency to harm some one, it harms him a mile away as surely as it does those on the scene." ...|$|E
500|$|There, at the casino, Bond {{meets with}} Kristatos and asks {{how to meet}} Columbo, not knowing that Columbo's men are {{secretly}} recording their conversation. After Columbo and his mistress, Countess Lisl von Schlaf, argue, Bond offers to escort her home with Kristatos' car and driver. The two then spend the night together. In the morning Lisl and Bond are ambushed by Locque and Lisl is killed. [...] Bond is captured by Columbo's men before Locque can kill him; Columbo then tells Bond that Locque was actually hired by Kristatos, who is working for the KGB to retrieve the ATAC. Bond accompanies Columbo and his crew on a raid on one of Kristatos' opium-processing warehouses in Albania, where Bond uncovers naval mines {{similar to the one}} that sank the St Georges, suggesting it was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> After the base is destroyed, Bond chases Locque and kills him.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{critic of}} the play was diarist Samuel Pepys, who wrote in 1662: [...] "it is a play of itself the worst that I ever heard in my life." [...] Poet John Dryden wrote 10 years later in praise of the play and its comic character Mercutio: [...] "Shakespear show'd {{the best of his}} skill in his Mercutio, and he said himself, that he was forc'd to kill him in the third Act, to prevent being killed by him." [...] Criticism of the play in the 18th century was less sparse, but no less divided. Publisher Nicholas Rowe was the first critic to ponder the theme of the play, which he saw as the just punishment of the two feuding families. In mid-century, writer Charles Gildon and philosopher Lord Kames argued that the play was a failure in that it did not follow the classical rules of drama: the tragedy must occur because of some character flaw, <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> of fate. Writer and critic Samuel Johnson, however, considered it one of Shakespeare's [...] "most pleasing" [...] plays.|$|E
500|$|Payá's {{daughter}} Rosa María {{stated that}} her father died after the rental car {{in which he was}} traveling was rammed several times by another car. Payá's son Oswaldo added that his father had received numerous death threats and stated that the accident's survivors had reported that the car had been deliberately driven off the road. [...] The official statement by the Cuban government said that the driver lost control of the vehicle and collided with a tree. The MCL stated that [...] "the circumstances of these deaths have not been cleared up and are open to hypothesis" [...] and demanded a [...] "transparent" [...] inquiry into the accident. On 27 July, the Cuban Interior Ministry forwarded an official report to foreign press, blaming driver error and quoting Carromero as saying that the car had skidded off the road due to poor road conditions and bad weather. Payá's widow rejected the report, stating that the crash was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> and that a government report could not be trusted.|$|E
