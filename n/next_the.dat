The main {{entrance to the}} castle was the Gate <b>next</b> <b>the</b> Sea, next to the castle's tidal dock that allowed it to be supplied directly by sea. The dock was protected by a wall later named the Gunners Walk and a firing platform that may have housed a trebuchet siege engine during the medieval period. The Gate <b>next</b> <b>the</b> Sea led into an outer barbican, protected by a drawbridge, arrow slits and murder-holes, leading on into the outer ward.|$|E

The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E

Two diamond interchanges at 700North and 2100North occur as the freeway approaches Davis County. Past 2100North, the freeway enters rural Salt Lake County, and the road curves to the northwest. An interchange at Legacy Parkway gives northbound I-215 motorists and southbound Legacy Parkway motorists their respective connections. The road turns east and loses one lane in each direction. There is a diamond interchange at SR-68 before the highway merges into northbound I-15 in North Salt Lake.|$|E

5|$|A vast {{marshland}} {{could only}} have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25million and 2million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the <b>next.</b> <b>The</b> length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.|$|E
5|$|As Hammurabi was {{assisted}} {{during the}} war in the south by his allies from the north such as Yamhad and Mari, the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest. Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling the unrest and soon after crushing Eshnunna. <b>Next</b> <b>the</b> Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon's former ally Mari, although {{it is possible that the}} 'conquest' of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas.

5|$|Blakeney Point, {{like most}} of the {{northern}} part of the marshes in this area, is part of the parish of Cley <b>next</b> <b>the</b> Sea. The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne. It is approximately 6.4km (4mi) long, and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20m (65ft) in width and up to 10m (33feet) high. It has been estimated that there are 2.3millionm3 (82millionft3) of shingle in the spit, 97per cent of which is derived from flint.|$|E

The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the lake in the hamlet of Melrose Park, where NY38 meets NY437 by way of a traffic circle. At this point, NY437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY38 becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue toward the city of Auburn.|$|E
