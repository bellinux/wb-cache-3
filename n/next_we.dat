Here the date 1604 is inscribed. <b>Next,</b> <b>we</b> see the young Jesus engaged in discussions with the two lawyers. Then Jesus is shown holding the hands of two lost souls who he has rescued from the open mouth of hell ("Abandon all hope ye who enter here") from which flames emerge and other lost souls writhe in agony, including the legendary Kattell Gollet. A demon sits above the mouth orchestrating proceedings and another with horns is with the others in the mouth itself.|$|E

50|$|<b>Next</b> Time <b>We</b> Love is a 1936 melodrama film {{directed}} by Edward H. Griffith and starring Margaret Sullavan, James Stewart and Ray Milland. The adapted screenplay was by Melville Baker, with an uncredited Preston Sturges and Doris Anderson, based on Ursula Parrott's 1935 novel <b>Next</b> Time <b>We</b> Live, which was serialized before publication as Say Goodbye Again. The film {{is also known}} as <b>Next</b> Time <b>We</b> Live in the U.K.|$|R
50|$|Ursula Parrott was {{a popular}} novelist of the time, several of whose novels were turned into films, most {{prominently}} Ex-Wife which became the 1930 movie The Divorcee. The story which provided the source material for <b>Next</b> Time <b>We</b> Love was first serialized as Say Goodbye Again in McCall's from December 1934 to April 1935, and was then published as a novel called <b>Next</b> Time <b>We</b> Live, which was also the working title of the film. There was debate about what to call the movie, with studio executives concerned that a motion picture entitled <b>Next</b> Time <b>We</b> Live might be misinterpreted as being about reincarnation, while director Edward H. Griffith wanted to avoid losing the publicity value of using the novel's title. Although the film was released as <b>Next</b> Time <b>We</b> Love, the alternate title <b>Next</b> Time <b>We</b> Live was used for its British release.|$|R

25|$|Decryption is {{performed}} {{by going to}} the row in the table corresponding to the key, finding the position of the ciphertext letter in this row, and then using the column's label as the plaintext. For example, in row L (from LEMON), the ciphertext L appears in column A, which is the first plaintext letter. <b>Next</b> <b>we</b> go to row E (from LEMON), locate the ciphertext X which is found in column T, thus T is the second plaintext letter.|$|E
25|$|The {{momentum}} equations {{are written}} {{primarily for the}} generic trajectory of a packet of flow travelling on a horizontal plane and taken at a certain elapsed time called t. The position of the packet {{is defined by the}} distance on the trajectory s=s(t) which it has travelled by time t. In reality, however, the trajectory is the outcome of the balance of forces upon the particle. In this section we assume to know it from the start for convenience of representation. When we consider the motion determined by the forces selected <b>next,</b> <b>we</b> will have clues of which type of trajectory fits the particular balance of forces.|$|E
25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable.

After the first few letters one can often guess the rest of the word. English text has between 0.6 and 1.3 bits of entropy per character of the message.|$|E

On the frieze below we see the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple with Jesus standing on a small stool and two depictions dealing with baptism.

Finally Jesus is shown holding discussions with the elders in the temple.|$|E
