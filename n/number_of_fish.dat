5|$|In 2010 a new fish counter was {{commissioned}} for the Shimna {{river and the}} initial results indicated that fish numbers had reached approximately 76% of the conservation limit (the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> required to spawn) in the 2010 season. This is an improvement from the estimated 12% in 2009.

The actual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> returning to the river each year to spawn, prior to European settlement, is uncertain {{due to the lack}} of records. During the first half of the 20th century, before damming, the fall chinook salmon run was estimated at anywhere between 19,000 and 75,500. The spring chinook and coho salmon runs were about 10,000 each and the annual steelhead run was about 50,000.|$|E

5|$|Rainbow trout, chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific Lamprey are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. Overall, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Some Mauritanian {{dolphins}} {{cooperate with}} human fishermen. The dolphins drive {{a school of}} fish towards the shore, where humans await with nets. In the confusion of casting nets, the dolphins catch a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> as well. Intraspecies cooperative foraging has also been observed. These behaviors may also be transmitted via teaching. Controversially, Rendell and Whitehead have proposed a structure {{for the study of}} cetacean culture. Similar cases have been observed in Laguna, Santa Catarina in Brazil since during 19th century as well.|$|E
5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E

5|$|The {{streams and}} lakes around Adams offer a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> for the angler to seek out. The two most common species, eastern brook trout and rainbow trout (Columbia River redband trout), are {{in nearly every}} lake and stream. Brown trout and {{cutthroat}} trout appear {{in most of the}} lakes in the High Lakes Area and three lakes are home to tiger trout. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of trout. Bull trout {{can be found in the}} upper reaches of the Klickitat and Lewis Rivers. Westslope cutthroat trout can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the Cispus River. Whitefish can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.|$|E

40|$|Agriculture Economic Dept., College of Agriculture, King Saud Univ., P. O. Box 2460, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia. Saudi {{agriculture}} policies aim {{to increase}} local production of main agriculture commodities such as {{red and white}} meats including fish. The gap between production and consumption <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> increased, so imported fish was 66000 tons in 1995. The traditional fishery sector considered as main source <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> which yield 79 % of total marine fishery yield on average period 1988 - 1996. The limiting of traditional fishery resource availability, as <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> efforts and fishing days, at Red Sea and Arabian Gulf need to be studied for its efficient use and impacts on fishing yield. For the limited data available, the study methodology is based on derivation of stochastic production function frontier with <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> efforts and fishing days as the only inputs available in statistics available. Using that form of production function will separate the error term to show the technical inefficiency of production.
