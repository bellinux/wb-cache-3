50|$|Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke {{were two}} {{physicians}} of the 1800s whose patients were {{evidence of the}} double dissociation between generating language (speech) and understanding language. Broca's patients could no longer speak but could understand language (non-fluent aphasia) while Wernicke's patients could no longer understand language but could produce jumbled speech (fluent aphasia). Post-mortems revealed lesions in separate {{areas of the brain}} in each case (now referred to as Broca's area and Wernicke's area respectively). Although the <b>neurophysiology</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> is now known to be more complicated than described by Broca or Wernicke, this classic double dissociation acted to begin modern neuropsychological investigation of language.|$|E
40|$|David Caplan’s {{introduction}} {{into the}} field of aphasia has some very good points. It is well written. It is comprehensive in that it covers historical thinking as well as current work. Recent developments in the <b>neurophysiology</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> {{and also in the}} field of psycholinguistics are discussed. The exposition is theory based and theories are eva-luated against each other with reference to a particular set of data. In this respect the author has been selective and I think rightly so. He presents sample groups of studies to discuss them in depth. This gives the reader a good sense of how phenomena in this field are appoached. He may not have made the best selection in every single case, but I think the approach as such is well taken. The title of the book reflects its organization. ’Neurolinguistics ’ is defined as ’the study of language brain relationships ’. Its aim is to find relations between brain damage and behavioural dysfunction. The aphasia work carried out, mostly by neurologists, between 1860 an...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{evaluation}} of language function and basic neuroscience {{research into the}} <b>neurophysiology</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> are tied together. Whole-head MEG systems readily facilitate detailed spatiotemporal characterization of language processes. A fair amount of information is available about the cortical sequence of word perception and comprehension in the auditory and visual domain, which can be applied for clinical use. Language production remains, at present, somewhat less well charted. In clinical practice, the most obvious needs are noninvasive {{evaluation of}} the language-dominant hemisphere and mapping of areas involved in language performance to assist surgery. Multiple experimental designs and analysis approaches have been proposed for estimation of language lateralization. Some {{of them have been}} compared with the invasive Wada test and need to be tested further. Development of approaches for more comprehensive pre-sur-gical characterization of language cortex should build on basic neuroscience research, making use of parametric designs that allow func-tional mapping. Studies of the neural basis of developmental and acquired language disorders, such as dyslexia, stuttering, and aphasia can currently be regarded more as clinical or basic neuroscience research rather than as clinical routine. Such investigations may even-tually provide tools for development of individually targeted training procedures and their objective evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The nativist view <b>of</b> <b>language</b> {{holds that}} the {{principal}} foundation of linguistic competence is an innate faculty of linguistic cognition. In this paper, close scrutiny is given to nativism’s fundamental commitments {{in the area of}} metaphysics. In the course of this exploration it is argued that any minimally defensible variety of nativism is, for better or worse, committed to two theses: linguistic competence is grounded in a faculty of linguistic cognition that is (i) embodied and (ii) whose operating rules are represented in the <b>neurophysiology</b> <b>of</b> human <b>language</b> users...|$|R

Whilst more mundane concepts of timing, sequencing, spatial organisation, and Gestalt principles of perception are well known and applied, the nature of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and the responsibility of the sender in that regard, as well as the maintenance of simplistic notions of developmental brain organization and hemisphericity for language rather than the <b>neurophysiology</b> <b>of</b> embodied <b>language</b> as an example, still inform pre-K- 3 curriculum.

40|$|International audienceObtaining a <b>neurophysiology</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> {{production}} {{is a complex}} endeavour which, at present, is in its “infancy”. It will require the integration of long-standing psycholinguistic models and phenomena with the anatomical and dynamical constraints of neural coding. In our target article [Strijkers, K., & Costa, A. (2016). The cortical dynamics of speaking: Present shortcomings and future avenues. Language, Cognition and Neuroscience, 1 – 20. doi: 10. 1080 / 23273798. 2015. 1120878; henceforth S&C], we hypothesized that one promising way of doing so is by perceiving words as cortical assemblies in a proactive brain. Conceptualizing word production as such means {{that some of the}} traditional assumptions underlying psycholinguistic models will need to be re-assessed (or at least extended) in light of this novel perspective. However, {{it does not mean that}} it is the only conceivable way to integrate language and the brain nor that neuroscience should be prioritized over psycholinguistics. Rather, its importance lies in making the linking hypothesizes between linguistic function and neural code explicit so that we can empirically test the integration of both domains. Likely, some of the linking hypotheses proposed in S&C may be proven wrong, but more importantly, others may prove to be an advance in the right direction towards a mechanistic framework of the cortical dynamics of speaking...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{findings}} in the <b>neurophysiology</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> production have provided {{a detailed description of}} the brain network underlying this behavior, as well as some indications about the timing of operations. Despite their invaluable utility, these data generally suffer from limitations either in terms of temporal resolution, or in terms of spatial localization. In addition, studying the neural basis of speech is complicated by the presence of articulation artifacts such as electro-myographic activity that interferes with the neural signal. These difficulties are virtually absent in a powerful albeit much less frequent methodology, namely the recording of intra-cranial brain activity (intra-cranial electroencephalography). Such recordings are only possible under very specific clinical circumstances requiring functional mapping before brain surgery, most notably in patients that suffer from pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Here we review the research conducted with this methodology in the field of language production, with explicit consideration of its advantages and drawbacks. The available evidence is shown to be diverse, both in terms of the tasks and the cognitive processes tested and in terms of the brain localizations being studied. Still, the review provides valuable information for characterizing the dynamics of the neural events occurring in the language production network. Following modality specific activities (in auditory or visual cortices), there is a convergence of activity in superior temporal sulcus, which is a plausible neural correlate of phonological encoding processes. Later, between 500 and 800 ms, inferior frontal gyrus (around Broca's area) is involved. Peri-rolandic areas are recruited in the two modalities relatively early (200 - 500 ms window), suggesting a very early involvement of (pre-) motor processes. We discuss how some of these findings may be at odds with conclusions drawn from available meta-analysis of language production studies...|$|E
