50|$|In 2001, the New York City Transit Authority started {{disposing}} of retired subway cars by dumping them at sea to create artificial reefs, {{with the intention}} of promoting marine life. This option was chosen because it was less expensive than removing asbestos from the cars; the asbestos was determined to not be a hazard in the ocean. Further, the artificial reefs would provide environmental and economic benefits, such as providing shelter for marine animals and creating <b>new</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities.</b> The first reef constructed was Redbird Reef in Delaware. Eventually, multiple states received retired subway cars for reefs. The program was discontinued in 2010, after more than 2,500 cars were reefed, because newer cars contained more plastic, which was too expensive to economically remove before reefing.|$|E
40|$|A {{large part}} of fishing {{behavior}} is choosing where to fish. Trawl skippers usually choose between known <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities,</b> which are observed as groups of trawls that are conducted in the same portion of a fishing ground, or go exploratory fishing. We outline a simple clustering method based on Euclidean distances between trawls that offers a more realistic way of defining <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities</b> than grid cells or statistical areas. The resulting cluster tree of trawls is divided into individual groups of trawls (<b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities)</b> using a recommended cut point. Our method correctly classified simulated trawls into <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities.</b> <b>Fishing</b> <b>opportunities</b> were obtained for vessels in the British Columbia groundfish trawl fishery; each vessel usually fished at a wide variety (mean 26, standard deviation 16, range 2 69) of <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Within each <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity,</b> trawls generally caught similar species. In the Argentina scallop fishery, our method was able to divide exploratory from regular fishing trawls, with obvious applications for catch-per-unit-effort calculations. Our method {{could also be used}} to detect positional errors in data from these fisheries. <b>Fishing</b> <b>opportunities</b> could provide indications of how fishermen might react to marine protected areas and to the imposition of quotas on multispecies fisheries...|$|R

50|$|In Laos, the ex-ante {{appraisal}} of the damming of a small river predicted a modest positive impact on production and livelihoods, with creation of a reservoir fishery outweighing degradation of the pre-existing river fishery. The outcome was contingent on continuation of rainfed wet season rice production and traditional farming practices, as adoption of practices involving reduced water storage in paddy fields was likely to reduce fish production considerably. Since maintaining connectivity of paddy fields and perennial water bodies is likewise important, cross-drainage culverts need to be passable to fish and the harvesting at these concentration points should be restricted. The creation of a reservoir would improve access to and convenience of fishing for those within reach, particularly in the dry season, and it would increase opportunities for specialisation in <b>fishing.</b> <b>New</b> income <b>opportunities</b> in irrigated agriculture are likely to reduce the overall level of fishing effort and increase returns, with the greatest benefits to the households most reliant on fishing.|$|R
