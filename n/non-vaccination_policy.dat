40|$|Background: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is the causative {{agent of}} the Newcastle disease, a severe disease in birds {{associated}} with substantial economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Sweden is situated along the Western European waterfowl flyway and applies a <b>non-vaccination</b> <b>policy</b> combined with directives of immediate euthanisation of NDV infected flocks. During the last decades {{there have been several}} outbreaks with NDV in poultry in Sweden. However, less is known about the virus prevalence in the wild bird population including waterfowl, a well-established reservoir of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV- 1), the paramyxovirus serotype that include pathogenic NDV. Methods: The survey constituted of 2332 samples from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), trapped {{in the southern part of}} Sweden during autumn migration in 2010. These samples were screened for APMV- 1 by real-time reverse transcription PCR, and viral strains from positive samples were isolated and characterized by sequence analysis of the fusion gene and by phylogenetic analysis. Conclusions: Twenty of these samples were positive for APMV- 1, hence a virus prevalence of 0. 9 % (95 % Confidence Interval [95 % CI]= 0. 54 %, 1. 35 %). The highest APMV- 1 prevalence was detected in juvenile Mallards sampled in November (n= 887, prevalence 1. 24 % ([95 % CI]) = 0. 67 %, 2. 24 %).

40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years {{there was an}} {{enormous}} increase in pig production in several parts of the European Union. After entering of disease agents in such areas {{it is very easy}} for them to spread and to persist in the pig population. This has resulted in a situation in which a lot of pathogens continually occur in the pig population. The size of the pig farming operations and the small geographical distance between them makes it almost impossible to eliminate most of the disease agents from the populations. On the other hand there is a development in the EU-regulations that requires more and more guarantees with respect to the absence of some pathogens in the population in a <b>non-vaccination</b> <b>policy.</b> Only countries able to comply with these requirements have free entrance to the European market. A second development in this field is the increasing interest in a high quality standard of the products {{at the end of the}} pig production chain; first of all in relation to the safety of the product linked to residues and zoonoses, but further to the meat quality and at last the emotional quality for the consumer. These developments have lead to a health control policy in swine production that is based on two different tracks: the safeguarding strategy and the controlling strategy...|$|E
40|$|Large herbivores {{in nature}} suffer from {{veterinary}} law In the Habitat Directive, Natura 2000, the EU aims at preservation, restoration and interconnection of large-scale nature reserves throughout the union. Such {{a network of}} interconnected wilderness will provide dearly needed space to large wild animals, {{many of which are}} declining or even in danger of extinction. A thousand years ago most of Europe was nature, providing space for aurochs, moose, wild horse, reindeer, wild boar, bear, wolf and lynx. What little areas remain, should be preserved. In nature restoration and preservation, large herbivores play a crucial role: they shape and maintain the landscape by selective grazing (deer, wisent), rooting the soil (wild boar) and dispersal of seeds, to name but a few ecological functions. Food availability, predators and naturally occurring diseases provide a check on herd size and keep populations healthy in the long run. Surrogate species In modern landscape restoration, surrogate species are employed by lack of wild ancestral species. Koniks and Heck cattle play the part of extinct wild horse and aurochs. Also hardened domestic species are used, like Scottish highlander, Icelandic pony and Soay sheep. Once released in a nature reserve, the animals quickly learn to fend for themselves, building up herds and thriving, where conditions allow. Also, wild species like wisent and Przewaltski horse are bred in zoos and reintroduced into their former ancestral grounds. Snake By interconnecting large areas by means of corridors, nature conservationists cherish the hope that a sufficiently large network of interbreeding populations will keep up genetic diversity. But there is a snake in this envisioned paradise recovered. The snake is called ‘veterinary law’. Veterinary authorities fear the role of wildlife in outbreaks of infectious animal diseases and often oppose establishment of corridors. Moreover, in case of an outbreak, veterinary authorities may require the killing of free-roaming herds in nature reserves. And veterinary law overrules Natura 2000. Even protected species on the verge of extinction may fall victim to this rule. Not only wild or half wild animals are to be killed, but also hundreds of thousands farm animals, even is there is an effective vaccine available. Vaccination is punished with loss of trade status and severe economic loss. Foot and Mouth Disease The Large Herbivore Foundation, a project set up by the World Wildlife Foundation, asked the Science Shop for Biology to explore the possibilities for a more nature-friendly veterinary policy. After reviewing the evidence on two very contagious infectious diseases, Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Classical Swine Fever (CSF), the Science Shop concluded that even with these two most feared diseases, a more nature friendly policy is possible, without compromising veterinary health. Most important international body is the OIE, the Organization for Animal Health. After the 2002 outbreak of FMD, the OIE amelioriated its strict <b>non-vaccination</b> <b>policy</b> in favor of the preservation of red list species, but the surrogate species and non-red list species still have to be exterminated in case of an outbreak. And there are huge financial and practical obstacles preventing the protection of wildlife. Wildlife more at risk As wildlife is more at risk from outbreaks among farm animals than to them, nature conservationists and veterinary authorities have a common interest in preventing mass outbreaks. It is recommended, that the nature conservationists support OIE’s long term eradication programme of the most threatening diseases. And they should take care to prevent direct contact of animals in nature reserves and corridors with farm animals, especially during outbreaks. In case of an outbreak among wildlife, a non-intervention policy is usually the best option. Mass vaccination or mass extermination is often unfeasible and will probably do more harm than good. In establishing the borders of nature reserves and the situation of corridors, it is recommended to take the risk of communicable diseases and the need for isolation into account. On the other hand, veterinary regulations need to be adapted in order to better protect populations of wild and half-wild animals. ...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} (CSF) has been present in Serbia {{for a long}} period of time as an endemic disease, and it occurs with lesser or greater {{intensity}} from year to year. Since it is a highly contagious disease of domestic and wild pigs, the outbreaks of the disease causes severe consequences for animal welfare, livestock production and economic losses to the national economies in countries where it occurs. Therefore, CSF has a great epizootiological and economic importance to the swine production, primarily because of trade restrictions for live pigs and pork products. CSF eradication and control programmes are generally based on vaccination strategies in countries with endemic occurrence of CSF or <b>non-vaccination</b> <b>policies</b> in contries wich successfully eradicated or are free of CSF. Whatever the general eradication stategy is in place, in the case of an outbreak of CSF the stamping-out method is used for suppression and eradication of the disease, with strict implementation of specific veterinary-sanitary measures in the infected and surveillance zones, clearly defined by legal provisions. In the period before 2006, there were certain regions in Serbia where CSF occurred almost every year, including regions where pig farming was not the primary branch of animal husbandry. Pig identification and implementation of vaccination, as well as the control of trade of pigs from infected areas to other parts of the country were not very successful. Due to the serious losses inflicted by the disease, a new Programme of CSF control was adopted in 2006, which inter alia included the obligatory identification of pigs, registration of pig holdings and free of charge vaccination of all susceptible animals in the country, as well as the implementation of other statutory measures, including obligatory evidence of veterinary activities in the national Veterinary information system. The results obtained in the period after the implementation of the Programme of CSF control (2007, 2008 and 2009) indicate a positive impact on the reduction of outbreaks of CSF, as well as on the reduction of prevalence (p< 0. 001). Also, the effectiveness of vaccination of pigs in 2007 compared to the period before and after the implementation of the Programme was the highest (97. 78 %), as well as the costs of its implementation...|$|R
