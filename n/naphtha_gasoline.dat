This study analyzes and compares the characteristics of PM emissions from <b>naphtha</b> <b>gasoline</b> PPC, ethanol PPC, methanol PPC and methanol diffusion combustion in terms of soot mass concentration, number concentration and particle size distribution in a single cylinder Scania D 13 engine, while varying the intake O 2. Intake temperature and injection pressure sweeps were also conducted. The fuels emitting the highest mass concentration of particles (Micro Soot Sensor) were gasoline and methanol followed by ethanol. The two alcohols tested emitted nucleation mode particles only, whereas gasoline emitted accumulation mode particles as well. Regarding soot mass concentration measurements; methanol never exceeded 1. 6 mg/m 3 while when operating on gasoline this value never descended below 1. 6 mg/m 3. From this result it can be concluded that the main contributor to PM mass emissions is mainly increasing CMD (Count Mean Diameter) in the accumulation mode size range, but can in diffusion combustion also be caused by a high amount of nucleation mode particles. A probable cause of higher particle number emissions, when running the engine on methanol compared to ethanol, is the corrosiveness of the fuel itself. Except for the ultra-low PM mass emitted from alcohol combustion, it is also possible to alter the EGR concentration with a higher level of freedom without having to consider the NOX - soot tradeoff...|$|E

In {{the present}} work a direct method for the {{determination}} of arsenic in petroleum derivatives has been developed, comparing {{the performance of a}} commercial transversely heated platform atomizer (THPA) with that of a transversely heated filter atomizer (THFA). The THFA results in a reduction of background absorption and an improved sensitivity as has been reported earlier for this atomizer. The mixture of 0. 1 % (m/v) Pd+ 0. 03 % (m/v) Mg+ 0. 05 % (v/v) Triton X- 100 was used as the chemical modifier for both atomizers.

The characteristic mass of 13 pg found in the THFAwas about a factor of two better than that of 28 pg obtained with the THPA; however, the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were essentially the samefor both atomizers (1. 9 and 6. 2 μg L− 1, respectively, for THPA, and 1. 8 and 5. 9 μg L− 1, respectively, for THFA) due to the increased noise observed with the THFA. A possible explanation for that is a partial blockage of the radiation from the hollow cathode lamp by the narrow inner diameter of this tube and the associated loss of radiation energy. Due to the lack of an appropriate certified reference material, recovery tests were carried out with inorganic and organic arsenic standards and the resultswere between 89 % and 111 %.

The optimum was achieved with mildly hydrotreated PL's, corresponding to a H- 2 consumption of 202 NL/kg(PL). These mildly hydrotreated PL's led to similar coke formation during co-refining as pure VGO cracking.

Due to the necessity of sunlight to provide energy for the CR 5 reaction, the production of carbon monoxide will only take place during daylight hours and 2 hours worth of carbon monoxide production along with an excess of 10 % of this amount will be stored in floating roof storage tanks. The storage of some extra carbon monoxide will keep the startup and shutdown production of petrol product constant as the sun rises and sets. The water gas shift reactions and Fischer- Tropsch reactors will operate for as long as carbon monoxide is available and will shut down once the carbon monoxide is depleted. Assuming a discount rate of 13 %, the project yields a -$ 5. 5 billion NPV over a 30 year time period. Based on this negative net present value, the plant proves to be economically unattractive. This result is primarily driven by high operating costs due to the high stress put on expensive catalysts that require frequent replacement as well as daily startup/shutdown costs. The largest negative economic factors in the plant projections are related to operating expenses. Specifically, the daily startup and shutdown costs associated with the CR 5, WGS and FT reactors are significant. A related factor is the replacement cost of catalysts due to the high amounts of stress associated with daily shutdown, which requires 1 the catalysts to be replaced every 5 years. Storage tanks for continuous operation were considered, which would require 134 storage tanks total. This option is potentially more economically attractive; however, continuous operation was still discounted because the cost of maintenance, piping equipment costs, and other logistical challenges associated with housing the storage tanks. In addition, this option still produces a negative NPV after 30 years. Finally, the compressor operation requires significant electricity, factoring into the economic unattractiveness of the operation of this plant. These variables all lead to a negative net present value and negative cash on hand throughout thirty years of operation. Consequently, unless technological advancements can be made to change the fundamental operations of the sunlight to transportation fuel plant, the investment is not recommended...|$|E

These offer {{the potential for a}} diversification of feedstocks to be used, lower greenhouse gas impacts, and lower costs. Gasification is a cardinal constituent of several of the proposed second generation paths, such as catalytic routes to diesel, <b>gasoline,</b> <b>naphtha,</b> methanol, ethanol and other alcohols, and syngas fermentation routes to ethanol. Prodigious technical procession are made that allows substantially augmented usage of biomass as a fuel. An appealing and executable possibility of biomass utilization for energy production is gasification integrated with a combined cycle. In biomass gasification, there is greater experience with gasifiers for heat and power applications than for fuels yield. This technology seems to have the hypothesis to reach utmost efficiencies based on fundamentally pristine and renewable fuel. The plants utilize low grade fuels at reasonable overall efficiencies of 35 %- 50 % based on gross heating value. Integrated Biomass Gasification Combined Cycle (IBGCC) systems supplant the conventional combustor with a gasifier and gas turbine. Biomass gasifiers have the potency to be up to twice as efficient as using conventional boilers to generate electricity. Progressive gas turbine and combined cycle technology is commercially explicated and manifested with natural gas as well as solid fuels such as coal through the use of gasification technology.

The article presents a comparative study and combined application between response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) based on design of experiment (DOE) strategy in the modeling and prediction of the research octane number (RON). In this study, DOE–CCRD full factorial design was incorporated into the ANN methodology, so the need of a large quantity of training data was avoided. ANN methodology showed a very obvious advantage over RSM for both data fitting and estimation capabilities. Based {{on the results of}} analysis of variance (ANOVA), a multiple determination coefficient of 0. 8 and 0. 99 were obtained for both RSM and ANN respectively. It has been found that by employing RSM approach coupled with ANN model based on DOE strategy, the visualization of the experimental points in three dimensional spaces can disclose qualitatively and quantitatively the activity relationships. This approach of combination of RSM–ANN–DOE has revealed its ability to solve a quadratic polynomial model involving solving, optimization, complexity and difficult relationships especially nonlinear ones may be investigated without complicated equations involved.
