On the first play of the quarter, Druckenmiller completed a 20-yard pass to Oxendine for a first down at the Tech 40-yard line. Parker ran for three yards, but Tech was forced to call a timeout before the <b>next</b> <b>play.</b> During the timeout, a light rain began to fall that would last through {{the remainder of the}} game. Coming out of the timeout, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass, but made it up on the <b>next</b> <b>play</b> by rushing for 16 yards, picking up a first down at the 41-yard line of Nebraska. This was followed by another rush by Druckenmiller, this time for nine yards.

5|$|After the post-score kickoff and return, Florida State {{began at}} its 22-yard line. Weinke {{completed}} a first-down pass to Warrick, but Warrick committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty in the process. On the <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> Weinke attempted a long pass downfield, but Tech defender Anthony Midget intercepted {{the ball at}} the Tech 41-yard line. Trailing by five, Tech's offense began a drive to potentially further cut Florida State's lead or put the Hokies in the lead themselves. After slipping {{on the field and}} taking a loss, Vick completed a 20-yard pass to Hawkins, who picked up a first down and pushed Tech to the Florida State 39-yard line. After a short rush by Kendrick, Vick scrambled to the State 21-yard line for another first down. On the <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> Vick was sacked for a seven-yard loss, but recovered the lost ground by running for 22yards on the <b>next</b> <b>play.</b> With a first down at the Seminoles' seven-yard line, Vick handed the ball to Kendrick, who ran seven yards straight ahead for a Tech touchdown, giving the Hokies the lead {{for the first time in}} the game. Again, Beamer ordered a two-point conversion attempt, but again, Florida State stopped the Hokies short. Despite that failure to pick up the two-point conversion, Tech took a 2928 lead with 2:13 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff, NC State {{returned}} {{the ball to}} the 27-yard line, where the Wolfpack began the game's first play. That play was a short run to the right. On the <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> NC State picked up the game's first first down with a rush up the middle by fullback Mal Crite. Crite picked up another first down on the <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> driving the Wolfpack inside Virginia Tech territory, but the Hokies' defense stiffened and forced the Wolfpack to punt after NC State failed to gain another first down. Tech {{returned the}} punt to its 21-yard line, where the Tech offense took over. On Virginia Tech's first offensive play, running back Maurice Williams broke free for a 77-yard run that took the Hokies inside the one-yard line of NC State. The run was the longest of Williams' career and is a Peach Bowl record for longest play from scrimmage.

The extra point was good, and Tennessee's lead was cut to 4523, but with only 4:13 remaining in the game, the game seemed out of reach for the Hokies.|$|E

5|$|The Gliders {{planned to}} {{dominate}} Mexico early, playing as aggressively against {{them as they}} had played against the Netherlands.
