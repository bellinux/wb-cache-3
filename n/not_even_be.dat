5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E
5|$|Other researchers, like Larry Martin {{believe that}} dromaeosaurids, {{along with all}} maniraptorans are not dinosaurs at all. Martin {{asserted}} for decades that birds were unrelated to maniraptorans, but in 2004 he changed his position, and now he agrees that the two are the closest of relatives. Martin believes that maniraptorans are secondarily flightless birds, and that birds evolved from non–dinosaurian archosaurs, so {{that most of the}} species formerly called theropods would now <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> classified as dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless and may <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> noticed when contact is made. Teeth may {{remain in the}} wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, {{which is similar to}} tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E

25|$|A variant form {{usually has}} a very similar {{appearance}} and meaning as its base form.

Within each organism, scale shape varies greatly according to body area, with intermediate scale forms appearing between different areas; furthermore, scale morphology may <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> constant {{within a given}} body area. To confuse things further, scale morphologies are not unique to specific taxa, and may be indistinguishable on the same area of two different species.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} neural tube {{transformation}} into structures {{that will eventually}} develop into {{the central nervous system}} is known as neurulation, the success of which is dependent on the presence of folate within the body. This process begins in the human approximately 21 days after conception, and is completed by 28 days. Thus, a woman may <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> aware of her pregnancy by the time the process of neurulation is complete, potentially causing severe consequences {{in the development of the}} fetus.|$|E
25|$|Cultural Mormon is a {{term used}} for Mormons who no longer believe some, or many, of the doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), but who self-identify as Mormon. Usually, this {{is a result of}} having been raised in the LDS Church or having {{converted}} and spent a large portion of one's life as {{an active member of the}} LDS Church. Cultural Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the church, and in some cases may <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> official members of the church.|$|E

25|$|In Banach spaces, a {{large part}} of the study {{involves}} the dual space: the space of all continuous linear maps from the space into its underlying field, so-called functionals. A Banach space can be canonically identified with a subspace of its bidual, which is the dual of its dual space. The corresponding map is an isometry but in general not onto. A general Banach space and its bidual need <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> isometrically isomorphic in any way, contrary to the finite-dimensional situation. This is explained in the dual space article.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{theoretical}} {{upper limit}} {{to the size of}} districts in STV, and they may <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> needed at all: Thomas Hare's original proposal was for a single, nationwide district. In theory, STV could allow for the election of particularly small minorities provided they secure a quota's worth of votes, if very large districts were used. The 1925 Irish Senate election used one district to elect nineteen places and the Cork Corporation used a single 21-seat local electoral area until subdivided in time for the 1967 local election.|$|E
25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of M. vivesi are other New World species of Myotis {{which are not}} adapted to piscivory, {{rather than the other}} piscivorous bats in the genus. This indicates that the adaptations to catching fish in M. vivesi and other species are the result of convergent evolution. No fossils attributable to M. vivesi have been discovered. A fossil species of Pizonyx, Pizonyx wheeleri, was named by Walter Dalquest and Daniel Patrick in 1993 from the Miocene of Texas, but according to a 1993 review by Nicholas Czaplewski, this species instead belongs to the genus Antrozous and may <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> distinct from the living species Antrozous pallidus.|$|E

25|$|The new Stockholm was {{launched}} on 10 March 1940, when World War II was already raging in Europe. Construction proceeded {{regardless of the}} war, and the ship was ready for delivery to her owners in October 1941. She completed her trial runs in the Swedish American Line livery, but ultimately the company saw no point in taking delivery of the vessel—the war had caused transatlantic services to be suspended, and {{it was possible that}} the ship could <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> safely transferred to neutral Sweden from Italy. As a result, the Stockholm was sold to the Italian government on 3 November 1941, renamed MS Sabaudia and converted to a troopship.|$|E
25|$|On January 5, 2010, after {{lobbying}} by Air Force Officers and Commanders, it {{was reported}} that the final evaluation report by the Brazilian Air Force placed the Saab Gripen NG ahead of the other contenders. The decisive factor was apparently the overall cost of the new fighters, both in terms of unit cost, and operating and maintenance costs, and the personal preference of the test pilots. Rafale was reported to <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> the second choice. It was announced in February 2011 that the decision would be further delayed due to budget cuts. And that July the decision was put off for yet another six-month extension.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of sign {{language in the}} region, including many pockets of home sign and local sign languages, such as Ghandruk Sign Language, Jhankot Sign Language, and Jumla Sign Language in Nepal, and Alipur Sign Language in India, which appear to be language isolates. There are also various Sri Lankan sign languages which may <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> related to each other. However, the urban varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal (Nepalese Sign Language), and Bangladesh are clearly related (although, for Nepalese Sign Language at least, {{it is not clear}} whether the relation is genetic, or perhaps rather one of borrowing compounded by extensive incorporation of a shared South Asian gestural base). There is disagreement whether these related varieties should be considered separate languages.|$|E
