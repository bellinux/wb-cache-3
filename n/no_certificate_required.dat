40|$|Elaborating on {{the merits}} of self-certified public key systems and message {{recovery}} signature schemes, this paper proposed a proxy signature scheme based on discrete logarithms and its variant based on elliptic curve discrete logarithms. The proposed schemes are efficient in the terms of communication overheads and computational efforts due to the following reasons: (i) The signing message is unnecessary to transmit, since the verifier can recover it from the proxy signature. (ii) The tasks of verifying the authenticity of public keys, validating the proxy signature, and recovering the signed message are carried out simultaneously in a single step. (iii) <b>No</b> <b>certificate</b> is <b>required</b> for validating the public key. As compared with the previous works, which were implemented with the certificate-based public key system, the proposed schemes are more secure and efficient. In addition, the elliptic curve variant is especially suitable for the cryptographic applications with limited computing power and storage space, since its lower computation efforts and shorter key lengths...|$|R
30|$|In occupationally {{segmented}} labour markets, young IVET {{graduates who}} cannot find a skilled {{job in the}} occupation for {{which they have been}} trained are not provided with an institutionalised pathway to skilled employment in other occupational sub-segments. Access to occupational segments that do not match the certificate obtained is constrained because occupational mobility would require the acquisition of an additional occupational certificate. Therefore, occupational changes at labour market entrance will direct young IVET graduates into the peripheral segment where <b>no</b> specific <b>certificate</b> is <b>required</b> to take up employment. Following this argument, we can expect occupational changes after IVET to be accompanied by engagement in unskilled employment.|$|R

40|$|Reptiles {{have become}} {{increasingly}} common as domestic pets, and with them reptile-associated Salmonella infections in humans. From 1990 to 2000, a total of 339 reptile-associated Salmonella cases were reported in Sweden. In 1996, {{as part of its}} efforts to adapt its import regulations to those of the European Union, Sweden <b>no</b> longer <b>required</b> <b>certificates</b> stating that imported animals were free of Salmonella. A subsequent increase was noted in the incidence of reptile-associated cases from 0. 15 / 100, 000 in the period 1990 - 1994 to 0. 79 / 100, 000 in 1996 and 1997. After a public education campaign was begun through the news media, the incidence dropped to 0. 46 / 100, 000. Children were the most affected age group among patients (incidence 1. 3 / 100, 000). Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis was the most frequent serotype (24 % of isolates), followed by S. Typhimurium (9 % of isolates). Import restrictions and public information campaigns are effective public health measures against reptile-associated salmonellosis...|$|R
