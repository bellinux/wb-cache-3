Compared with bananas grown at 30 / 25 degrees C (day/night), leaf production at 18 / 14 degrees C was inhibited by 51 % in <b>normal</b> <b>plants</b> and 18 % in dwarf off-types. The {{emergence of the}} first leaf that developed at low temperature was delayed by 11 days for <b>normal</b> <b>plants</b> and 5 days for the dwarf off-types. Photoinhibition of lamina, measured by decrease in the chlorophyll fluorescence variable Fv/Fm, occurred in all banana plants growing in the field during the winter months. The {{extent to which the}} plants were photoinhibited was significantly greater for the <b>normal</b> <b>plants</b> than dwarf off-types. Under controlled environmental conditions, photoinhibition was similarly greater in <b>normal</b> <b>plants</b> than dwarf off-types. After 153 h at 18 / 14 degrees C and a 9 -h photoperiod of photon flux density (PFD) of 380 mu mol/m(2). s, Fv/Fm was reduced by 22 and 13 % for normal and dwarf off-types, respectively. When plants were exposed to 18 degrees C and a continuous PFD of 380 mu mol/m(2). s for 20 h, Fv/Fm was reduced by 50 % for <b>normal</b> <b>plants</b> and 36 % for dwarf off-types. The results of the study indicate that dwarf off-types generated from banana micropropagation showed improved tolerance to low temperature and light, showing better growth and lower susceptibility to low-temperature induced photoinhibition than <b>normal</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{variation}} for {{root and}} shoot morphology of two genotypes of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) from different gene pools {{and of their}} F 2 progeny was examined. Two experiments were conducted in solution culture. In experiment 1, plants of two cultivars of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.); cv. Carioca (Ca) with indeterminate growth habit and small seeds and cv. Prince (Pr) with determinate growth habit and large seeds; and their F 2 progeny were used. Plants were screened for root fractions and for root and shoot abnormalities. In experiment 2, grafting {{combinations of the two}} parental genotypes were used. The two parental cultivars, which are genetically uniform, behaved similarly, showing only a little variation in root fractions. By contrast, the F 2 progeny showed a wide range of root growth and fraction and different categories of plants were distinguished; (1) <b>normal</b> <b>plants,</b> (2) dwarfed root plants (3) dwarfed shoot plants and (4) plants with abnormal shoots but <b>normal</b> roots.

The soils in the area were analyzed for selected macro and micronutrients. Macronutrients analyzed included potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphates and nitrates while the micronutrients analyzed were copper, iron and zinc. The techniques employed were Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, Flame Emission Spectrometry and UV/Visible Spectrophotometry. The soil pH measurement was also taken. The average levels obtained in mg/kg for potassium, sodium, calcium, nitrates and phosphates were 110, 240. 8, 540, 71 and 100 respectively. Recommended nutrient range levels in mg/kg as per Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) are: potassium 1 - 100 mg/kg, sodium 20 - 300 mg/kg, calcium 2 - 400 mg/kg, nitrates above 42 mg/kg and finally for phosphates 2000 - 5000 mg/kg. The results indicate generally that macronutrient levels of phosphates and nitrates were low and below the required minimum required levels for <b>normal</b> <b>plant.</b> Micronutrients were within the limits for <b>normal</b> <b>plant</b> growth.

40|$|Chitinase-like {{proteins}} {{have long}} been proposed to play roles in <b>normal</b> <b>plant</b> growth and development, but no mutations in chitinase-like genes have been obtained previously to support this hypothesis. In this study, we {{have shown that the}} gene responsible for the elp 1 mutation in Arabidopsis encodes a chitinase-like protein (AtCTL 1). Mutation of this chitinase-like gene caused ectopic deposition of lignin and aberrant shapes of cells with incomplete cell walls in the pith of inflorescence stems. The AtCTL 1 gene was expressed in all organs during <b>normal</b> <b>plant</b> growth and development, but it was not induced by wounding, salicylic acid, pectin fragments, or ethylene. Consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern, mutation of the AtCTL 1 gene affected many aspects of plant growth and development, including exaggerated hook curvature, reduced length and increased diameter of hypocotyls in dark-grown seedlings, and reduced root length and increased number of root hairs in light-grown seedlings. The mutant phenotypes could be rescued partially by ethylene inhibitors, and ethylene production in the mutant was significantly greater than in the wild type.

Using PCR amplification, ABCDE model genes BraAP 2, BraAP 3, BraPI, BraAG, BraSHP, and BraSEP were isolated from Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis). We examined six development stages of floral buds collected from Chinese cabbage and compared between a line demonstrating normal flowering (A- 8) and two mutated lines that exhibited plants having petal-loss (A- 16 and A- 17). The expression of ABCDE model genes has been analyzed by qRT-PCR. Compared with flower buds of petal-loss <b>plants</b> and <b>normal</b> <b>plants,</b> the expression of A-class gene BraAP 2 was significantly decreased during the first to fourth stages, C-class gene BraAG expression was significantly decreased during the first to fifth stages, and D-class gene BraSHP expression was significantly decreased during the first to third stages.

However, when grown at 26 °C (nonpermissive temperature) the plants produced small yellow leaves which exhibited one- twentieth the chlorophyll content of <b>normal</b> <b>plants.</b> Affected leaves did not increase their chlorophyll content when plants were incubated at permissive temperatures, but leaves which developed at the lower temperature contained increased amounts of chlorophyll.

Ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase activity was decreased by half, relative to <b>normal</b> <b>plants,</b> in the mutant plants grown at the nonpermissive temperature, indicating that general protein synthesis was not greatly impaired and that the effect of the mutation was perhaps specific for chlorophyll content.
