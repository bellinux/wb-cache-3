5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. He argues {{that there is a}} duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned <b>natural</b> <b>environments.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nairobi National Park is a {{national}} park in Kenya. Established in 1946, the national park was Kenya's first. It is located approximately 7 kilometres (4mi) south of the centre of Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, with an electric fence separating the park's wildlife from the metropolis. Nairobi's skyscrapers {{can be seen from}} the park. The proximity of urban and <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> has caused conflicts between the animals and local people and threatens animals' migration routes.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In <b>natural</b> <b>environments,</b> such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E
50|$|Although geographers are {{historically}} {{known as}} people who make maps, map making is actually the field of study of cartography, a subset of geography.

For example, they study how the <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> contributes to the human society and how the human society affects the <b>natural</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|R
30|$|As {{the cross}} in Fig.  1 (left box) illustrates, natural {{processes}} are inherent and {{limited to the}} <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> system. Although <b>natural</b> processes can be induced by human or natural mechanisms, they are regarded {{as part of the}} <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> and include primarily physical factors (Gares et al. 1994; Sherman and Nordstrom 1994).

40|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> {{has a great}} {{influence}} {{on the ability of}} spacecraft to perform according to mission design specification. Compatibility with the <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> is a primary factor in determining the functional lifetime of the spacecraft. The spacecraft being designed and developed today are growing in complexity. In many instances, the increased complexity also increases its sensitivity to environmental effects. Sensitivities to the <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> can be tempered through appropriate design measures, mitigation strategies, and/or the acceptance of known risk. The design engineer must understand the effects of the <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> on the spacecraft and its components; while having an in-depth knowledge of mitigation strategies. Too much protection incurs unnecessary expense, and often times excessive mass; while too little protection can easily lead to premature mission loss. This presentation will provide a brief overview of both the <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> and its effects and provide some insight into mitigation strategies...|$|R
5|$|Most {{laboratory}} {{techniques for}} growing bacteria use {{high levels of}} nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in <b>natural</b> <b>environments,</b> nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (syntrophy).|$|E
5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their <b>natural</b> <b>environments.</b> Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} side of Hadley's proposal {{rests on}} two key principles: a guardianship system, {{according to which}} knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, {{and the use of}} animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the limits of their property. Hadley rejects first occupancy and labour-mixing accounts of appropriation, and instead suggests that there are two ways that his account might fruitfully be justified. First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact that wild animals require their territory in order to satisfy their basic needs and the claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory. Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting <b>natural</b> <b>environments.</b> Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit pragmatism, and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{conceptualization}} of the <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> in an evolving ecological public health paradigm. The <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> has long been recognized as essential to supporting life, health, and wellbeing. Our {{understanding of the relationship}} between the <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> and health has steadily evolved from one of an undynamic environment to a more sophisticated understanding of ecological interactions. This evolution is reflected in a number of ecological public health models which demonstrate the many external and overlapping determinants of human health. Six models are presented here to demonstrate this evolution, each model reflecting an increasingly ecological appreciation for the fundamental role of the <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> in supporting human health. We conclude that after decades of public health’s acceptance of the ecological paradigm, we are only now beginning to assemble knowledge of sophisticated ecological interdependencies and apply this knowledge to the conceptualization and study {{of the relationship between the}} <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> and the determinants of human health...|$|R
40|$|Tourism is {{the only}} sector in which <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> plays a {{substantial}} role. Nowadays, the interaction between ecotourism and the <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> is generally inter-dependence; ecotourism holds on to <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> for resources, {{and in order to}} survive the environmental threat, <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> in turn, depends on ecotourism. In human society, the selfish use of common resources can lead to catastrophic consequences, a situation known as the ‘tragedy of the commons’ (TOC). More often than not, <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> as the common pool resource (CPR) is overused and degraded, as is the unfortunate fate of most TOC. Thus, this paper explains this particular circumstance in the context of Ecotourism in Malaysia, specifically in Kenyir Lake.
