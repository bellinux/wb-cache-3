50|$|Initially, {{enthusiasm to}} emigrate to Turkey was {{inflated}} by the euphoria that greeted {{the birth of}} the newly established Republic of Turkey and later of promises of assistance to Turks who emigrated. A decision taken by the Turkish Government at the end of 1925, for instance, noted that the Turks of Cyprus had, according to the Treaty of Lausanne, the right to emigrate to the republic, and therefore, families that so emigrated would be given a house and sufficient land. The precise number of those who emigrated to Turkey is a matter that remains unknown.

50|$|Economic motives {{played an}} {{important}} part in the Turkish Cypriot migration wave as conditions for the poor in Cyprus during the 1920s were especially harsh.

The total number of ethnic Turkish Jews were estimated at five thousand people if those under 15 were counted. Scholars have estimated possibly ten thousand Jews of Turkish origin for the whole of France at the time. Turkey's Code allowed for double nationality, but people had to update their registry at the consulate every five years to preserve a Turkish identity. Many former Turkish nationals in France had neglected this, as most had lived there for decades. Ties to their parents' country were often reduced to anecdotal level. Scholars estimate that approximately ten thousand Jews who solely held the <b>Turkish</b> <b>nationality</b> may have resided in France at the time.|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the specific anti-Helicobacter pylori immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody profile for {{a sample of}} 824 asymptomatic schoolchildren in southern Germany (mean age, 10. 7 ± 0. 65 years) with an H. pylori-specific IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. The prevalence of infection was 19. 8 % (95 % confidence interval, 17. 1 to 22. 7 %). The immunoresponses were characterized predominantly by antibodies against low-molecular-mass antigens of 14 and 29 kDa, with {{a significant difference between}} children of German and <b>Turkish</b> <b>nationalities</b> (P = 0. 0012 and P < 0. 0001, respectively) ...|$|R

He is a Turk from Altai, who overran this country with his Turkish Army. Therefore it {{is more of an}} honour to us to be named after his origin than after himself. We have so far been deceived by the ignorance of our forebears, and fie on these forebears who made us forget our nationality....

50|$|After the {{incorporation}} of southern Epirus into Greece, Chams {{had the right to}} choose between Greek and <b>Turkish</b> <b>nationality,</b> under the 4th provision of the Athens peace treaty. It can be inferred that during the Interwar period the Muslim Cham community did not appear to have a clear-cut understanding of their national affiliation beyond their local religious affiliations. Chams were in fact divided amongst themselves as to where their loyalties lay. In the event, the Chams chose the Greek nationality instead of the Turkish. This convention gave special rights to religious minorities, but not to ethnic minorities, under the third provision.|$|R

A letter of 28 February 1941 from the German embassy, signed Otto Abetz, stated that they would be [...] "disposed to evaluate specific cases concerning Turkish nationals" [...] as communicated by the consulate. But when Xavier Vallat was appointed Head Commissioner for Jewish Affairs, he gave new impetus to Vichy France's anti-Jewish actions.|$|R

50|$|The {{census of}} 1970 counted 21,000 Turks; in the part-census of 1977 this figure {{had risen to}} 60,000. For the next few years, family reunifications {{continued}} to raise the totals and by 1981 there were 64,000 Turks. Although this growth was slowing down, it did continue to grow to 72,000 Turks by 1985. By 1996, there were 81,744 Turks in Belgium, 26% of whom lived in Brussels and 50% in Flanders-particularly in Antwerp and Ghent. In 1993, some 88,269 people with <b>Turkish</b> <b>nationality</b> were registered in Belgium, however by 1999, this dropped to 70,701 Turkish nationals because {{a substantial part of}} the population adopted the Belgian nationality.|$|R
5000|$|The Turkish {{version of}} Pan-Turanianism was {{summed up by}} American {{politicians}} as follows: [...] "It has been shown above that the Turkish version of Pan-Turanianism contains two general ideas: (a) To purify and strengthen the <b>Turkish</b> <b>nationality</b> within the Ottoman Empire, and (b) to link up the Ottoman Turks with the other Turks in the world. These objects were first pursued in the cultural sphere by a private group of 'Intellectuals', and promoted by peaceful propaganda. After 1913 they took on a political form and were incorporated in the programme of the C.U.P." [...] Ottoman defeat in World War I briefly undermined the notion of Pan-Turanianism.|$|R
40|$|In {{determining}} {{the effectiveness of}} AIDS preventive measures among heterosexuals, trends in visits to two clinics for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in Amsterdam between 1982 and 1989 are described. Also, data on sexual behaviour are presented that were collected {{in a sample of}} 635 heterosexual women and 947 heterosexual men at one of the clinics between September 1986 and December 1988. In 1987, when in The Netherlands for the first time extensive publicity was given to the risk of heterosexual transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, the numbers of male and female heterosexual attenders started to decline. Exceptions to this general decline were men of <b>Turkish</b> <b>nationality</b> and foreign prostitutes, each group showing a continuing increase. At the same time, the numbers of customers reported by prostitutes in the sample declined markedly between 1986 and 1988, from a median of 35 to 15 per month (p = 0. 001). Condom use with casual contacts generally increased in the sample period. We conclude that the publicity given to "heterosexual AIDS" [...] contributed to by the national AIDS prevention campaign [...] apparently led to a considerable {{decrease in the number of}} risky contacts of heterosexuals in Amsterdam in 1987 and 1988. This does not seem to apply to men with <b>Turkish</b> <b>nationality.</b> In 1989 a change appeared in several subgroups when the number of visitors started to rise. Also, the probability of an STD diagnosis increased in male attenders. This may indicate a change in the tendency towards safer sexual behaviour...|$|R

[...] By contrast, [...] "the Turkish national movement does not exhibit the failings of the earlier movements. It is in every way adapted to the intellectual standard and feelings of the nation. It also keeps pace with the ideas of the age, which have for some decades centred round the principle of <b>Nationality.</b> In adopting <b>Turkish</b> Nationalism as the basis of their national policy, the Turks have only abandoned an abnormal state of affairs and thereby placed themselves on a level with modern nations[4]." ...|$|R
40|$|What {{has become}} known as the Gülen {{movement}} has grown considerably over the past 20 years.

On one hand, it forms part of the phenomenon of the neo-brotherhoods inspired by Sufism, but on the other, because of the nationalist and neoliberal ideology it champions, it is linked with the main tendencies of “national Islam” that opposes radical “internationalist Islamism”...|$|R
