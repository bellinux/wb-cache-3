25|$|Mitotic <b>nondisjunction</b> {{results in}} somatic mosaicism, since only {{daughter}} cells originating from the cell where the <b>nondisjunction</b> event has occurred {{will have an}} abnormal number of chromosomes. <b>Nondisjunction</b> during mitosis {{can contribute to the}} development of some forms of cancer, e.g. retinoblastoma (see below).|$|E
25|$|Trisomy X {{is a form}} of sex {{chromosome}} aneuploidy where females have three instead of two X chromosomes. Most patients are only mildly affected by neuropsychological and physical symptoms. Studies examining the origin of the extra X chromosome observed that about 58-63% of cases were caused by <b>nondisjunction</b> in maternal meiosis I, 16-18% by <b>nondisjunction</b> in maternal meiosis II, and the remaining cases by post-zygotic, i.e. mitotic, <b>nondisjunction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Trisomy 18 (47,XX,+18) {{is caused}} by a meiotic <b>nondisjunction</b> event. With <b>nondisjunction,</b> a gamete (i.e., a sperm or egg cell) is {{produced}} with an extra copy of chromosome 18; the gamete thus has 24 chromosomes. When combined with a normal gamete from the other parent, the embryo has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 18.|$|E
50|$|The {{aneuploidy}} {{is thought}} to be caused by problems occurring during meiosis, either in the mother or in both the mother and father. Successive <b>nondisjunctions</b> have been observed in the mother of at least one patient.The features of the syndrome likely arise due to failure of x inactivation and the presence of multiple X chromosomes from the same parent causing problems with parental imprinting. In theory, X inactivation should occur and leave only one X chromosome active in each cell. However, failure of this process has been observed in one individual studied. The reason for this {{is thought to}} be the presence of an unusually large, and imbalanced, number of X chromosomes interfering with the process.|$|R
2500|$|Some of {{the most}} {{frequent}} genetic disorders are abnormalities of sex chromosomes, but polysomies rarely occur. 49,XXXXY chromosome polysomy occurs every 1 in 85,000 newborn males. The incidence of other X polysomies (48,XXXX, 48,XXXY, 48,XXYY) is more rare than 49,XXXXY. Polysomy Y (47,XYY; 48,XYYY; 48,XXYY; 49,XXYYY) occurs in 1 out of 975 males and may cause psychiatric, social, and somatic abnormalities. Polysomy X may cause mental and developmental retardation and physical malformation. Klinefelter syndrome {{is an example of}} human polysomy X with the karyotype 47, XXY. X chromosome polysomies can be inherited from either a single maternal (49, X polysomies) or [...] paternal (48, X polysomies) X chromosome. Polysomy of sex chromosomes is caused by successive <b>nondisjunctions</b> in meiosis I and II.|$|R
40|$|Axelrod and Hamilton (Science 211 : 1390, 1981) {{suggested}} that trisomies {{may result from}} an end-game strategy between chromosomes competing {{to get on the}} gamete as the mother approaches menopause. We tested this hypothesis by reviewing studies of the parental origin of the extra chromosome in trisomy 21 births. These data show that there is no significant rise in trisomy 21 conceptions as the mother ages. The increase in trisomies with maternal age results not from an increase in <b>nondisjunctions,</b> but from a decrease in rejection of trisomy zygotes, which may be adaptive for the mother towards the end of her reproductive life. This decreasing rate of rejection may result from the changing inclusive benefits of two maternal strategies as menopause approaches...|$|R
25|$|<b>Nondisjunction</b> is {{the failure}} of {{homologous}} chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate properly during cell division. There are three forms of nondisjunction: failure {{of a pair of}} homologous chromosomes to separate in meiosis I, failure of sister chromatids to separate during meiosis II, and failure of sister chromatids to separate during mitosis. <b>Nondisjunction</b> results in daughter cells with abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy).|$|E
25|$|Calvin Bridges and Thomas Hunt Morgan are {{credited}} with discovering <b>nondisjunction</b> in Drosophila melanogaster sex chromosomes {{in the spring}} of 1910, while working in the Zoological Laboratory of Columbia University.|$|E
25|$|Development {{of cancer}} often {{involves}} multiple alterations of the cellular genome (Knudson hypothesis). Human retinoblastoma {{is a well}} studied example of a cancer type where mitotic <b>nondisjunction</b> can contribute to malignant transformation: Mutations of the RB1 gene, which is located on chromosome 13 and encodes the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein, can be detected by cytogenetic analysis in many cases of retinoblastoma. Mutations of the RB1 locus in one copy of chromosome 13 are sometimes accompanied by loss of the other wild-type chromosome 13 through mitotic <b>nondisjunction.</b> By this combination of lesions, affected cells completely lose expression of functioning tumor suppressor protein.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the most}} {{frequent}} genetic disorders are abnormalities of sex chromosomes, but polysomies rarely occur. 49,XXXXY chromosome polysomy occurs every 1 in 85,000 newborn males. The incidence of other X polysomies (48,XXXX, 48,XXXY, 48,XXYY) is more rare than 49,XXXXY. Polysomy Y (47,XYY; 48,XYYY; 48,XXYY; 49,XXYYY) occurs in 1 out of 975 males and may cause psychiatric, social, and somatic abnormalities.

X chromosome polysomies can be inherited from either a single maternal (49, X polysomies) or paternal (48, X polysomies) X chromosome. Polysomy of sex chromosomes is caused by successive <b>nondisjunctions</b> in meiosis I and II.|$|R
40|$|Abnormalities in {{chromosome}} number {{that occurred during}} meiosis were evaluated with a specially-constructed diploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The strain is heterozygous for six markers of the right arm of chromosome V and heterozygous for cyh 2 (resistance to cycloheximide) on chromosome VII. —Selection of meiotic spores on a medium containing cycloheximide and required nutrilites—except those for the markers of the right arm of chromosome V—allows the growth of aberrant clones belonging only to two classes: a) diploid clones, caused by failure of the second meiotic division, with a frequency of 0. 54 x 10 - 4 per viable spore; and b) diplo V, aneuploids derived from <b>nondisjunctions</b> in meiosis I or meiosis II, with a total spontaneous frequency of 0. 95 x 10 - 4 per viable spore. About two-thirds of the aneuploids originated during meiosis I, the rest during meiosis II. An investigation of these events in control meioses and after treatment with MMS, Benomyl and Amphotericin B suggests that this assay system is suitable for screening environmental mutagens for their effects on meiotic segregation...|$|R
50|$|The parasexual cycle, {{a process}} {{peculiar}} to fungi and single-celled organisms, is a nonsexual mechanism of parasexuality for transferring genetic material without meiosis or {{the development of}} sexual structures. It was first described by Italian geneticist Guido Pontecorvo in 1956 during studies on Aspergillus nidulans (also called Emericella nidulans when referring to its sexual form, or teleomorph). A parasexual cycle is initiated by the fusion of hyphae (anastomosis) during which nuclei and other cytoplasmic components occupy the same cell (heterokaryosis and plasmogamy). Fusion of the unlike nuclei in the cell of the heterokaryon results in formation of a diploid nucleus (karyogamy), which {{is believed to be}} unstable and can produce segregants by recombination involving mitotic crossing-over and haploidization. Mitotic crossing-over can lead to the exchange of genes on chromosomes; while haploidization probably involves mitotic <b>nondisjunctions</b> which randomly reassort the chromosomes and result in the production of aneuploid and haploid cells. Like a sexual cycle, parasexuality gives the species the opportunity to recombine the genome and produce new genotypes in their offspring. Unlike a sexual cycle, the process lacks coordination and is exclusively mitotic.|$|R
25|$|The {{incidence}} of XYY syndrome is approximately 1 in 800-1000 male births. Many cases remain undiagnosed {{because of their}} normal appearance and fertility, {{and the absence of}} severe symptoms. The extra Y chromosome is usually a result of <b>nondisjunction</b> during paternal meiosis II.|$|E
25|$|Mosaicism syndromes can {{be caused}} by mitotic <b>nondisjunction</b> in early fetal development. As a consequence, the {{organism}} evolves as a mixture of cell lines with differing ploidy (number of chromosomes). Mosaicism may be present in some tissues, but not in others. Affected individuals may have a patchy or assymmetric appearance. Examples of mosaicism syndromes include Pallister-Killian syndrome and Hypomelanosis of Ito.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} difference {{between male and}} female meiosis concerns the frequency of recombination between homologous chromosomes: In the male, almost all chromosome pairs are joined by at least one crossover, while more than 10% of human oocytes contain at least one bivalent without any crossover event. Failures of recombination or inappropriately located crossovers have been well documented as contributors to the occurrence of <b>nondisjunction</b> in humans.|$|E
40|$|Sex {{chromosomes}} {{evolved from}} a pair of autosomes and they are differentiated as a result of supression of recombination. This process leads to a successive degradation of odd sex chromosome (alosome), which is becoming genetically inert finally or even excluded. Fundamental processes taking part in degeneration of alosome are Muller's ratchet, genetic hitchhiking, background selection, accumulation of transposable elements and constitutive heterochromatin. Indeed, these processes take part in either degeneration of both Y or W chromosomes. Remarkably, these alosomes show different rates of degeneration, most probably due to 1) different structure of male and female gonads as well as 2) different course of gametogenesis in both sexes. Furthermore, rate of alosome degeneration is usually lower in plants because they are haploid during the major part of life cycle. Other mechanisms of sex chromosome evolution involve rearrangements between autosomes and gonosomes, <b>nondisjunctions</b> and fissions of original sex chromosomes, transformation of B chromosomes into sex chromosomes or non-random segregation of autosomes with sex chromosomes. Other phenomenon that appears in sex chromosome evolution is transition between XY/XX and ZW/ZZ systems or transition between chromosomal sex determination and epigamy. Actually, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Pentasomy X (49,XXXXX) {{has been}} {{associated}} with a severe clinical condition, presumably resulting from failure or disruption of X chromosome inactivation. Here we report that some human X chromosomes from a patient with 49,XXXXX pentasomy were functionally active following isolation in inter-specific (human-rodent) cell hybrids. A comparison with cytogenetic and molecular findings provided evidence that more than one active X chromosome was likely to be present in the cells of this patient, accounting for her abnormal phenotype. Results: 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) -pulsed cultures showed different patterns among late replicating X chromosomes suggesting that their replication was asynchronic and likely to result in irregular inactivation. Genotyping of the proband and her mother identified four maternal and one paternal X chromosomes in the proband. It also identified the paternal X chromosome haplotype (P), indicating that origin of this X pentasomy resulted from two maternal, meiotic <b>nondisjunctions.</b> Analysis of the HUMANDREC region of the androgen receptor (AR) gene in the patient's mother showed a skewed inactivation pattern, while a similar analysis in the proband showed an active paternal X chromosome and preferentially inactivated X chromosomes carrying the 173 AR allele. Analyses of 33 cell hybrid cell lines selected in medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine (HAT) allowed for the identification of three maternal X haplotypes (M 1, M 2 and MR) and showed that X chromosomes with the M 1, M 2 and P haplotypes were functionally active. In 27 cell hybrids in which more than one X haplotype were detected, analysis of X inactivation patterns provided evidence of preferential inactivation. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that 12 % of X chromosomes with the M 1 haplotype, 43. 5 % of X chromosomes with the M 2 haplotype, and 100 % of the paternal X chromosome (with the P haplotype) were likely to be functionally active in the proband's cells, a finding indicating that disruption of X inactivation was associated to her severe phenotype...|$|R
25|$|Most gross genomic {{mutations}} in gamete germ cells probably result in inviable embryos; however, {{a number of}} human diseases are related to large-scale genomic abnormalities. Down syndrome, Turner Syndrome, {{and a number of}} other diseases result from <b>nondisjunction</b> of entire chromosomes. Cancer cells frequently have aneuploidy of chromosomes and chromosome arms, although a cause and effect relationship between aneuploidy and cancer has not been established.|$|E
25|$|Uniparental disomy {{denotes the}} {{situation}} where both chromosomes of a chromosome pair are inherited from the same parent and are therefore identical. This phenomenon most likely {{is the result of}} a pregnancy that started as a trisomy due to <b>nondisjunction.</b> Since most trisomies are lethal, the fetus only survives because it loses one of the three chromosomes and becomes disomic. Uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 is, for example, seen in some cases of Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of cases where monosomy occurs, the X chromosome comes from the mother. This may be due to a <b>nondisjunction</b> in the father. Meiotic errors that lead to the production of X with p arm deletions or abnormal Y chromosomes are also mostly found in the father. Isochromosome X or ring chromosome X on the other hand are formed equally often by both parents. Overall, the functional X chromosome usually comes from the mother.|$|E
25|$|Triple X {{syndrome}} is not inherited, but usually, occurs as an event during {{the formation of}} reproductive cells (ovum and sperm). An error in cell division called <b>nondisjunction</b> can result in reproductive cells with additional chromosomes. For example, an oocyte or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of the X chromosome {{as a result of}} the non-disjunction. If one of these cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra X chromosome in each of her cells. In some cases, trisomy X occurs during cell division in early embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|A healthy egg and/or {{sperm cell}} {{contains}} individual chromosomes, {{each of which}} contributes to the 23 pairs of chromosomes needed to form a normal cell with a typical human karyotype of 46 chromosomes. Numerical errors can arise at {{either of the two}} meiotic divisions and cause the failure of a chromosome to segregate into the daughter cells (<b>nondisjunction).</b> This results in an extra chromosome, making the haploid number 24 rather than 23. Fertilization of eggs or insemination by sperm that contain an extra chromosome results in trisomy, or three copies of a chromosome rather than two.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nondisjunction</b> usually {{occurs as}} the result of a {{weakened}} mitotic checkpoint, as these checkpoints tend to arrest or delay cell division until all components of the cell are ready to enter the next phase. If a checkpoint is weakened, the cell may fail to 'notice' that a chromosome pair is not lined up on the mitotic plate, for example. In such a case, most chromosomes would separate normally (with one chromatid ending up in each cell), while others could fail to separate at all. This would generate a daughter cell lacking a copy and a daughter cell with an extra copy.|$|E
25|$|Chromosome {{abnormalities}} can be numerical, as in {{the presence}} of extra or missing chromosomes, or structural, as in derivative chromosome, translocations, inversions, large-scale deletions or duplications. Numerical abnormalities, also known as aneuploidy, often occur as a result of <b>nondisjunction</b> during meiosis in the formation of a gamete; trisomies, in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two, are common numerical abnormalities. Structural abnormalities often arise from errors in homologous recombination. Both types of abnormalities can occur in gametes and therefore will be present in all cells of an affected person's body, or they can occur during mitosis and give rise to a genetic mosaic individual who has some normal and some abnormal cells.|$|E
500|$|Without proper {{homologous}} recombination, chromosomes often incorrectly align for {{the first}} phase of cell division in meiosis. [...] This causes chromosomes to fail to properly segregate in a process called <b>nondisjunction.</b> [...] In turn, <b>nondisjunction</b> can cause sperm and ova to have too few or too many chromosomes. Down's syndrome, which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, is one of many abnormalities that result from such a failure of homologous recombination in meiosis.|$|E
2500|$|Trisomy 21 is {{the cause}} of {{approximately}} 95% of observed Down syndrome, with 88% coming from <b>nondisjunction</b> in the maternal gamete and 8% coming from <b>nondisjunction</b> in the paternal gamete. [...] Mitotic <b>nondisjunction</b> after conception would lead to mosaicism, and is discussed later.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{cases have}} been {{reported}} of people with Down syndrome having children with trisomy 21. [...] In these cases (all from mothers), the ovaries were trisomy 21, leading to a secondary <b>nondisjunction</b> during gametogenesis and a gamete with an extra chromosome 21. [...] Such Down syndrome trisomies are indistinguishable from Down syndrome trisomy created through meiotic <b>nondisjunction.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Chromosome <b>nondisjunction</b> in mitosis can be atrributed to [...] the {{inactivation}} of topoisomerase II, condensin, or separase.|$|E

2500|$|Down syndrome, a trisomy of {{chromosome}} 21, is {{the most}} common anomaly of chromosome number in humans.

[...] It {{is the leading cause of}} pregnancy wastage and {{is the most}} common known cause of mental retardation. [...] It is well documented that advanced maternal age is associated with greater risk of meiotic <b>nondisjunction</b> leading to Down syndrome.

2500|$|Klinefelter {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common sex chromosome aneuploidy in humans. It represents the most frequent cause of hypogonadism and infertility in men. Most cases are caused by <b>nondisjunction</b> errors in paternal meiosis I.|$|E
2500|$|Trisomy 21 (47,XX,+21) {{is caused}} by a meiotic <b>nondisjunction</b> event. [...] A typical gamete (either egg or sperm) has one copy of each {{chromosome}} (23 total). [...] When it is combined with a gamete from the other parent during conception, the child has 46 chromosomes. [...] However, with <b>nondisjunction,</b> a gamete is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 21 (the gamete has 24 chromosomes). [...] When combined with a typical gamete from the other parent, the child now has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 21. [...] The trisomy 21 karyotype figure shows the chromosomal arrangement, with the prominent extra chromosome 21.|$|E
2500|$|Meiotic <b>nondisjunction</b> {{has been}} well studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. [...] This yeast {{undergoes}} mitosis similarly to other eukaryotes. [...] Chromosome bridges occur when sister chromatids are held together post replication by DNA-DNA topological entanglement and the cohesion complex.

2500|$|Polysomy of {{chromosomes}} 1, 2, 4, 5, and 25 {{are also}} frequently involved in canine tumors. [...] Chromosome 1 may contain a gene responsible for tumor development {{and lead to}} changes in the karyotype, including fusion of the centromere, or centric fusions. Aneuploidy due to <b>nondisjunction</b> is a common feature in tumor cells.|$|E
2500|$|In general, <b>nondisjunction</b> {{can occur}} in any form of cell {{division}} that involves ordered distribution of chromosomal material. Higher animals have three distinct forms of such cell divisions: Meiosis I and [...] meiosis II are specialized forms of cell division occurring during generation of gametes (eggs and sperm) for sexual reproduction, [...] mitosis is the form of cell division used by all other cells of the body.|$|E
2500|$|Tetrasomy 18p {{occurs when}} the short arm of the 18th {{chromosome}} appears four times, rather than twice, in {{the cells of the}} body.
