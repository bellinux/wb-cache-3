5|$|The A-10's {{durability}} {{was shown}} on 7 April 2003 when Captain Kim Campbell, while flying over Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, suffered extensive flak damage. Iraqi fire damaged {{one of her}} engines and crippled the hydraulic system, requiring the aircraft's stabilizer and flight controls to be operated via the 'manual reversion mode'. Despite this damage, Campbell flew the aircraft for <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and landed safely.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{dominated}} both {{practice sessions}} on the Friday, with Räikkönen fastest {{in the first}} Practice Session and Felipe Massa was fastest in the second Practice Session. Behind the Ferraris, Alonso was third in his McLaren, but seven tenths behind, with his teammate and World Championship leader Lewis Hamilton sixth, but lost <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of the session due to car trouble. The two McLarens were split by David Coulthard and Nico Rosberg.|$|E

5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton {{completely}} detected {{most of the}} malware samples. For {{two-thirds of}} the samples, all traces were removed. Norton found and removed all the commercial keyloggers. A full scan took <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to complete though, {{twice as long as}} the 2007 version. The suite blocked most of the malware from installing and all the commercial keyloggers, regardless of any modifications made to the samples. PC World noted that Norton removed 80 percent of malware-associated files and Registry entries.|$|E
5|$|The most {{destructive}} {{of the weather}} events, an EF4 tornado, traveled for <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> through four counties in Oklahoma during the evening of February10. It destroyed 114residences in Lone Grove alone. All casualties (8 deaths and 46 injuries) from the outbreak were due to the tornado in the Lone Grove area in Carter County.

5|$|The {{music for}} The Rocketeer was {{composed}} and conducted by James Horner. The soundtrack received positive reviews {{and is often}} mentioned as {{being one of the}} film's stronger elements. The soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records and features <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of music with eight tracks of score and two vocal tracks performed by actress/singer Melora Hardin. The two songs were arranged by Billy May, who had collaborated with Horner several times in the past.|$|E

5|$|Another riot {{occurred}} in August 1992 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, during a co-headlining tour with Metallica. Prior to Guns N' Roses' appearance, Metallica's set {{was cut short}} after singer-guitarist James Hetfield suffered second-degree burns in a pyrotechnics accident. However, Guns N' Roses was unable to go on stage early, because Rose once again was late arriving at the venue. <b>Nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> into their show, Rose complained of voice problems before walking off stage, following which a riot erupted in downtown Montreal, resulting in an estimated $400,000 in damages. In November of that year, Rose was convicted of property damage and assault {{in relation to the}} Riverport riot; he was fined $50,000 and received two years' probation.|$|E
5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was {{bitten by}} a black mamba and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{withering}} fire, Klenau's force reached Essling's edge, {{where his}} men set up 64 artillery pieces and bombarded the French for <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Taking the village by storm, Austrian cavalry {{poured into the}} village from the north, and the French were pushed out in a methodical advance. Klenau's batteries were able to fire on the French-held bridges south of the village, over which the French had to retreat. In bitter house-to-house fighting, the Austrians entered the village. Combat at the granary was especially brutal, as Hungarian grenadiers battled unsuccessfully to dislodge the French from their positions {{in the second and}} third floors. The battle resumed at dawn of 22 April. Masséna cleared Aspern of Austrians, but while he did so, Rosenberg's force stormed Jean Lannes' position at Essling. Lannes, reinforced by Vincent Saint-Hilaire's division, subsequently drove Rosenberg out of Essling. At Aspern, Masséna was driven out by Hiller and Bellegarde's counter-attacks.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Fuentes and Samzadeh sent Bruce Soord, {{leader of}} the British band The Pineapple Thief, <b>a</b> CD with <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour's</b> worth of mostly improvised {{material}}.

5|$|The ship, with Stars of David {{painted on}} her funnels, {{pulled away from}} the dock at eight minutes before noon, <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> later than her planned {{departure}} time, and headed to Haifa, with an intermediate stop in Naples. On board were some 400passengers from all over the United States and Canada, most of whom were tourists wanting to see the Holy Land. Many of the passengers, including a contingent from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, were also sailing in order to attend the dedication of the Hebrew University at Mount Scopus by former British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour. President Arthur also carried agricultural equipment and trucks to be used for farm development in Palestine. In addition, the liner featured Bernice P. Schmitt and Rebeccca Adelman, who, according to contemporary news reports, were the first ever female officers on an ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|The BPF {{returned}} to action on 12 May and no Japanese aircraft were seen or detected that {{day or the}} next. One of Formidables Avengers made a successful landing aboard Indomitable with only one landing gear leg extended and no flaps on 13 May. The BPF continued its routine of two days of operations alternating {{with one or two}} days to replenish its ships for the next several days with minimal interference by the Japanese. On the morning of 18 May, armourers were loading ammunition into aircraft when a Corsair's guns were accidentally fired into an Avenger, which caught fire. The overhead fire sprinklers were immediately turned on, but the fire could not be extinguished for <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> not least because the electric motors driving the steel fire curtains had been damaged in the first kamikaze attack and could only be repaired by a dockyard. Twenty-one Corsairs and seven Avengers were either damaged or destroyed in the incident. Rawlings decided to detach Formidable early to give her extra time for repairs in Sydney and she was ordered to depart on 22 May.|$|E
5|$|While Smith was {{attending}} junior high school, his parents divorced. Continuing {{to pursue his}} interest in baseball, he would ride the bus for <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to reach Dodger Stadium, cheering for the Los Angeles Dodgers at about 25 games a year. Upon becoming a student at Locke High School, Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams. Smith was a teammate of future National Basketball Association player Marques Johnson on the basketball team, and a teammate of future fellow Hall-of-Fame player Eddie Murray on the baseball side. After high school Smith attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to walk-on to the baseball team. In addition to his academic education, he learned to switch-hit from Cal Poly coach Berdy Harr. When Cal Poly's starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith subsequently took over the starting role. Later named an All-American athlete, he established school records in career at bats (754) and career stolen bases (110) before graduating in 1977.|$|E

The Americans were also forced to leave behind most of their cannon on Meeting House Hill {{because most of the}} artillery horses were killed.|$|E
25|$|Cotten starred a {{year later}} in Welles's {{adaptation}} and production of The Magnificent Ambersons. After the commercial disappointment of Citizen Kane, RKO was apprehensive about the new film, and after poor preview responses, cut it by <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before its release. Though at points the film appeared disjointed, it was well received by critics. Despite the critical accolades Cotten received for his performance, he was again snubbed by the Academy.|$|E
