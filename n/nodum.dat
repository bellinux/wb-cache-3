50|$|Robustum <b>nodum</b> is the {{one species}} of a {{problematic}} genus of Ordovician hemithecellid mollusc proposed by Stinchcomb and Darrough in 1995.Its similarities to Matthevia were outlined by Vendrasco & Runnegar.|$|E
50|$|In ancient Rome, {{death by}} hanging—suicide or otherwise—was {{regarded}} as particularly shameful, {{and those who}} had died by this method were refused a burial. Virgil's Aeneid, for example, refers to the noose as <b>nodum</b> informis leti ("the coil of unbecoming death"). Timothy Hill writes that there is no conclusive explanation of why the stigma existed; {{it has been suggested that}} hanging was a method of the poor. The Greeks considered hanging a woman's death because many women had died by this method. A study found that, in literary sources, 1.5-10 percent and 30 percent of suicides in the Roman and Greek civilizations, respectively, were by hanging.|$|E
40|$|The physiography, soils, {{climate and}} dense woody {{vegetation}} are briefly described for Ntshongweni, a cone-shaped hill in Natal, South Africa (29 ° 51 ' S and 30 ° 43 ' E). A primary ordination of the woody plants, based on Bray & Curtis’s (1957) method, {{was carried out}} using 60 quadrats. Four stand noda were delimited and another four noda within a secondary ordination of a cluster of quadrats {{which could not be}} interpreted within the primary ordination. Edaphic and atmospheric moisture conditions and slope aspect were proposed as the main site factors correlated with species performance. Tables of density, local frequency and constancy for species occurring in each <b>nodum</b> were drawn up. </p...|$|E
40|$|The physiography, {{soils and}} climate are briefly {{described}} for the Pongolo River flood plain pans situated in north-east Zululand (27 S, 32 E), Natal, South Africa. Quantitative vegetation data ob­tained from 60 stands distributed over 9 pans were summarized using a Braun-Blanquet procedure and a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Both approaches {{indicated that the}} aquatic vegetation could be subdivided into two main groups of growth forms: the submerged and the floating and/or rooted-floating aquatic plants, each showing a distribution influenced primarily by physical factors such as exposure and depth of water. In the PCA, each of the above groups was defined by two stand noda, each <b>nodum</b> representing a plant community that could be observed in the field. The Braun- Blanquet analysis further subdivided the floating and/or rooted-floating aquatic plants into groups of species {{on the basis of}} chemical and substrate factors. </p...|$|E
40|$|Saxicolous (rock dwelling) lichen and {{bryophyte}} {{communities are}} important components of qualifying rock habitats designated under the EC Habitats Directive but {{little is known}} about their development on sites which are scheduled primarily for their vascular flora. This study used phytosociological methods to describe and classify saxicolous lichen and bryophyte communities on limestone on Strath candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC). Sample data were collected and sorted into groups of similar samples or noda. The results were compared with previous published classifications of lichen and bryophyte communities. The work is part of a wider study looking at a range of sites in GB to obtain an overview of saxicolous communities and their relationships to environmental factors, revise their classification and assess their conservation value. Main findings ● Six noda of saxicolous lichen and bryophyte communities were characterised on limestone on Strath and related to published classifications. ● Four noda were associated with qualifying ‘Limestone pavement ’ and two occur on more isolated rock outcrops or boulders. ● One <b>nodum</b> was widespread on exposed limestone pavement surfaces and was dominated by crustos...|$|E
