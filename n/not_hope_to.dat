5|$|Although {{supplies}} {{had been}} left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed {{up the hill to}} meet him.|$|E
5|$|In {{some ways}} the run-up to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> assault well-defended positions.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} the Sibiu-based Astra {{magazine}} Transilvania (where he sometimes used the signature AG), Agârbiceanu remained the editor of Patria until 1927, and also resumed his collaboration with Viața Românească. However, he was disappointed by the cultural and economic decline which came {{as a consequence of}} Transylvania's incorporation: the local press, he noted, had largely lost its purpose and could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> survive competition. As noted by reviewers from Ilie Rad to Răzvan Voncu, some of Agârbiceanu's more valuable work saw print in minor provincial reviews.|$|E

5|$|Although the French {{troops would}} have a higher {{proportion}} of motorised units than their German adversaries, in view of the respective distances to be covered, they could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> reach their assigned sector advancing in battle deployment before the enemy did. Their only prospect of beating the Germans to it lay in employing rail transport. This implied they would be vulnerable in the concentration phase, building up their forces near Breda. They needed the Dutch troops in the Peel-Raam Position to delay the Germans for a few extra days to allow a French deployment and entrenchment, but French rapid forces also would provide a security screen. These consisted of the reconnaissance units of the armoured and motorised divisions, equipped with the relatively well-armed Panhard 178 armoured car. These would be concentrated into two task forces named after their commander: the Groupe Beauchesne and the Groupe Lestoquoi.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{accepting}} that Soult would not arrive, Ney could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> hold his position, much less push the Austrians back. He concluded {{that he must}} fall back to Winterthur. To cover the retreat, he instructed Walther and his cavalry to establish {{a position on the}} Töss, above the bridge at Stieg. From there, the cavalry could protect an orderly retreat. Amidst a muddy rivulet feeding the Töss, Ney positioned a second detachment guarding the village of Töss and the road leading to a ridge of the hills, where he placed a couple of cannons. From the ridge, his rear guard could fire its artillery on the Austrian advance.|$|E
5|$|The First Battle of Ciudad Juárez {{took place}} in April and May 1911 between federal forces loyal to President Porfirio Díaz and rebel forces of Francisco Madero, during the Mexican Revolution. Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa {{commanded}} Madero's army, which besieged Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. After two days of fighting the city's garrison surrendered and Orozco and Villa {{took control of the}} town. The fall of Ciudad Juárez to Madero, combined with Emiliano Zapata's taking of Cuautla in Morelos, convinced Díaz that he could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> defeat the rebels. As a result, he agreed to the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez, resigned and went into exile in France, thus ending the initial stage of the Mexican Revolution.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{occurred}} during Holy Week, 1799, amid rain and dense fog. Initially, the French {{were able to}} take, and hold, Ostrach and the nearby hamlet of Hoßkirch plus several strategic points on the Ostrach marsh. As the engagement began, Habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed French defenses. By evening, the French left wing was flanked and Jourdan's men retreated from Ostrach to the Pfullendorf heights. On the next morning, as Jourdan considered a counter-attack, the weather broke, and he could {{look down on the}} Austrian battle array. The numbers and dispositions of the Austrians convinced him that any attack would be useless, and that he could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> maintain his position in the heights. As he withdrew, a portion of his right flank was cut off from the main force.|$|E
5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita is the editor. Kierkegaard's role in all this appears to be that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from the points of view expressed in his works, although the absurdity of his pseudonyms' bizarre Latin names proves that he did <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View of My Work as an Author.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of Windows 95 in August 1995, Delrina was now {{competing}} directly against Microsoft in the fax/electronic communications marketplace, as Windows 95 included a basic faxing application as an accessory, along with a licensed version of Hilgraeve's HyperTerminal communication package, (which was also {{used as the basis}} for Delrina's own WinComm program). While these applications offered only rudimentary fax and online communication services in comparison to the mature Delrina products, Microsoft was perceived as a potentially serious future competitor in the communications market space. The release of the initial version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer in late 1995 as a free product effectively killed off the early emerging market for non-free browsers, creating a market where Delrina's Cyberjack browser could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> compete.|$|E

5|$|At 11:45, Armide {{surrendered}} to Centaur, followed 15 minutes later by Minerve. Both ships had suffered heavy damage and {{casualties in the}} unequal engagement and could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> continue their resistance {{with the rest of}} the British squadron rapidly approaching. To the north, Infatigable had failed to outrun Mars and Captain Lukin forced the frigate to surrender after a brief cannonade. With three ships lost and the other three long disappeared to the south, Soleil determined to flee westwards, hoping the damage he had inflicted on Centaurs sails was sufficient to prevent her pursuit. However, Gloire had also been damaged and could not distance herself from the British flagship sufficiently before support arrived in the form of Mars. With his ship undamaged, Lukin was able to easily catch the fleeing frigate and opened fire at 14:30, combat continuing for half an hour before Soleil surrendered, his frigate badly damaged. To the south, Windsor Castle had proven far too slow to catch the smaller French ships, which had easily outrun the second rate and escaped.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 {{election}} saw the Republicans capture {{not just}} the presidency but control of the Senate as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party {{for the first time}} in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss, but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism. He chose to become the ranking member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career. Kennedy became a committed champion of women's issues and of gay rights, and established relationships with select Republican senators to block Reagan's actions and preserve and improve the Voting Rights Act, funding for AIDS treatment, and equal funding for women's sports under Title IX. To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics important to him. Kennedy could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> stop all of Reagan's reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez's ships {{captured}} {{a number of}} stragglers from Redmill's convoy and managed to isolate Sirius, which only just escaped after narrowly avoiding an unequal encounter with four French ships of the line. With the convoy dispersed, Willaumez gathered his scattered forces and despatched the frigate Volontaire to the Spanish island of Tenerife with the prizes, before turning {{the remainder of his}} squadron southwards for his designated cruising grounds. To the north, Leissègues gradually approached Brisbane's convoy during the night but did not close with him until the morning of 16 December. In response, Brisbane formed his three warships into a line of battle, accompanied by three of the larger merchant ships. This force could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> resist Leissègues' main force, but would enable the 17 other vessels to escape by blocking the French squadron's frigates from chasing them. Ignoring the escaping convoy, Leissègues formed his own line of battle and continued to close with Brisbane, whose faster ships steadily pulled away from the French throughout the day. As darkness fell, Leissègues abandoned the pursuit and turned to the south and Brisbane immediately despatched Boadicea to Brest and Wasp to the blockade squadrons along the Atlantic Seaboard with urgent warnings of the French operations in the Eastern Atlantic. Brisbane himself remained in distant contact with Leissègues for another day before the French squadron sheered away. Brisbane continued southwards with the remainder of his convoy, seeking the British blockade squadron at Cadiz.|$|E

25|$|Virtually none {{of these}} {{objectives}} were met. Allied fire support was grossly inadequate and the raiding force was largely trapped on the beach by obstacles and German fire.

25|$|With {{the conquest}} of Eindhoven, Parma's forces made great {{advances}} in the region, and gained the allegiance {{of the majority of}} the towns of northern Brabant. The Spanish victory also increased the crisis between the Duke of Anjou and the States-General. Anjou laid the blame for the fall of Eindhoven to the States, while the States were fed up with his ambitions, and the inefficiency and slowness of his troops. However, the Prince of Orange, strong supporter of the alliance, reiterated that they could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> defeat Parma without French aid.|$|E
25|$|The rumblings {{of reform}} taking place within Ottoman society reached the Sultanate, and were {{eventually}} echoed at an institutional level. The Ottoman regime, {{in order to}} counteract the threat of political and religious influence from the Christian missionary schools and due to the realisation that the empire could <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> survive without learning the modern natural sciences, began to implement its own reforms (tanzimat). According to the Arab historian, Eugene Rogan, the reforms introduced by the Sultanate {{had little effect on}} the subjects of the empire. However, by the 1850s and 1860s, the fruits of reform were visible in the daily life.|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{photographic}} {{and internet}} technology have revolutionised {{the way people}} create, process and share digital images. This paper investigates people?s motivations for image publishing and tagging on the web 2. 0 site Flickr. Using an online pilot survey, 33 participants answered questions about their uploading and tagging practices, and whether or <b>not</b> they <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> make a commercial gain from their images. The results show that most people have two main motivational reasons both for using Flickr, and for the tagging of their images. However, whilst a person may be motivated to use Flickr for both personal and social reasons, tagging motivation tends to focus more exclusively on either {{one or the other}} of these two factors. Overall it was found that social organisation and social communication are the most popular motivational factors for both using Flickr and for tagging images, suggesting that Flickr is enjoyed for the community environment it provides rather than as a place to store images. However despite people?s desire to share their images, most users are <b>not</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> make a commercial gain from the items they upload...|$|R
