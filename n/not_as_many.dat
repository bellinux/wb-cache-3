5|$|Gasketball was {{released}} for iPad on August 9, 2012. They {{had decided to}} release the game as an ethically non-coercive free-to-play game, with a free base game and in-app purchases for the extended content. <b>Not</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> players paid for the content as expected. This was due, in part, to the players' difficulty in finding the purchase function. The game had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked {{near the top of}} an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart.|$|E

5|$|Siward can {{be found}} {{witnessing}} numerous charters during Edward's reign, though <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as the Godwinsons; Siward usually comes third in lists of earls, behind Godwine and Leofric but ahead of Godwine's sons and the other earls. He witnessed at least seven, possibly nine, extant charters in 1044, six or seven in 1045, two in 1046, one in 1048 and one in 1049. A Dux ("earl") named Sihroþ and Sihroð witnessed two charters in 1050, {{and this may be}} Siward. There is another attestation in 1050, and his name appears in two dubious witness lists attached to charters dating to 1052 and 1054. Possibly Siward's last historical appearance in English legal documents is in the agreement made—probably at Lincoln—between Wulfwig, Bishop of Dorchester, and Earl Leofric, dating to between 1053 and 1055.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} Chola coins {{discovered}} {{so far are}} <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as those of Pandyas; {{most of them have}} been found from archeological excavations at Puhar and Arikamedu, and also beds of rivers Amaravathi near Karur and South Pennar near Tirukkoilur. An early Chola coin has also been found in Thailand. The Chola coins do not contain a portrait or a legend and all of them depict symbols of animals and other inanimate objects like the animal series of the Cheras. But, all of them carry the symbol of a tiger, the Chola emblem, on their reverse. One of the coins has been assigned a date earlier than 200 BCE and some others to about the time of Roman influence, which is around the dawn of the Christian era.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} {{provided the}} HV {{with the opportunity}} to extend its territorial gains from Operation Winter '94 by advancing from the Livanjsko field. The move was expected to relieve pressure on the ARBiH 5th Corps defending Bihać, while positioning the HV in a more favourable position to strike Knin, the RSK capital. The HV and HVO responded quickly through Operation Summer '95 (Ljeto '95). The offensive, commanded by HV Lieutenant General Ante Gotovina, succeeded in capturing Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč on 2829 July. The attack drew off some RSK units away from Bihać, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as expected {{at the outset of the}} operation. Nevertheless, the offensive put the HV in an excellent position, as it isolated Knin from Republika Srpska and FR Yugoslavia, and led to the capture of Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč, which sat astride the only direct route between the two.|$|E

25|$|The {{series was}} a major {{financial}} success, with the films classified {{as one of the}} highest-grossing film series of all time, going on to outgross The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.

25|$|Hercules was {{designed}} {{from the start}} to operate from Ajax bases. However, as it protected a much greater area, <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> sites were needed to provide coverage of potential targets. Early deployments starting in 1958 were on new sites, but Ajax units started converting as well. Conversions were largely complete by 1960, leaving only a few Ajax sites in use. The last active Nike Ajax batteries were relieved of their mission in December 1961, followed by the last Army National Guard unit in May 1964.|$|E

Bournville had an area of 639.8 hectares, and within this, it has a population density of 39.8 people per hectare. 52.9% of the population was identified as female, above the city average of 51.6%.

25|$|Schönefeld Airport {{consists}} of the four terminals A, B, C and D. These terminals are located {{next to each other}} but have separate landside areas; however they are connected through a joint airside concourse. Terminal C has no check-in facilities, it is used exclusively for passengers clearing security checks to enter the airside boarding gates. Due to a lack of space, there are <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> facilities as those at many other international airports. There are some shops, however, including duty-free, newsagents, a few restaurants such as Burger King and a single airline lounge.|$|E
25|$|By the 2000s and 2010s, {{an influx}} of {{residents}} seeking affordable family housing had pushed property prices up. In 2015, houses {{in various parts of}} Windsor Terrace sold for about $1.2 million to $2 million in 2015, and apartments cost from $400,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to more than $1 million for a three-bedroom apartment. Windsor Terrace is becoming more ethnically diverse and culturally active, owing to a demographic change since the 1990s, when the area had a more elderly population and <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> families with young children. The increased presence of many families with young kids has not indicated a significant cultural change in the neighborhood.|$|E

The IIHF holds IIHF World Women's Championships tournaments in several divisions; championships are held annually, except that the top flight does not play in Olympic years.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} and {{principal}} objectives of the revolutionary regime was the adoption of a standard national writing system. Shortly after coming to power, Barre introduced the Somali language (Af Soomaali) as the official language of education, and selected the modified Latin script developed by the Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed as the nation's standard orthography. From then on, all education in government schools had to be conducted in Somali, and in 1972, all government employees were ordered to learn to read and write Somali within six months. The reason given for this was to decrease a growing rift between those who spoke the colonial languages, and those who did <b>not,</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> of the high ranking positions in the former government were given to people who spoke either Italian or English.|$|E

The trivalent cyclopentadienyl compound Np(C5H5)3·THF was obtained in 1972 from reacting Np(C5H5)3Cl with sodium, although the simpler Np(C5H5) {{could not be}} obtained.
