30|$|Our {{analysis}} {{of the relationships between}} <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence, public education investment, and human capital accumulation based on panel data from 31 provinces in China collected from 1999 to 2015 reveals a significant negative correlation between <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence and human capital accumulation, suggesting a crowding-out effect of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence on human capital. The results are consistent with our theoretical expectations. Based on our theoretical prediction, we also discuss the relationship between <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence and human capital accumulation by introducing the interactive term of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence and public education investment. The results show that, after the introduction of the interaction term, the coefficient of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence remains significantly negative, but the interactive coefficient is significantly positive. The results indicate that public education investment could reduce the crowding-out effect of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence on human capital.|$|R

The first two propositions suggest a strong and direct connection between self-identity, place, and how individuals perceive and value the environment. The third, fourth, and fifth propositions tie together social group identity and place, particularly emphasizing the influence of social group identity on strategic behavior in <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> pol-itics. The sixth proposition relates to the geographic scale of place as a strategic choice in <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> decision making. Taken together, the propositions suggest that <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> politics {{is as much a}} contest over place meanings as it is a competition among interest groups over scarce resources.

40|$|This {{research}} {{extends the}} study of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> violations by examining the association between conservation organizations and the enforcement of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> violations across 67 Florida counties in 2006. Specifically, the authors look at <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> violations as an organizational outcome that is influenced by perceived community organization around environmental conservation. To do this, they examine the association {{between the number of}} conservation organizations and the level of enforcement for <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> violations. The results suggest that even while controlling for organizational capacity (i. e., number of officers), offenders and targets, proportion rural population, and economic benefits from <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> use, a positive association exits between conservation organizations and <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> enfor cement levels. This relationship is not replicated in the case of animal rights and hunting and fishing organizations. Although issues related to environmental justice are always a concern in studies of environmental enforcement, the authors find no evidence of an association between social and economic disadvantage and community organizing. Finally, a post hoc examination of the data suggests that the association between conservation organizations and the level of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> enforcement is stronger for those counties where more officers enforce <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> violations than for those counties where fewer officers enforce violations.

Past {{studies have found that}} a country with poor government governance have brought <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> curse, where large <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> reserves have decreased the education level and economic well-being of that country. By collecting the data from the Labour Force Survey and Statistics Canada, this paper tests if <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> abundant provinces, such as Alberta and British-Columbia have gone through <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> curse or <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> blessing in comparison to <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> scarce provinces, like Ontario and Quebec. There are two regression methods used here, one following the simple regression used by most <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> curse paper to test education level in the provinces, and one following Boyce and Emery (2011) 's income per capita regression. The first method of regression on education enrolment and government expenditure on education per capita did not return significant results, but the second following Boyce and Emery (2011) 's regression method did return that resource rich provinces enjoy higher income per capita...|$|R

40|$|Ecosystem-based <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> {{management}} {{involves the}} integration of biophysical and human dimensions. Both {{the social sciences and}} biophysical sciences contribute {{to our understanding of the}} process of balancing social, economic, and biological factors. While the role of the biophysical sciences is relatively well recognized in the <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> management sector, the contributions of the social sciences are less well understood and they are less frequently incorporated into management plans and activities. In this paper we summarize several distinct contributions of the social sciences to <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> management and describe 10 ways that decision makers use social sciences. We predict the role of social sciences in <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> management will become more important and we suggest that more collaborative research projects between social science researchers and <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> managers will emerge. We also suggest that more cross-fertilization within the diverse streams of social sciences— as well as between the social sciences and biophysical sciences—will be essential in order to address complex research questions related to <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> management.

5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources</b> Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources</b> Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources</b> Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E
