40|$|Narrow Money-Transactions Money The {{growth rate}} of the <b>narrow</b> {{monetary}} <b>aggregates</b> picked up in 1999, reflecting the expansion in economic activity and the stabilization of interest rates. The sharp acceleration of the <b>narrow</b> <b>aggregates</b> in recent months suggests buoyant growth in GDP in coming quarters. Signs of a possible rise in inflation are also emerging. Over the longer run, for inflation {{to remain in the}} Bank's 1 to 3 per cent target range, the growth of narrow money would have to slow down from its current pace. In 1999, the {{growth rate of}} M 1 also began to converge with that of the other <b>narrow</b> <b>aggregates,</b> M 1 + and M 1 ++. This suggests that the influence of the special factors that have been affecting the growth rate of M 1 has diminished. Broad Money-"Store of Value" Household savings represent deferred consumption, and therefore the broad monetary aggregate provides information about future spending and, hence, inflation. In 1999, the very broad measure of money, M 2 ++, grew at much the same rate as it did in 1998. This outcome is in line with inflation remaining in the inflation-control target range {{over the next couple of}} years. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{relevance}} of monetary aggregates for monetary policy as indicators of real activity. The main hypothesis of this paper is that <b>narrow</b> monetary <b>aggregates</b> can help forecasting real output. The empirical analysis combines the time scale decomposition of time series using wavelets and the possible existence of cointegrating relationships between money, output and prices. Using recent Peruvian data, evidence is found to support the proposed hypothesis. In particular, the results suggest the existence of co-integration between non-stationary series built using wavelet filtering. In this context, exogeneity tests reveal that <b>narrow</b> monetary <b>aggregates</b> are weakly and strongly exogenous; i. e., they are helpful for forecasting real output. These results suggest that money has a role for monetary policy as an indicador of real activity. ...|$|R

In this article, Dinah Maclean describes how the monetary aggregates {{are used in the}} formulation of monetary policy analysis at the Bank, outlining the key tools and models used. The most important money-based model currently in use is the M 1 -VECM. In this model, deviations in the money supply from the long-term demand for money cause changes in inflation. The author briefly describes the "active-money" paradigm underlying this model and explains the key equations within it. Other simpler empirical models are also outlined, including single-equation indicator models for output based on the <b>narrow</b> <b>aggregates,</b> a neural network, and a model based on the broader aggregate M 2 ++.

40|$|Although many {{countries}} have abandoned monetary targeting in recent decades, monetary aggregates are still useful indicators of future economic activity. Past {{research has shown}} that, compared with other monetary aggregates and expressed in real terms, net M 1 and gross M 1 have traditionally provided superior leading information for output growth. Yet financial innovations {{and the elimination of}} reserve requirements {{over the past two decades}} have made it increasingly difficult for financial institutions to differentiate between demand and notice deposits, suggesting the need to re-examine the information content of <b>narrow</b> monetary <b>aggregates</b> that depend on such a distinction. Based on an analysis over a sample period from 1975 Q 1 to 2005 Q 1, the authors determine that the leading-indicator properties of the <b>narrow</b> monetary <b>aggregates</b> for output growth have shifted over time and that, since 1993, real M 1 + has become a better indicator of future output growth than real gross and net M 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} thirty years, two major waves of {{financial}} innovation have affected the profile of M 1 in Canada, {{as well as other}} <b>narrow</b> <b>aggregates,</b> which have made them difficult to use for the conduct of monetary policy. The paper describes these innovations and provides estimates of their impact on the level of various aggregates, as well as on their relationship with output growth and inflation. Finally, it discusses the need to develop measures of transaction money that can adapt more rapidly to financial innovation. The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors. No responsibility for them should be attributed to the Bank of Canada. I. Introduction and Summary 1 It is generally accepted among macroeconomists that there exists a relationship between money, output and prices. A change in the money supply immediately affects financial variables, such as interest rates, exchange rates and asset prices. Changes in these variables affect the liquidity position of financial institutions, which in turn influences the liquidity of firms an...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} monetary asset components {{and some of the}} variables that traditionally enter into aggregate money demand relations. This is done for Danish data within the natural framework of a multivariate econometric model. The purpose of the study is to investigate issues in relation to the level and weighting of a monetary aggregate. We show that within this model it is possible to identify monetary aggregates at different levels of aggregation and that for the <b>narrow</b> <b>aggregate</b> (M 1) equal weighting of the components are permitted. For the broader aggregates, (M 2) or (M 2 -M 1), equal weighting is no longer appropriate. These findings are not contradictory to what we would expect from aggregation and index number theory. Finally, the overall identifica-tion of the stationary (or long-run) structure points towards a co-existence of a liquid and a less liquid money demand relation which is interpreted as an indication of the possibility of splitting the total money demand relation with respect to different motives for holding money.

40|$|In its {{conduct of}} {{monetary}} policy, the Bank of Canada carefully monitors {{the pace of}} monetary expansion for indications about the outlook for inflation and economic activity. In recent years, {{a number of factors}} have distorted the growth of the traditional broad and <b>narrow</b> <b>aggregates.</b> In this article, the authors discuss the uncertainty surrounding the classification of deposit instruments that has resulted from the elimination of reserve requirements and from other financial innovations. They introduce twonew measures of transactions balances, M 1 + and M 1 ++ (described more fully in a technical note in this issue of the Review), that internalize some of the substitutions that have occurred. They attribute the deceleration in M 1 growth in 1998 partly to the declining influence of special factors, partly to a lagged response to interest rate increases in 1997 and early 1998, and partly to some temporary tightening in credit conditions in the autumn of 1998. The broad monetary aggregate M 2 ++, which includes all personal savings deposits, life insurance annuities, and mutual funds, grew at a steady pace in 1998, presaging growth of about 4 to 5 per cent in total dollar spending and inflation inside the target range. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper builds monthly time-series of Divisia {{monetary}} aggregates for the Gulf {{area for the}} period of June 2004 to December 2011, using area-wide data. We also offer an "economic stability" indicator for the GCC area by analyzing the dynamics pertaining to certain variables such as the dual price aggregates, aggregate interest rates, and the Divisia aggregate user cost growth rates. Our findings unfold the superiority of the Divisia indexes over the officially published simple-sum {{monetary aggregates}} in monitoring the business cycles. There is also direct evidence on higher economic harmonization between GCC countries [...] especially in terms of their financial markets and the monetary policy. Monetary policy often uses interest rate rules, when the economy is subject only to technology shocks. In that case, money is nevertheless relevant as an endogenous indicator (Woodford, 2003). Properly weighted monetary aggregates provide critical information to policy makers regarding inside liquidity created by financial intermediaries. In addition, policy rules should include money as well as interest rates, when the economy is subject to monetary shocks as well as technology shocks. The data show <b>narrow</b> <b>aggregates</b> growing while broad aggregates collapsed following the financial crises. This information clearly signals problems with the financial system's ability to create liquidity during the crises. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the developments in the monetary aggregates {{over the course of}} 1997 and their implications for future economic activity. The <b>narrow</b> <b>aggregate,</b> M 1, grew rapidly {{in the first half of}} 1997 but slowed somewhat during the second half of the year. Much of the strong growth in this aggregate over the last several years has been associated with a higher demand for transactions balances as interest rates declined and economic activity revived. There were some special factors at play, however, that are discussed in the article. The Bank expects some slowing in M 1 growth through 1998 and into 1999. This would be consistent with a trend of inflation within the inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 per cent over the next couple of years. Growth in the broad aggregate, M 2 +, continued to be distorted by the shift of savings out of fixed-term deposits into mutual funds. A broader aggregate that includes M 2 +, CSBs, and all mutual funds and thus provides a better estimate of broad money growth, grew at a moderate pace during 1997. The recent behaviour of the broad monetary aggregates continues to suggest that inflation will remain low in coming years. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper focusses on the {{empirical}} relationship between financial indicators (monetary and credit aggregates and short-term interest rates) {{and measures of}} economic activity. It aims to supplement an earlier paper by Bullock, Morris and Stevens (1988) (BMS), which explored these issues. BMS tentatively concluded that short-term interest rates and the <b>narrow</b> <b>aggregate</b> M 1 had a reasonably good leading relationship with private final demand. Broad monetary and credit aggregates tended to be lagging indicators, and the intermediate aggregates (M 3 and bank lending) presented a mixed picture. This earlier paper relied on simple graphical and correlation-based techniques to draw these conclusions. The same questions are addressed in this paper, this time using more rigorous statistical testing techniques. Vector auto-regression (VAR) analysis is used to identify leading and lagging relationships among the data. All data are pre-tested {{for the presence of}} deterministic trends and unit roots, and differenced and detrended accordingly, before the models are estimated. Estimation is over the period 1969 – 1988 (given available data), using seasonally adjusted quarterly series. Results confirm that the broader aggregates generally lag activity, however there is no strong evidence of a leading relationship between the short-term interest rate (or M 1) and activity. The latter suggests a complex relationship between interest rates and activity over time; a process influenced by the operation of monetary policy, which cannot be satisfactorily unravelled using the techniques employed here. The data set of BMS is also extended in this paper to allow a preliminary examination of the tradeable goods sector. Models including the exchange rate, foreign demand and prices, as well as domestic activity and financial variables are estimated. Results from these tests suggest an effect of the exchange rate on imports and exports, which is consistent with a link between monetary policy and the tradeable goods sector. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{cornerstone}} of monetary policy making {{is that a}} looser monetary policy is associated with lower interest rates, higher growth of <b>narrow</b> monetary <b>aggregates,</b> higher output and higher inflation. These responses, which we collectively {{refer to as the}} liquidity effect hypothesis, are at odds with some of the leading theoretical models of money. This paper proposes and implements a quasi-Bayesian methodology that allows us to compare the liquidity effect hypothesis with two other hypotheses: the sticky price hypothesis and the inflation tax hypothesis. Our results indicate that there is evidence against the liquidity effect hypothesis in U. S. data, but that a skeptical Bayesian decision maker would still assign most posterior weight it. For Japan, in contrast, even a skeptic would end up favoring the sticky price hypothesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Long run {{real money}} demand and {{velocity}} function for the <b>narrow</b> monetary <b>aggregate</b> M 1 are tested {{by means of}} the cointegration approach developed by Johansen and Juselius (1990). The results support the existence of a systematic relationship between M 1 -velocity, the rate of interest and the exchange rate. An interesting aspect of the trivariate error correction vector autoregressive analysis is the evidence of bidirectional causality between the exchange rate and velocity. Furthermore, changes in the rate of interest provide information that helps predict future movements of M 1 -velocity. Finally, the results derived from Engle and Granger (1987) two-step procedure suggest that M 1 -velocity is subject to control through policy-induced interest rate and exchange rate movements, thus justifying the adoption of M 1 as a useful monetary target. ...|$|R
