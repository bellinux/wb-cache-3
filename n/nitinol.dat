25|$|Left atrial {{appendage}} occlusion is an experimental alternative to anticoagulants. During cardiac catheterization, a device (such as the Watchman device) consisting of an expandable <b>nitinol</b> frame is {{introduced into the}} left {{atrial appendage}}, the source of blood clots in more than 90% of cases. A trial comparing closure against warfarin therapy found closure to be non-inferior when measured against a composite end point of stroke, cardiovascular death and systemic embolism.|$|E
25|$|For aneurysms in the aorta, arms, legs, or head, the {{weakened}} {{section of}} the vessel may {{be replaced by a}} bypass graft that is sutured at the vascular stumps. Instead of sewing, the graft tube ends, made rigid and expandable by <b>nitinol</b> wireframe, can be easily inserted in its reduced diameter into the vascular stumps and then expanded up to the most appropriate diameter and permanently fixed there by external ligature. New devices were recently developed to substitute the external ligature by expandable ring allowing use in acute ascending aorta dissection, providing airtight (i.e. not dependent on the coagulation integrity), easy and quick anastomosis extended to the arch concavity Less invasive endovascular techniques allow covered metallic stent grafts to be inserted through the arteries of the leg and deployed across the aneurysm.|$|E
2500|$|Percutaneous {{closure of}} an ASD is {{currently}} only indicated for {{the closure of}} secundum ASDs with a sufficient rim of tissue around the septal defect so that the closure device does not impinge upon the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, or the tricuspid or mitral valves. [...] The Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO) is commonly used to close ASDs. [...] The ASO consists of two self-expandable round discs connected to {{each other with a}} 4-mm waist, made up of 0.004â€“ to 0.005-inch <b>Nitinol</b> wire mesh filled with Dacron fabric. Implantation of the device is relatively easy. The prevalence of residual defect is low. The disadvantages are a thick profile of the device and concern related to a large amount of <b>nitinol</b> (a nickel-titanium compound) in the device and consequent potential for nickel toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|SEMS may be {{coated with}} {{chemicals}} {{designed to prevent}} tumour ingrowth; these are termed [...] "covered" [...] stents. <b>Nitinol</b> (a shape memory nickel-titanium alloy), polyurethane, and polyethylene are typically used as coatings for SEMS. Covered stents carry the advantage of preventing tumours from growing into the stent, although they {{run the risk of}} increased migration after deployment.|$|E
50|$|Nickel titanium, {{also known}} as <b>Nitinol</b> (part of shape memory alloy), is a metal alloy of nickel and titanium, where the two {{elements}} are present in roughly equal atomic percentages e.g. <b>Nitinol</b> 55, <b>Nitinol</b> 60.|$|E
5000|$|<b>NiTiNOL</b> 60, or 60 <b>NiTiNOL,</b> is a Nickel Titanium alloy (nominally Ni-40wt% Ti) {{discovered}} in the late 1950s by the U. S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory (hence the [...] "NOL" [...] portion of the name <b>NiTiNOL).</b> [...] Depending upon the heat treat history, 60 <b>NiTiNOL</b> {{has the ability to}} exhibit either superelastic properties in the hardened state or shape memory characteristics in the softened state.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nitinol</b> is {{difficult}} to weld, both to itself and other materials. Laser welding <b>nitinol</b> to itself is a relatively routine process. More recently, strong joints between NiTi wires and stainless steel wires have been made using nickel filler. Laser and Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welds have been made between NiTi tubes and stainless steel tubes [...] More research is ongoing into other processes and other metals to which <b>nitinol</b> can be welded.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitinol</b> {{biocompatibility}} is {{an important}} factor in biomedical applications. <b>Nitinol</b> (NiTi), which is formed by alloying nickel and titanium (~ 50% Ni), is a shape memory alloy with superelastic properties more similar to that of bone, when in compared to stainless steel, another commonly used biomaterial. Biomedical applications that utilize <b>Nitinol</b> include stents, heart valve tools, bone anchors, staples, septal defect devices and implants. It is a commonly used biomaterial especially in the development of stent technology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitinol</b> {{is highly}} {{biocompatible}} and has properties {{suitable for use}} in orthopedic implants. Due to Nitinol's unique properties it has seen a large demand for use in less invasive medical devices. <b>Nitinol</b> tubing is commonly used in catheters, stents, and superelastic needles.|$|E
5000|$|Stiquito's [...] "muscles" [...] {{are made}} of <b>nitinol,</b> a shape memory alloy that expands and contracts, roughly emulating the {{operation}} of a muscle. The application of heat causes a crystalline structure change in the wire. <b>Nitinol</b> contracts when heated and returns to its original size and shape when cooled.|$|E
50|$|Fatigue {{failures}} of <b>nitinol</b> devices are a constant subject of discussion. Because {{it is the}} material of choice for applications requiring enormous flexibility and motion (e.g., peripheral stents, heart valves, smart thermomechanical actuators and electromechanical microactuators), it is necessarily exposed to much greater fatigue strains compared to other metals. While the strain-controlled fatigue performance of <b>nitinol</b> is superior to all other known metals, fatigue failures have been observed in the most demanding applications. There {{is a great deal}} of effort underway trying to better understand and define the durability limits of <b>nitinol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The late 1980s saw the {{commercial}} introduction of <b>Nitinol</b> as an enabling technology {{in a number}} of minimally invasive endovascular medical applications. While more costly than stainless steel, the self expanding properties of <b>Nitinol</b> alloys manufactured to BTR (Body Temperature Response), have provided an attractive alternative to balloon expandable devices in stent grafts where it gives the ability to adapt to the shape of certain blood vessels when exposed to body temperature. On average, [...] of all peripheral vascular stents currently available on the worldwide market are manufactured with <b>Nitinol.</b>|$|E
50|$|In dentistry, the {{material}} is used in orthodontics for brackets and wires connecting the teeth. Once the SMA wire {{is placed in the}} mouth its temperature rises to ambient body temperature. This causes the <b>nitinol</b> to contract back to its original shape, applying a constant force to move the teeth. These SMA wires {{do not need to be}} retightened as often as other wires because they can contract as the teeth move unlike conventional stainless steel wires. Additionally, <b>nitinol</b> can be used in endodontics, where <b>nitinol</b> files are used to clean and shape the root canals during the root canal procedure. Because of the high fatigue tolerance and flexibility of <b>nitinol,</b> it greatly decreases the possibility of an endodontic file breaking inside the tooth during root canal treatment, thus improving safety for the patient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitinol</b> is half nickel, {{and thus}} {{there has been}} a great deal of concern in the medical {{industry}} regarding the release of nickel, a known allergen and possible carcinogen. (Nickel is also present in substantial amounts in stainless steel and cobalt-chrome alloys.) When properly treated (via electropolishing and/or passivation), <b>nitinol</b> forms a very stable protective TiO2 layer that acts as a very effective and self-healing barrier against ion exchange. It has been repeatedly shown that <b>nitinol</b> releases nickel at a slower pace than stainless steel, for example. With that said, very early medical devices were made without electropolishing, and corrosion was observed. Today's <b>nitinol</b> vascular self-expandable metallic stents, for example, show no evidence of corrosion or nickel release, and the outcomes in patients with and without nickel allergies are indistinguishable.|$|E

50|$|Actuation {{frequency}} of <b>nitinol</b> {{is dependent on}} the heat management, especially during the cooling phase. Numerous methods are used to increase the cooling performance, such as forced air, flowing liquids, thermoelectric modules (i.e. Peltier or semiconductor heat pumps), heat sinks, conductive materials and higher surface-to-volume ratio (improvements up to 3.3 Hz with very thin wires and up to 100 Hz with thinfilm <b>nitinol).</b> The fastest <b>nitinol</b> actuation recorded was carried by a high voltage capacitor discharge which heated an SMA wire in a manner of microseconds, and resulted in a complete phase transformation (and high velocities) in a few milliseconds.|$|E

50|$|Surface {{passivation}} {{techniques can}} greatly increase the corrosion resistance of <b>nitinol.</b> In order for <b>nitinol</b> {{to have the}} desired superelastic and shape memory properties, heat treatment is required. After heat treatment, the surface oxide layer contains a larger concentration of nickel {{in the form of}} NiO2 and NiO. This increase in nickel has been attributed to the diffusion of nickel out of the bulk material and into the surface layer during elevated temperature treatments. Surface characterization methods have shown that some surface passivation treatments decrease the concentration of NiO2 and NiO within the surface layer, leaving a higher concentration of the more stable TiO2 than in raw, heat-treated <b>Nitinol.</b>|$|E

50|$|Shape memory heparin {{mimicking}} polymers {{can be used}} {{to create}} devices that extract hemorrhaging tissue. Microactuator (right) is a prototype endovascular electromechanical clot-extraction device. This device consists of electromechanical microactuator mounted on the distal tip of either a Prowler-14 microcatheter The microactuator is fabricated using a shape memory polymer (SMP) shell over a shape memory nickel-titanium alloy (<b>nitinol)</b> wire backbone with attached copper leads to deliver a current. The microactuator maintains a straight rod shape until the applied current, provided by a DC power supply, heating the <b>nitinol</b> wire, causing the microactuator to transform into a corkscrew shape capable of retrieving a blood clot. At body temperature, the overlying SMP is in a glassy state and maintains the <b>nitinol</b> tightly coiled configuration in a straight form for endovascular delivery. Once the microactuator is positioned beyond the clot, joule heating is initiated. As the surrounding SMP is heated by conduction to its characteristic glass-transition temperature (Tg â‰ˆ 80 Â°C), it transitions to its rubbery state, allowing the <b>nitinol</b> to resume its corkscrew shape. Retrieval of the blood clot occurs through a pull back motion. The <b>nitinol</b> is engulfed in a tight space even though it is expanding and as a result retreats thus extracting the tissue.|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{application}} of <b>nitinol</b> wire is in female contraception, specifically in intrauterine devices.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{application}} is active tuning of structural natural frequency using <b>Nitinol</b> wires to dampen vibrations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nitinol</b> is {{typically}} composed of approximately 50 to 51% nickel by atomic percent (55 to 56% weight percent). Making {{small changes in}} the composition can change the transition temperature of the alloy significantly. Transformation temperatures in <b>nitinol</b> can be controlled to some extent, where Af temperature ranges from about âˆ’20 Â°C to +110 Â°C. Thus, it is common practice {{to refer to a}} <b>nitinol</b> formulation as [...] "superelastic" [...] or [...] "austenitic" [...] if Af is lower than a reference temperature, while as [...] "shape memory" [...] or [...] "martensitic" [...] if higher. The reference temperature is usually defined as the room temperature or the human body temperature (37 Â°C; 98 Â°F).|$|E
50|$|New {{advances}} with micro {{laser welding}} have vastly improved {{the quality of}} medical devices made with <b>nitinol.</b>|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the high}} damping {{capacity}} of Superelastic <b>nitinol,</b> it is also used as a golf club insert.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitinol</b> is also {{popular in}} {{extremely}} resilient glasses frames. It {{is also used}} in some mechanical watch springs.|$|E
50|$|Hot {{working of}} <b>nitinol</b> is {{relatively}} easy, but cold working {{is difficult because}} the enormous elasticity of the alloy increases die or roll contact, leading to tremendous frictional resistance and tool wear. For similar reasons, machining is extremely difficultâ€”to make things worse, the thermal conductivity of <b>nitinol</b> is poor, so heat is difficult to be removed. Grinding (abrasive cutting), Electrical discharge machining (EDM) and laser cutting are all relatively easy.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{treating}} <b>nitinol</b> is {{delicate and}} critical. It is the knowledge intensive process to fine-tune the transformation temperatures. Aging {{time and temperature}} controls the precipitation of various Ni-rich phases, and thus controls how much nickel resides in the NiTi lattice; by depleting the matrix of nickel, aging increases the transformation temperature. The combination of heat treatment and cold working is essential in controlling the properties of <b>nitinol</b> products.|$|E
