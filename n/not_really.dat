5|$|In {{regards to}} {{composing}} {{the song and}} its lyrical meaning, Allen noted that, Mark's got a very good ear. He's very relaxed {{in the studio and}} very thoughtful.

5|$|Like {{many other}} German veterans, Göring was {{a proponent of}} the Stab-in-the-back legend, the belief which held that the German Army had <b>not</b> <b>really</b> lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the {{civilian}} leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the Republicans, who had overthrown the German monarchy.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} several round towers {{have been found}} in Malta, and they are {{believed}} to date back to the late Punic or Roman periods.

5|$|By his writing, Espejo {{wanted to}} educate the people and to awaken a rebellious spirit in them.

5|$|Occasionalism is {{the view}} espoused by Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are <b>not</b> <b>really</b> causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects {{by an act of}} God's intervention on each specific occasion.|$|E

I think people are quite used to girls in this industry really being able to move in front of the camera, but I'm just rubbish at that kind of thing.|$|E

5|$|After the 1836 election, Harrison did <b>not</b> <b>really</b> stop {{running for}} president, nor did his {{supporters}} stop boosting him—an Ohio political convention endorsed him {{as early as}} 1837. His finances were somewhat secured by his appointment as clerk of Hamilton County's circuit court, a post that paid no salary, but allowed considerable income from fees. The years between 1838 and 1840 were years of personal tragedy for the general, as three of his adult children died and his wife Anna fell seriously ill. Harrison {{did his best to}} manage a network of acquaintances and supporters from his home in North Bend, corresponding extensively and seeking to have items favorable to him placed in the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Anjali Sharma is {{no longer}} the tomboy she was in college, she has become a {{beautiful}} woman and is now engaged to Aman Mehra (Salman Khan), an NRI living in London. However, she explains to her mother (Reema Lagoo) that she does <b>not</b> <b>really</b> love him and is marrying him as a compromise as she feels she can never love again after losing Rahul. Aman also suspects that she does <b>not</b> <b>really</b> love him. Determined to reunite her father and his best friend, Anjali Khanna and her grandmother search for Anjali Sharma and soon learn that {{she is going to be}} working at a summer camp in Shimla. Rahul tells his daughter that she is not allowed to attend the summer camp and heads to a conference, only to find out that his mom and daughter went without telling him, having left a letter for him.

One night while watching television, Anjali Sharma realizes she has met Rahul's daughter, and that Tina is dead. Rahul soon arrives at Camp Sunshine, after his daughter fakes a fever, where he and Anjali Sharma are surprised and delighted to see each other again, sharing a sweet reunion.

She runs away in tears, after which Aman arrives and tells Rahul that he is Anjali's fiancee. Rahul is heartbroken but congratulates Anjali. She takes this as him rejecting her again, so she leaves the summer camp and decides to get married to Aman as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew {{with the}} concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a {{movement}} began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were <b>not</b> <b>really</b> part of the Britpop scene, included The Verve and Radiohead. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead - although having achieved moderate recognition with The Bends in 1995 - achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).|$|E

Carey has had {{refractive}} surgery to correct his vision and therefore did <b>not</b> <b>really</b> require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him). However, while this was true for several years, on the May 17, 2006, episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals. As of 2007, Carey resides in Los Angeles and New York City.|$|E

The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also Minister of Defense, announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM batteries in two hours.
