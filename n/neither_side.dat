5|$|French forces not {{retreating}} {{with the}} Guard were surrounded in their positions and eliminated, <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> asking for nor offering quarter. The French Young Guard Division reported 96per cent casualties, and two-thirds of Lobau's Corps ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|These {{negotiations}} {{broke down}} in 2005, when <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> could agree on the research protocol and the research project was cancelled. More {{progress has been made}} on the environmental front. In 2005, the first U.S.-Vietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held.|$|E
5|$|Considered by itself, Artemisium was a {{relatively}} insignificant battle. The Allies did not defeat the Persian navy, nor prevent it from advancing further {{along the coast of}} Greece. Conversely, neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet, nor irreparably weaken it. The battle was thus an indecisive one, which pleased <b>neither</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
50|$|The opponents did not {{immediately}} engage with each other. They encamped {{close to each other}} and spent some days skirmishing. When <b>neither</b> <b>sides</b> gained any advantage, the respective commanders decided on battle.|$|R
50|$|Quarter finals, Sarawak {{were drawn}} with Felda United. Sarawak first leg away game ended goalless with <b>neither</b> <b>sides</b> {{put the ball}} into the net. In Stadium Negeri, Sarawak were held drawn 2-2 and Felda were through to semis with away goals advantage.|$|R
50|$|The {{first half}} of the game ended in a draw with <b>neither</b> <b>sides</b> scoring a goal, though each had good scoring opportunities. Gary van Egmond made a risky change to his sides {{starting}} formation, playing with a back three. In the 64th minute Mark Bridge scored the only goal after Tony Vidmar slipped, giving the ball to Bridge in the last quarter.|$|R
5|$|During the deadlock, <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> {{was able}} to secure a {{definite}} victory in capturing the mountaintop, but the US forces succeeded in their mission of preventing the North Koreans from advancing beyond Battle Mountain, {{paving the way for}} the North Koreans' eventual defeat and withdrawal from the area after the Battle of Inchon.|$|E
5|$|In 1204, John lost Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou to Philip II of France, leaving English {{power on}} the {{continent}} limited to Gascony and Poitou. John raised {{taxes to pay for}} military campaigns to regain his lands, but unrest grew among many of the English barons; John sought new allies by declaring England a Papal fiefdom, owing allegiance to the Pope. In 1215, John and the rebel barons negotiated a potential peace treaty, the Magna Carta. The treaty would have limited potential abuses of royal power, demobilised the rebel armies and set up a power-sharing arrangement, but in practice <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> complied with its conditions. John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the Magna Carta and the First Barons' War erupted, with the rebel barons aided by Philip's son, the future Louis VIII, who claimed the English throne for himself. The war soon settled into a stalemate, with <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> able to claim victory. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry as his heir.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, Britain and France {{declared}} war on Germany following the German invasion of Poland. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council decided {{to stay on the}} defensive along the border, relying on the Maginot Line in helping counter an anticipated German offensive across the German-French border. As <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> made any offensive moves, a Drôle de Guerre (Phoney War) developed as both sides stood-off along the border.|$|E
60|$|Emlyn set {{the matter}} before Cicely, urging <b>neither</b> one <b>side</b> nor the other, and waited her judgment. It was swift and decisive.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought from 4 to 8 May 1942, {{was a major}} naval {{battle between}} the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and naval and air forces from the United States and Australia, {{taking place in the}} Pacific Theatre of the Second World War. The battle is {{historically}} significant as the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other, as well as the first in which <b>neither</b> <b>side's</b> ships sighted or fired directly upon the other.|$|R
40|$|A new dance fly (Empididae: Empidinae) with hugely {{modified}} male fore tarsus, {{either on}} the right, left, both or <b>neither</b> <b>sides,</b> is described from Japan. Such massive polymorphic asymmetry occurring with so high an incidence in a population is previously unreported. In view of the courtship behaviour of other Empidinae, we hypothesize that the oversized tarsus is a secondary sexual character employed by males for attracting females. Alternative hypotheses are also discussed. We suggest that this extraordinary new species is a potential model {{for the study of}} mating biology in Empidinae and the evolution of mating systems in general...|$|R
5|$|In {{some ways}} the run-up to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the game {{turned into a}} {{defensive}} battle. <b>Neither</b> <b>side</b> scored {{until late in the}} third quarter, when Tech took advantage of a State fumble to score the first touchdown of the second half. Tech failed to convert a two-point conversion, but NC State fumbled again on the ensuing possession, and Tech was able to drive for another touchdown. Leading 22–21, Tech attempted another two-point conversion, which also failed.|$|E
5|$|John and {{the rebel}} barons {{did not trust}} each other, and <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> seriously {{attempted}} to implement the peace accord. The 25 barons selected for the new council were all rebels, chosen by the more extremist barons, and many among the rebels found excuses to keep their forces mobilised. Disputes began to emerge between those rebels who had expected the charter to return lands that had been confiscated and the royalist faction.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{sides of}} the single {{received}} a lot of airplay on local Detroit stations, but problems very quickly arose. The first version of the song was withdrawn because it was considered [...] "too raw", and a smoother take was released. Gordy did little to promote the single’s A-side, and, some time later, the label discovered that the song could be conceived to have a scandalous [...] "double meaning", and switch to pushing the B-side alone before ceasing promotion of the single altogether. <b>Neither</b> <b>sides</b> of the single charted nationally, but were smash hits on several regional charts in parts of the country.|$|R
5000|$|Young {{made his}} senior debut for Middlesbrough on 23 April 1921 {{at home to}} Chelsea in the First Division, a match in which Middlesbrough made four changes to their forward line. In the first minute, Young [...] "darted forward in {{threatening}} fashion, but finished his fine individual effort shooting just over the bar"; <b>neither</b> <b>side's</b> players could do better, and the match ended goalless. He was retained for the 1921-22 season, but made no more first-team appearances, and he signed for Third Division North runners-up Darlington {{in the summer of}} 1922, ahead of their second season in the Football League.|$|R
60|$|In {{an instant}} three others bared {{their weapons and}} ranged {{themselves}} beside him. The remaining two--of whom was Lucagnolo--folded their hands, manifesting by that impassivity that they were minded to take <b>neither</b> one <b>side</b> nor the other.|$|R
5|$|Alcibiades first rose to {{prominence}} {{when he began}} advocating aggressive Athenian action after {{the signing of the}} Peace of Nicias. That treaty, an uneasy truce between Sparta and Athens signed midway through the Peloponnesian War, came at the end of seven years of fighting during which <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> had gained a decisive advantage. Historians Arnold W. Gomme and Raphael Sealey believe, and Thucydides reports, that Alcibiades was offended that the Spartans had negotiated that treaty through Nicias and Laches, overlooking him on account of his youth.|$|E
5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. <b>Neither</b> <b>side</b> {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Both Allied and Japanese {{naval forces}} {{continued}} to converge on 22 August {{and both sides}} conducted intense aircraft scouting efforts, however <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> spotted its adversary. The disappearance {{of at least one}} of their scouting aircraft (shot down by aircraft from Enterprise before it could send a radio report), caused the Japanese to strongly suspect that U.S. carriers were in the immediate area. The U.S., however, was unaware of the disposition and strength of approaching Japanese surface warship forces.|$|E
25|$|In Destiny of the Daleks (1979), it was {{revealed}} that Davros had survived the Daleks' attack and lived on, buried in a bunker in suspended animation. During the time Davros was sleeping, the Daleks had abandoned the ruins of Skaro and established a vast interstellar empire, eventually encountering a hostile race of androids called the Movellans. The Dalek and Movellan warfleets were very evenly matched, and <b>neither</b> <b>side's</b> purely logical battle computers could find a successful strategy for an attack against the other. As a result, the two fleets remained locked in a standoff for centuries, constantly manoeuvring and probing for an opportunity to break the stalemate but without either side actually firing a single shot.|$|R
50|$|Both sides claimed victory with {{roughly equal}} casualties, but <b>neither</b> <b>side's</b> {{accomplishment}} was impressive. George B. McClellan's advance on Richmond was halted and the Army of Northern Virginia {{fell back into}} the Richmond defensive works. Union casualties were 5,031 (790 killed, 3,594 wounded, 647 captured or missing) and Confederate 6,134 (980 killed, 4,749 wounded, 405 captured or missing). The battle was frequently remembered by the Union soldiers as the Battle of Fair Oaks Station because that is where they did their best fighting, whereas the Confederates, for the same reason, called it Seven Pines. Historian Stephen W. Sears remarked that its current common name, Seven Pines, is the most appropriate because {{it was at the}} crossroads of Seven Pines that the heaviest fighting and highest casualties occurred.|$|R
500|$|During the Second Schleswig War of 1864, Don Juan d'Austria was {{deployed}} {{with the}} ship of the line [...] and two other vessels to the North Sea, but arrived too late {{to take part in}} any fighting, then-Commodore Wilhelm von Tegetthoff having already inflicted a strategic defeat on the Danish squadron at the Battle of Heligoland. All three ships saw action during the Seven Weeks' War that pitted Austria against Prussia and Italy two years later. The war at sea culminated at the Battle of Lissa in July 1866, where all three ships were heavily engaged, though they were not seriously damaged and inflicted little on their Italian opponents. <b>Neither</b> <b>side's</b> ships carried guns strong enough to defeat their opponents armor plating. After the war, the ships were disarmed and [...]|$|R
5|$|Despite these successes, Matilda {{was unable}} to {{consolidate}} her position. Miles of Gloucester, {{one of the most}} talented of her military commanders, had died while hunting over the previous Christmas. Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion against Stephen in the east ended with his death in September 1144 during an attack on Burwell Castle. As a result, Stephen made progress against Matilda's forces in the west in 1145, recapturing Faringdon Castle in Oxfordshire. Matilda authorised Reginald, the Earl of Cornwall, to attempt fresh peace negotiations, but <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> was prepared to compromise.|$|E
5|$|In Nuenen, Van Gogh {{focused on}} {{painting}} and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined {{him on his}} forays; {{she fell in love}} and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|In the {{engagement}} on 4 August 1800 <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> {{had a single}} man killed or wounded; the action still inflicted a severe naval defeat on a powerful French frigate force, ending its successful raiding career. Although Captain Jurien in Franchise spent another three weeks off the Brazilian coast before returning to France. On 9 August he encountered the merchantman Wellesley, which {{was on her way}} to the Cape, but after an engagement of about an hour, the British ship succeeded in driving off her attacker. Jurien followed Wellesley for two days but then gave up the chase; he then did not see another sail until he left the area.|$|E

5|$|Nine weeks later, with <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> {{winning the}} {{majority}} of electors, the House (now Republican-controlled) will decide the President and the Senate (Democrat-controlled) for the Vice President, the first instance of this happening since the 1824 presidential election aftermath. Claire eventually wins when Donald Blythe issues a bill to block any filibuster of coming onto the floor; while the house couldn't reach a majority. In the meantime, Claire is sworn in as Acting President of the United States and begins to exert her limited power by excluding Frank from certain presidential functions, such as the swearing-in of the new Justice of the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|North Korean forces {{began making}} {{gains in the}} hills along the river {{adjacent}} to their bridgehead, against positions of the 34th Infantry. Coordinated attacks pushed A Company to the north back from their hills with heavy casualties on August 7. K Company to the south was also attacked but held its line, reinforced by L Company on August 10. Fighting continued for several days, resulting in heavy casualties as both sides captured and recaptured the hills along the Naktong, <b>neither</b> <b>side</b> able to gain a decisive advantage against the other.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 1780, Arnold {{obtained}} {{command of}} West Point. On August 15, {{he received a}} coded letter from André with Clinton's final offer: £20,000 and no indemnification for his losses. <b>Neither</b> <b>side</b> knew for some days that the other was in agreement with that offer, due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines. Arnold's letters continued to detail Washington's troop movements and provide information about French reinforcements that were being organized. On August 25, Peggy finally delivered to him Clinton's agreement to the terms.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 November, the 2/7 and 2/5 Air Cavalry Battalions {{were ordered}} to march out the landing zone heading north bound toward LZ Albany and {{north-northeast}} bound toward LZ Columbus {{to make way for}} the B-52 bombers to strike the enemy troops remaining in LZ X-Ray areas and various other locations of the Chu Pong-Ia Drang complex. Upon approaching the LZ Albany vicinity, the 2/7 Air Cavalry walked into a [...] "meeting engagement" [...] with units of the 1/33 and 8/66 Battalions, in which <b>neither</b> <b>sides</b> had anticipated. The Air Cavalry troops sustained heavy lost with 151 killed in action and 121 wounded in action. The enemy's casualties were much heavier with 403 body count killed, 100 estimated killed and 112 weapons captured. During the day, B-52 bombers continued carpet bombing the Chu Pong-Ia Drang complex.|$|R
50|$|The {{point system}} was FIFA's 3-1-0 (W-D-L). The league had a {{balanced}} schedule with each team playing the others {{a total of}} four times, twice each home and away.
