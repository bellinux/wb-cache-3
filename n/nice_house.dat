2500|$|Our {{street was}} called Carr Street after my Father. We {{had a very}} <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> and a lovely garden... Carr Street was a very fine street. The dirt road waved {{up and down and}} in and out. the horses made it that way, zigzagging the carts and {{carriages}} through it. The rest of the street was green grass and wild roses. [...] In front of our place Father had made a gravel walk but after our trees stopped there were just two planks to walk on.|$|E

60|$|ELLIE. Was I? I forget. Tell me. Do {{you like}} {{this part of the}} country? I heard you ask Mr Hushabye at dinner whether there are any <b>nice</b> <b>houses</b> to let down here.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} that means! James, why aren't you a little more human? You get heaps of invitations to <b>nice</b> <b>houses.</b> Much better {{go out and make}} some women friends. You ought to marry, you know." ...|$|R
50|$|By 1862 the Streiffs were prosperous {{enough to}} build a <b>nicer</b> <b>house</b> for themselves. It is the oldest {{surviving}} building on the farm, but is not the house pictured at right. Their 1862 farmhouse is in gabled ell form with the then-popular Greek Revival-styled cornice returns, and with bay windows and lunette windows in the gables.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. [As though {{talking to}} herself.] I've got {{a husband who}} adores me and a <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> to live in. I've got a {{position}} and {{as much money as}} I want. I'm safe. I'm respectable. I ought to be happy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will intercede with my husband, ma'am,' she said. 'He's a true man if rightly managed; and I'll beg him to {{consider}} your position. 'Tis a very <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> you've got here,' she added, glancing round, 'and well worth a little sacrifice to keep it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{was meant}} to be a burglar," [...] he said placidly, [...] "and I have no doubt I should have been if I hadn't {{happened}} to be born in that <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> next door. I can't see any harm in it, anyhow." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{population of}} Retsof was mostly of Italian origin; {{they lived in}} a company town where the salt mine owned the houses and a store and maintained the small village. The Italian families lived together with a few non Italians. The others who were mostly bosses lived on the 'Avenue' in <b>nicer</b> <b>houses</b> with indoor plumbing.|$|R
60|$|The last sound Peter {{heard before}} he was quite alone were the mermaids {{retiring}} one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He {{was too far away}} to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the <b>nicest</b> <b>houses</b> on the mainland), and he heard the bells.|$|R
60|$|For {{the next}} few days, monsieur, I am in Paradise. My 'ost has much <b>nice</b> <b>'ouse</b> in Eaton Square. He is rich, popular. There is much society. And I--I have the succes fou. I am young, 'andsome, debonair. I cannot speak the English very well--not so well as I now speak 'im--but I manage. I get along. I am intelligent, amiable. Everyone loves me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle {{would be}} delighted," [...] said Mrs. Berry, with a wilful {{blinking}} of plain facts. [...] "He’s got {{nothing better to}} do; it’s a <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> and good food, and he could sit at the open window and sniff at the sea all day long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Mr. Jernshaw. [...] "I don’t {{know the}} sex, then, that’s all. If {{you think that}} you’re going to keep a <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> like this all to yourself, you’re mistaken. It’s a home; and where there’s a home a woman comes in, somehow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{look quite}} {{happy in the}} future, mother," [...] {{retorted}} Elsa cheerily; [...] "especially when I have seen you and father installed in that <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> in the Kender Road, with your garden and your cows and your pigs and a maid to wait on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid it}} will be hard enough to get a really {{suitable}} house," [...] warned Priscilla. [...] "Don't expect too much, Anne. <b>Nice</b> <b>houses</b> in <b>nice</b> localities will probably be away beyond our means. We'll likely have to content ourselves with a shabby little place on some street whereon live people whom to know is to be unknown, and make life inside compensate for the outside." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{realization}} of smooth execution of public street enterprise and good communication with inhabitants needs {{the way of}} easy and right explanation which the inhabitants understand the street planning, and the scheme of administration and inhabitants make the <b>nice</b> <b>housing</b> environment together.

The applicability of the presentation system is made clear using in the real project...|$|R
50|$|The Great Depression {{led many}} of the community's mansions to be {{converted}} into multi-family housing. The neighborhood lost its elitist cachet, and by the 1960s {{many of the}} <b>nicer</b> <b>houses</b> in the area had been torn down or condemned. Starting in the 1970s, however, Munger Place began to be rediscovered, as enterprising individuals recognized the historic architecture (particularly Prairie Style) and large spaces behind the neighborhood's dilapidated veneer.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{went to live}} at Radnor and for {{a little}} while {{everything}} went well. Margaret had a <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> and was gay and happy. She dressed beautiful and entertained a good deal. Then--well, Ronald Fraser's first wife turned up looking for him! She wasn't dead after all.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mercy on us, if that's {{your idea}} of a <b>nice</b> <b>house!</b> But I don't know--I have always kept out of it,' Lady Davenant added, {{checking}} herself. Then she went on, 'If you are so fond of Mrs. Berrington I am sorry to inform you that she is absolutely good-for-nothing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{it is like}} a bit of England, Master Wilfrid! That {{might very}} well be the Thames there, and this some gentleman's place near Reading; only the trees are different. When we get up a <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> here, with a garden round it, it will be like home again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not go to town!" [...] cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, [...] "I {{shall be}} quite {{disappointed}} {{if you do}} not. I could get the <b>nicest</b> <b>house</b> in world for you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public." ...|$|R

50|$|Noordhoek can be {{accessed}} either from the spectacular scenic coastal road, Chapman's Peak Drive, which leads out of Hout Bay or via the mountain road Ou Kaapse Weg which cuts through the beautiful Silvermine Nature Reserve - {{now part of the}} Table Mountain National Park. Noordhoek is a small scattered community of <b>nice</b> <b>houses,</b> often with sea views and has a large horse population as riding on the long sandy beach is a great attraction. Many artists live in Noordhoek.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, young man," [...] he exclaimed, {{holding out}} his hand, [...] "I am much obliged for that {{recommendation}} of yours to these people! I have taken a house in Connaught Place--a real <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> it is, too. Come and see us--number 17. The wife and daughters land to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|Annie {{lived in}} a <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> and had a little maid. Paul ran gaily up the steps. He {{expected}} his mother laughing in the hall, but it was Annie who opened to him. She seemed distant to him. He stood a second in dismay. Annie let him kiss her cheek.|$|E
6000|$|K.--So am I. Sold {{out just}} in time. Much better fun being here, than having the cholera at Scutari. <b>Nice</b> <b>house,</b> Milliken's. Snob, but good fellow--good cellar, doosid good cook. Really, that salmi yesterday,--couldn't have it better {{done at the}} [...] "Rag" [...] now. You have got into good {{quarters}} here, mother.|$|E

50|$|The {{site where}} Arden was built was {{originally}} {{occupied by the}} c. 1678 Josiah Barnard House, which was described in 1829 {{as one of the}} <b>nicest</b> <b>houses</b> of its time. This house was torn down in 1846 {{to make way for the}} construction of Arden. It was built for John Dove, a Scottish immigrant who, along with Peter Smith, established the first flax mill in Andover. The builder was Jacob Chickering, a leading local builder, who may have had design guidance for Theodore Voelkers. Dove's family held the property until 1891.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, dear, {{more like}} this than {{anything}} else you have ever seen; but the sun does not always shine so brightly as it does just now, and sometimes there are terrible snow-storms. But we will build you a <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> Eda, with a very large fireplace, so that we won't feel the cold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, {{with a large}} toleration of tone and a deep breath that {{expanded}} his ample chest, [...] "we spend more on our houses nowadays. I started out to build a forty-thousand-dollar house. Well, sir! that fellow has got me in for more than sixty thousand already, and I doubt if I {{get out of it}} much under a hundred. You can't have a <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> for nothing. It's just like ordering a picture of a painter. You pay him enough, and he can afford to paint you a first-class picture; and if you don't, he can't. That's all there is of it. Why, they tell me that A. T. Stewart gave one of those French fellows sixty thousand dollars for a little seven-by-nine picture the other day. Yes, sir, give an architect money enough, and he'll give you a <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> every time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You've a <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> Joseph,' I {{could not}} refrain from observing, 'and {{pleasant}} inmates; and I think the concentrated essence {{of all the}} madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with theirs! However, {{that is not to}} the present purpose--there are other rooms. For heaven's sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!' ...|$|E
50|$|Roodepoort {{is another}} major {{formerly}} independent municipality, recently incorporated into Johannesburg. Roodepoort's previously predominantly white population is changing as {{its proximity to}} Soweto has made it attractive to middle-class black {{people who want to}} move to <b>nicer</b> <b>houses</b> while maintaining ties to their old communities. There is ample access from the more affluent northern residential areas to the inner city. However, links are poor towards high economic and commercial areas in the north, such as Randburg and Sandton. This gives rise to increasing numbers of secondary roads, creating congestion and putting pressure on residential areas and infrastructure.|$|R
