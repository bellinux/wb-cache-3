50|$|Magnetic {{sequential}} access memory is typically used for secondary storage in general-purpose computers due to their higher density at lower cost compared to RAM, as well as resistance to wear and <b>non-volatility.</b> Magnetic tape is the only type of {{sequential access}} memory still in use; historically, drum memory has also been used.|$|E

"Non-volatile" [...] {{products}} may use {{volatile memory}} during normal operation and dump the contents into non-volatile memory if the power fails, using an on-board backup power source. Volatile memory is faster than non-volatile; it is byte-addressable; {{and it can}} be written to arbitrarily, without concerns about wear and device lifespan. However, including a second memory to achieve <b>non-volatility</b> (and the on-board backup power source) increases the product cost compared to volatile memory.|$|E

50|$|The {{lanthanides}} form {{very stable}} polonides of formula LnPo with the halite (NaCl) structure: as the +2 oxidation state is disfavoured for most lanthanides, these are probably {{best described as}} intermetallic compounds rather than charge-separated ionic species. These compounds are stable to at least 1600 °C (the melting point of thulium polonide, TmPo, is 2200 °C), in contrast the ionic polonides (including the lanthanide sesquipolonides Ln2Po3) which decompose at around 600 °C. The thermal stability and <b>non-volatility</b> of these compounds (polonium metal boils at 962 °C) is important for their use in polonium-based heat sources.|$|E
50|$|Those who {{required}} real RAM-like {{performance and}} <b>non-volatility</b> typically {{have had to}} use conventional RAM devices and a battery backup. This nonvolatile BIOS memory, often called CMOS RAM or parameter RAM, was a common solution in earlier computer systems like the original Apple Macintosh, which used {{a small amount of}} memory powered by a battery for storing basic setup information like the selected boot volume. Much larger battery backed memories are still used today as caches for high-speed databases, requiring a performance level newer NVRAM devices have not yet managed to meet.|$|E
50|$|Persistent memory {{capabilities}} {{extend beyond}} <b>non-volatility</b> of stored bits. For instance, {{the loss of}} key metadata, such as page table entries or other constructs that translate virtual addresses to physical addresses, may render durable bits non-persistent. In this respect, persistent memory resembles more abstract forms of computer storage, such as file systems. In fact, almost all existing persistent memory technologies implement at least a basic file system {{that can be used}} for associating names or identifiers with stored extents, and at a minimum provide file system methods {{that can be used for}} naming and allocating such extents.|$|E
50|$|Phase-change {{memory has}} many near ideal memory qualities such as <b>non-volatility,</b> fast {{switching}} speed, high endurance {{of more than}} 1013 read -write cycles, non-destructive read, direct overwriting and long data retention time of more than 10 years. The one advantage that distinguishes it from other next generation non-volatile memory like {{magnetic random access memory}} (MRAM) is the unique scaling advantage of having better performance with smaller sizes. The limit to which phase-change memory can be scaled is hence limited by lithography at least until 45 nm. Thus, it offers the biggest potential of achieving ultra-high memory density cells that can be commercialized.|$|E
50|$|Pyrolysis oil, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as biocrude or biooil, is a synthetic fuel under investigation as substitute for petroleum. It is obtained by heating dried biomass without oxygen in a reactor at a temperature of about 500 °C with subsequent cooling. Pyrolytic oil (or bio-oil) {{is a kind of}} tar and normally contains levels of oxygen too high to be considered a hydrocarbon. This high oxygen content results in <b>non-volatility,</b> corrosiveness, immiscibity with fossil fuels, thermal instability, and a tendency to polymerize when exposed to air. As such, it is distinctly different from petroleum products. Removing oxygen from biooil or nitrogen from algal biooil is called upgrading.|$|E
50|$|Rapid {{advances}} in semiconductor fabrication in the 1970s {{led to a}} new generation of solid state memories that magnetic-core memory simply could not compete with. Relentless market forces have dramatically improved these devices over the years, and today the low-cost and high-performance DRAM forms the vast majority of a typical computer's main memory. However, there are many roles where <b>non-volatility</b> is important, either in cases where the power will be removed for periods of time or where the constant power needs of DRAM conflicts with low-power devices. For many years, there was no practical RAM-like device to fill this niche, and many systems used a combination of RAM and some form of ROM for these roles.|$|E

5000|$|The use of 4 AA NiCd (MessagePad 110, 120 and 130) and 4x AA NiMH cells (MP2x00 series, eMate 300) give a runtime {{of up to}} 30 hours (MP2100 {{with two}} 20 MB Linear Flash memory PC Cards, no {{backlight}} usage) and up to 24 hours with backlight on. While adding more weight to the handheld Newton devices than AAA batteries or custom battery packs, the choice of an easily replaceable/rechargeable cell format gives the user a still unsurpassed runtime and flexibility of power supply. This, together with the flash memory used as internal storage starting with the Apple MessagePad 120 (if all cells lost their power, no data was lost due to the <b>non-volatility</b> of this storage), {{gave birth to the}} slogan [...] "Newton never dies, it only gets new batteries".|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the best-known}} forms of both NV-RAM and EEP-ROM memory are flash memory. Some {{drawbacks}} to flash memory include {{the requirement to}} write it in larger blocks than many computers can automatically address, and the relatively limited longevity of flash memory due to its finite number of write-erase cycles (most consumer flash products {{at the time of}} writing can withstand only around 100,000 rewrites before memory begins to deteriorate). Another drawback is the performance limitations preventing flash from matching the response times and, in some cases, the random addressability offered by traditional forms of RAM. Several newer technologies are attempting to replace flash in certain roles, and some even claim to be a truly universal memory, offering the performance of the best SRAM devices with the <b>non-volatility</b> of flash. To date these alternatives have not yet become mainstream.|$|E
50|$|While {{flash memory}} {{remains one of}} the most popular storages in {{embedded}} systems because of its <b>non-volatility,</b> shock-resistance, small size, and low energy consumption, its application has grown much beyond its original design. Based on its original design, NOR flash memory is designed to store binary code of programs because it supports XIP (eXecute-In-Place) and high performance in read operations, while NAND flash memory is used as a data storage because of its lower price and higher performance in write/erase operations, compared to NOR flash. In recent years, the price of NAND flash has gone down much faster than that of NOR flash. Thus, to reduce the hardware cost ultimately, using NAND flash to replace NOR flash (motivated by a strong market demand) becomes a new trend in embedded-system designs, especially on mobile phones and arcade games.|$|E
5000|$|Toggle MRAM memory {{utilizes}} the magnetism of electron spin, {{enabling the}} storage of data without volatility or wear-out. Toggle MRAM utilizes a single transistor and a single MTJ cell {{in order to provide}} a durable, high-density memory. Because of the <b>non-volatility</b> of Toggle MRAM, data that is held in this memory is accessible for 20 years, at temperature (from -40c to 150c). The MTJ is composed of a fixed magnetic layer, a thin dielectric tunnel barrier, and a free magnetic layer. When a bias is applied to the Spin Toggle's MTJ, electrons that are spin polarized by the magnetic layers [...] "tunnel" [...] across the dielectric barrier. The MTJ device has a low resistance when the magnetic moment of the free layer is parallel to the fixed layer and a high resistance when the free layer moment is oriented anti-parallel to the fixed layer moment.|$|E
5000|$|A {{new type}} of {{magnetic}} storage, called magnetoresistive random-access memory or MRAM, is being produced that stores data in magnetic bits based on the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Its advantage is <b>non-volatility,</b> low power usage, and good shock robustness. The 1st generation that was developed was produced by Everspin Technologies, and utilized field induced writing. [...] The 2nd generation is being developed through two approaches: thermal-assisted switching (TAS) which is currently being developed by Crocus Technology, and spin-transfer torque (STT) on which Crocus, Hynix, IBM, and several other companies are working. [...] However, with storage density and capacity orders of magnitude smaller than an HDD, MRAM is useful in applications where moderate amounts of storage with a need for very frequent updates are required, which flash memory cannot support due to its limited write endurance. Six state MRAM is also being developed, echoing four bit multi level flash memory cells, that have six different bits, as opposed to two.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith the {{continuous}} shrinking of technology node, conventional CMOS logic circuits suffer from high power issues due to both increasing leakage current and long traffic delay. Hybrid non-volatile (NV) logic-in-memory architecture, where emerging NV memories are distributed over a logic-circuit plane, {{has been widely}} investigated to overcome these limitations. Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is considered {{as one of the}} most promising NV candidates thanks to its <b>non-volatility,</b> fast access speed, infinite endurance and easy 3 -D integration with CMOS technology. Recently, several 1 -bit NV full-adder (FA) structures using MTJ have been proposed to build low-power high-density arithmetic/logic unit for processors. However, one of their major disadvantages is partial <b>non-volatility</b> since they only use MTJs as one of their operands. For the purpose of extending 1 -bit NV-FA to multi-bit structure and realizing full <b>non-volatility,</b> synchronous 8 -bit NV-FA architecture is presented in this paper, where all the input signals are stored in MTJs instead of CMOS registers. Three possible structures are proposed with respect to different locations of NV data.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} few years, {{a new era of}} smart {{connected}} devices has emerged in the market to enable the future world of the Internet of Things (IoT). A key requirement for IoT applications is the power consumption to allow very high autonomy in the case of battery-powered systems. Depending on the application, such devices will be most of the time in a low-power mode (sleep mode) and will wake up only when there is a task to accomplish (active mode). Emerging non-volatile memory technologies are seen as a very attractive solution to design ultra-low-power systems. Among these technologies, magnetic random access memory is a promising candidate, as it combines <b>non-volatility,</b> high density, reasonable latency, and low leakage. Integration of <b>non-volatility</b> as a new feature of memories has the great potential to allow full data retention after a complete shutdown with a fast wake-up time.
