The current {{rapid increase in}} irrigation water use threatens sustainable food production. In this study, we estimated the time-varying dependency of the supply of irrigation water from rivers, large reservoirs with a greater than 1. 0 km 3 storage capacity, medium-size reservoirs with storage capacities ranging from 1. 0 km 3 to 3. 0 Mm 3, and non-local non-renewable blue water (NNBW), particularly taking into account variations in irrigation area during the period 1960 – 2000. We also estimated the future irrigation water requirements from water supply sources {{in addition to these}} four sources, using an irrigation area scenario. The <b>net</b> irrigation <b>water</b> requirements from various supply sources were assessed using the global H 08 water resources model. The H 08 model simulates water requirements on a daily basis at a resolution of 1. 0 ° × 1. 0 °. We obtained <b>net</b> irrigation <b>water</b> from rivers and medium-size reservoirs, and determined that the NNBW increased continuously from 1960 to 1985, but the <b>net</b> irrigation <b>water</b> from large reservoirs increased only marginally. After 1985, the <b>net</b> irrigation <b>water</b> from rivers approached a critical limit with the continued expansion of the irrigation area. The irrigation water requirements from medium-size reservoirs and NNBW increased significantly following the expansion of the irrigation area and the increased storage capacity of medium-size reservoirs. Under the irrigation area scenario without climate change, global <b>net</b> irrigation <b>water</b> requirements from additional water supply sources will account for 26 % of the total requirements in the year 2050.

This condition is called isotonic and occurs when the same level of solutes are present {{on either side of the}} cell membrane so that the <b>net</b> <b>water</b> movement is zero. If the interstitial fluid has a higher concentration of solutes than the intracellular fluid it will pull water out of the cell. This condition is called hypertonic and if enough water leaves the cell it will not be able to perform essential chemical functions. If the interstitial fluid becomes less concentrated the cell will fill with water as it tries to equalize the concentrations. This condition is called hypotonic and can be dangerous because it can cause the cell to swell and rupture. One set of receptors responsible for thirst detects the concentration of interstitial fluid. The other set of receptors detects blood volume.|$|E
