40|$|International audienceAn {{important}} problem arising in {{the cast}} film process is the socalled <b>neck-in</b> phenomenon, which may induce a drastic film width reduction {{as well as an}} inhomogeneous film thickness distribution (with the so called "dog-bone" defect {{on each side of the}} film). This <b>neck-in</b> phenomenon is highly influenced by the polymer rheology (increasing polymer elasticity leads to decrease markedly the <b>neck-in),</b> the stretching distance, the cooling conditions and the draw ratio. In this paper, we present a 2 D Newtonian non-isothermal model based on a membrane approximation for the film. Stress balance, mass balance and temperature balance equations are solved iteratively using various finite element methods adapted to free surface problems and to transport equations. Coupling between mechanical and thermal equations is achieved introducing an Arrhenius temperature dependance for the viscosity. The influence of the heat transfer coefficient has been carefully investigated...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{viscoelastic}} {{modeling of}} the extrusion film casting process, {{based on the}} lD membrane model and modified Leonov constitutive equation, was conducted {{and the effect of}} the viscoelastic stress state at the die exit (captured here via second to first normal stress difference ratio) on the unwanted <b>neck-in</b> phenomenon has been analyzed for wide range of Deborah numbers and materials having different level of uniaxial and planar extensional strain hardening. Relevant experimental data for LDPE and theoretical predictions based on multimode eXtended Pom-Pom model acquired from the open literature were used for the validation purposes. It was found that firstly, the predicting capabilities of both constitutive equations for given material and processing conditions are comparable even if the single mode modified Leonov model was used and secondly, the agreement between theoretical and experimental data on <b>neck-in</b> is fairly good. Results of the theoretical study revealed that the viscoelastic stress state at the die exit (i. e. -N 2 /N 1 ratio) increases the level of <b>neck-in</b> if uniaxial extensional strain hardening, planar to uniaxial extensional viscosity ratio and Deborah number increases.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the reduction of width along the stretching direction, the so-called <b>neck-in</b> effect, on the draw resonance instability in Newtonian film casting using a linear stability analysis of a model of reduced dimensionality including gravity and inertia forces. Proper scaling reveals the aspect ratio, i. e. the ratio of the initial film half-width to the film length, together with the fluidity and the inlet velocity as independent, dimensionless control parameters. Moreover, we introduce the local Trouton ratio as a measure for the type of elongational deformation, which can be uniaxial, planar, or a combination of both. In the case of purely uniaxial or planar deformations, a one-dimensional model is sufficient. The influence of the control parameters on the draw resonance instability, including a threshold to unconditional stability, is visualized by several stability maps. Special cases of viscous-gravity and viscous-inertia models are analyzed separately due to their practical importance. Gravity appears to influence the aspect ratio at which the critical draw ratio is maximum and amplifies the stabilizing effect of the <b>neck-in.</b> Inertia increases the stabilization due to <b>neck-in,</b> eventually leading to a window of unconditional stability within the analyzed region of aspect ratios. The mechanism underlying the complete suppression of draw resonance is presented, using exclusively steady state analysis. Additionally, the stabilizing mechanisms of gravity and <b>neck-in</b> are revealed. Known alternative stability criteria are extended to the case of finite width and their validity is tested in the presence of inertia, gravity, and finite aspect ratios.

In this paper, a numerical model developed by the authors is used to test and optimize two technological solutions, aimed at reducing the geometrical defects : a localized air cooling {{on the edges of}} the film at the die exit and an "encapsulation die" which enables the extrusion of a high melt strength polymer along the outer edge of a core polymer.

The undesirable <b>neck-in</b> and draw resonance phenomena frequently occurring in the extrusion coating of HDPE are shown in this study to be {{due to the fact that}} lower axial tension in the HDPE film rendered by its low melt strength leads to process instabilities.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{study of the}} film casting process, {{with a focus on}} the effect of the draw ratio on the swelling of the extruded sheet. So far, studies regarding film casting have dealt mainly with the phenomenon of <b>neck-in</b> and have neglected swelling of the material as it emerges from the die lips. Knowledge of the amount of swelling is important for accurate determination of the effect of stretching and orientation phenomena. The problem is tackled by studying the gap-wise swelling of the sheet or film as it emerges from a wide rectangular die and is subsequently drawn down under different draw ratios. The material is treated as viscoelastic by utilizing the Linear Phan Thien-Tanner (LPTT) model. Newtonian simulations are also carried out. A decoupled iterative algorithm is used for the determination of the shape of the extruded sheet, {{based on the fact that}} the sheet's surfaces belong to streamlines.

40|$|Os primeiros polietilenos de baixa densidade (PEBDs) foram produzidos em reatores de alta-pressão de tecnologia {{autoclave}}, resultando em materiais com boas propriedades ópticas e facilmente processáveis em injeção, extrusão de filmes plano ou balão e revestimento por extrusão, tanto na forma pura quanto em misturas com polietilenos de baixa densidade linear (PEBDLs). No entanto, as plantas autoclave têm se tornado cada vez mais escassas no mundo, já que novos investimentos têm sido realizados em unidades industriais maiores e mais produtivas de tecnologia tubular. Assim, a compreensão das diferenças físicas, estruturais e principalmente reológicas entre PEBDs destas duas tecnologias é o objetivo principal deste trabalho. Além disso, pretende-se estudar o comportamento reológico destes PEBDs no processo de revestimento por extrusão, que é um dos mais críticos em termos de reologia. Para isso, foram selecionados três PEBDs de tecnologia autoclave (A 1, A 2 e A 3) e um de tecnologia tubular (T 1) e foram preparadas misturas de T 1 e A 1. As amostras foram caracterizadas em relação à densidade, temperaturas de fusão e cristalização e grau de cristalinidade por calorimetria diferencial de varredura (DSC), massas molares médias (Mn, Mw, Mz) e polidispersão (PD) por cromatogradia de permeação de gel (GPC); e com relação ao comportamento reológico, tendo sido avaliadas quanto ao índice de fluidez, reometria rotacional, reometria capilar, resistência do fundido e análise dinâmico-mecânica (DMA). Os resultados indicam que as amostras de PEBDs de tecnologia autoclave avaliadas foram produzidos em condições de reação distintas, cada qual resultando em determinada polidispersão e quantidade de cadeias de alta massa molar, responsáveis pelo aumento da elasticidade e resistência do fundido. O PEBD de tecnologia tubular apresentou menor PD, refletindo em menor grau de elasticidade e pseudoplasticidade. O acréscimo de diferentes teores de A 1 (mais ramificado) em T 1 (menos ramificado) resultou em uma interessante combinação entre as características reológicas das duas amostras de PEBDs. Finalmente, conclui-se que diferenças significativas de propriedades físicas, térmicas, estruturais e reológicas entre os PEBDs podem influenciar o desempenho de <b>neck-in</b> e draw-down em processamento e também no produto final. The first {{low density polyethylene}}s (LDPEs) {{were produced}} in high-pressure reactors and autoclave technology, resulting in materials with good optical properties and easily processed in injection, cast and blown film extrusion and extrusion coating, either pure or blended with {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPEs). However, autoclave plants have become increasingly scarce in the world, as new investments have been made in larger and more productive plants based on tubular technology. Thus, understanding the physical, structural and rheological differences between LDPEs of these two technologies is the main objective of this work. Furthermore, this work aims to study the rheological behavior of the LDPEs in the extrusion coating process, {{which is one of the}} most critical in terms of rheology. For this purpose, three autoclave LDPEs (A 1, A 2 and A 3) and one tubular LDPE (T 1) were selected and some blends were prepared with different proportions of A 1 and T 1. The samples were characterized with respect to density, melting/crystallization temperatures and degree of cristalinity by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), average molecular weight distribution (Mn, Mw, Mz) and polydispersity (PD) by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and also the rheological characterization was performed by assessing melt index, rotational rheometry, capillary rheometry, melt strength and dynamic-mechanical analysis (DMA). The results indicate that the autoclave LDPEs were produced at distinct reaction conditions, each one resulting in particular polydispersity and level of long chain branching, which are responsible for elasticity and melt strength. The tubular LDPE presented lower PD, reflecting a lower degree of elasticity and shear thinning. The addition of A 1 (more branched) in hot blends with T 1 (less branched) resulted in an interesting combination of rheological characteristics of the two LDPEs. Finally, it was concluded that distinct physical, thermal, structural and rheological properties between the LDPEs may influence <b>neck-in</b> and draw-down performance during processing and also the final product characteristics...|$|E

The distribution of each of the four alleles of the VDR genotypes was similar in the two racial groups. The Apa I VDR genotype was associated with serum PICP (P =. 0494) but not with serum 1, 25 (OH) 2 D or serum osteocalcin. A significant association between the Apa I VDR genotype and BMD of the lumbar spine (P =. 0291) was also observed. However, the Bsm I, Taq I, and Fok I genotypes were not significantly associated with BMD or serum osteocalcin, PICP, or 1, 25 (OH) 2 D. Multivariate stepwise analysis indicated that (1) the Apa I VDR genotype was associated with BMD of the lumbar spine in the two groups together; with total body calcium and BMD of the total body, radius, trochanter, and femoral neck in the black men; and with BMD of the radius in the white men; analysis also indicated that (2) race was significantly associated with total body calcium and BMD of the total body, lumbar spine, and femoral neck. In summary, the Apa I VDR genotype is associated with serum PICP and BMD at a number of sites but does not contribute to or account for racial differences in BMD in young adult men.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{examination}} of extrusion coating product performance, which is aspired to improve with resin choice and essential process parameters such as melt temperature and air gap distance. The performance is defined via two main testing methods, which are hot air sealing and pinhole measurements. Furthermore, infrared (IR) thermometry is applied to monitor the polymer film temperature during processing and contribute the conclusions of the laboratory measurement results. Theoretical part presents essential information about polymer material, extrusion coating process and parameters, product properties and fundamentals of IR thermometry. Firstly, the structure, properties and polymerization of polyethylene are discussed, followed by the principles of extrusion coating process. The knowledge of extrusion coating is reinforced with process parameters and their influence is considered via product properties. Finally, IR thermometry is examined including theoretical basis, equipment introduction and measurement method. Experimental part includes trial runs to produce product samples and laboratory measurements that focus on the quality control. Experiments concentrate on three main variables; melt temperature, air gap and resin choice, which are adjusted through the measurements. Hot air sealing and pinhole analyses are performed after each trial run in order to monitor the product quality and discover optimal process conditions for every material. The ultimate goal is to examine combination of melt temperature, air gap distance and material, which produces the best possible hot air sealing and pinhole results with the lowest possible coating weight. The measurements of experimental part offer a few confirmed outcomes, which enable conclusions concerning optimal melt temperature and air gap settings. Furthermore, comparison between different resin choices is possible. Higher melt temperature setting mainly improves hot air sealing and pinhole results. However, some resins does not endure excessive heating and degradation and the properties start to decline. The effect of air gap is similar to the melt temperature. Higher air gap setting decreases sealing temperature and reduces pinholes almost invariably despite increased cooling of the film. Moreover, increased <b>neck-in</b> must be noticed as the advantages of higher air gap are considered. The comparison of resin choice produce the most controversial results and the effect of blending is partially indefinite. First set of measurements support the blending in order to improve hot air sealing and pinhole results, but the advantage is disappeared in subsequent examination. Furthermore, increased material cost do not support the use of blends...|$|E
40|$|The {{target of}} the study is to explore the {{opportunity}} of enhancing the adhesion of polyethylene terephthalate to the cardboard when the coating thickness of polyethylene terephthalate onto the cardboard is diminished. The reference coating weight is 40 g/m 2 and the target is to achieve same great adhesion with between 25 - 30 g/m 2 coating weight. According to the purpose of the thesis, literature study includes principles of extrusion coating, differences in extrusion coating of polyesters and polyolefins, adhesion theories and practical methods for adhesion improvement in extrusion coating. Literature study is followed by an experimental part, where adhesion improvement by changing processing parameters, modifying process equipments and trying different grades of polyethylene terephthalate was studied once the coating weight is diminished. In the experimental part of the study, 5 adhesion trials are performed. In adhesion trial 1 and 2, PET 1 grade is utilized and PET 2 grade is utilized in adhesion trial 3, 4, 5. Firstly, both grades of PET are screened by performing with only corona as a pretreatment method by following same processing parameters. In screening trials, process variable is air gap. In the following adhesion trials, the effect of flame treatment by performing with various air gap levels and the effect of process equipment modifications by performing with various line speeds are studied for both of them by following same processing parameters. After trials have done, samples are analyzed. Analysis methods can be examined in two different groups: main and additional analysis methods. Main analysis methods are adhesion test by hand, grammage test and <b>neck-in</b> test. Additional analysis methods are heat sealing test, microscopy test and pinhole test. For the application of addditional test methods, it is decided that they will be performed if the adhesion level of polyethylene terephthalate on the cardboard reaches the level of 5 over 5 at the target coating weight. The best attained adhesion of PET 1 is the level of 4 over 5 by performing only with corona during the screening trial. Normally, the best adhesion results is expected from modifications of process equipments results. The most probable reason of the situation is high melt temperature that caused thermal degradation. In the case of adhesion of PET 2 grade, the best adhesion level is 4 over of 5 while performing with modified process equipments. In addition, coating weight results of PET 2 obtained from common test points are generally out of the target coating weight range. This shows {{that it is possible to}} reach almost same adhesion level at lower coating weight levels by utilizing PET 2 grade. All in all, it is proven that it is possible to run the process at 30 g/m 2 coating with almost perfect adhesion for both polyethylene terephthalate grades. Better adhesion can be achieved by performing with high line speeds, high screw speeds and minimum air gap values...|$|E
