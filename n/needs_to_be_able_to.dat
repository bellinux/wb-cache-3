5|$|Repeating nines also {{turn up in}} {{yet another}} of Georg Cantor's works. They {{must be taken into}} account to {{construct}} a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions, of the uncountability of the unit interval. Such a proof <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.|$|E

Reasons for the leakage include poor fit or fitting, leaking via head or facial hair, movement of the facial muscles causing temporary leaks, or impact of external objects against the mask, which may distort it temporarily, or move it so that it leaks, or in extreme cases dislodge it entirely from the diver's head.|$|E
25|$|Today's {{biometric}} technology makes non-violent {{methods of}} gaining access, {{even by the}} most experienced safe hackers and code crackers, nearly impossible. Modern vaults and safes are also reinforced {{to the point that}} the amount of explosives needed to blow them open would likely create unwanted attention and run the risk of harming the building to the point of collapse. By their very nature, even the most impregnable vault or safe eventually <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be opened and closed by someone. To circumvent vault and safe security features, robbers often kidnap the bank manager, but that is not always a successful ideal as banks have often removed the manager's ability to open the vault.|$|E

They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, line-out or scrum {{and need to be}} decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs. Good fly-halves are calm, clear thinking and have the vision to direct effective attacking plays. Fly-halves need good passing and kicking skills. Often the fly-half is the best kicker in the team and <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> execute attacking kicks such as up-and-unders, grubbers and chip kicks as well as being able to kick for territory. Many fly-halves are also the team's goal kickers.|$|E

25|$|An {{effective}} fast bowler <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hold {{a consistent}} line and length, or in common terms, to be accurate. In this context, line {{refers to the}} path of the ball towards the batsman, in the horizontal dimension running from the off to the leg side, while length describes the distance the ball travels toward the batsman before bouncing. Variations in length is generally seen as the more important of the two for a fast bowler. The faster the bowler, the harder it is to achieve consistent line and length but sheer speed can make up for the shortfall. Fast bowlers who also manage to be accurate can be devastatingly effective, for example the likes of Australian pace bowler Glenn McGrath and South African pace bowler Shaun Pollock.|$|E
25|$|Perfoliate {{pondweed}} is {{not widely}} cultivated, which is perhaps surprising {{as it is}} not ecologically demanding and is an attractive plant. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. It is easy to grow in a garden pond or even in a barrel, but unlike some other submerged plants <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> root in a suitable substrate such as sand or aquatic compost. Keeping nutrient levels low helps to prevent smothering by algae and more invasive aquatic plants. Plants being established should be weighted down initially {{to allow them to}} root, and benefit from being planted among other aquatic plants that can act as a 'nursery'. Transplants have a high survival rate once established.|$|E
25|$|Most fish, {{reptiles}} and amphibians {{undergo a}} limited physiological colour change {{in response to a}} change in environment. This type of camouflage, known as background adaptation, most commonly appears as a slight darkening or lightening of skin tone to approximately mimic the hue of the immediate environment. It has been demonstrated that the background adaptation process is vision-dependent (it appears the animal <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> see the environment to adapt to it), and that melanin translocation in melanophores is the major factor in colour change. Some animals, such as chameleons and anoles, have a highly developed background adaptation response capable of generating a number of different colours very rapidly. They have adapted the capability to change colour in response to temperature, mood, stress levels, and social cues, rather than to simply mimic their environment.|$|E

The caterpillar <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> feed and to avoid being eaten and much of its morphology has evolved to facilitate these two functions. After growth and ecdysis, the caterpillar enters into a [...] developmental stage called a pupa (or chrysalis) around which it may form a casing. The insect develops into the adult in the pupa stage; when ready the pupa hatches and the adult stage or imago of a butterfly or moth arises.|$|E
500|$|Memory and naÃ¯ve B cells {{normally}} {{exist in}} relatively small numbers. [...] As the body <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{respond to a}} large number of potential pathogens, it maintains a pool of B cells {{with a wide range of}} specificities. Consequently, while there is almost always at least one B (naive or memory) cell capable of responding to any given epitope (of all that the immune system can react against), there are very few exact duplicates. However, when a single B cell encounters an antigen to which it can bind, it can proliferate very rapidly. Such a group of cells with identical specificity towards the epitope is known as a clone, and is derived from a common [...] "mother" [...] cell. [...] All the [...] "daughter" [...] B cells match the original [...] "mother" [...] cell in their epitope specificity, and they secrete antibodies with identical paratopes. These antibodies are monoclonal antibodies, since they derive from clones of the same parent cell. A polyclonal response is one in which clones of multiple B cells react to the same antigen.|$|E

The three most positive affecting factors {{for the baby}} are a mother's social support, maternalâfetal attachment and high self-esteem. The three most negative affecting factors are maternal depression, maternal stress, and maternal anxiety.

2500|$|There {{are other}} options, and in {{particular}} in fours the middle pair may row on the same side: this arrangement {{means that there is}} less yawing of the boat through the water throughout the course of the stroke, making it more efficient. The two rowers in the middle, rowing in a 'tandem', need to be well matched and synchronised to make this work (i.e. avoid clashing blades), and the bow person, rowing with a significant gap between them and stroke on their side of the boat, also <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> adapt to the larger space in front of them.

2500|$|Guru Nanak's teachings are founded {{not on a}} final {{destination}} of heaven or hell but on a spiritual union with the Akal which results in salvation or Jivanmukta (liberation whilst alive), a concept also found in Hinduism.

Sikhs believe in reincarnation and karma concepts found in Hinduism and Buddhism. However, in Sikhism both karma and liberation [...] "is modified by the concept of God's grace" [...] (nadar, mehar, kirpa, karam etc.). Guru Nanak states [...] "The body takes birth because of karma, but salvation is attained through grace". To get closer to God: Sikhs avoid the evils of Maya, keep the everlasting truth in mind, practice Shabad Kirtan, meditate on Naam, and serve humanity. Sikhs believe that being in the company of the Satsang or Sadh Sangat {{is one of the key}} ways to achieve liberation from the cycles of reincarnation.|$|E
