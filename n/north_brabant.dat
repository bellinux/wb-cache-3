5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 May General Winkelman {{remained}} moderately optimistic.

5|$|On 14 May the Germans had {{occupied}} {{almost all of}} <b>North</b> <b>Brabant.</b> SS-Standarte Deutschland, quickly advancing to the Western Scheldt, reached the Bath Position. This cut off the retreat of 27e Groupe de Reconnaissance de Division d'Infanterie, which was subsequently destroyed defending Bergen-op-Zoom. The morale of the defenders of the Bath Position, already shaken by stories from Dutch troops fleeing to the west, was severely undermined by the news that Winkelman had surrendered; many concluded that it was useless for Zealand to continue resisting as the last remaining province. A first preparatory artillery bombardment on the position in the evening of 14 May caused the commanding officers to desert their troops, who then also fled.|$|E

Dutch forces {{fell back}} {{to the line of}} the Meuse abandoning the fortress of Breda after a short siege, and the Stadtholder called on Britain for help. Within nine days an initial British guards brigade had been assembled and dispatched across the English Channel, landing at Hellevoetsluis under the command of general Lake and the Duke of York. Meanwhile, while Dumouriez moved <b>north</b> into <b>Brabant,</b> a separate army under Francisco de Miranda laid siege to Maastricht on 23 February. However the Austrians had been reinforced to 39,000 and, now commanded by Saxe-Coburg, crossed the Rur River on 1 March and drove back the Republican French near Aldenhoven. The next day the Austrians took Aachen before reaching Maastricht on the Meuse and forcing Miranda to lift the siege.|$|R

The community of Grandmother's Bay, an extension of the Lac La Ronge First Nation, lies approximately 5 miles to the northeast, directly across Otter Lake. There are provincial campgrounds 5 km north at Otter Rapids, 7 km north at the Devil Lake Provincial Recreation Site, and 1.5 km south. There is also a provincial campground within the community itself. The community of Missinipe is within Lac La Ronge Provincial Park, at its northern tip. The community contains a seasonally operated general store, tourist cabins and other accommodations. Tourism and facilitation of wilderness travel are its main focus. The community may be accessed by Highway 102, or by float plane.|$|R
5|$|Vincent Willem van Gogh {{was born}} on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the {{predominantly}} Catholic province of <b>North</b> <b>Brabant</b> in the southern Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. Van Gogh was given {{the name of his}} grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), who received a degree in theology at the University of Leiden in 1811, had six sons, three of whom became art dealers. This Vincent may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).|$|E
5|$|On 11 May the Dutch {{commander}} General Winkelman {{was faced}} with two priorities. First of {{all he wanted to}} eliminate the German airborne troops. Though the strategic assault had failed, he feared a further enemy build-up via Waalhaven and saw the German possession of the Moerdijk bridges as a serious impediment to the movement of allied reinforcements to the Fortress Holland. The second priority was closely related to the first: enabling the French army to build up a strong defensive line in <b>North</b> <b>Brabant,</b> to connect the Fortress Holland with the Allied main force in Belgium. As he had withdrawn most of his troops from the area, Winkelman had only limited means available to influence this process, largely leaving the task to local commanders.|$|E
5|$|On {{the extreme}} {{south of the}} Grebbe Line, the Grebbeberg, the Germans were now {{deploying}} three SS battalions including support troops and three fresh infantry battalions of IR.322; two of IR.374 laid in immediate reserve. During the evening and night of 12–13 May the Dutch had assembled in this sector about a dozen battalions. These forces consisted of the reserve battalions of several army corps, divisions and brigades, and the independent Brigade B, which had been freed when the Main Defence Line in the Land van Maas en Waal had been abandoned {{as part of the}} withdrawal of III Army Corps from <b>North</b> <b>Brabant.</b> However, not all of these units would be concentrated into a single effort for a counterattack to retake the main line. Some battalions had been fed immediately into the battle at the Stop Line and others were kept in reserve, mainly behind the fall-back line near the Rhenen railroad. Furthermore, most battalions were a quarter below strength. Four were to be used, under command of Brigade B, for the flanking attack from the north. This attack was delayed for several hours; when it finally started late in the morning of 13 May, it ran right into a comparable advance by two battalions of Der Fuehrer. This brigade, unaware of Dutch intentions, had shifted its attack axis to the north to roll up the Grebbe Line from behind. A confused encounter battle followed in which the vanguard of the Dutch troops, poorly supported by their artillery, began to give way at around 12:30 to the encroaching SS troops. Soon this resulted in a general withdrawal of the brigade, which turned into a rout when, at about 13:30, the Grebbeberg area was bombed by 27 Ju 87 Stukas.|$|E
40|$|Iron is {{commonly}} present in groundwater worldwide. The presence of iron {{in drinking water}} is not harmful to human health, however it is undesirable because of the associated aesthetic and operational problems, namely: bad taste, colour, stains on laundry and plumbing fixtures, and aftergrowth in the distribution system. Iron is generally removed from groundwater {{by the process of}} aeration followed by rapid sand fihration. This study reveals that two mechanisms are involved in this process, namely: "floc filtration" and "adsorptive filtration". Floc filtration comprises the oxidation of iron(ll), wbicb is the dominant form of iron in groundwater, to iron(lll) followed by floc formation and removal ofthe flocs by rapid sand filtration. In adsorptive fihration, iron(ll) is adsorbed onto filter media and subsequently oxidised to iron(lll), forming a coating on the filter media. Under the ommonly applied treatment conditions in iron removing plants the floc filtration is expected to be dominant and tbe adsorptive filtration complimentary. A pilot study conducted at the Gilze water treatment plant of Water Supply <b>North</b> West <b>Brabant</b> demonstrated that adsorptive filtration has several potential advantages over floc filtration, namely: longer filter runs due to slower head loss development, better fihrate quality, shorter ripening time and less backwash water use. In existing groundwater treatment plants, the high irondi) adsorption capacity ofthe iron oxide coated filter media makes it potentially possible to switch tbe goveming mode of operation from floc filtration to adsorptive filtration. To achieve this two options can be considered, they are: (i) iron(ll) adsorption under anoxic conditions followed by oxidation with oxygen-rich water and, (ii) adsorption of iron(ll) in the presence of oxygen and simultaneous oxidation. The first option might be attractive specifically when two filtration steps are available...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Permian in the Netherlands, as {{known from}} {{borehole}} data, is deposited in a mainly evaporitic facies <b>north</b> of the <b>Brabant</b> and Rhenish Massifs. In the extreme south (Belgian Campine, de Peel) a near-shore facies of reef dolomites and elastics occurs. In {{the western and}} central Netherlands the Upper Permian is represented by a thin sequence of anhydrite and dolomite with some elastics (anhydrite facies). The rock salt facies, developed in the northeastern part of the country, is subdivided into 4 evaporation cycles. Each cycle, when complete, consists {{of a series of}} claystone, dolomite, anhydrite, rock salt, bitter salts, laid down under conditions of increasing basin salinity followed by a thin series of rocksalt and anhydrite, deposited under decreasing salinity. The depositional rhythm of the deposits in the rock salt facies is caused by periodic northward shifts of the area of greatest subsidence. Owing to tectonic movements, initiating these shifts, changes occurred in the physiographic conditions relating to entrance channel and basin causing the basin salinity to decrease. Only during periods of relatively low salinity did euxinic conditions exist which gave rise to bituminous deposits. From the distribution of dolomites and bituminous deposits the presence of an east-west striking swell, the Cocvorden Swell, has been inferred, showing that this was a higher and more slowly subsiding tract in the Upper Permian basin. The transition of marine Upper Permian to continental Bunter cannot be regarded as a time boundary; nor are time and rock units within the Upper Permian basin necessarily identical...|$|R

25|$|Brabantian {{is named}} after the {{historical}} Duchy of Brabant, which corresponded mainly to the provinces of <b>North</b> <b>Brabant</b> and southern Gelderland, the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Flemish Brabant, as well as Brussels (where its native speakers have become a minority) and the province of Walloon Brabant. Brabantian expands into small parts in the west of Limburg while its strong influence on the East Flemish of East Flanders and eastern Zeelandic Flanders weakens towards the west. In a small area in the northwest of <b>North</b> <b>Brabant</b> (Willemstad), Hollandic is spoken. Conventionally, the South Guelderish dialects are distinguished from Brabantian, {{but there are no}} objective criteria apart from geography to do so.

25|$|To the {{northwest}} and north, where the ancient Scheldt ran via the Striene to empty into the Meuse (Dutch Maas), the Menapii had lived during Caesar's time. Their Roman civitas {{appears to have}} ended near the Striene-Scheldt, and in their place were possibly new tribes such as the Frisiavones, Marsacii, Sturii, Canninefates and Batavians. The Batavians had their own civitas within Germania Inferior. So {{it is not clear}} if the Civitas Tungrorum reached to the North Sea, nor whether it reached to the old Meuse-Maas delta, as the later diocese of Liège did.

25|$|Christianity is {{currently}} the largest religion in the Netherlands. The provinces of <b>North</b> <b>Brabant</b> and Limburg have historically been strongly Roman Catholic, {{and some of their}} people might still consider the Catholic Church as a base for their cultural identity. Protestantism in the Netherlands consists of a number of churches within various traditions. The largest of these is the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN), a United church which is Reformed and Lutheran in orientation. It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and a smaller Lutheran Church. Several orthodox Reformed and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN. Although in the Netherlands as a whole Christianity has become a minority, the Netherlands contains a Bible Belt from Zeeland to the northern parts of the province Overijssel, in which Protestant (particularly Reformed) beliefs remain strong, and even has majorities in municipal councils.|$|E
25|$|The Southern Dutch cuisine {{consists}} of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of <b>North</b> <b>Brabant</b> and Limburg and the Flemish Region in Belgium. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an haute cuisine. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the Vlaai from Limburg and the Moorkop and Bossche Bol from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the worstenbroodje (a roll with a sausage of ground beef, literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from Trappist to Kriek. 5 of the 10 International Trappist Association recognised breweries in the world, {{are located in the}} Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.|$|E
25|$|Legal distinctions {{are made}} in the Opium Law between drugs with a low risk of harm and/or addiction, called soft drugs, and drugs with a high risk of harm and/or addiction, called hard drugs. Soft drugs include hash, marijuana, {{sleeping}} pills and sedatives, while hard drugs include heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, LSD and ecstasy. Policy has been to largely tolerate the sale of soft drugs while strongly suppressing the sale, circulation and use of hard drugs, effectively separating it into two markets. Establishments that have been permitted to sell soft drugs under certain circumstances are called coffee shops. Laws established in January 2013 required visitors of coffee shops to be Dutch residents, but these laws were only applied in Zeeland, <b>North</b> <b>Brabant</b> and Limburg after much local criticism. Possession of a soft drug for personal use in quantities below a certain threshold (5 grams of cannabis or 5 cannabis plants) is tolerated, but larger quantities or posession of hard drugs may lead to prosecution. Prosecution for possession, trade and (in some rare cases) use are typically handled by the muncipal government except where large-scale criminal activity is suspected.|$|E
