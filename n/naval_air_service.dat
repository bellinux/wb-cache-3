5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{units in}} the Greek Armed Forces were formed in June 1912. In the following Balkan Wars, the Hellenic Navy {{was the first in}} military history to use aircraft to track down and bomb the enemy fleet (1913). The <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> was officially established during the First World War and participated with the Allies in several missions over the Aegean. After participation in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) a long period of peace followed during which the <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> was reorganized and upgraded, especially with the establishment of the State Aircraft Factory, which manufactured various types of aircraft. In 1930 the <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> was merged with the Hellenic Army Aviation and formed the third branch in the Greek Armed Forces, the Hellenic Air Force.|$|E

5|$|While 22,812 Canadian {{military}} personnel {{had served in}} the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> (RNAS) and RAF, Canadian air services were not created and did not operate as an independent military force until nearly the end of the war. With 1 Squadron and 2 Squadron of the Canadian Air Force established at Upper Heyford in Britain during August 1918 and the Royal Canadian <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service,</b> established for home defence in September 1918, Canadian units had only reached operational status by the end of hostilities and never saw combat.|$|E
5|$|The Hellenic <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> {{must not}} be {{confused}} with the current aviation branch of the Hellenic Navy, which includes the helicopter-equipped Navy Helicopter Command (Διοίκηση Ελικοπτέρων Ναυτικού– ΔΕΝ) and the 353rd Naval Cooperation Squadron (353 ΜΝΑΣ), run jointly with the Hellenic Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Drummond {{kept the}} {{temporary}} rank of captain when the RFC {{merged with the}} Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> to form the Royal Air Force on 1April 1918.

5|$|Allingham {{wanted to}} join the war effort in August 1914 as a {{despatch}} rider, but his critically ill mother managed {{to persuade him to}} stay at home and look after her. However, after his mother died in 1915, aged 42, Allingham enlisted with the Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> (RNAS). He became formally rated as an Air Mechanic Second Class on 21 September 1915, and was posted to Chingford before completing his training at Sheerness, Kent. His RNAS serial number was RNAS F8317.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1914 credits were voted {{for the creation of}} a naval aerodrome in Eleusina, Attica. Meanwhile, despite limited funds Aristeidis Moraitinis managed to establish the first naval aviation school and corps. In spring 1915 the establishment of an independent Naval Aviation Department within the Ministry of Naval Affairs and the incorporation of the Greek naval air fleet into the Greek Navy ensured the foundation of the <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> (NAY).|$|E
50|$|The post of Fifth Sea Lord then lapsed until 1938 {{when the}} Admiralty regained {{responsibility}} for naval aviation: the post was reestablished {{and was the}} Chief of <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Services,</b> responsible for preparation and management {{of all of the}} Royal Navy's aircraft and air personnel.|$|R
50|$|Role: The Secretariat {{served as}} {{intermediaries}} between Ministers and the Office of the Fifth Sea Lord and Chief of <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Services</b> The <b>Air</b> branch or (A Branch), was added in 1938 and {{was responsible for}} examining and advising all matters in regard to Air Requirements.|$|R
25|$|The Port Victoria P.V.2 was a British {{prototype}} floatplane fighter of the First World War, {{designed and}} built at the Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service's</b> Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain. Only a single aircraft was built, with the type not being chosen for production.|$|R
5|$|During World War I, Goble flew fighters on the Western Front {{with the}} British Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service.</b> He became an ace with ten victories, {{commanded}} No. 5 Squadron (later No. 205 Squadron RAF), and {{was awarded the}} Distinguished Service Order and the Distinguished Service Cross. Returning to Australia, Goble assisted {{in the formation of}} the RAAF as an independent branch of the Australian armed forces. On an exchange posting to Britain in the 1930s, he led No. 2 (Bomber) Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|Goble was {{accepted}} for flying training with the Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> (RNAS) in July 1915. After graduating as a flight sub-lieutenant on 20 October 1915, {{he became a}} test pilot and undertook anti-submarine patrols out of Dover. Goble commenced operations with only three hours solo flying experience. Towards {{the end of the}} year he was posted across the Channel to Dunkirk, flying Caudron reconnaissance-bombers and Sopwith Pup fighters.|$|E
5|$|Navenby was an {{agricultural}} village {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century, but the outbreak of the First World War brought changes for the community. A small airfield, Wellingore Heath, was opened on land bordering Navenby in 1917, to provide a base for the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service.</b> The flat landscape, with its cliff-top situation, proved an ideal situation for flight operations.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, Luce was {{appointed}} Commodore of the Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service's</b> Central Depot and Training Establishment at Cranwell. However, {{the following year}} when Cranwell {{became part of the}} newly founded Royal Air Force, Luce was replaced by Brigadier-General Briggs who had transferred from the Navy to the RAF.|$|R

5|$|Rather than {{introducing}} any revolutionary tactical doctrine, crews {{gradually became}} more experienced and increased their effectiveness that way, while specialist training was provided {{when it was}} required. Survival rates remained mediocre, owing {{to the nature of}} long-range operations over water. However, with greater innovations, such as radar, better designed aircraft, and more potent weaponry, the crews built on their experiences and the service became an effective <b>naval</b> <b>air</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5|$|The British Royal Flying Corps and Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> used {{black for}} night bombers, while {{a wide variety}} of {{experimental}} camouflages were tried out for specific roles such as trench strafing, with multiple colors. Alternatives were tested in late 1917 at Orfordness Experimental Station, resulting in NIVO (Night Invisible Varnish Orfordness) being introduced in early 1918, used for all external surfaces on night bombers until superseded by World War II colors.|$|E
5|$|Allingham was {{the oldest}} ever {{surviving}} member {{of any of the}} British Armed Forces and one of the oldest surviving veterans of the First World War. He was the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland, the last surviving member of the Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> (RNAS) and the last surviving founding member of the Royal Air Force (RAF). In 2001 he became the face of the First World War veterans' association and made frequent public appearances to ensure that awareness of the sacrifices of the First World War was not lost to modern generations. He received many honours and awards for his First World War service and his longevity.|$|E
50|$|Ramsay {{served as}} commander-in-chief, East Indies Station, from 1936 to 1938, {{and then became}} Fifth Sea Lord and Chief of <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Services.</b> Ramsay held this post until the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War. He was promoted to Admiral in December 1939 and retired at his own request in 1942.|$|R
50|$|Repaired, Nichols {{was used}} by the Air Transport Command (ATC) and <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Transport <b>Service</b> (NATS).|$|R
50|$|He volunteered at the {{outbreak}} of war and was commissioned with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He served with Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service's</b> Armoured Car Division at Gallipoli. He contracted dysentery there and was eventually invalided out of the Royal Flying Corps on 30 December 1916. However, he appealed {{and returned to the}} RFC.|$|R
5|$|Ivor Ewing McIntyre {{was born}} on 6 October 1899 in Kent, England, the son of Captain Duncan McIntyre. He joined the Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> (RNAS) in 1917, and saw action in World WarI as a flight sub-lieutenant. McIntyre {{transferred}} to the Royal Air Force (RAF) on its creation as an independent service in 1918, and was a lieutenant when awarded the Air Force Cross in the 1919 New Year Honours. He was granted a short-service commission in the RAF as a flying officer on 12 December 1919.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is notable}} for once being the {{location}} of a Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> seaplane base at St Mildred's Bay, which defended the Thames Estuary coastal towns during World War I. The town is the subject of Sir John Betjeman's poem, Westgate-on-Sea. Residents have included the 19th-century surgeon Sir Erasmus Wilson and former Archbishop of Canterbury William Temple. The artist Sir William Quiller Orchardson painted several of his best-known pictures while living in Westgate-on-Sea. The British composer Arnold Cooke attended the town's Streete Preparatory School in the early 20th century, and Eton headmaster Anthony Chenevix-Trench spent the earliest few years of his education in the town.|$|E
5|$|The young {{air force}} was a small, close-knit {{organisation}} comparable to a flying club, although several pioneering flights were undertaken by its members. One {{of the most}} notable was made by Goble and Flying Officer (later Flight Lieutenant) Ivor McIntyre in 1924, when they became the first men to circumnavigate Australia by air, in a single-engined Fairey IIID floatplane. The English-born McIntyre, who was lead pilot while Goble acted as commander and navigator, was also a World War I veteran of the Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service.</b> The purpose of the flight was to survey the northern coastline of Australia for defence planning, and to test {{the capabilities of the}} Fairey IIID.|$|E
50|$|The Port Victoria P.V.1 was a British {{prototype}} floatplane fighter of the First World War, {{built at}} the Royal <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service's</b> Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain by fitting a Sopwith Baby with high-lift wings.

50|$|Having {{switched}} {{observers to}} Karl Elsasser, Meyer claimed two victories on 1 October 1916, {{one of which}} was confirmed. Meyer and Elsasser then used Friedrichshafen FF.33 number 880 to down a FBA off Zeebrugge for his fifth confirmed victory. Karl Meyer became the German <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service's</b> first flying ace, {{and one of the few}} German two-seater aces.|$|R
