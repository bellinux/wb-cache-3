40|$|Summary This paper {{takes an}} {{integrative}} approach towards dialectics and social movement theories {{in a model}} of regional industry emergence processes. Based on an inductive qualitative investigation we describe how a new industry emerges in a declining and peripheral region dominated by struggling and traditional local industry. The emanating model of regional industry emergence is based on four main processes; framing processes, movement mobilisation processes, inter-industry relational processes and dialectical processes, which together shape the emerging regional industry. This exemplifies how new regional industry mobilisation efforts provide an 'anti-thesis' to traditional industry, and how established industry actors respond with contestation to protect their business concepts. Furthermore we illustrate how new industry actors reframe their concepts to complement dominating traditional industry and to overcome tensions and conflicts. Following dialectic interaction between new and traditional industry we <b>noticed</b> signs <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> and synthesis between the newly formed and old industry actors; ultimately resulting in a revitalisation of the region's traditional industry. As such, the paper {{makes a point of}} accounting for agency and productive conflict when understanding regional industry renewal and emergence.

50|$|Hawkes {{studied at}} Oxford until 1947, {{when he decided}} to move to China to {{continue}} his studies at Peking University. Hawkes was so determined that he booked passage on a ship to Hong Kong without having received <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> his <b>acceptance.</b> The Chinese scholar Hu Shih, who then served as university president, was notorious for ignoring correspondence, and Hawkes' plans were saved only when the British poet William Empson, who was the only foreigner at the university, noticed Hawkes' letters and arranged for him to be accepted as a graduate student. The university was located in downtown Beijing (later moved to Haidian District on the former site of Yenching University), and Hawkes lived in a rented room in a medieval hutong lane dwelling. He took courses in Chinese literature from noted scholars such as Luo Changpei and Yu Pingbo. Hawkes and his Chinese classmates were present in Tiananmen Square on 1 October 1949 to hear Mao Zedong announce the founding of the People's Republic of China following the Communist Party of China's defeat of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) in the Chinese Civil War.|$|R

5000|$|The {{application}} process for Business Careers {{is much like}} the other magnet schools in NISD. A student planning to attend BCHS must fill out an application form.

Middle school 8th grade students are {{the target of the}} BCHS recruiters since it will be their first year in high school and it is easier for them {{to take full advantage of}} the programs offered at BCHS, but occasionally students already in high school may be eligible to apply provided that they meet the requirements to attend.

Those already in high school may apply provided that they meet the previously stated requirements and apply by the end of the 9th grade year. In order for 10th graders to be considered for acceptance they must already be taking business-related courses in their current high school. No 11th graders may apply for acceptance the following year. Should the applicant meet the requirements he/she will receive a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> As with all magnet schools in NISD, the school cannot accept everyone.

40|$|Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is {{the only}} rule of {{procedure}} devoted exclusively to encouraging settlement. The basic operation of Rule 68 is simple. A defendant (but not a plaintiff) may make an offer under Rule 68 to settle a case for a specified dollar amount or other relief. If the plaintiff accepts the offer, the Rule 68 offer and a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> are filed and the clerk enters judgment according {{to the terms of}} the offer. If, however, the offer is not accepted, and the judgment obtained by the plaintiff at trial is not more favorable than the offer, the plaintiff 2 ̆ 2 must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer. 2 ̆ 2 In short, if a plaintiff rejects a Rule 68 settlement offer and fails to beat the offer at trial, the plaintiff is responsible for paying the costs accruing after the offer is made. This mandatory sanction deprives a prevailing plaintiff of costs to which he would normally be entitled 2 ̆ 2 as of course 2 ̆ 2 under Rule 54 (d). Unfortunately, despite its unique status as a rule encouraging settlement, Rule 68 is seldom used and is widely considered a failure. There are three major reasons for Rule 682 ̆ 7 s present ineffectiveness. First, the rule can be invoked only by parties defending against claims. Second, the sanction of costs has generally been considered too small to encourage defendants to make Rule 68 offers or to encourage plaintiffs to accept them. Third, even when Rule 68 has been used, it has not led to early settlements because defendants generally have a greater incentive to earn interest on their money than to avoid plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 costs. Thus, many Rule 68 offers are not made until shortly before trial. All of this may be about to change. On December 5, 1984, the United States Supreme Court heard oral argument in Marek v. Chesny. 2 ̆ 2 In Marek, the Court is considering whether the term 2 ̆ 2 costs 2 ̆ 2 in Rule 68 includes civil rights attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees, which are defined in 42 U. S. C. § 1988 as 2 ̆ 2 part of the costs. 2 ̆ 2 Specifically, the Court will decide whether a civil rights plaintiff who rejects a Rule 68 offer and ultimately obtains a less favorable judgment at trial must be denied attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees for all work performed after the Rule 68 offer was made. Although Marek v. Chesny superficially involves only the relationship between Rule 68 and section 1988, the case may have a much broader impact. At least ninety federal statutes in addition to section 1988 allow courts to award prevailing parties reasonable attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees as part of the costs. If the Court decides that Rule 68 in effect incorporates the definition of costs used in the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees statutes, Rule 68 will become an enormously powerful settlement tool in cases involving fee-shifting statutes. One third or more of all federal litigation will thus be affected by the decision in Marek v. Chzesny. Indeed, the issue is important enough for the Solicitor General of the United States to have filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to hold that Rule 68 costs include attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees in cases involving any of the ninety-plus fee award statutes. The court of appeals 2 ̆ 7 holding in Marek that Rule 68 costs do not include attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees in civil rights cases rested on two grounds. First, the court of appeals concluded that defining Rule 68 costs to include civil rights attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees would have violated the Rules Enabling Act by abridging the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s substantive right to attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees under section 1988. Second, the court of appeals concluded that construing Rule 68 costs to include civil rights attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees would contradict the policies underlying section 1988. This Article disagrees with the court of appeals holding...|$|E

And finally it also follows up Radishchev's political opinions that can be easily perceived as an irreconcilable dispute between two main personalities associated with the ideas of Enlightenment - reformer of society Radishchev and Catherine II, reigning empress. In practical part, there are found, based on comparative analysis of complex of short stories The Hunting Sketches by Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev and The Pit by Aleksandr Ivanovich Kuprin, some connections and similarities with respect to Radishchev's ideas. No matter, that The Pit was written after the abolition of serfdom; however, the two other books were written before the abolition.
