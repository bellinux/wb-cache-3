25|$|The case {{attracted}} some {{media coverage}} at the time, because Nigg had formerly {{worked at the}} Mezzaluna restaurant in Brentwood, {{where he had been}} a friend of Ronald Goldman's. Almost 15 months earlier, Goldman and <b>Nicole</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>Simpson</b> had been found slain at her home near the restaurant, after he had gone there to return her mother's eyeglasses, which had been left behind at Mezzaluna. Brown Simpson's ex-husband, former football star O. J. Simpson, had been charged with the murders, and his highly publicized trial had reached closing arguments.|$|E
25|$|At 12:10a.m. on June 13, 1994, <b>Nicole</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>Simpson</b> and Ronald Goldman {{were found}} murdered outside of Nicole's Bundy Drive {{condominium}} in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles. Brown had been stabbed multiple {{times in the}} head and neck, and had defensive wounds on her hands. The larynx could be seen through the gaping wound in her neck, and vertebra C3 was incised; her head remained barely attached to the body. Both victims had been dead for about two hours prior to being discovered by police. Robert Riske, one of the first two officers on the scene, found a single bloody glove, among other evidence.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} on January 24, 1995 and was {{televised}} by Court TV {{and in part}} by other cable and network news outlets for 134 days. Los Angeles County prosecutor Christopher Darden argued that Simpson killed his ex-wife in a jealous rage. The prosecution opened its case by playing a 9-1-1 call from <b>Nicole</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>Simpson</b> on January 1, 1989. She expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her, and he could be heard yelling {{at her in the}} background. Other material related to domestic violence was presented. The prosecution also presented dozens of expert witnesses to place Simpson {{at the scene of the}} crime, on subjects ranging from DNA profiling to blood and shoeprint analysis.|$|E

25|$|The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office prosecuted Simpson for {{the killings}} of Goldman and Simpson's ex-wife, <b>Nicole</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>Simpson,</b> {{based on the}} theory that Simpson, who had had a history of {{domestic}} violence with her, had acted in a fit of rage upon realizing that {{she was not going to}} return to him. Simpson himself, according to his lawyers, believed that the two had been killed over their involvement in drug dealing in the area, and that other murders at the time were carried out for the same reason. Brown, her former husband believed, had been planning to open a restaurant of her own using proceeds from cocaine sales. Mezzaluna Trattoria, where she ate her last meal, and where both Nigg and Goldman had worked, was reportedly a nexus for drug trafficking in Brentwood.|$|E
