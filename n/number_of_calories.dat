These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories,</b> altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E

The post-matching result from nearest neighbor matching reveals that adaptation tends to positively and significantly affect household calorie intake. The estimates of nearest neighbor matching show that adoption of adaptation options improves household food calorie intake by 2635  kcal/day per adult equivalent. Similarly, the Kernel matching result reveals adopting either of the adaptation options also guarantee favorable effect on food security. This means that compared to similar/matched households that did not adopt any of the adaptation options, households that did adopt experienced a 2660  kcal/day per adult equivalent higher <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> intake (significant at the 1 % level).|$|R

We propose a complementary view in which perceptual and motor representations of physical distance influence people’s thoughts and feelings without reference to the self, extending research and theory on the effects of distance into domains where construal-level theory is si-lent. Across four experiments, participants were primed with either spatial closeness or spatial distance by plotting an assigned set of points on a Cartesian coordinate plane.

2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that [...] "during the twentieth century two 'revolutions' {{transformed}} rural Mexico: the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) and the Green Revolution (1950–1970)". With the support of the Mexican government, the U.S. government, the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Rockefeller Foundation, Mexico made a concerted effort to transform agricultural productivity, particularly with irrigated rather than dry-land cultivation in its northwest, to solve its problem of lack of food self-sufficiency. [...] In the center and south of Mexico, where large-scale production faced challenges, agricultural production languished. [...] Increased production meant food self-sufficiency in Mexico to feed its growing and urbanizing population, [...] with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> consumed per Mexican increasing. Technology was seen as a valuable way to feed the poor, and would relieve some pressure of the land redistribution process.|$|E
2500|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the G.D. Searle company. He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When he licked his finger, he noticed {{that it had a}} sweet taste. Torunn Atteraas Garin oversaw the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. It is an odorless, white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 200 times as sweet as sugar and {{can be used as a}} tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, gelatins, beverages, and chewing gum. [...] When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids. [...] This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks. [...] Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original amino acids. [...] Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product, and is thus useful for reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> in a product.|$|E

40|$|In {{chronologically}} aging yeast, longevity can {{be extended}} by administering a caloric restriction (CR) diet or some small molecules. These life-extending interventions target the adaptable target of rapamycin (TOR) and cAMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling pathways that are under the stringent control <b>of</b> <b>calorie</b> availability. We designed a chemical genetic screen for small molecules that increase the chronological life span of yeast under CR by targeting lipid metabolism and modulating housekeeping longevity pathways that regulate longevity irrespective <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> available <b>calories.</b> Our screen identifies lithocholic acid (LCA) as one of such molecules. We reveal two mechanisms underlying the life-extending effect of LCA in chronologically aging yeast. One mechanism operates in a calorie availability-independent fashion and involves the LCA-governed modulation of housekeeping longevity assurance pathways that do not overlap with the adaptable TOR and cAMP/PKA pathways. The other mechanism extends yeast longevity under non-CR conditions and consists in LCA-driven unmasking of the previously unknown anti-aging potential of PKA. We provide evidence that LCA modulates housekeeping longevity assurance pathways by suppressing lipid-induced necrosis, attenuating mitochondrial fragmentation, altering oxidation-reduction processes in mitochondria, enhancing resistance to oxidative and thermal stresses, suppressing mitochondria-controlled apoptosis, and enhancing stability of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA...|$|R

Excess adiposity is known to cause chronic inflammation, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease: {{the leading cause of death}} for over a decade. With many women of reproductive age considered overweight or obese, the association between obesity and metabolic disorder is concerning. Positive metabolic health outcomes of offspring due to maternal exercise have been documented; however, little is known about how maternal exercise modifies high fat diet associated metabolic dysregulation upon mothers during gestation. The aim of our study was to determine whether maternal exercise before and during pregnancy would alleviate high fat diet-associated glucose and insulin resistance in high fat fed pregnant mice. Using C 57 BL/ 6 virgin female mice as a model, we fed the animals either a low fat diet (LFD; 10 % kcal from fat) or a high fat diet (HFD; 45 % kcal from fat) for twelve weeks, with an exercise intervention after four weeks (HFD+Ex), and pregnancy initiation after eight weeks of diet consumption. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed at day 15 of gestation. Prescribed diet and exercise (or sedentary) behavior continued throughout pregnancy until animals were sacrificed at the 19 th day of gestation. The HFD animals experienced a significant increase in body weight, along with increased <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> consumed per day, and exercise further increased body weight and food intake. Both the HFD and the HFD+Ex animals displayed impaired glucose and insulin tolerance testing when compared with the LFD animals. Interestingly, exercise improved serum insulin levels at termination. mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty acid and glucose metabolism were upregulated in the HFD+Ex animals compared with the HFD mice. Our study exhibits that the development of adiposity from the consumption of a high fat diet prior to pregnancy leads to detrimental maternal effects during late gestation, including higher body weight, and glucose tolerance. Surprisingly, the addition of exercise did not alter dam morphology or gestational glucose tolerance; however, it did improve serum insulin levels and metabolite handling in the heart...|$|R
