25|$|Before 2011, a cab's {{availability}} {{was indicated}} by {{the lights on the}} top of the car. When no lights were lit, the cab would be occupied by passengers. When just the center light showing the medallion number was lit, the cab would be empty and available. When the OFF and DUTY inscriptions to either side of the medallion number were lit, with the medallion <b>number</b> <b>off,</b> the cab would be off duty and not accepting passengers. However, when the OFF and DUTY inscriptions were lit and the medallion number was still lit, the cab would be off duty but the driver could choose to pick up passengers heading in the same direction as the driver. In fall 2011, the TLC announced a plan to replace the three-light system with a simple indicator as to whether the taxi is available. In 2012, the TLC simplified the light system further, with a lit roof light indicating that the taxi is available and an unlit light indicating that the taxi is not available, regardless of whether it has passengers or is simply off duty. It also started fining drivers $100 for picking up passengers without the light on, except for if the driver is picking up their last passenger of their shift.|$|E
500|$|Other New York {{portrayals of}} Hamlet of note include that of Ralph Fiennes's in 1995 (for which {{he won the}} Tony Award for Best Actor) – which ran, from first preview to closing night, a total of one hundred performances. About the Fiennes Hamlet Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times that it was [...] "… not one for {{literary}} sleuths and Shakespeare scholars. It respects the play, but it doesn't provide any new material for arcane debates on what it all means. Instead it's an intelligent, beautifully read …" [...] Stacy Keach played the role with an all-star cast at Joseph Papp's Delacorte Theatre in the early 70s, with Colleen Dewhurst's Gertrude, James Earl Jones's King, Barnard Hughes's Polonius, Sam Waterston's Laertes and Raúl Juliá's Osric. Sam Waterston later played the role himself at the Delacorte for the New York Shakespeare Festival, and the show transferred to the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1975 (Stephen Lang played Bernardo and other roles). Stephen Lang's Hamlet for the Roundabout Theatre Company in 1992 received mixed reviews and ran for sixty-one performances. David Warner played the role with the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1965. William Hurt (at Circle Rep Off-Broadway, memorably performing [...] "To Be Or Not to Be" [...] while lying on the floor), Jon Voight at Rutgers, and Christopher Walken (fiercely) at Stratford CT have all played the role, as has Diane Venora at the Public Theatre. Off Broadway, the Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted an uncut first folio Hamlet in 1978 at Columbia University, with a playing time of under three hours. In fact, Hamlet is the most produced Shakespeare play in New York theatre history, with sixty-four recorded productions on Broadway, and an untold <b>number</b> <b>Off</b> Broadway.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1993, Katz {{installed}} a nationwide 800 number at Real Life Storybooks, {{where people could}} ask questions and directly order storybooks about real-life situations. The 800 number was one <b>number</b> <b>off</b> from another {{that led to a}} nationwide hot line designed to prevent child abuse. Katz often received misdialed child abuse calls. Despite her informing the callers that they had dialed a wrong number, the callers often continued, relating stories such as a father who wanted Katz's input on the potential harm [...] "if he were to rape his 4-month-old daughter lying naked next to him" [...] and a [...] "mother of a 9-month-old who was convinced the child was trying to [...] "get her goat" [...] by crying." [...] Eventually, Katz changed the 800 number per the request of the purveyors of the child abuse hotline, reasoning that [...] "I changed my 800 number because I was asked to do so, so the callers could get the help they needed." ...|$|E

6000|$|And {{consider}} {{just what}} these [...] "complications" [...] are {{of which the}} opponents of Proportional Representation chant so loudly. In the sham election of to-day, which the politicians claim gives them a mandate to muddle up our affairs, the voter puts a x against {{the name of the}} least detestable of the two candidates that are thrust upon him. Under the Proportional Representation method there will be a larger constituency, a larger list of candidates, and a larger number of people to be elected, and he will put I against the name of the man he most wants to be elected, 2 against his second choice, and if he likes he may indulge in marking a third, or even a further choice. He may, if he thinks fit, <b>number</b> <b>off</b> the whole list of candidates. That is all he will have to do. That is the stupendous intricacy of the method that flattens out the minds of Lord Harcourt and Sir Thomas Whittaker. And as for the working of it, if you must go into that, all that happens is that if your first choice gets more votes than he needs for his return, he takes only the fraction of your vote that he requires, {{and the rest of the}} vote goes on to your Number 2. If 2 isn't in need of all of it, the rest goes on to 3. And so on. That is the profound mathematical mystery, that is the riddle beyond the wit of Westminster, which overpowers these fine intelligences and sets them babbling of [...] "senior wranglers." [...] Each time there is a debate on this question in the House, member after member hostile to the proposal will play the ignorant fool and pretend to be confused himself, and will try to confuse others, by deliberately clumsy statements of these most elementary ideas.
