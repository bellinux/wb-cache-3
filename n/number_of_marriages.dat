However, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> of such nature are low. Marriages are arranged. The preferred minimum age is 22 for males and 18 for females, though these ages are increasing as of 2003.

500|$|Hugh Mackie {{purchased}} the Old Blacksmith's Shop at Gretna Green in 1890 and resided there as [...] "anvil priest" [...] until 1926 {{when he was}} looking to retire and find a replacement. Mackie found Richard Rennison, who had recently joined the community, and by October 1927, Rennison was presiding over marriages and acting as caretaker of the shop. The shop had ceased any metalwork in 1900 and was solely used for marriage ceremonies. A natural showman, Rennison soon became the resident [...] "anvil priest" [...] and set about marrying people. He would regularly point out that, although {{he was not a}} member of the clergy, he could marry people as he was [...] "No Sinner" [...] – the reverse of his surname! In his first ten years, he married around 2000 couples, the majority of whom were couples between 40 and 60 years old. By 1939, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> he had performed had increased past 4000 due to the many young men who wanted to get married before starting their service in World War II.|$|E

40|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{divorced}} <b>marriages,</b> as a phenomenon, {{is becoming}} more and more interesting, specially now, at the time of crisis. The question is what leads to this phenomenon. There is a series of factors which could be the cause of divorce; some of them are measurable, some of them are not, some are of economic nature, some are emotional, some sociodemographic, some related to customs etc. This paper tried to present some of these factors and to establish the relation between them and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> divorced <b>marriages.</b> The analysis included the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> divorced <b>marriages</b> in the municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in 2008. ...|$|R

2500|$|Parisians under Napoleon married {{relatively}} old; {{the average}} age of marriage between 1789 and 1803 was between thirty and thirty-one for men and twenty-five to twenty-six for women. Unmarried couples living together in concubinage , especially in the working class, were also common. These couples were frequently stable and long-lasting; a third lived together for more than six years, twenty-two percent for more than nine years. Divorce had been common during the Revolution and the Consulate, when one in five marriages ended in divorce. Napoleon was in general hostile to divorces, though he himself divorced Empress Josephine. In 1804 the divorce rate had fallen to ten percent. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> increased greatly {{in the last years of}} the Empire, after the disastrous campaign in Russia, as many young men married to try to avoid military service. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> rose from 4,561 in 1812 to 6,585 in 1813, the largest number since 1796.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contemporary}} Taiwan {{the phenomenon}} of mixed marriages between couples comprising different ethnic groups has grown to include people from the Indian subcontinent, southeast Asia, Europe, the Americas and the Pacific Islands.

As Taiwan's birthrate is among the lowest in the world, this contingent is playing an increasingly important role in changing Taiwan's demographic makeup. By 2010, this social-cultural group of people is typically known as [...] "Taiwan's new resident (台灣新住民 lit. [...] "New Residents in Taiwan" [...] ).|$|E

60|$|THAT {{there is}} strong reason to suspect the {{existence}} of a most extensive plot, conspiracy, or design, secretly contrived by vast numbers of single ladies in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and now extending its ramifications in every quarter of the land; the object and intent of which plainly appears to be the holding and solemnising of an enormous and unprecedented <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages,</b> on the day on which the nuptials of Her said Most Gracious Majesty are performed.|$|E
6000|$|Such a {{transaction}} {{is not an}} entrance into a [...] "holy state of matrimony": it is {{as often as not}} the inauguration of a lifelong squabble, a corroding grudge, that causes more misery and degradation of character than a dozen entirely natural [...] "desertions" [...] and [...] "betrayals." [...] Yet the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> effected more or less in this way must be enormous. When people say that love should be free, their words, taken literally, may be foolish; but they are only expressing inaccurately a very real need for the disentanglement of sexual relations from a mass of exorbitant and irrelevant conditions imposed on them on false pretences to enable needy parents to get their daughters [...] "off their hands" [...] and to keep those who are already married effectually enslaved by one another.|$|E

60|$|The {{converse}} case occurs when, by {{improvements in}} agriculture, {{the repeal of}} corn laws, or other such causes, the necessaries of the laborers are cheapened, and they are enabled with the same [money] wages to command greater comforts than before. Wages will not fall immediately: it is even possible that they may rise; but they will fall at last, so as to leave the laborers no better off than before, unless during this interval of prosperity the standard of comfort regarded as indispensable by the class is permanently raised. Unfortunately this salutary effect {{is by no means}} to be counted upon: it is a much more difficult thing to raise, than to lower, the scale of living which the laborers will consider as more indispensable than marrying and having a family. According to all experience, a great increase invariably takes place in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> in seasons of cheap food and full employment.|$|E
60|$|One {{principal}} {{reason is}} that the histories of mankind that we possess are histories only of the higher classes. We have but few accounts that can be depended upon of the manners and customs of that part of mankind where these retrograde and progressive movements chiefly take place. A satisfactory history of this kind, on one people, and of one period, would require the constant and minute attention of an observing mind during a long life. Some of the objects of inquiry would be, in what proportion to the number of adults was the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages,</b> to what extent vicious customs prevailed in consequence of the restraints upon matrimony, what was the comparative mortality among the children of the most distressed part of the community and those who lived rather more at their ease, what were the variations in the real price of labour, and what were the observable differences {{in the state of the}} lower classes of society with respect to ease and happiness, at different times during a certain period.|$|E
60|$|Is it not {{probable}} {{that in this}} case the number of inhabitants had increased faster than the food and the accommodations necessary to preserve them in health? The mass of the people would, upon this supposition, be obliged to live harder, and a greater number would be crowded together in one house, and it is not surely im{{probable that}} these were among the natural causes that produced the three sickly years. These causes may produce such an effect, though the country, absolutely considered, may not be extremely crowded and populous. In a country even thinly inhabited, if an increase of population take place, before more food is raised, and more houses are built, the inhabitants must be distressed in some degree for room and subsistence. Were the marriages in England, for the next eight or ten years, to be more prolifick than usual, or even were a greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> than usual to take place, supposing the number of houses to remain the same, instead of five or six to a cottage, there must be seven or eight, and this, added to the necessity of harder living, would probably have a very unfavourable effect on the health of the common people.|$|E
