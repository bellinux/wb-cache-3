A variety of oral and topical anti-fungal agents are currently available but their use is limited by their adverse effect profile, drug–drug interactions, and limited efficacy. Therefore, {{there is a great}} need for newer anti-fungal agents. Tavaborole is one of these newer agents and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2014 for the topical treatment of mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis.

Functional current collector (FCC) [10, 11, 12] was developed to isolate the damaged areas in a mechanically abused battery cell, which significantly decreased the heat generation rate.

Although these enzymes are well conserved among prokaryotes, significant divergence has occurred between prokaryotic and eukaryotic aaRSs, which can be exploited in the discovery of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Although several aaRS inhibitors have been reported before, they failed as a result of poor selectivity and limited cell penetration. Areas covered: This review covers January 2006 to April 2012 wherein several new analogues were claimed as aaRS inhibitors. Anacor Pharmaceuticals patented several boron-containing derivatives inhibiting the function of the editing domain of aaRSs. Two patents describe the combination of aaRS inhibitors with other antibacterial agents. Patents disclosing aaRS inhibitors for indications other than antimicrobial agents are not considered for review here. Expert opinion: Several recently disclosed leads may form the foundation for development of potent and selective bacterial aaRS inhibitors. In comparison with, for example, terbinafine and itraconazole, compound C 10 (AN 2690) is a very promising candidate for treatment of ungual and periungual infections with improved <b>nail</b> <b>penetration</b> and low keratin binding.

40|$|Thermal runaway imposes major {{challenges}} to large-scale lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The working temperature of a LIB is usually around room temperature. However, upon mechanical abuse {{such as an}} impact or <b>nail</b> <b>penetration,</b> LIB cell components may fail and internal short circuits could be formed. As a result, a series of exothermic electrochemical reactions and decompositions would take place and the local temperature can rapidly increase. In this thesis, a few novel techniques are investigated to mitigate thermal runaway of LIBs. Mechanically triggered approach has been employed. Thermal-runaway retardant (TRR) is encapsulated in mechanically responsive packages made of materials inert to the battery environment, and upon external mechanical loadings the packages can be broken apart and release the TRR. This mechanism allows {{for the use of}} aggressive chemicals to suppress the short circuit discharge and reduce the subsequent exothermic phenomena, immediately after the battery is damaged even before temperature increase begins. The best TRR candidates are identified to be amines and alkanes. Among amines, secondary amines and tertiary amines perform better than primary amines. The reduction in electrolyte ionic conductivity and the displacement of electrolyte are the thermal-runaway-mitigation mechanisms of the secondary and the tertiary amines, respectively.

If untreated, infection progresses and may lead to discomfort, reduced quality of life, and risk of complications in patients with comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, peripheral vascular disease). Onychomycosis treatments are designed to eradicate causative pathogens (most commonly Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes), restore healthy nails, and prevent recurrence or spread of infection. Given the deep-seated nature of most cases of onychomycosis, an effective antifungal agent needs to achieve and maintain sufficient drug concentrations throughout the nail unit {{for the duration of}} healthy nail in-growth. Oral antifungal drugs are the most effective available therapy and are generally well tolerated, but may be limited by safety concerns and the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs).

The present study aimed at evaluating the antimycotic activity {{of a new}} water-soluble nail lacquer containing CPX (CPX/sol), easily removable by washing with water and applicable to periungual skin. Objectives To compare transungual permeation of CPX with that of MRF in the same hydroxypropyl chitosan-based nail lacquer (MRF/sol) and with a nonwater-soluble reference (Loceryl®; Galderma International, La Défense, France), and to evaluate the antimycotic activity of CPX/sol and Loceryl® against the most common fungal strains that cause onychomycosis. Methods In vitro drug permeation experiments with CPX/sol, MRF/sol and Loceryl® were carried out through bovine hoof slices. Experimental permeates from CPX/sol and Loceryl® underwent in vitro susceptibility testing against clinical isolates of dermatophytes, moulds and yeast. Results MRF transungual flux from MRF/sol lacquer was significantly higher when compared with Loceryl®. CPX was able to permeate hoof membranes more easily compared with MRF. CPX and MRF concentrations in the subungual fluids collected after application of CPX/sol or Loceryl® were sufficient to inhibit fungal growth, {{with the exception of}} Candida parapsilosis. Smaller amounts of fluid containing CPX were required for complete inhibition of fungal growth. Efficacy index values were significantly higher for CPX/sol. Conclusions Application of the CPX/sol nail lacquer allows rapid <b>nail</b> <b>penetration</b> of CPX, providing CPX levels sufficient to inhibit fungal growth for a prolonged period of time (30 h) after application of lacquer dose. CPX/sol nail lacquer appeared superior to the market reference Loceryl® in terms of both vehicle (hydroxypropyl chitosan) and active ingredient (CPX) as witnessed by its higher efficacy on all nail pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Background  In a {{previous}} study a new hydrosoluble nail lacquer (P- 3051) containing 8 % ciclopirox (CPX) showed higher <b>nail</b> <b>penetration</b> compared to a water-insoluble 5 % amorolfine (MRF) lacquer. To our knowledge, in vivo human data on a similar topic are not available. Objectives  To compare fingernail penetration of P- 3051 with that of MRF reference in humans and to evaluate their predicted efficacy against Trichophyton rubrum and Candida parapsilosis. Methods  Single centre, randomized, multiple dose, open label, within subjects study. Test and reference were self-applied to all fingernails of either hand for 28  days. At baseline and after 15 and 25  days, the nail free edge was collected for analysis. Efficiency coefficients were calculated for T. rubrum and C. parapsilosis as ratios of nail concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration. The coefficients were classified as very high, high or poor. Results  Nail concentrations after 15  days were 2. 82  ±  0. 58  μg/mg for CPX and 0. 64  ±  0. 11  μg/mg for MRF. At day 25 there was a non-significant decline (1. 85  ±  0. 31  μg/mg, P =  0. 077) for CPX and a highly significant (0. 13  ±  0. 03  μg/mg, P =  0. 0002) 80 % decline for MRF. Efficiency coefficients were very high/high in all subjects treated with P- 3051 against both T. rubrum and C. parapsilosis; they were significantly lower for MRF reference against both pathogens at both observation points. Conclusions  P- 3051 exhibited better penetration and higher predicted efficacy after in vivo multiple application to human fingernails when compared to MRF reference. These in vivo data are in good agreement with our previous in vitro study...|$|E
40|$|The {{inferior}} cycle {{performance of}} All-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) {{resulting from the}} low mixed ionic and electronic conductivity in the electrodes, {{as well as the}} large interfacial resistance between the electrodes and the electrolyte need to be overcome urgently for commercial applications. Here, an advanced cell construction strategy has been proposed, in which a cohesive and highly conductive poly(oxyethylene) (PEO) -based electrolyte is employed both in the cathode layer and in the interface of the electrolyte/anode, leading to an ASSLB with superior interfacial contact between the electrolyte and the electrodes, and forming a three-dimensional ionic conductive network in the cathode layer. Especially, the NASICON-type ionic conductor covered with the PEO-based polymer, integrating the advantages of an inorganic electrolyte and organic electrolyte, presents an enhanced electrochemical stability and an excellent compatibility with the Li electrode. Consequently, the ASSLBs of LiFePO 4 (LFP) /Li with this advanced construction strategy exhibit excellent interfacial compatibility, ultralong cycle life and high capacity, i. e., a reversible discharge capacity maintained at 127. 8 mA h g(- 1) for the 1000 th cycle at 1 C with a retention of 96. 6 %, and an initial discharge capacity of 153. 4 mA h g(- 1) with a high retention of 99. 9 % after 200 cycles at 0. 1 C. Besides, the high-voltage monopolar stacked batteries with a bipolar structure can be fabricated conveniently, showing an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 6. 63 V with a good cycle performance. In particular, the ASSLBs present outstanding safety in terms of <b>nail</b> <b>penetration</b> and burning in fire. Therefore, this advanced cell construction strategy may generate tremendous opportunities in the search for novel emerging solid-state lithium metal batteries...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Targeting drug {{treatment}} to fungal infections that reside within {{or below the}} nail plate is problematic due to the highly restrictive barrier of the human nail. To optimise topical formulations for ungual drug delivery, inclusion of an effective penetration enhancer (PE) is imperative. At present, in vitro nail permeation studies can take weeks or months {{in order to obtain}} any meaningful data because the lack of a simple in vitro model to identify and develop nail PEs makes the selection and optimisation of novel PEs an empirical and inefficient process. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare three methods for pre-formulation screening of putative ungual PEs and then to select the most suitable technique for screening candidates that may enhance the permeation of therapeutic agents through the human nail. Methods. Three screening techniques were evaluated; nail swelling (weight increase of human nail clippings), horse hoof swelling (weight increase of horse hoof clippings) and <b>nail</b> <b>penetration</b> of a radiolabelled permeability probe. Four test PEs were evaluated using each screening method and nail swelling was identified as a simple, rapid, economic, relevant and reliable technique. This screen was then used to evaluate 20 potential PEs. Thioglycolic acid (TA), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and urea H 2 O 2 produced the greatest nail weight increases; 71. 0 +/- 4. 6 %, 69. 2 +/- 6. 6 %, and 69. 0 +/- 9. 9 respectively. To confirm the relationship between human nail swelling and altered ungual barrier function, a permeation study was performed in human nails using caffeine as a model penetrant. Results and Discussion. Human nails pre-treated with TA in vitro had a 3. 8 -fold increase in caffeine flux compared to the control (TA-free solution). This study illustrated the potential to use human nail clipping swelling as a surrogate marker of PE activity for topical ungual drug delivery...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ender and Simon Weidner popularized {{the concept}} of closed condylocephlic nailing for intertrochanteric {{fractures}} in 1970. The clinical experience of authors revealed that Ender nailing alone cannot provide secure fixation in elderly patients with osteoporosis. Hence we conducted a study to evaluate the efficacy of a combined fixation procedure using Ender nails and a cannulated compression screw for intertrochanteric fractures. Materials and Methods: 76 patients with intertrochanteric fractures were treated using intramedullary Ender nails and cannulated compression screw from January 2004 to December 2007. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 80 years (range 70 - 105 years). Using the Evan&#x 2032;s system of classification 49 were stable and 27 unstable fractures. Inclusion criteria was high risk elderly patients (age > 70 years) with intertrochanteric fracture. The exclusion criteria included patients with pressure sores over the trochanteric region. Many patients had pre-existing co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, COPD, ischemic heart disease, CVA and coronary artery bypass surgery. The two Ender nails of 4. 5 mm each were passed across the fracture site into the proximal neck. This was reinforced with a 6. 5 mm cannulated compression screw passed from the sub trochanteric region, across the fracture into the head. Results: The mean follow-up was 14 months (range 9 - 19 months) Average time to fracture union was 10 weeks (range 6 - 16 weeks). The mean knee ROM was 130 o (&# 177; 5 o). There was no case of <b>nail</b> <b>penetration</b> into hip joint. In five cases with advanced osteoporosis there was minimal migration of Ender nails distally. Conclusions: The Ender nailing combined with compression screw fixation in cases of intertrochanteric fractures in high risk elderly patients could achieve reliable fracture stability with minimal complications...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{treatment}} of onychomycosis remains problematic {{even though there}} are several potent antifungal agents available for patient use. The aim of this investigation was to understand whether the structural modifications that arise when a patient’s nail become infected plates influences the permeation of drugs into the nail following topical application. It was hoped that through improving understanding of the nail barrier in the diseased state, the development of more effective topical treatments for onychomycosis could be facilitated. The permeation of three compounds with differing hydrophobicities, caffeine, terbinafine and amorolfine (clogD at pH 7. 4 of − 0. 55, 3. 72 and 4. 49 respectively), was assessed across both healthy and onychomycosis infected, full thickness, human nail plate sections. Transonychial water loss (TOWL) measurements performed on the healthy and diseased nails supported previous observations that the nail behaves like a porous barrier given the lack of correlation between TOWL values with the thicker, diseased nails. The flux of the more hydrophilic caffeine was twofold greater across diseased in comparison with the healthy nails, whilst the hydrophobic molecules terbinafine and amorolfine showed no statistically significant change in their <b>nail</b> <b>penetration</b> rates. Caffeine flux across the nail was found to correlate with the TOWL measurements, though no correlation existed for the more hydrophobic drugs. These data supported the notion that the nail pores, opened up by the infection, facilitated the passage of hydrophilic molecules, whilst the keratin binding of hydrophobic molecules meant that their transport through the nail plate was unchanged. Therefore, in order to exploit the structural changes induced by nail fungal infection it would be beneficial to develop a small molecular weight, hydrophilic antifungal agent, which exhibits low levels of keratin binding...|$|E
