30|$|Transparency is the {{fundamental}} requirement for sustainability, and in this direction traceability assists in integrating different stakeholders in the supply chain to create transparency along with supporting {{different aspects of the}} sustainability. However, implementing traceability is a challenging task owing to the organizational and technological complexities associated with the textile sector and expected outcomes. The organizational complexities can be analyzed from the organizational and supply chain context of the sector. The textile sector is a dispersed network of actors carrying different operations (Shih and Agrafiotis 2015). Despite having dominance in the supply chain, all the upstream suppliers are not managed by the retailer/brand owner. The brand owners monitor only those suppliers which affect them mostly. The rest of the links are either monitored indirectly (such as random audits or certifications) or not monitored at all. Hence, the textile supply chain is not an integrated sector, and the retailer—which acts as supply chain captain—partially controls the supply chain, and there is no single actor which can enforce the strategies for traceability (or transparency) throughout the supply chain. Additionally traceability is a double-edged sword, it brings better control and other benefits which assist transparency in the supply chain, however, the increased transparency is not always beneficial and acceptable to all. For example, the supply chain actors would not like to disclose all his suppliers and related information because  this may benefit the opponents directly or indirectly and affect their strategies. Moreover, there is often an involvement of agents (or middlemen) between the buyers and the <b>suppliers,</b> and the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> act as a competitive factor for the agents. As agents disclosing the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> for supply chain transparency can potentially lead the buyers to bypass the agents for future contracts with the suppliers; therefore, it is not considered a favorable option to the agents (Egels-Zandén et al. 2015).|$|R

30|$|Owing the {{complexity}} of the textile supply networks, it is indeed a challenging task for the brands to recall all the suppliers and to monitor their activities. In this context, traceability has emerged a practical solution to create social transparency. Traceability, by definition, is the “ability to verify the history, location, or application of an item by means of documented recorded identification” (International organization for standardization 2007); therefore, it allows recalling of the product information. The traceability number used is to uniquely identify the product, and the product-linked information is thus can be retrieved for each product using the unique traceability number. The traceability information allows each of the supply chain actors identify thus improving transparency in the supply chain. A number of initiatives have been witnessed in the past in this direction. For instance, All American Clothing Co. provides a traceability number with their jeans which allow consumers to trace the history of the jeans back to the cotton field (Goswami 2014), which alternately allows the customers to decide the sustainability aspect of the garment. Similarly, Nudie Jeans Co. has implemented a high level of traceability in its supply chain and disclosed the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> on its website to create more transparency in the supply chain (Egels-Zandén et al. 2015).|$|R

Previous proposed models have considered only two states <b>of</b> nature: all <b>suppliers</b> fail to deliver and not all suppliers fail to deliver. In practice, however, there is clearly a partial loss associated with the failure <b>of</b> any individual <b>supplier.</b> We present models that allow a more realistic decision-making process by taking into consideration the independent risks <b>of</b> individual <b>supplier</b> failures when the probability of failure for each <b>of</b> the <b>suppliers</b> is equal {{as well as the}} case where the probability of failure from each <b>of</b> the <b>suppliers</b> is not equal. We also consider various levels <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> failure probability and possible procurement or operating cost savings gained from using less reliable suppliers. The results indicate that when suppliers are highly reliable, sole sourcing is the lowest cost approach under all experimental conditions. However, as the suppliers become less reliable, additional suppliers may be required to obtain the lowest cost. Finally, it was shown that only in the extreme conditions <b>of</b> unreliable <b>suppliers,</b> high loss to operational cost per supplier, and low ability to mitigate the failure from a partial set <b>of</b> <b>suppliers,</b> having a large number <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> is an effective strategy.
