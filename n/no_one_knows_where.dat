Calmer, he wants to wait for help, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> they are because they had told their {{families}} they were going somewhere else. They winch the vehicle back up to the road, but they cannot get it to start.|$|E

25|$|Where Ado-Ekiti is {{situated}} {{is a land}} that has been continuously inhabited/occupied by human communities from time immemorial. Available research shows that human societies of unknown antiquity occupied this neighbourhood about eleven thousand (11,000) years ago. These ancient inhabitants were probably the same or progenitors/ancestors of Igbon near Ogotun, Erijiyan, Ijero, Ulesun and Asin (near Ikole) who were probably autochthones because available traditions shows that they had lived in and near their abodes from time immemorial. As a matter of fact, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where,</b> if any, they came from {{and for how long}} they had lived in those ancient sites. Ulesun appears the best-known apparently on account of its size, the number of its subordinate communities especially Aso, Ulero, Isinla, Ilamoji, Ukere and Agbaun (near Igbemo), its well-organized traditional religion including its festivals etc. and its location at the heartland of Ekitiland. These ancient people were the ancestors of Ekiti, they played hosts in the 7th and 8th centuries, about 1,200 years ago, to waves of immigrants from the basins of the rivers Niger and Benue; these settled among the ancient Ekiti, and were fewer in number and so, the hosts culturally absorbed them.|$|E

500|$|The {{fact that}} the novel's title character, the President, is never named gives him a mythological dimension, rather than the {{personality}} of a specific Guatemalan dictator. Literary scholar Kevin Bauman notes that readers are not let {{into the mind of}} the President; instead his appearance is [...] "continually re-evaluated, re-defined, and, ultimately, re-constructed according to his perception by others, similar to Asturias's own novelistic (re)vision of Estrada Cabrera's regime". According to literary critic Hughes Davies, the President [...] "represents political corruption but his presentation as an evil deity who is worshiped in terms that mockingly echo religious ritual elevates him to a mythical plane" [...] and he is [...] "an inverted image of both the Christian and Mayan deities since he is the source only of death". The dictator also has an element of mystery about himit seems that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> he is because he occupies several houses {{on the outskirts of the}} town. Mystery also surrounds the questions of when and how he sleeps. In the novel, rumors abound that he sleeps beside the telephone with a whip in his hand while others claim that he never sleeps at all.|$|E

Of her time at the Western Front, McMein said, [...] "Since I have lived through air bombing I never will be frightened by anything on earth. The terror of air raids cannot be imagined. They are heralded by the blowing of sirens and the ringing of church bells, and amid this din the lights are extinguished and then suddenly come the bombs, falling <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where.</b> The noise they made is worse {{than that of the}} battles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deuteronomy is {{a series}} of speeches by Moses on the plains of Moab {{opposite}} Jericho. Also referred to as Mishneh Torah in Hebrew (a repeat of the Torah) the essential gist of the entire book is a rebuke to the Children of Israel to not worship idolatry, to not follow in the ways of Cana'an, and to cleave to God. Moses proclaims the Law (Deuteronomy 12–26), gives instruction concerning covenant renewal at Shechem (Deuteronomy 27–28) and gives Israel new laws (the [...] "Deuteronomic Code"). At {{the end of the book}} (Deuteronomy 34) Moses is allowed to see the promised land from a mountain, and then dies. The text emphasises that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> Moses was finally buried (34:6). Knowing that he was nearing the end of his life, Moses had appointed Joshua his successor, bequeathing to him the mantle of leadership. Soon afterwards Israel begins the conquest of Canaan.|$|E

50|$|The idea {{of blood}} chit {{originates}} from 1793 when French balloonist Jean-Pierre Blanchard demonstrated his hot air balloon in the United States.
