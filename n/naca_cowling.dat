25|$|It {{was also}} at Langley that Weick headed the {{development}} of streamlined, low-drag engine cowling technology that was to advance aircraft performance dramatically. The <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> first revolutionized civil air transport by making aircraft faster and more profitable. It also found application on the bombers and fighters of World War II. For this engineering breakthrough, he won the prestigious Collier Trophy for NACA in 1929.|$|E
25|$|The Orion was {{the last}} design using many {{identical}} elements from the Lockheed designs preceding it. It primarily used {{all the elements of}} the Altair, but included a forward top cockpit similar to the Vega, plus the <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> introduced in the Air Express. Lockheed used the same basic fuselage mold and wing for all these wooden designs (the Explorer wing was unique), hence the close similarities between them. The Orion featured an enclosed cabin with seating for six passengers. The Orion received its Approved Type Certificate on May 6, 1931.|$|E
25|$|It {{made its}} maiden flight in August 1935, {{powered by a}} 720hp (537kW) Hispano-Suiza 9Vbrs radial engine. With this engine it reached a speed of 352km/h (219mph). In October that year it was re-engined with a 680hp (507kW) Hispano-Suiza 14Hbrs radial in a <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling,</b> {{increasing}} the speed and the floats were modified. It was re-engined again in October 1937 with a 900hp (671kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs-1 V12 engine with a 20mm cannon firing through the propeller boss. Despite reaching 400km/h (248mph), faster {{than any of the}} other competitors, the R.90 was not ordered into production, 20 Loire 210s being purchased instead.|$|E

25|$|Looking {{to improve}} the design, Lockheed {{delivered}} the Vega 5 in 1929. Adding the Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp engine of 450hp (336kW) improved weights enough to allow two more seats to be added. A new <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> increased cruise speed to 155mph (249km/h) and top speed to 165mph (266km/h). The new six-seat configuration proved to be too small, and the 5 was purchased primarily for private aviation and executive transport. A total of 64 Vega 5s were built. In 1931, the United States Army Air Corps bought two Vega 5s; one designated C-12 and one as the C-17. The C-17 had additional fuel tanks in the wings.|$|E
25|$|The hottest {{points on}} any {{air-cooled}} engine are the cylinder heads, located around {{the circumference of}} a radial engine. In order to provide sufficient air to cool the engine, airflow had to be maximized at this outer edge. This was normally accomplished by leaving {{the majority of the}} front face of the engine open to the air, causing considerable drag. During the late 1920s, NACA led development of a dramatic improvement by placing an airfoil-shaped ring around the outside of the cylinder heads (the <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling).</b> The shaping accelerated the air as it entered the front of the cowl, increasing the total airflow, and allowing the opening in front of the engine to be made smaller.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, the Jupiter was licence-built from 1924 by Nakajima, {{forming the}} basis of their own {{subsequent}} radial aero-engine design, the Nakajima Ha-1 Kotobuki. It was produced in Poland as the PZL Bristol Jupiter, in Italy as the Alfa Romeo 126-RC35, and in Czechoslovakia by Walter Engines. The most produced version was in the Soviet Union, where their Shvetsov M-22 version powered the initial Type 4 version of the Polikarpov I-16 (55 units produced). Type 4 Polikarpovs can be identified by their lack of exhaust stubs, rounded <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> and lack of cowling shutters, features which were introduced on the Shvetsov M-25 powered Type 5 and later variants (total production 4,500+ units). Production started in 1918 and ceased in 1930.|$|E
50|$|The SET XV was {{a fighter}} {{aircraft}} developed in Romania in the mid-1930s. It was a conventional single-bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span braced by N-struts. It was fitted with fixed tailwheel undercarriage with spatted mainwheels. The cockpit was fully enclosed, {{and the engine}} was fitted with a <b>NACA</b> <b>cowl.</b> Construction throughout was fabric-covered metal.|$|R
25|$|The {{remaining}} four aircraft were production P-3As, but primarily used {{to service}} test the Pratt & Whitney Wasp engine. In {{addition to the}} significant increase in drag, the radial engine also interfered with the pilot's view.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was equipped with}} a closed cockpit, had fixed landing gear, and was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-1535 radial air-cooled engine as had the F3U-1, but also included a controllable pitch propeller and a new <b>NACA</b> <b>cowl</b> with adjustable cowling gills on {{the trailing edge of}} the cowl. The adjustable cowling gills permitted better control of cooling airflow over the engine.|$|R
500|$|It {{made its}} first flight on 30 April 1930 and was fitted with an {{imported}} supercharged [...] Jupiter VII. It was painted in silver with a red cheat line; a red [...] "VT" [...] was superimposed on the red star on the rudder. The second prototype, known as the VT-12, had a Jupiter VI engine, and took to the air on 22 May, bearing the name [...] "Klim Voroshilov." [...] The two prototypes also differed in minor details regarding {{the shape of the}} tail and the construction of the landing gear. All this meant a slight difference in weight and performance between the two prototypes was present, with the second being slightly heavier and faster, while the first had a slight range advantage and a higher service ceiling. The third prototype, designated as the VT-13 and inscribed with [...] "A Gift for the XVIth Congress of the Party", was powered by a [...] Soviet-built M-15 engine with a <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling,</b> but this proved to be unreliable and was not put into production.|$|E

50|$|The SV.5 {{nevertheless}} found {{a customer}} in the Latvian Air Force, which was seeking a similar aircraft. When a study mission to Belgium confirmed the type's suitability, the Latvian government negotiated {{the purchase of}} ten examples in exchange for 5,700 tonnes of wheat. These machines were slightly different from the prototype, with a <b>NACA</b> <b>cowl</b> {{in place of the}} Townend ring, a resdesigned horizontal stabiliser, and simplified main undercarriage. Germany would not permit the overflight of the aircraft, so in September 1936 they were shipped disassembled to Riga, where Jean Stampe oversaw their erection by VEF.|$|R

The corrected propulsive efficiency is shown to be independent of the angle of attack for the high-speed and the climbing ranges of flight. A working chart is presented for the selection of similar propellers over a wide range of airplane speed, engine power, and propeller revolution...|$|R
2500|$|The Mark IV {{introduced}} {{the much more}} powerful 825hp (615kW) Bristol Perseus sleeve valve radial engine enclosed in a <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> which significantly improved performance, increasing maximum speed to 156mph (251km/h) and rate of climb to 840ft/min (4.3m/s). [...] However, in this version the Perseus had overheating problems, and this version was thus deemed unsuitable for tropical service with production limited to 18 aircraft all of which served with the home based squadrons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} had a metal monocoque fuselage, {{while the}} wings were of corrugated metal construction. The mainwheels {{of the conventional}} landing gear retracted backwards into the wing, being operated by cables driven by a handwheel turned by the pilot. The first prototype was powered by an imported 433kW (580hp) Bristol Mercury radial engine enclosed by an <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> and driving a two-bladed wooden propeller. [...] It was armed with a single PV-1 machine gun, with provision for two Kurchevsky APK-37 recoilless autocannon under the wing.|$|E
2500|$|During development, {{interest}} in the [...] "buried engine" [...] concept faded. Improvements in conventional streamlining, notably the <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling,</b> eliminated {{the need for a}} buried engine for improved performance. Additionally, with bomber designs like the B-17, using radial engines for power, starting to enter production, the need for new bomber designs became less pressing and the Army turned its attention to new pursuit models. [...] For this role the O-1430 was not terribly useful, so Continental modified the basic design into a V-12, and then into an inverted-V-12, the I-1430.|$|E

40|$|The Report {{describes}} a research programme undertaken at ARA in 1968 - 73. It represents {{the first attempt}} in the UK to design forecowl profiles for a podded engine nacelle of modern proportions, with the specific aim of obtaining favourable supercritical flow development over the cowl exterior. Six cowl shapes were tested, of empirical design but exploiting the 'peaky' pressure distribution principle previously evolved for high speed aerofoils. Earlier results for <b>NACA</b> I-series <b>cowls</b> were used as a basis of comparison though all the present cowls had larger lip radii than <b>NACA</b> 1 -series <b>cowls</b> {{in order to improve}} the low speed performance in conditions that might correspond to a windmilling engine in single-engine flight of a twin-engined transport.

50|$|During an {{era when}} biplanes were still common, {{the use of a}} {{monoplane}} planform, a <b>NACA</b> engine <b>cowl,</b> and large wheel pants significantly reduced aerodynamic drag, creating a streamlined design. Construction of the fuselage and wings was based on a plywood structure with the thin wings braced with wires. The sleek, polished fuselage continued the shape and width of the cowl throughout, with the cockpit featuring a small windshield, set nearly flush with the skin. A turtle deck extended from the cockpit to the vertical tail creating a fairing for the helmeted head of the pilot.|$|R
2500|$|One {{aircraft}} (YR-ACS) was built, later modified with a cabin {{for five}} passengers and two luggage compartments. Initially {{intended to be}} powered by a licence-built [...] Gnome & Rhône 7K radial engine, the aircraft was eventually fitted with a [...] Armstrong Siddeley Serval I ten-cylinder radial engine in a <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling.,</b> which was, in turn, replaced with a [...] Lorraine 7M Mizar 47, driving a three-bladed propeller. The fixed landing gear was supported by long faired vertical struts to the wings, with teardrop spats over the mainwheels and a tailwheel {{at the end of}} the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} the fuselage of the PL.3 was mostly of metal construction. From propeller to aft {{of the wing}} root the fuselage was a tube of constant diameter, set by the wide chord <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> around its 525kW (700hp) licence-built Pratt & Whitney Hornet radial engine, which then tapered to the tail. [...] The underlying structure from nose to tail was a rectangular chrome molybdenum steel frame, aluminium covered in front and plywood behind. [...] The low profile cockpit placed the crew at the wing trailing edge. [...] The PL.3 had a conventional undercarriage with mainwheels retracting rearwards into the wing, leaving a small part exposed.|$|E
2500|$|Drag: Having the {{cylinders}} {{exposed to the}} airflow increases drag considerably. The answer was the addition of specially designed cowlings with baffles to force the air between {{the cylinders}}. The first effective drag reducing cowling that didn't impair engine cooling was the British Townend ring or [...] "drag ring" [...] which formed a narrow band around the engine covering the cylinder heads, reducing drag. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics studied the problem, developing the <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> which further reduced drag and improved cooling. Nearly all aircraft radial engines since have used NACA-type cowlings. Because radial engines are often wider than similar inlines or vees, {{it is more difficult}} to design an aircraft to minimize cross sectional area, a major cause of drag, although {{by the beginning of the}} Second World War, this disadvantage had largely disappeared as aircraft sizes increased, and multi-row radials increased the power produced in relation to the cross sectional area.|$|E
40|$|Results {{of flight}} {{tests of the}} {{performance}} and cooling characteristics of three NACA D cowlings and of a conventional <b>NACA</b> D <b>cowling</b> on the XP- 42 airplane are summarized and compared. The D cowling is, in general, characterized {{by the use of}} an annular inlet and diffuser section for the engine-cooling air. The D cowlings tested were a long-nose high-inlet-velocity cowling, a short-nose high-inlet-velocity cowling, and a short-nose low inlet-velocity cowling. The use of wide-chord propeller cuffs or an axial-flow fan with the D cowlings increased the cooling pressure recoveries in the climb condition at the expense of some of the improvement in speed...|$|R
5000|$|The exact date of {{the first}} flight of the Renard R.33 is not known but it was {{probably}} in the early summer of 1934. Apart from the Les Ailes article, there are no references to this Belgian aircraft in the contemporary Anglo-French aviation press. A reconstructed Belgian civil aircraft register shows two examples, the first (OO-ANT) registered on 1 May 1934 and the second (OO-ANV) on 10 August 1934. [...] The first, which had two registered owners after leaving Renard, had the Renard 120 uncowled engine but the second, which stayed with the company, had a wide chord, <b>NACA</b> type <b>cowling</b> as well as faired mainwheels. At one time this aircraft was fitted with a [...] ADC Cirrus Hermes I four cylinder, upright inline.|$|R
5000|$|In its {{original}} configuration, designated the Ju 52/1m, the Ju 52 was a single-engined aircraft, powered by either a BMW IV or Junkers liquid-cooled V-12 engine. However, the single-engine model was underpowered, and after seven prototypes had been completed, all subsequent Ju 52s were built with three radial engines as the Ju 52/3m (drei motoren — [...] "three engines"). Originally powered by three Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet radial engines, later production models mainly received 574 kW (770 hp) BMW 132 engines, a licence-built refinement of the Pratt & Whitney design. Export models were also built with 447 kW (600 hp) Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp and 578 kW (775 hp) Bristol Pegasus VI engines. The two wing-mounted radial engines of the Ju 52/3m had half-chord cowlings and in planform view (from above/below) {{appeared to be}} splayed outwards, being mounted at an almost perpendicular angle to the tapered wings sweptback leading edge (in a similar fashion to the Mitsubishi G3M bomber and Short Sunderland; the angled engines on the Ju 52 were intended {{to make it easier}} to maintain straight flight should an engine fail, while the others had different reasons). The three engines had either Townend ring or NACA cowlings to reduce drag from the engine cylinders, although a mixture of the two was most common (as can been seen in many of the accompanying photographs), with deeper-chord NACA ducts on the wing engines and a narrow Townend ring on the center engine (which was more difficult to fit a deeper <b>NACA</b> <b>cowl</b> onto, due to the widening fuselage behind the engine). Production Ju 52/3m aircraft flown by Luft Hansa before World War II, as well as Luftwaffe-flown Ju 52s flown during the war, usually used an air-start system to turn over their trio of radial engines, using a common compressed air supply that also operated the main wheels brakes.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> {{enhanced}} speed through drag reduction while delivering improved engine cooling. The {{idea that}} the <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> produced thrust through the Meredith effect is fallacious—although in theory {{the expansion of the}} air as it was heated by the engine could create some thrust by exiting at high speed, in practice this required a cowling designed and shaped to achieve the high speed exit of air required (which the <b>NACA</b> <b>cowling</b> was not), and in any case, at 1930s airspeeds, the effect is negligible.|$|E

40|$|This report {{gives the}} results of {{measurements}} of the lift, drag, and propeller characteristics of several wing and nacelle combinations with a tractor propeller. The nacelles were so located that the propeller was about 31 % of the wing chord directly ahead of {{the leading edge of}} the wing, a position which earlier tests (NASA Report No. 415) had shown to be efficient. The nacelles were scale models of an <b>NACA</b> <b>cowled</b> nacelle for a radial air-cooled engine, a circular nacelle with the V-type engine located inside and the radiator for the cooling liquid located inside and the radiator for the type, and a nacelle shape simulating the housing which would be used for an extension shaft if the engine were located entirely within the wing. The propeller used in all cases was a 4 -foot model of Navy No. 4412 adjustable metal propeller. The results of the tests indicate that, at the angles of attack corresponding to high speeds of flight, there is no marked advantage of one type of nacelle over the others as far as low drag is concerned, since the drag added by any of the nacelles in the particular location ahead of the wing is very small. The completely cowled nacelle for a radial air-cooled engine appears to have the highest drag, the liquid-cooled engine appears to have the highest drag, the liquid-cooled engine nacelle with external radiator slightly less drag. The liquid-cooled engine nacelle with radiator in the cowling hood has about half the drag of the cowled radial air-cooled engine nacelle. The extension-shaft housing shows practically no increase in drag over that of the wing alone. A large part of the drag of the liquid-cooled engine nacelle appears to be due to the external radiator. The maximum propulsive efficiency for a given propeller pitch setting is about 2 % higher for the liquid-cooled engine nacelle with the radiator in the cowling hood than that for the other cowling arrangements...|$|R
