25|$|The Greek Prime Minister, Constantine Mitsotakis, took a {{much more}} {{moderate}} line on the issue than {{many of his colleagues}} in the governing <b>New</b> <b>Democracy</b> <b>party.</b> Despite opposition from hardliners, he endorsed the proposal in March 1993. The acceptance of the formula by Athens also led to the reluctant acquiescence of the government in Skopje, though it too was divided between moderates and hardliners on the issue.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Andreas Papandreou, George Papandreou's son, {{founded the}} Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) in {{response}} to Karamanlis's conservative <b>New</b> <b>Democracy</b> <b>party,</b> with the two political formations dominating in government {{over the next four}} decades. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980. Greece became the tenth member of the European Communities (subsequently subsumed by the European Union) on 1 January 1981, ushering in a period of sustained growth. Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping, and a fast-growing service sector raised the country's standard of living to unprecedented levels. Traditionally strained relations with neighbouring Turkey improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999, leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against Turkey's bid for EU membership.|$|E
500|$|On 1 May 2010, the Greek {{government}} announced {{a series of}} austerity measures (the Third austerity package within months) to secure a three-year [...] loan (First Economic Adjustment Programme). This was met with great anger by some Greeks, leading to massive protests, riots, and social unrest throughout Greece. The Troika, a tripartite committee formed by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (EC, ECB and IMF), offered Greece a second bailout loan worth [...] in October 2011 (Second Economic Adjustment Programme), but with the activation being conditional on implementation of further austerity measures and a debt restructure agreement. Surprisingly, the Greek prime minister George Papandreou first answered that call by announcing a December 2011 referendum on the new bailout plan, but had to back down amidst strong pressure from EU partners, who threatened to withhold an overdue [...] loan payment that Greece needed by mid-December. On 10 November 2011, Papandreou resigned following {{an agreement with the}} <b>New</b> <b>Democracy</b> <b>party</b> and the Popular Orthodox Rally to appoint non-MP technocrat Lucas Papademos as new prime minister of an interim national union government, with responsibility for implementing the needed austerity measures {{to pave the way for}} the second bailout loan.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{strained}} ties during Josip Broz Tito's rule of Yugoslavia, Serbian-Greek relations {{reached the}} point where the creation of a state for Serbs and Greeks was seriously proposed by Slobodan Milošević in 1992. According to the proposal Greece, Serbia, and the Republic of Macedonia would all be members of the tripartite confederation. In 1994, Milošević invited Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to consider the longstanding proposal of the Athens-Belgrade-Skopje confederation. Papandreou characterized the idea as [...] "a pioneering, interesting proposal" [...] but noted that it had not yet been examined. Main opposition <b>New</b> <b>Democracy</b> <b>party</b> leader Miltiadis Evert, who had also met with Milošević, said that all Balkan countries should instead gain accession to the European Union. Political Spring party leader Antonis Samaras said that the proposal was [...] "interesting but should be thoroughly examined." [...] These proposals failed to gain any significant response from the Greek government, mostly because of the precarious state of Yugoslavia at the time.|$|E

Two proposed amendments referring to Bulgaria and Greece's failure to recognise a Macedonian minority living in these countries, and one referring to the constitutional name Republic of Macedonia, were rejected. On the other hand, the EU reiterated that the naming issue will not be considered in the accession process (although Greece's ability to veto remains intact).
