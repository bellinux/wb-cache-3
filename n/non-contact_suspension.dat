40|$|A control {{strategy}} of combining HÂ¿ control and feedback linearization {{was applied to}} the model of a highly nonlinear, three Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOF) electromagnetic actuator, which was recently designed for <b>non-contact</b> <b>suspension</b> of a large payload. The new electromagnetic actuator has the advantage of passive gravity compensation based on permanent magnets with low stiffness and high force density. But the nonlinearity is so high that the stability status along each DOF changes while the translator is traveling within the working range. Feedback linearization method was used to compensate the nonlinearity, a stabilizing controller was employed to eliminate the slow-varying calculation error of the passive force, and an HÂ¿ controller was designed for vibration isolation. Simulation results show that the proposed {{control strategy}} has robust vibration isolation performance within a working range in which the relation between the magnetic force and the relative position is highly nonlinear...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this program}} is the {{development}} of a high precision multisensor based on a high T(sub c) superconducting proof mass. The design of a prototype is currently underway. Key technical issues appear resolvable. High temperature superconductors have complicated, hysteretic flux dynamics but the forces on them can be linearly controlled for small displacements. Current data suggests that the forces on the superconductors decay over a short time frame and then stabilize, though very long term data is not available. The hysteretic force characteristics are substantial for large scale excursions, but {{do not appear to be}} an issue for the very small displacements required in this device. Sufficient forces can be exerted for <b>non-contact</b> <b>suspension</b> of a centimeter sized proof mass in a vacuum sealed nitrogen jacket cryostat. High frequency capacitive sensing using stripline technology will yield adequate position resolution for 0. 1 micro-g measurements at 100 Hz. Overall, a reasonable cost, but very high accuracy, system is feasible with this technology...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, analysis, and experimental testing of systems for <b>non-contact</b> <b>suspension</b> {{and control of}} flexible structures. Our particular {{focus is on the}} use of such suspensions in manufacturing processes which can be facilitated by the ability to control workpiece motion without contact. This can be of significant utility in processes such as coating, painting, heat treating, and web handling. We develop a novel approach for the control of such non-contact suspensions through what we term sensor averaging and actuator averaging. The difficult stabil-ity and robustness problems imposed by the flexible dynamics of the workpiece can be overcome by taking a properly-weighted average of the outputs of a distributed array of N motion sensors (sensor averaging), and/or by applying a properly-weighted distributed array of M forces (actuator averaging) to the workpiece. The theory for these dual techniques is developed in detail in the thesis. These approaches are shown to be independent of the specific boundary conditions or the longitudinal dimensions of the workpiece. These approaches are thus generally applicable to a wide range o...|$|E

Our particular {{focus is on}} the use of such suspensions in manufacturing processes such as coating and painting which can be facilitated by non-contact handling. We have developed a novel approach for the control of such <b>non-contact</b> <b>suspensions</b> through what we term sensor averaging and actuator averaging.

These approaches are shown to be independent of the specific boundary conditions or the longitudinal dimensions of the workpiece. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of our theory in the successful magnetic suspension of a 3 m long, 6. 35 mm diameter, 0. 89 mm wall thickness steel tube with varying boundary conditions.

40|$|Containerless high {{temperature}} processing and material property measurements are discussed. Researchers developed methods for <b>non-contact</b> <b>suspension,</b> heating, and property measurement for materials at temperatures up to 3, 680 K, the melting point of tungsten. New, scientifically interesting results were obtained in Earth-based research. These {{results and the}} demonstration of new methods and techniques form a basis for further advances under the low gravity environment of space where containerless conditions are more easily achieved. Containerless {{high temperature}} material property investigations that have been completed in this and our earlier projects include measurements of fluorine LaB sub 6 reaction kinetics at 1, 000 to 1, 500 K; optical property measurements on sapphire (Al 2 O 3) at temperatures up to the melting point (2, 327 K); and vapor pressure measurements for LaB sub 6 at 2, 000 to 2, 500 K, for molybdenum up to 2, 890 K and for tungsten up to 3, 680 K. Gas jet levitation which is applicable to any solid material, and electromagnetic levitation of electrical conductors were used to suspend the materials of interest.

40|$|The Dynamic Spin Rig (DSR) is used {{to perform}} {{vibration}} tests of turbomachinery blades and components under spinning conditions in a vacuum. A heteropolar radial active magnetic bearing was integrated into the DSR to provide <b>non-contact</b> magnetic <b>suspension</b> and mechanical excitation of the rotor to induce turbomachinery blade vibrations. The magnetic bearing replaces {{one of the two}} existing conventional radial ball bearings. Prior operation of the DSR used two voice-coil type linear electromagnetic shakers which provided axial excitation of the rotor. The new magnetic suspension and excitation system has provided enhanced testing capabilities. Tests were performed at high rotational speeds for longer duration and higher vibration amplitudes. Some characteristics of the system include magnetic bearing stiffness values up to 60, 000 lb. /in., closed loop control bandwidth around 500 Hz, and multi-directional radial excitation of the rotor.

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has {{developed}} a magnetic bearing system for the Dynamic Spin Rig (DSR) with a fully suspended shaft {{that is used to}} perform vibration tests of turbomachinery blades and components under spinning conditions in a vacuum. Two heteropolar radial magnetic bearings and a thrust magnetic bearing and the associated control system were integrated into the DSR to provide magnetic excitation as well as <b>non-contact</b> mag- netic <b>suspension</b> of a 15. 88 kg (35 lb) vertical rotor with blades to induce turbomachinery blade vibration. For rotor levitation, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with a special feature for multidirectional radial excitation worked well to both support and shake the shaft with blades. However, more advanced controllers were developed and successfully tested to determine the optimal controller in terms of sensor and processing noise reduction, smaller rotor orbits, more blade vibration amplitude, and energy savings for the system. The test results of a variety of controllers that were demonstrated up to 10. 000 rpm are shown. Furthermore, rotor excitation operation and conceptual study of active blade vibration control are addressed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades the deeper and more {{detailed}} understanding of rotating machinery dynamic behavior facilitated the study and the design of several devices aiming at friction reduction, vibration damping and control, rotational speed increase and mechanical design optimization. Among these devices a promising technology is represented by active magnetic actuators which found a great spread in rotordynamics and in high precision applications due to (a) the absence of all fatigue and tribology issues motivated {{by the absence of}} contact, (b) the small sensitivity to the operating conditions, (c) the wide possibility of tuning even during operation, (d) the predictability of the behavior. This technology can be classified as a typical mechatronic product due to its nature which involves mechanical, electrical and control aspects, merging them in a single system. The attractive potential of active magnetic suspensions motivated a considerable research effort for the past decade focused mostly on electrical actuation subsystem and control strategies. Examples of application areas are: (a) Turbomachinery, (b) Vibration isolation, (c) Machine tools and electric drives, (d) Energy storing flywheels, (e) Instruments in space and physics, (f) <b>Non-contacting</b> <b>suspensions</b> for micro-techniques, (g) Identification and test equipment in rotordynamics. This chapter illustrates the design, the modeling, the experimental tests and validation of all the subsystems of a rotors on a five-axes active magnetic suspension. The mechanical, electrical, electronic and control strategies aspects are explained with a mechatronic approach evaluating all the interactions between them. The main goals of the manuscript are: • Illustrate the design and the modeling phases of a five-axes active magnetic suspension; • Discuss the design steps and the practical implementation of a standard suspension control strategy; • Introduce an off-line technique of electrical centering of the actuators; • Illustrate the design steps and the practical implementation of an online rotor selfcentering control technique. The experimental test rig is a shaft (Weight: 5. 3 kg. Length: 0. 5 m) supported by two radial and one axial cylindrical active magnetic bearings and powered by an asynchronous high frequency electric motor. The chapter starts on an overview of the most common technologies used to support rotors with a deep analysis of their advantages and drawbacks with respect to active magnetic bearings. Furthermore a discussion on magnetic suspensions state of the art is carried out highlighting the research efforts directions and the goals reached in the last years. In the central sections, a detailed description of each subsystem is performed along with the modeling steps. In particular the rotor is modeled with a FE code while the actuators are considered in a linearized model. The last sections of the chapter are focused on the control strategies design and the experimental tests. An off-line technique of actuators electrical centering is explained and its advantages are described in the control design context. This strategy can be summarized as follows. Knowing that: a) each actuation axis is composed by two electromagnets; b) each electromagnet needs a current closed-loop control; c) the bandwidth of this control is depending on the mechanical airgap, then the technique allows to obtain the same value of the closed-loop bandwidth of the current control of both the electromagnets of the same actuation axis. This approach improves performance and gives more steadiness to the control behavior. The decentralized approach of the control strategy allowing the full suspensions on five axes is illustrated from the design steps to the practical implementation on the control unit. Furthermore a selfcentering technique is described and implemented on the experimental test rig: this technique uses a mobile notch filter synchronous with the rotational speed and allows the rotor to spin around its mass center. The actuators are not forced to counteract the unbalance excitation avoiding saturations. Finally, the experimental tests are carried out on the rotor to validate the suspension control, the off-line electrical centering and the selfcentering technique. The numerical and experimental results are superimposed and compared to prove the effectiveness of the modeling approach...|$|R
