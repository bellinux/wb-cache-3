The results show that pressure wave phenomena occur between the high-pressure reservoir and the discharge orifice, but that these pressure waves can be controlled so as to be advantageous to the injection of the fuel.

Because of the complexity of the internal flow and uncertainty of the internal pressure, there is uncertainty {{in the design of the}} key structure. We simulate the whole opening process of the valve under different key structural dimensions with Fluent Dynamic Mesh and UDFs, and we do experiments to authenticate simulation results. The turn-on time we get from the simulation is the same as that from experiments under the valveâ€™s actual operating conditions, in other words, the simulation results are correct, so we can identify the valve flow and get the internal pressure data which provides a reliable basis for the design of the key structural dimensions...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory {{in connection with}} a general research on fuel-injection for aircraft. The purpose of the {{investigation was}} to determine the factors controlling the reproducibility of spray penetration and secondary discharges after cut-off. The development of single sprays from automatic injection valves was recorded by means of special high-speed photographic apparatus capable of taking 25 consecutive pictures of the moving spray at a rate of 4, 000 per second. The effect of two types of injection valves, injection-valve tube length, initial pressure in the injection-valve tube, speed of the injection control mechanism, and time of spray cut-off, on the reproducibility of spray penetration, and on secondary discharges were investigated. It was found that neither type of injection valve materially affected spray reproducibility. The initial pressure in the injection-valve tube controlled the reproducibility of spray penetrations. An increase in the initial pressure or in the length of the injection-valve tube slightly increased the spray penetration within the limits of this investigation. The speed of the injection-control mechanism did not affect the penetration. Analysis of the results indicates that secondary discharges were caused in this apparatus by pressure waves initiated by the rapid opening of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>valve.</b> The secondary discharges were eliminated in this investigation by increasing the length of the injection-valve tube.

40|$|Objective: Epicardial {{adipose tissue}} (EAT) is {{associated}} with the presence, severity and extent of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) in addition to subclinical atherosclerosis. We investigated if EAT thickness is related to acute myocardial infarction in patients with CAD. We also searched for the association between EAT thickness and objective coronary flow and myocardial perfusion parameters such as and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Frame count (TFC) and myocardial blush grade (MBG). Methods: Two-hundred consecutive patients with stable angina pectoris or acute coronary syndrome who were admitted to Ufuk University Faculty of Medicine, Dr RÄ±dvan Ege Hospital cardiology department were included in this observational, cross-sectional study. EAT thickness was evaluated by conventional transthoracic echocardiography. Coronary angiography was performed to determine the coronary involvement and perfusion. Results: Mean EAT thicknesses were 5. 4 Â± 1. 9 mm, 6. 3 Â± 1. 8 mm, and 8. 5 Â± 1. 4 mm in the stable angina pectoris (SAP), unstable angina pectoris (USAP) and acute myocardial infarction groups, respectively (p 7 mm; mean TFC: 21. 6 Â± 2. 2, 25. 3 Â± 3. 3 and 35. 2 Â± 7. 7; and MBG values: 2. 98 Â± 0. 14, 2. 83 Â± 0. 57 and 1. 7 Â± 1. 16, respectively; both p< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{investigation}} is to integrate an electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brake model with efficient longitudinal train force algorithms based on the trajectory coordinate formulations. The ECP brake model, developed in this investigation consists of the train line (cable), locomotive automatic brake valve, air brake pipe, and ECP manifold. The train line, which covers {{the entire length of}} the train, allows the brake commands to be received by the car simultaneously. While pneumatic pressure is used to generate the braking forces, the brake pipe is no longer used to provide the brake level commands. Instead, the brake pipes are used to provide a continuous supply of compressed air stored in a reservoir mounted on each railcar. Using the ECP system to apply the brakes uniformly and instantaneously gives better train control, shortens the stopping distances, and leads to a lower risk of derailment. In this investigation, the fluid continuity and momentum equations are used to develop the governing air pressure flow equations. These partial differential equations are converted to a set of ordinary differential equations using the finite element method leading to an air brake force model that accounts for the effect of the air flow in long train pipes as well as the effect of leakage and branch pipe flows. The car brake forces are applied to the wheels using the ECP manifold located in each car. The ECP manifold used in this investigation has four valves: <b>cut-off</b> <b>valve,</b> vent valve, auxiliary valve, and emergency valve. The ECP manifold is connected to three main pneumatic components: the auxiliary reservoir, the emergency reservoir, and the brake cylinder. The reservoirs serve as the main storage of the pressurized air, while the brake cylinder and other mechanical components such as the rigging and the brake shoes transmit the brake force to the wheels. In this investigation, a mathematical model of the ECP manifold and its components is developed. The relationship between the main components of the ECP brake system and the train dynamics is discussed, and the final set of differential equations that integrates the ECP brake and train dynamics is presented. Different simulation scenarios are considered in this study in order to investigate the effect of the brake forces on the train longitudinal dynamics in the case of different braking scenarios. The performance of the developed ECP brake system is compared with the Association of American Railroads safety and operation standards, and with experimental results published in the literature...|$|R

50|$|The first simple fixed-stroke {{hydraulic}} motors had the disadvantage {{that they used}} the same volume of water whatever the load and so were wasteful at part-power. Unlike steam engines, as water is incompressible, {{they could not be}} throttled or their <b>valve</b> <b>cut-off</b> controlled. To overcome this, motors with variable stroke were developed. Adjusting the stroke, rather than controlling admission valves, now controlled the engine power and water consumption. One of the first of these was Arthur Rigg's patent engine of 1886. This used a double eccentric mechanism, as used on variable stroke power presses, to control the stroke length of a three cylinder radial engine. Later, the swashplate engine with an adjustable swashplate angle would become a popular way to make variable stroke {{hydraulic motors}}.|$|R
50|$|Developments {{after the}} {{separate}} expansion valve {{led to more}} sophisticated valve gears that could achieve the same goal of varying inlet lap with a single valve. The first of these were the link valve gears, particularly the Stephenson link valve gear. This uses a pair of eccentrics with a sliding link mechanism between them {{that acts as a}} mechanical adding device. Selecting intermediate positions provides a valve actuation with the effect of increasing <b>cut-off.</b> As such <b>valve</b> gears also provided, and were first developed for, reversing, they were widely used on locomotives. Theoretically, the precise effect is that of reduced valve travel, rather than an earlier cut-off. This has the effect of reducing overall valve opening, reducing initial steam supply and so having the effect of wire-drawing rather than pure expansion. Despite this, the Stephenson gear became one of the two most-widely used gears for locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Fitchburg were notable in also {{supplying}} {{an automatic}} governor (illus., left-hand flywheel) that controlled the <b>valve's</b> <b>cut-off</b> according to load. Such governors would become significant around 1900 {{with the development}} of the high-speed engine, where they were used to control speed precisely. In these earlier medium-speed engines, the function of these governors was not just to control the engine's speed, but also to improve efficiency. The Fitchburg piston valves could be operated with a cut-off from zero to two-thirds of the stroke. A larger cut-off improves efficiency when operating under light loads. Earlier engines had used devices such as expansion valves to achieve this, but they also required the continued attention of a skilled driver, who could 'drive' the engine by varying the cut-off as load changed. The earlier Watt governors only controlled a throttle valve, so although they controlled an engine's speed, they did not encourage efficiency. An engine operating with no cut-off but a throttled steam supply will be operating inefficiently, owing to reduced expansive working and the risk of wire-drawing. The first 'automatic' governors were termed that because they not only controlled the speed, but could also take over the role of the driver and could vary cut-off too.|$|R
5000|$|Up to 1860 Saxon {{appears to}} have mainly {{concentrated}} on engine repair work and producing mill gearing and shafting. Spring Works was extended in 1860 {{by the addition of}} an erecting shop, when engine making seems to have started in a small way, and was further expanded in 1870. An example of an early Saxon engine was one built in the 1860s for a Manchester confectionery firm which was a horizontal single cylinder non-condensing engine, 60 ihp, with a Meyer variable <b>cut-off</b> slide <b>valve.</b> The construction of larger engines had started by 1870/71 when they built a horizontal cross compound engine, possibly for an Oldham customer, which used steam at the relatively high pressure for that time of 100 lbs psi. By 1875 Saxon was building engines of between 750 and 1,000 ihp, for the new 'Oldham Limiteds'. These were mostly horizontal twin tandem compound engines - a 4-cylinder design for which Saxons became noted during {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. During 1871-80 Saxons are known to have built at least 10 engines with a capacity of about 6,800 ihp, mostly for cotton mills. [...] George Saxon engines were charactised by having a long stroke and high operating speed.They used Corliss valves on their large mill engines from around 1890 onwards, having previously used slide valves in their engines. The Saxon design dispensed with the wrist plate and unusually placed Corliss valves on both the HP (high-pressure) and LP (low-pressure) cylinders where other designers, such as McNaught and Petrie would have used piston valves. Saxons were late adopters of Corliss valve engines but were quick to adopt the efficient triple-expansion engine design. During 1891 and 1892 they converted a number of large compound engines to triple-expansion, with a saving in fuel of up to 18%, and in 1892 they built their first horizontal twin tandem triple-expansion engine, 1,260 ihp, for Rock Mill, Ashton-under-Lyne. They also continued to build large horizontal twin tandem compound engines. Near-identical engines Saxons built in 1902 for Dawn Mill, Shaw, and Magnet Mill, Chadderton, developed 1400 hp at 140 psi and 1700 hp at 160 psi. The flywheels of these engines were 26 ft in diameter and weighed between 80 and 90 tons. The speed of 60 rpm and stroke of 5 ft were standard at this time.|$|R
40|$|Cascade {{impactor}} {{analysis is}} the standard technique for in vitro characterization of aerosol clouds generated by medical aerosol generators. One important reason for using this inertial separation principle is that drug fractions are classified into aerodynamic size ranges {{that are relevant to}} the deposition in the respiratory tract. Measurement of these fractions with chemical detection methods enables establishment of the particle size distribution of the drug in the presence of excipients. However, the technique is laborious and time consuming and most of the devices used for inhaler evaluation lack sufficient possibilities for automation. In addition to that; impactors often have to be operated under conditions for which they were not designed and calibrated. Particularly, flow rates through impactors are increased to values at which the flow through the nozzles is highly turbulent. This has an uncontrolled influence on the collection efficiencies and cut-off curves of these <b>nozzles.</b> Moreover, the <b>cut-off</b> value varies with the flow rate through an impactor nozzle. On the other hand, the high air flow resistances of most impactors are rather restricting to the attainable (fixed) inspiratory flow curves through these devices. Especially for breath actuated dry powder inhalers, higher flow rates and flow increase rates may be desirable than can be achieved in combination with a particular type of impactor. In this paper, the applicability of laser diffraction technology is evaluated as a very fast and highly reliable alternative for cascade impactor analysis. With this technique, aerodynamic diameters cannot be measured, but for comparative evaluation and development, comprising most in vitro applications, this is not necessary. Laser diffraction has excellent possibilities for automated recording of data and testing conditions, and the size classes are independent of the flow rate. Practical limitations can be overcome by using a special inhaler adapter which enables control of the inspiratory flow curve through the inhaler, analysis of the emitted fine particle mass fraction and pre-separation of large particles during testing of dry powder inhalers containing adhesive mixtures.
