Not long afterward, the roof of their kitchen gave away with a thud. Both were tile roofs.|$|E
25|$|Otter, {{commanded}} by Captain Dorr, was fitted out at Boston, and despatched to Sydney, where she anchored on 25 January 1796. Captain Dorr {{and a few}} of his crew landed at the very spot where Mr. Muir was located (the vicinity of Jeffrey Street in the modern suburb of Kirribilli), under the pretence that they were proceeding to China and were in want of fresh water. The captain had an audience with Mr Muir, and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> was lost. On the morning of 11 February 1796, Muir was safely taken on board Otter, which instantly set sail. Other accounts state that Muir rowed out of the harbour and met Otter outside the Heads. Muir's own account of his escape, as given in subsequent letters preserved in Spanish archives, is that Captain Dorr, coming into Port Jackson in January 1796 agreed to give him a passage to Boston provided he could effect his escape without danger to Dorr. On the evening of February 18, the day before Dorr was to sail, Muir put to sea in a small boat, with two servants, taking nothing with him but the shirt and coat on his back, and that about the middle of the next day they boarded Otter at a considerable distance from land. One account states that as many as 20 convicts escaped from the penal colony in Port Jackson aboard Otter. Three of the convicts were left on Nomuka Island in Ha'apai Tonga on 15 March 1796.|$|E

[...] Clearly, Frederick's position was precarious, and the Prussians were outnumbered.

This would, Bourcet thought, finish the campaign. After some persuasion Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen were convinced and everyone went to sleep.

The proceedings lasted three weeks, during which time Fleming was unwell, suffering a heart attack as the case progressed. Two weeks after the case, during the weekly Tuesday staff conference at his employers, The Sunday Times, Fleming suffered a serious, second heart attack that necessitated convalescence, which he undertook at the Dudley Hotel in Hove. While there, one of Fleming's friends, Duff Dunbar, gave him a copy of Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin to read and suggested that he {{took the time to}} write up the bedtime story that Fleming used to tell his son Caspar each evening.

500|$|As Glitter was an {{unsuccessful}} mixture of covers and dance music, Charmbracelet incorporated slower, contemporary melodies. In {{his review of}} the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine criticized the album's content, describing Carey's voice as [...] "in tatters". He wrote, [...] "Whenever she sings, there's a raspy whistle behind her thin voice and she strains to make notes throughout the record. She cannot coo or softly croon, nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs. Her voice is damaged, and there's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> where it sounds strong or inviting." [...] Though fueled by strong media attention regarding Carey's return to music, {{as well as her}} new deal with Island Records, the album failed to deliver the type of success she had been accustomed to throughout the 1990s, and only managed sales of five million copies globally. After the album's release, and its succeeding tour, Carey began conceptualizing and working on a new project, eventually titled The Emancipation of Mimi, her tenth studio effort. By November2004, Carey had already recorded several songs for the album.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Charmbracelet was {{released}} to nearly negative critical reception. Aggregator website Metacritic, which averages professional reviews into a numerical score, gave Charmbracelet {{a score of}} 43/100, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic rated the album two out of five stars, and criticized its production and the condition of Carey's voice. He wrote, [...] "Whenever she sings, there's a raspy whistle behind her thin voice and she strains to make notes throughout the record...Her voice is damaged, and there's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> where it sounds strong or inviting." [...] Tom Sinclair of [...] Entertainment Weekly said she was [...] "in fine voice". He wrote that [...] "Through the Rain" [...] sinks in its own sodden sentimentality, as do by-the-numbers efforts like 'Yours' and 'I Only Wanted'", and added that [...] "Clown' is a moody number graced with mournful acoustic guitar and a gorgeously nuanced vocal, while 'Sunflowers for Alfred Roy' is a short, sweet song sung to a lovely piano accompaniment". He finished by saying that [...] "too much of Charmbracelet is mired in middle-of-the-road muck." ...|$|E

The episode had everything that makes 30 Rock great." [...] Canning opined that Liz's admissions to Oprah Winfrey were [...] "painfully funny", and that Tracy [...] "was on fire" [...] following his actions in this episode. In conclusion, Canning gave it a 10 out of 10 rating. Jeremy Medina of Paste was complimentary towards the episode, reporting that it had [...] "madcap humor tirelessly delivered one joke after another at a lightning fast speed, adding up to one of the funniest episodes in the series." [...] Medina enjoyed the social experiment between Jenna and Tracy, noting that it was [...] "hilarious".

500|$|In The Village Voice, Gary Giddins penned an angrily dismissive {{review of}} Agharta, {{in which he}} charged Davis with failing to assert his musical {{presence}} on the terribly [...] "sad" [...] record. A few days after it was published, he was sent a package full of large cotton swabs, industrial-strength scouring pads, and a card that read, [...] "The next time you review Miles Davis clean out your head." [...] Although Giddins dismissed the message, Agharta grew {{to become one of}} his favorite albums from the trumpeter's electric period, as he reevaluated its elements of drama, relentless tension, and what he considered the best performances of Fortune and Cosey's careers. [...] "There really is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> when the music fails to reflect the ministrations of the sorcerer himself", Giddins later said. Nathan Cobb from The Boston Globe reviewed the record favorably in 1976, calling it [...] "a kind of firestorm for the '70s" [...] with a [...] "positively cosmic" [...] rhythmic foundation and Davis [...] "the one who leads the others through the unknown waters of electronic jazz rock". In Down Beat, Gilmore said the band performed best on the breakneck segments opening each of the two discs, where Cosey's ferocious improvisations [...] "achieved a staggering emotional dimension" [...] lacking on the slower passages, which he felt were redeemed by Davis' elegiac trumpet playing. Lester Bangs found Agharta too difficult to definitively assess but nonetheless more fascinating than most other music being released at the time. He wrote in Phonograph Record that Davis' new music was the product of his heart's once luminous [...] "emotional capacities" [...] having been shattered by [...] "great, perhaps unbearable suffering", but that [...] "the soul beyond it" [...] could never be destroyed and interestingly [...] "almost glows uniquely brighter in its own dark coldness; and that, that which is all that is left, is merely the universe".|$|E
2500|$|His second album, <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>Moment</b> Too Soon, {{was much}} more successful, {{becoming}} the best-selling country album in 1994. The first single, [...] "Indian Outlaw", caused considerable controversy, as critics argued that it presented Native Americans in a patronizing way. Some radio stations refused to play it, but the controversy helped spur sales, and the song became McGraw's first top 10 country single (getting as high as No.8), and reaching No.15 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E

2500|$|The second single {{from the}} album, [...] "Don't Take the Girl", became McGraw's first No.1 country hit, in {{addition}} to reaching number 17 on the Hot 100, and [...] "helped cement his image as a ruggedly good-looking guy with a sensitive side." [...] By year's end, [...] "Down on the Farm" [...] had peaked at number 2 on the country charts; after it, the album's title track became his second number 1 single in early 1995, and [...] "Refried Dreams" [...] reached number 5 afterward.

[...] On the strength of this success, McGraw won Academy of Country Music awards for Album of the Year and Top New Male Vocalist in 1994.

2500|$|McGraw began {{singing in}} a neotraditional country style, but {{starting}} with 1997's Everywhere, he developed a more crossover-friendly, country pop sound, making {{him one of the}} first male Country singers of his generation to crossover to Pop. McGraw has released fourteen studio albums (eleven for Curb Records and three for Big Machine Records). 10 of those albums have reached number 1 on the Top Country Albums charts, with his 1994 breakthrough album <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>Moment</b> Too Soon being the top country album of 1994. All of these albums have produced 65 singles, 25 of which have reached number 1 on the Hot Country Songs or Country Airplay charts. Three of these singles — [...] "It's Your Love," [...] "Just to See You Smile," [...] and [...] "Live Like You Were Dying" [...] — were the top country songs of 1997, 1998, and 2004 according to Billboard Year-End. He has also won three Grammy Awards, 14 Academy of Country Music awards, 11 Country Music Association (CMA) awards, 10 American Music Awards, and three People's Choice Awards.

[...] Anna Smith of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots is uneven, but when it's on course, cat fans will be in heaven." [...] Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots prances along on three basic truths. One, cats are funny. Two, vain Spanish cats in high-heeled musketeer boots are even funnier. Lastly, booted, vain Spanish cats voiced by a breathy Antonio Banderas are flat-out hilarious." [...] Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, saying [...] "Puss In Boots makes a great theme-park ride, a thrill-a-minute feast for the eyes and the semicircular canals.

2500|$|French met General Charles Lanrezac, {{commanding}} the French Fifth Army on his right, at Rethel (17 August)—they {{were met by}} Lanrezac's Chief of Staff Hely d'Oissel, with the words: [...] "At last you’re here: it’s <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> too soon. [...] If we are beaten we will owe it to you". They conferred in private {{despite the fact that}} Lanrezac spoke no English and Sir John could speak little French, Wilson being eventually called over to translate. [...] French asked whether the German advance forces spotted at Huy would cross the Meuse River (a reasonable question, as a westward crossing of the Meuse exposed the BEF to encirclement from the west)—his inability to pronounce the name [...] "Huy" [...] caused Lanrezac to exclaim in exasperation that the Germans had probably [...] "come [...] [...] [...] to fish"; French understood the tone but not the meaning, and Wilson tactfully translated that the Germans would indeed cross the river. [...] French informed Lanrezac that his forces would not be ready until 24 August, three days later than promised. [...] The French cavalry under André Sordet, which Sir John had previously asked Joffre in vain to be placed under his command, were further north trying to maintain contact with the Belgians. [...] Sir John, concerned that he had only four infantry divisions rather than the planned six, wanted to keep Allenby's cavalry division in reserve and refused Lanrezac's request that he lend it for reconnaissance in front of the French forces (Lanrezac misunderstood that French intended to use the British cavalry as mounted infantry). [...] French and Lanrezac came away from the meeting with a poor relationship. [...] At the time French wrote in his diary that Lanrezac was [...] "a very capable soldier", although he claimed otherwise in his memoirs 1914. [...] Besides their mutual dislike he believed Lanrezac was about to take the offensive, whereas Lanrezac had in fact been forbidden by Joffre to fall back and wanted the BEF moved back further to clear roads for a possible French retreat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{policies}} of Weltpolitik, especially the Tirpitz Plan {{brought about a}} period of Anglo-German tension {{in the first years}} of the 20th century. Chamberlain who detested the land of his birth had no trouble taking sides in the emerging Anglo-German antagonism. Chamberlain who came to hate Britain expressed his approval of the writings of the Anglophobic and anti-Semitic German historian Heinrich von Treitschke, whose view of Britain as a grasping, greedy nation of cheap traders dishonestly vacuuming up the world's wealth was the same as his own. In another letter to Wilhelm, Chamberlain wrote: [...] "There are periods, when history is, as it were, woven on a loom.. in such a way that the warp and woof are established and are essentially unalterable; but then come times when the threads are introduced for a new fabric, when the time of material and the design must first be determined...We find ourselves in such a time today." [...] Chamberlain declared to Wilhelm that Germany now had to become the world's greatest power, both for its own good and the good of the rest of the world. In his letter, Chamberlain dismissed France as a second-rate nation that could only fall further; Russia was a nation of [...] "stupid" [...] Slavs which was only just being held together because Nicholas II had German blood, without the German blood in the House of Romanov [...] "nothing would remain but a decaying matière brute" [...] in Russia; and Britain was clearly declining into a bottomless pit of greed, ineffective democratic politics and unrestrained individualism. Chamberlain was very anti-American and called the United States a [...] "Dollar dynasty", writing: From dollars only dollars can come, nothing else; spiritually America will live only so long as the stream of European spiritual power flows there, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> longer. That part of the world, it may be proven, creates sterility, it has as little of a future as it has a past. Chamberlain concluded his letter to Wilhelm that: [...] "The future progress of mankind depends on a powerful Germany extending far across the earth". To this end, Chamberlain advocated German expansionism both in Europe and all over the world; building the High Seas Fleet which would break the British mastery of the seas; and restructuring German society along the lines advocated by the extreme right-wing, völkisch Pan-German League.|$|E
