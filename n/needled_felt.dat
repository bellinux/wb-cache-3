An experiment has been conducted at Kumbazha, in Pathanamthitta district, Kerala, India to evaluate {{the different types of}} coir geotextiles and polythene as soil mulch. The treatments include different mulching materials like natural <b>needled</b> <b>felt,</b> black <b>needled</b> <b>felt,</b> rubberized coir, black polythene and transparent polythene along with a control plot (no mulch). The experiment was laid out in Completely Randomized Design with six replications. The test crops used were bhindi (var. Salkeerthi) and pineapple (var. Mauritius). The study reveals that with bhindi crop growth parameters like plant height, leaf number and lateral spread were increased by mulching with rubberized coir and transparent polythene. These two mulches caused early flowering and increased fruit yield. Coir materials as mulch recorded a yield increase ranging from 67 to 196 %. Observations also reveal that weeds were not grown in plots mulched with black polythene, transparent polythene and rubberized coir. Rubberized coir as mulch enhanced the fruit yield in the case of pineapple, which is followed by natural <b>needled</b> <b>felt</b> and transparent polythene. Black polythene resisted weed growth up to 7 MAP, whereas rubberized coir and transparent polythene suppressed weeds up to 8 MAP. Though the weeds were grown in other treatments the weeds count was significantly lower than that of control plot. Mulching with transparent polythene enhanced the soil temperature whereas rubberized coir lowered soil temperature. More over all mulched treatments had a favourable influence in increasing soil moisture. Observing the biodegradability and eco-friendly nature of coir it could be inferred that rubberized coir can serve as good mulch for bhindi and pineapple with minimum weed problem...|$|E
40|$|Damage to cartilage, caused {{either by}} disease or injury, affects {{a large number}} of people worldwide, {{severely}} reducing the patient's quality of life and generating a huge burden on healthcare systems. The limited success of treatment options such as tissue grafts has been the driving force behind much research into tissue engineering strategies for cartilage repair. One of the challenges associated with tissue engineering cartilage is that of generating constructs of clinically relevant sizes since the formation of a crust of tissue at the scaffold periphery restricts the supply of nutrients to the growing tissue. The hypothesis of this thesis was that a tissue engineering system incorporating scaffolds containing both random and anisotropic porosity and a novel flow perfusion bioreactor system would facilitate in vitro tissue formation by enhancing the supply of nutrients to the growing construct. This hypothesis was examined using cartilage as a model tissue. It was shown that scaffolds combining both random and anisotropic porosity (sparse knit scaffolds) had improved flow properties compared to scaffolds containing random porosity alone (<b>needled</b> <b>felt</b> scaffolds). Following studies to characterise the scaffolds and to determine the appropriate conditions for seeding cells into the scaffolds, cartilage formation within the different scaffolds was assessed over a four week culture period. It was found that the flow perfusion system was not as favourable for in vitro cartilage formation as either the commercially available Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) or static culture. One of the sparse knit scaffolds (sparse knit 4) and the <b>needled</b> <b>felt</b> were further compared for cartilage formation over an eight week culture period, using static and RCCS culture. With respect to collagen and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production, cartilage constructs generated from the two scaffold systems were similar. Following static culture it was found that more viable cells were present at the centre of sparse knit 4 scaffolds than <b>needled</b> <b>felt</b> scaffolds. It was therefore concluded that scaffolds combining random and anisotropic porosity were advantageous for culturing tissues in environments where nutrient supply was reliant on diffusion alone.

These materials were developed as candidate replacements for the present <b>needled</b> <b>felt</b> SIP used between the ceramic tiles and the aluminum skin on the undersurface of the Orbiter. The SIP materials that were developed consisted of high temperature aramid fibers deposited by controlled fluid (air or liquid) carriers to form low density unbonded felts. The deposited felts were then bonded at the fiber intersections {{with a small amount}} of high temperature polyimide resin. This type of bonded felt construction can potentially eliminate two of the problems associated with the present SIP, viz., transmittal of localized stresses into the tiles and load history dependent mechanical response.

40|$|AbstractPulse-jet bag {{filters are}} {{frequently}} employed for particle removal from off gases. Separated solids form a layer on the permeable filter media called filter cake. The cake {{is responsible for}} increasing pressure drop. Therefore, the cake has to be detached at a predefined upper pressure drop limit or at predefined time intervals. Thus the process is intrinsically semi-continuous. The cake formation and cake detachment are interdependent and may influence {{the performance of the}} filter. Therefore, understanding formation and detachment of filter cake is important. In this regard, the filter media is the key component in the system. <b>Needle</b> <b>felts</b> are the most commonly used media in bag filters. Cake formation studies with heat treated and membrane coated <b>needle</b> <b>felts</b> in pilot scale pulse jet bag filter were carried out. The data is processed according to the procedures that were published already [Powder Technology, Volume 173, Issue 2, 19 April 2007, Pages 93 – 106]. Pressure drop evolution, cake height distribution evolution, cake patches area distribution and their characterization using fractal analysis on different <b>needle</b> <b>felts</b> are presented here. It is observed that concavity of pressure drop curve for membrane coated <b>needle</b> <b>felt</b> is principally caused by presence of inhomogeneous cake area load whereas it is inherent for heat treated media. Presence of residual cake enhances the concavity of pressure drop at the start of filtration cycle. Patchy cleaning is observed only when jet pulse pressure is too low and unable to provide the necessary force to detach the cake. The border line is very sharp. Based on experiments with limestone dust and three types of <b>needle</b> <b>felts,</b> for the jet pulse pressure above 4 bar and filtration velocity below 50 mm/s, cake is detached completely except a thin residual layer (100 – 200 μm). Uniformity and smoothness of residual cake depends on the surface characteristics of the filter media. Cake height distribution of residual cake and newly formed cake during filtration prevails. The patch size analysis and fractal analysis reveal that residual cake grow in size (latterly) following regeneration initially on the base with edges smearing out, however, the cake heights are not leveled off. Fractal dimension of cake patches boundary falls in the range of 1 – 1. 4 and depends on vertical position as well as time of filtration. Cake height measurements with Polyimide (PI) <b>needle</b> <b>felts</b> were hampered on account of its photosensitive nature...|$|R

In this work, experimental data is provided from a pilot scale pulse-jet regenerated bag filter test facility for three types of <b>needle</b> <b>felts</b> using air and limestone dust at ambient conditions. Results reveal that specific resistance of filter media is independent of velocity while the specific resistance of filter cake increases linearly with filtration velocity.

The cake resistance at constant velocity fits to a second degree polynomial whereas it increases linearly with the velocity. A linear relation is reported here for all the cases.
