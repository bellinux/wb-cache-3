25|$|Both {{same-sex}} marriages and civil unions of other <b>nations</b> <b>will</b> be automatically considered civil partnerships under UK law providing they came within Section 20 of the Act.

For example, a Vermont civil union would have legal standing in the UK, however in cases where one partner was American and the other British, the Vermont civil union would not provide the Briton with right of abode in Vermont (or any other US state or territory), whereas it would provide the American with right of abode in the UK.|$|E

25|$|International cricket in the 2006–07 cricket {{season is}} defi+ned by major statisticians, such as CricketArchive and Wisden, as those matches played on tours that started between September 2006 and April 2007. Two major ICC tournaments are {{scheduled}} for this season, with the Champions Trophy played in October in India, and the World Cup taking place in West Indies in March. In addition, England will defend the Ashes {{when they go to}} Australia in November, and all the ten Test <b>nations</b> <b>will</b> be in action during November and December – though Zimbabwe, who are playing Bangladesh during this time, withdrew from Test matches throughout 2006 and will thus only be playing One-day International matches.|$|E
25|$|The BBC {{covered the}} tournament {{since the start}} {{covering}} all matches apart from England home matches which were live on Sky Sports with highlights on BBC between 1997 and 2002. Between 2003 and 2015, the BBC covered every match live on BBC Sport either on BBC One or BBC Two with highlights also on the BBC Sport website and either on the BBC Red Button or late at night on BBC Two. In 2011, {{it was announced that}} the BBC's coverage of the tournament on TV, radio and online, would be extended to 2017. However, on 9 July 2015, in reaction to satellite pay-TV bids from Sky Sports and BT Sport for coverage from 2017, BBC agreed to lose exclusive rights to the tournament two years early. But from 2016, BBC and ITV would jointly broadcast the tournament in the UK, with BBC showing all France, Scotland and Wales home matches live, and ITV showing all England, Ireland and Italy home matches live. This means that the Six <b>Nations</b> <b>will</b> remain on free-to-air television in the UK until 2021.|$|E
500|$|Turkey {{has signed}} an {{agreement}} with Somalia, to open its first military base in Africa in which Turkish military officers will train Somali soldiers and troops from other African countries to fight against Al-Shabaab terrorist organization.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Soviet Union shot down KAL007, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, {{operating}} the commercial airports around New York City, denied Soviet aircraft landing rights, {{in violation of}} the United Nations Charter that required the host nation to allow all member countries access to the UN. In reaction, TASS and some at the UN raised {{the question of whether the}} UN should move its headquarters from the United States. Charles Lichenstein, acting U.S. permanent representative to the UN under Ambassador Kirkpatrick, responded, [...] "We will put no impediment in your way. The members of the U.S. mission to the United <b>Nations</b> <b>will</b> be down at the dockside waving you a fond farewell as you sail off into the sunset." [...] Administration officials were quick to announce that Lichenstein was speaking only for himself.|$|E
500|$|On 16 October 1945, {{before the}} UN Charter had even entered into force, retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts and former New Hampshire Governor Robert P. Bass held {{a conference in}} Dublin, New Hampshire, which passed the Dublin Declaration. It stated that the UN Charter was {{inadequate}} to preserve peace and proposed {{the transformation of the}} U.N. General Assembly into a world legislature, opining, [...] "Such a government should be based upon a constitution under which all peoples and <b>nations</b> <b>will</b> participate upon a basis of balanced representation which will take account of natural and industrial resources and other factors as well as population. It cannot be based on treaties...in which the states...act and vote as states". It called for [...] "limited but definite and adequate power for the prevention of war." [...] Grenville Clark and other participants in the Dublin conference went on to become active in the United World Federalists (UWF) and the global World Federalist Movement. UWF enjoyed some success in the postwar period, as 23 state legislatures passed bills supporting the organization’s goals, but McCarthyism prompted many prominent members to resign lest Senator Joseph McCarthy ruin their careers. In the United States, internationalism came to be associated with communism.|$|E
500|$|After World War II, the French Committee of National Liberation {{was late}} to be {{recognized}} by the US as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. The future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN, famously calling it a machin ("contraption"), and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between countries. Throughout the Cold War, both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1953, the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General, through its refusal to deal with him, while in the 1950s and 1960s, a popular US bumper sticker read, [...] "You can't spell communism without U.N." [...] In a sometimes-misquoted statement, President George W. Bush stated in February 2003 (referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime) that [...] "free <b>nations</b> <b>will</b> not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society." [...] In contrast, the French President, François Hollande, stated in 2012 that [...] "France trusts the United Nations. She knows that no state, no matter how powerful, can solve urgent problems, fight for development and {{bring an end to}} all crises... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance." [...] Critics such as Dore Gold, an Israeli diplomat, Robert S. Wistrich, a British scholar, Alan Dershowitz, an American legal scholar, Mark Dreyfus, an Australian politician, and the Anti-Defamation League consider UN attention to Israel's treatment of Palestinians to be excessive. In September 2015, Saudi Arabia's [...] Faisal bin Hassan Trad has been elected Chair of the UN Human Rights Council panel that appoints independent experts, a move criticized by human rights groups.|$|E
