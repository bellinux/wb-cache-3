25|$|Rosemary Basson {{proposed}} an alternative model of sexual response. She {{argues that the}} linear model is good at explaining men's sexual response but it poorly explains women's sexual responses; thus, she puts forth a circular model. She states that closeness or attachment to a partner increases the effectiveness of sexual stimulation. This leads to enhanced sexual arousal, which may ultimately result in orgasm. Consequently, this positive sexual arousal continues the sexual desire that women feel, and this desire increases intimacy with the partner. Other researchers have attempted to evaluate women's sexual functioning {{in terms of this}} new model but have found contradictory results. In one study conducted by Giles and McCabe, they found that the linear model of sexual response was a good predictor of women's sexual functioning (and dysfunction), while the circular model was a poor predictor. Once they modified the pathways of the model, the circular model then became a good predictor of sexual functioning. In another study looking at Malaysian women, researchers found that the circular model was actually a good predictor of women's sexual desire and arousal. More research <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> this area to show whether the circular model more accurately describes women's sexual response.|$|E

2500|$|The Office of Management and Budget {{reported}} that $54 billion in [...] "improper payments" [...] {{were made to}} Medicare ($24B), Medicaid ($18B) and Medicaid Advantage ($12B) during FY 2009. This was 9.4% of the $573 billion spent in these categories. The Government Accountability Office lists Medicare as a [...] "high-risk" [...] government program due to its vulnerability to improper payments. [...] Fewer than 5% of Medicare claims are audited. [...] Medicare fraud accounts for an estimated $60 billion in Medicare payments each year, and [...] "has become one of, if not the most profitable, crimes in America." [...] Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. These costs appear on the Medicare statements provided to Medicare card holders. The program pays out over $430 billion per year via over 1 billion claims, making enforcement challenging. Its enforcement budget is [...] "extremely limited" [...] according to one Medicare official. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview: [...] "Clearly more auditing {{needs to be done}} and it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> real time." [...] The Obama administration is providing Medicare with an additional $200 million to fight fraud as part of its stimulus package, and billions of dollars to computerize medical records and upgrade networks, which should assist Medicare in identifying fraudulent claims.|$|E
2500|$|Thematically, [...] "an-Nisā" [...] {{not only}} {{addresses}} concerns about women, but also discusses inheritance, marriage laws, {{how to deal}} with children and orphans, legal practices, jihād, relations between Muslim communities and People of the Book, war, and the role of Jesus as a prophet, rather than the son of God as Christians claimed. Furthermore, in discussing war, this sura encourages the Muslim community to fight for the vulnerable in war, as demonstrated by 4:75: [...] "Why should you not fight in God's cause and for those oppressed men, women, and children who cry out, ‘Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors! By Your grace, give us a protector and give us a helper!’?" [...] The sura addresses a multitude of issues faced by the early Muslim community and provides responses to the challenges the community faced. The wide variety of issues addressed in the sura and the length of the sura make it difficult to divide into literary structures. However, based on a study of themes present in each section of the sura, Amīn Ahsan Islāhī divides the sura into three thematically-based sections: social reform, the Islamic community and its opponents, and a conclusion. Mathias Zahniser presents an alternative means of looking at the structure of this sura. He claims that the central theme of this sura is the address to the Christians. He has come to this conclusion based on examination {{of the structure of the}} sura based on such devices as parallels, repetition, and ring composition. However, Carl Ernst admits that more works <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> this type of structural analysis in order to more fully understand the composition of such extensive suras.|$|E
