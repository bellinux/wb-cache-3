5|$|A {{division}} of the DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), regulates safety for the U.S. trucking industry. The FMCSA enforces the length, width, and weight limits of CMVs set by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for interstate commercial traffic. Interstate commercial traffic is generally limited to a network of Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and state highways known as the National Network (NN). Provided the truck remains on the NN, it is <b>not</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> state limits. These limits (which can be lower or higher than federal limits) come into effect for intrastate commercial traffic, provided the vehicle {{is not on the}} NN.|$|E
5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils <b>not</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> waterlogging.|$|E

5|$|After the 1990–91 Gulf War, UNSCOM {{determined}} that Iraq had been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium. Iraq chose {{to develop the}} electromagnetic process over more modern, economic, and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build, with fewer technical challenges, and the components required to build them were <b>not</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> export controls. At the time the program was discovered, Iraq {{was estimated to be}} two or three years away from producing enough material for nuclear weapons. The program was destroyed in the Gulf War. Consequently, the Nuclear Suppliers Group added the electromagnetic separation equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material and technology.|$|E

5|$|Because DUI in New Jersey is a non-criminal traffic violation, state DUI {{laws are}} <b>not</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> the Assimilative Crimes Act. Members of the Armed Forces can be court martialed for drunk driving, {{military}} bases can enforce New Jersey traffic law on civilians, {{and it is}} a misdemeanor under federal law to drive while intoxicated on land administered by the National Park Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Postal Service. Similar to New Jersey, federal DUI statutes prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while having a BAC of 0.08% or greater, and require a driver to give a breath sample if requested by a law enforcement authority.|$|E

5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are <b>not</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.|$|E

He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E
