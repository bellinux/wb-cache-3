25|$|Agar plates may be {{formulated}} {{as either}} permissive, {{with the intent}} of allowing the growth of whatever organisms are present, or restrictive or selective, {{with the intent of}} only allowing growth a particular subset of those organisms. This may {{take the form of a}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirement,</b> for instance providing a particular compound such as lactose as the only source of carbon and thereby selecting only organisms which can metabolize that compound, or by including a particular antibiotic or other substance to select only organisms which are resistant to that substance. This correlates to some degree with defined and undefined media; undefined media, made from natural products and containing an unknown combination of very many organic molecules, is typically more permissive in terms of supplying the needs of a wider variety of organisms, while defined media can be precisely tailored to select organisms with specific properties.|$|E
2500|$|Monogamy, or {{at least}} social monogamy, does exist in many {{societies}} around the world, {{and it is important}} to understand how these marriage systems might have evolved. [...] In any species, there are three main aspects that combine to promote a monogamous mating system: paternal care, resource access, and mate-choice; however, in humans, the main theoretical sources of monogamy are paternal care and extreme ecological stresses. [...] Paternal care should be particularly important in humans due to the extra <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirement</b> of having larger brains and the lengthier developmental period. [...] Therefore, the evolution of monogamy could be a reflection of this increased need for bi-parental care. [...] Similarly, monogamy should evolve in areas of ecological stress because male reproductive success should be higher if their resources are focused on ensuring offspring survival rather than searching for other mates. [...] However, the evidence does not support these claims. [...] Due to the extreme sociality and increased intelligence of humans, H. sapiens have solved many problems that generally lead to monogamy, such as those mentioned above. [...] For example, monogamy is certainly correlated with paternal care, as shown by Marlowe, but not caused by it because humans diminish the need for bi-parental care through the aid of siblings and other family members in rearing the offspring. [...] Furthermore, human intelligence and material culture allows for better adaptation to different and rougher ecological areas, thus reducing the causation and even correlation of monogamous marriage and extreme climates. However, some scientists argue that monogamy evolved by reducing within-group conflict, thus giving certain groups a competitive advantage against less monogamous groups.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{microbial}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> {{is a key}} {{challenge in}} microbiology. Here we leverage the recent availability of thousands of automatically generated genome-scale metabolic models to develop a predictor of microbial minimal medium requirements, which we apply to thousands of species to study the relationship between their <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> and their ecological and genomic traits. We first show that <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> are more similar among species that co-habit many ecological niches. We then reveal three fundamental characteristics of microbial fastidiousness (i. e., complex and specific <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements)</b> : (1) more fastidious microorganisms {{tend to be more}} ecologically limited; (2) fastidiousness is positively associated with smaller genomes and smaller metabolic networks; and (3) more fastidious species grow more slowly and have less ability to cooperate with other species than more metabolically versatile organisms. These associations reflect the adaptation of fastidious microorganisms to unique niches with few cohabitating species. They also explain how non-fastidious species inhabit many ecological niches with high abundance rates. Taken together, these results advance our understanding microbial nutrition on a large scale, by presenting new nutrition-related associations that govern the distribution of microorganisms in nature...|$|R
50|$|A fastidious {{organism}} is any organism {{that has}} a complex <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirement.</b> In other words, a fastidious organism will only grow when specific nutrients are included in its diet. The more restrictive term fastidious microorganism is often used {{in the field of}} microbiology to describe microorganisms that will grow only if special nutrients are present in their culture medium. An example of a fastidious bacterium is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which requires blood or hemoglobin and several amino acids and vitamins in order to grow. Other examples include Campylobacter spp. and Helicobacter spp, which are capnophilic - require elevated CO2 - among other requirements.|$|E
