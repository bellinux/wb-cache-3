40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} exists {{for lack of}} numerical skills among many health professionals. Although poor numeracy has long been recognised as a contributor to medication error, other activities for which <b>numerical</b> <b>literacy</b> are required, such as interpretation of diagnostic results, have been largely ignored. Poor self-awareness of lack of <b>numerical</b> <b>literacy</b> increases the risk, especially in the busy and hurried emergency environment. System changes, such as standardising units and improving number presentation, reduce the potential for misinterpretation; however system changes do not address the underlying deficiencies in mathematical skills. The training of doctors in numeracy has been largely ignored. In contrast, education for nurses frequently occurs during both pre- and post-registration programmes. Interventions have had mixed success, although additional emphasis in increasing conceptual understanding of numbers is encouraging. The consequences of poor <b>numerical</b> <b>literacy</b> should be addressed in all clinical staff, not only by practice change to remove the potential for errors to be made, but also complemented by self-awareness and education...|$|E
40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} has examined the effect of contextual knowledge on deductive reasoning. Relatively little work, however, has examined context effects on statistical reasoning. In this paper, we document that in a context such as drawing marbles from an urn, children correctly think of sampling {{as a way to}} measure the distribution of marbles. However, in other contexts, such as taking a survey of people’s opinions, children design samples that have the effect of causing a distribution. For example, they sample members of the population most likely to have positive opinions. We interpret these results by proposing that knowledge of statistics comes in discrete pieces of intuitive understanding whose elicitation is contingent upon the problem context. We describe a model of instruction that acknowledges the effects of context on statistical reasoning. The ability to reason about statistical data has become an important component of <b>numerical</b> <b>literacy.</b> Statistical information, once primarily in the purview of analysts, appears regularly in the mass media in the form of polls and surveys. Reflecting the increased importance of statistical reasoning, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (1989) proposed that a corridor of statistical instruction begin as earl...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{deliberation}} on students who advance {{from high school to}} a higher education institution, without demonstrating the attributes required on admission. They are granted formal access, despite being underprepared for tertiary studies. One of the qualities that they noticible lack is academic literacy. In the course of this investigation, academics had to relate what their perceptions were of the academic literacy of their students at higher education level. Initially, being literate meant the ability to read and write, but the term literacy has assumed a more varied form. The term multi-literacies is employed now, as there are several forms of literacy. These include, Information Technology, Technology, pictorial and <b>numerical</b> <b>literacies,</b> to name a few. Academic literacy constitutes more than one literacy, namely, operational or functional literacy, cultural literacy and critical literacy. These literacies are elaborated on and the role of language proficiency, together with the inter-relatedness between students' linguistic competence and their cognitive ability are discussed in depth. Alternatives are examined to assess how this problem of the lack of academic literacy can be circumvented and what mechanisms can be put in place in order that students can be assisted in their pursuit of academic literac...|$|R

This study aimed to assess the {{health literacy}} skills of parents and caregivers of preschool-aged children, using a progressive scenario describing a child with fever and presenting tasks relating to selection of a medicine and hypothetical dosing of their child. Participants (n = 417) from 33 childcare- and health-related sites in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Auckland completed the study. Participants' responses were largely appropriate regarding actions in response to worsening symptoms, selection of an appropriate product (from a limited range), whereby 84. 5 % of responses were for a single-ingredient paracetamol product and use of the package directions to state the frequency of dosing (93. 1 % of frequencies appropriate for paracetamol and 66. 7 % for ibuprofen). However, in only 50. 8 % of cases was an appropriate weight-based dose calculated, and doses were not measured to within 10 % of the stated dose in 16. 7 % of cases.

40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{reading and}} {{understanding}} the data is one of basic indicators to becoming an active and thoughtful citizen. These skills, also defined as <b>numerical</b> <b>literacy,</b> contribute meaningful and permanent learning via making connections between courses and subjects. In this view, Graphs {{are one of the}} forefront learning domains. Graphs are also frequently used in the education because of their ability to visualize numerical data. Whilst Graphs are considered a subject of mathematics, they are actually interdisciplinary subject and used in science, life and social studies and Turkish. The attitude of class teachers towards graphics is important as they are responsible to teach these courses in the first four grades. In the literature, although there are some studies on the knowledge levels of pre-service class teachers, there is a gap, especially in national literature, on the attitudes of them towards graphs. Being a part of study on developing an attitude instrument, this study aims at determining of the feelings of pre-service class teachers about graphs. For these purposes, 160 pre-service class teachers in fourth grade enrolled in a national university were asked an open ended question of “What do you feel when you face with a graph?” Data were collected in the second semester of instructional year of 2012 - 2013.

25|$|Although most {{electrical}} engineers will understand basic circuit theory (that is {{the interactions of}} elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use off-the-shelf components.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{challenges}} to successful digital government operations, but serving large, diverse populations {{of people is}} one of the foremost. This is doubly difficult for information that is highly codified such as statistical data. Such data are important for citizen decision making, but low levels of <b>numerical</b> <b>literacy</b> limit widespread application and government statistical services aim to make such information more broadly accessible and understandable. The Govstat Project has been working with federal statistical agencies to make government statistical data findable and understandable (www. ils. unc. edu/govstat). Our approach is twofold: define a Statistical Knowledge Network (SKN) that can evolve over time as citizens and government agencies at all levels share and integrate statistical information; and create user interface prototypes that make finding and understanding easy for diverse populations. The overall project has several threads of work but this paper focuses on two specific user interface threads: interactive glossaries as examples of our general efforts to provide multiple layers of online help, and a family of highly interactive user interfaces for exploring data. We start with a basic belief that a statistic, in isolation, is useless. If people are to find and understand statistical information, we need to surround statistical data with supportive information and means of manipulation that will reveal “the story behind the number, ” or as one of our agency partner colleagues (John Bosley, Bureau of Labor Statistics) puts it, “no naked data. ” Statistical experts depend on a variety o...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of play-way method on the numeracy skills of early basic education pupils in Ekiti State, Nigeria. Play-way method {{has been described as}} the best method for enhancing pupils learning by many researchers. It was observed by the author that many teachers of early childhood education still use demonstration method to teach the pupils. An interview conducted by the researcher reveals that some teachers find demonstration convenient because they could not provide enough materials that will go round the pupils. The population of the study was all the early basic education schools in Ekiti State where pupils are given pre-primary education specifically, children between ages 4 - 5 years. The sample is made up of 120 children split into two groups of 60. The design of the study was a quasi experimental. The children were interacted with for 6 weeks with the goals of exposing them to <b>numerical</b> <b>literacy.</b> Two groups were involved each exposed to different interactions, namely: guided play and demonstrations. The achievement test which is the instrument was validated and it has a correlation coefficient of 0. 76. The hypotheses tested the difference in the scores of the pupils in each group and also gender influence. The result showed that there was significant difference in the performance of students in favour of those in guided play group. Also gender has no influence on the pupils ’ achievement in each group. As a result of the findings, it was recommended that early child educators should use guided play with lots of activities to enhance pupils ’ achievement in numerical skills...|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{literacy}} {{is a new}} subject area which developed {{largely because of the}} concerns with respect to the low <b>numerical</b> <b>literacy</b> levels of adults. In 2006, Mathematical Literacy was introduced as an optional school subject in South Africa in the Further Education and Training band (Grades 10 - 12). This study focuses on Mathematical Literacy in-service training teacher development set in a large urban institution. The main aim {{of the study was to}} reflect on the development of meaning and understanding with respect to Mathematical Literacy curriculum interpretation and the Mathematical Literacy teaching practices of two teachers within an Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) Mathematical Literacy course. The data collected over time included ACE Mathematical Literacy course tasks and videotaped observations of the teaching of Mathematical Literacy of the selected teachers related to the use of a task based on data on gender-related smoking proportions across a range of countries. The study examined the relationship between context and mathematical content when Mathematical Literacy was discussed and when classroom practice was planned and presented. A spectrum of Mathematical Literacy teaching agendas, types and cognitive levels of questions used in classroom assessment tasks and ethical and moral class discussions were analysed. The study revealed that the two teachers interpreted the Mathematical Literacy curriculum in different ways and their teaching practice resulted in a range of teaching practices with emphasis on either reallife contexts or mathematics. The study showed limited, but visible shifts in understanding with respect to meaning and practice. The key findings included the development of a range of questions for Mathematical Literacy assessment tasks, reference to the cognitive level of questions, including low-level reflective questions, the emergence of a moral value-based dimension in Mathematical Literacy teaching practice and an adaptation to the spectrum of Mathematical Literacy teaching agendas as developed by Graven and Venkat (2007) ...|$|E
40|$|Developing world fishers {{are often}} assumed unable to {{comprehend}} fisheries management information {{because of their}} poor <b>numerical</b> and graphical <b>literacy.</b> This study questions this assumption by assessing {{the extent to which}} small-scale tuna fishers in Indonesia engaged in enumeration programs are able to understand, interpret and find value in the data collected from them when presented in graphical and numerically-aggregated forms. The analysis was based on structured interviews held with twenty tuna hand-line fishers on Buru Island, Maluku, Indonesia. We found that scientific displays such as graphs, tables and maps are understandable even for semi-literate fishers. Different forms of displays have more or less relevance and value for them in reflexive way. The sequence in which scientific displays are presented also matters, indicating that displays should be presented and explained in gradations from simple to more complex forms. Overall, however, the results show that face-to-face explanation remains necessary when communicating graphical and numerical information to fishers. Further attention should be given to forms of communication with fishers that allow for more reflexive decision-making and a shift to user-centric information systems. The ongoing development of mobile technologies aimed at incentivizing fishers to engage with and contribute to data and information collection, would benefit from selecting suitable information displays, presenting these in a guided sequence, and monitoring how fishers use this information to make decisions on the water...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Handloom {{industry}} {{is an organization}} which has some essential characteristics such as technology rules, regulation, hierarchical organization of different actors (namely merchant guilds or traders or mahajan and weavers or tanti), power relation between them, and conflict. These components are greatly significant to understand of an industry as a whole. To understand the handloom industry, the present paper has tried to study the hierarchy, power-relation and domination in the handloom weaving industry {{through the lens of}} Bourdieu‟s notion of field, capital and habitus. For this purpose, Murshidabad of West Bengal was selected as a field site. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, participant observation, unstructured interview and case study. For qualitative data like weaving technique, organizational system, social connections, conflict regarding prestige and power 150 participants (100 weavers and 50 mahajans or merchant) were selected according to the available informed consents. Some <b>numerical</b> data like <b>literacy</b> rate, monthly income, types of loom, categories of the weavers, and possession of the loom have covered so far total 142 households on the same basis of informed consent. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed through the percentage scoring and interpretative analysis respectively. It is found that mahajans possess and compete for all four forms of capital (economic, cultural, social and symbolic) in handloom weaving. The weavers possess strong cultural capital than other resources. Different degree of accumulation of capital formed the hierarchy, power-relation an...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays that study consumption choices and their policy implications. The first chapter tests the life-cycle permanent income hypothesis via an experimental approach. University {{students are asked to}} provide their consumption choices in hypothetical circumstances. Background information such as their <b>numerical</b> and financial <b>literacy</b> are collected in the experiment. The data suggest that the subjects' consumption choices do not necessarily support the life-cycle permanent income hypothesis. The consumption levels chosen by some subjects vary greatly when they face the same total remaining lifetime resources, but different composition of these resources between net and human wealth. This consumption error varies across gender and is affected by the subjects' numerical and financial ability. The results have important implications for policymakers. In the second chapter a censored quadratic model is used to examine whether soda taxes affect consumption. Households that do and do not consume soda are taken into account. The results show that in states that have a higher soda than food tax or that have just increased the soda tax rates, households consume significantly less soda. Households that have more children and are located in areas with a small population assign significantly larger weight to soda in their total utility. The price elasticity of soda consumption is high. The unconditional price elasticity is larger than the conditional price elasticity, which is measured using households that do purchase soda. Also, the price elasticity for low-income households is greater than for high-income households. The results presented may be important to policymakers setting soda taxes to prevent obesity. Following the second chapter, a modified three-good censored utility model is used to examine if beer and wine taxes affect alcohol consumption. This study provides empirical estimates of price elasticities on beer and wine, which suggests that beer taxes may not be a good avenue for policymakers to consider in counteracting the serious consequence of alcohol abuse. However, wine taxes may be effective in reducing alcohol abuse, especially for low-income households...|$|R
