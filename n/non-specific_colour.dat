40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of the Farnsworth D- 15 hue test in detecting early etham-butol toxicity compared to the Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, Caritas Medical Centre in Hong Kong from January 2012 to April 2013. Medical records for consecutive patients with tuberculosis referred for suspect-ed ethambutol-induced toxic optic neuropathy were reviewed. All consenting subjects underwent both the Ishihara pseudo-isochromatic plates and the Farnsworth D- 15 hue test. Those with pre-existing optic neuropathies, poor visual acuity, signifi-cant cataract, known congenital colour vision defects, retinopathies, and those on other systemic medications with potential ocular toxicity side effects were excluded. The qualitative results for the 2 screenings tests were compared. Results: During the study period, 65 eligible subjects, with tuberculosis, prescribed with ethambutol, were recruited. On Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates testing, all (100 %) of the subjects had normal results. On Farnsworth D- 15 hue test-ing, 23. 1 % (15 / 65) had abnormal results: 12. 3 % (8 / 65) had a tritan (blue-yellow) defect and 10. 8 % (7 / 65) had <b>non-specific</b> <b>colour</b> defects not conferring to a single colour deficiency. Conclusion: The Farnsworth D- 15 hue test appears to be more sensitive than the Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates in detecting colour defects as an initial subjective screening tool for suspected ethambutol-related optic neuropathy...|$|E
40|$|The xylera ureide method, {{based on}} {{analysis}} of xylem sap for N solutes associated with N fixation (ureides) and soil-N use (NO, α amino-N), {{is used for}} estimating Pfix (proportion of plant N derived from N fixation) of herbaceous species of the leguminous tribes Phaseoleae and Desmodieae and may have application for tree legumes. We report experiments, involving Calliandra calothyrsus, Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania grandiflora, Desmodium rensonii and Codariocalyx gyroides, to: (i) determine for each species the composition of N solutes of xylem sap and to calibrate, where possible, the xylem ureide method using N isotope dilution as an independent measure of Pfix; and (ii) establish appropriate procedures for sampling xylem sap in field studies. In the first experiment, the tree legumes were grown for 55 - 77 weeks and sampled repeatedly (6 - 9 times) for vacuum-extracted xylem sap, shoot dry matter, total N and N. Asparagine was the predominant amino compound in xylem sap of all species. The relative abundance of ureide-N in xylem sap (ureide-N {{as a proportion of}} ureide-N + α amino-N + NO -N) was compared with Pfix for five of the six tree legumes. Sap of S. grandiflora could not be analysed for ureides and NO using the standard colorimetric methods because of high levels of <b>non-specific,</b> background <b>colour.</b> For D. rensonii and C. gyroides, relative ureide-N ranged from less than 20 % (Pfix of zero) to around 65 and 40 %, respectively (Pfix of 100 %). Functions describing the relationships between relative ureide-N (y) and Pfix (x) were: y = 18. 3 + 0. 446 x (r = 0. 91) for D. rensonii; and y = 8. 49 + 0. 279 x (r = 0. 92) for C. gyroides. With the other three species, relative ureide-N was not related to Pfix. We concluded that the xylem ureide technique is suitable for estimating Pfix for D. rensonii and C. gyroides only. In the second experiment, established trees of G. sepium, D. rensonii, C. calothyrsus and C. gyroides were used to assess sampling protcols. Results indicated that vacuum extraction of sap should proceed immediately the branch is cut, that plants need to be sampled around noon to eliminate diurnal effects and that branch-to-branch variation in relative ureide-N values within a single tree was minor.
