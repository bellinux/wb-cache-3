I therefore claimed {{to be included in the}} same category as the civilian railway officials and men of the breakdown gang, whose declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of precisely the same character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a right to be considered a non-combatant too.|$|E
25|$|The Taming of the Shrew in {{performance}} {{has had an}} uneven history. Popular in Shakespeare's day, the play fell out of favour during the seventeenth century, when it was replaced on the stage by John Lacy's Sauny the Scott. The original Shakespearean text was {{not performed at all}} during the eighteenth century, with David Garrick's adaptation Catharine and Petruchio dominating the stage. After over two hundred years without a performance, the play returned to the British stage in 1844, the last Shakespeare play restored to the repertory. However, {{it was only in the}} 1890s that the dominance of Catharine and Petruchio began to wain, and productions of The Shrew become more regular. Moving into the twentieth century, the play's popularity increased considerably, and it became one of Shakespeare's most frequently staged plays, with productions taking place all over the world. This trend has continued into the twenty-first century, with the play as popular <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was when first written.|$|E

25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right <b>now.</b> <b>As</b> <b>it</b> was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense.

500|$|Day of the Tentacle: Remastered has {{received}} positive reviews, with the PC version having an aggregate review score of 87/100 tallied by Metacritic. Reviewers generally praised the title as having not lost its charm since its initial release, but found {{some aspects of}} the remastering to be lackluster. Richard Corbett for Eurogamer found the game [...] "every bit as well crafted <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was in 1993", but found the processes used to provide high-definition graphics from the original 16-bit graphics to making some of the required shortcuts taken in 1993 for graphics, such as background dithering and low animation framerates, more obvious on modern hardware. IGNs Jared Petty also found the remastered to still be enjoyable, and found the improvement on the graphics to be [...] "glorious", but worried that the lack of a hint system, as was added in The Secret of Monkey Island remastered version, would put off new players to the game. Bob Mackey for USgamer found that while past remastered adventure games have highlighted how much has changed in gamers' expectations since the heyday of adventure games in the 1990s, Day of the Tentacle Remastered [...] "rises above these issues to become absolutely timeless".|$|E

In 2008, due to her character's HIV scare, Metcalfe feared she was to going to be fired from the serial and had to seek reassurance from the producer that her fears were unfounded. In 2011 Metcalfe stated her plans {{to stay with the}} serial indefinitely, saying, [...] "I never get bored or lose interest" [...] with her storylines and scripts. In 2012, Kirkwood said that due to Metcalfe being the first actress he cast in Hollyoaks he was [...] "so chuffed that she's becoming a real star". He added that [...] "telling stories for Mercedes is as exciting <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was on day one".

In May 2013, Metcalfe signed a new contract keeping her on the soap for at least another year.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of Emma in the show's second season. He said: [...] "Emma is apparently married, but we haven’t seen her husband since October, and {{even when he was}} more of a “fixture” on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who’s appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma made no sense as anything other than a plot device. <b>Now,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this {{has something to do with}} the fact that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t make much sense and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No.404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan [...] "never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966." [...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song every once in a while. It still stands up <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> did then, maybe even more in some kind of weird way." ...|$|E

[...] When {{asked for his}} own stance on sampling during an interview with O2 Academy, Lake gave a positive response. He stated, [...] "What I was pleased with was, is the relevance of '21st Century Schizoid Man' today.' You know, it still sounds current. It still sounds relevant. That’s really gratifying after all of these years. I mean, that record is what — 40, 50 years old? I don’t know, but very old. Old like me! But it’s lovely to hear a really contemporary artist doing it." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lake further commented, [...] "In a way, that song still sounds modern to me.

[...] Due in part to West's usage, [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] has since became a favorite of Lake, who became known for opening each of his one-man shows by performing the song during his 2012 Songs of a Lifetime theatre tour.

500|$|The show's only main {{character}} {{to have been}} spared harsh criticism, Clair has garnered very positive reviews from critics, by whom she continues to be venerated frequently. Critics and journalists often celebrate the character's [...] "outspoken, womanist views". Blake Green of The Baltimore Sun described the character as [...] "the perfect wife and mother of five who also practiced law and dressed to the nines." [...] Jezebel's Hillary Crosley Coker hailed Clair as a [...] "career-driven matriarch that kicked ass {{at home and at}} work." [...] Writing for Complex, Nikeita Hoyte described Clair as [...] "A hard-ass mom who radiates the beauty of a goddess", while the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "Clair was one big beacon of gorgeous in the Huxtable household." [...] Daisy Dumas of the Daily Mail dubbed Clair an [...] "Indomitable matriarch". AfterEllen.com's Jill Guccini called Clair [...] "divine". Including her on her list of [...] "Diverse TV Ladies That Can Help Young Girls Learn How to Kick Ass", she hailed her relationship with Cliff as [...] "something that young girls—gay or straight—really need to see", while praising her occasional use of Spanish. In a retrospective review of The Cosby Show in 2014, Daily Life writer Ruby Hamad highlighted Clair as the [...] "one thing about the show that is as good <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was then". In terms of the character's best episodes, Joe Reid of The Atlantic cited Clair's unimpressed reaction to her husband allegedly confusing a cherished memory of her with that of an old love interest in the sixth season episode [...] "Isn't It Romantic?" [...] as a personal favorite, specifically lauding Rashad's pronunciation of [...] "tacky barrette" [...] and [...] "her hairpin turn when Cliff's real gift is revealed that shows that next dimension that always pushed Clair {{to the top of the}} heap." [...] Meanwhile, Kevin O'Keefe, writing for the same publication, selected Clair's enraged monologue to Vanessa in season six's [...] "Off to See the Wretched", followed by the character's dismay upon learning that Sondra has decided not to return to law school, as his favorites, enjoying the way in which Clair adopts an [...] "attack mode" [...] in both circumstances. Reviewing the character's conversation about pregnancy and marriage with Denise in season three's [...] "The Shower", Slates Aisha Harris wrote [...] "written realistically and delivered beautifully by Rashad, the moment attains a level of artistry that spot-on TV lessons rarely reach." [...] When the show aired, both middle and upper-class working women responded well to Clair. However, some few reviewers have occasionally accused the character of being too perfect and one-dimensional, while others found her to be too aggressive, outspoken, lacking in maternity and overly controlling towards both her children and husband. Additionally, some feminist critics did not appreciate the fact that Clair rarely struggles with everyday situations that working mothers typically encounter in real life.|$|E
