40|$|Abstract The rise {{in demand}} for {{specialized}} medical services in the U.

Consequently, managing patients in <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> clinics is a very challenging problem with very little research attention. In this paper, we derive algorithms for scheduling <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> patients and resources. We validate our algorithms using simulation of an actual <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> setting and historical data. We consider performance measures of both the patientâ€™s and the <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> managerâ€™s interests. The results we obtain provide useful insights into managing patients and resources in <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> clinics and can be applicable to many other similar health care settings...|$|R
