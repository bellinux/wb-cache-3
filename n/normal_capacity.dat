5|$|The {{weather in}} Glasgow was stormy, with torrential rain nearly {{flooding}} Hampden Park. As a result, the stadium didn't reach its <b>normal</b> <b>capacity</b> of 100,000, only 41,657 spectators attended the match. The first half was mostly uneventful, both teams negated {{the threat of}} the other. Despite this both sides had opportunities to take the lead. At the start of the match, Liverpool striker Ian St. John had a shot cleared off the goal line and midway through the second half Dortmund defender Theodor Redder almost scored an own goal. Towards the end of the half, Dortmund began to have more of an attacking threat. They were only denied by a number of saves from Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence, ensuring it remained 0–0 at half-time.|$|E

25|$|The Western Australian gas {{crisis was}} a major {{disruption}} to natural gas supply in Western Australia, caused by the rupture of a corroded pipeline and subsequent explosion at a processing plant on Varanus Island, off the state's north west coast on 3 June 2008. The plant, operated by Apache Energy, which normally supplied {{a third of the}} state's gas, was shut down for almost two months while a detailed engineering investigation and major repairs were carried out.

25|$|China has an {{abundant}} potential for hydroelectric power production {{due to its}} considerable river network and mountainous terrain. Most of the total hydroelectric capacity is situated in the southwest of the country, where coal supplies are poor but demand for energy is rising swiftly. The potential in the northeast is fairly small, but {{it was there that}} the first hydroelectric stations were built—by the Japanese during its occupation of Manchuria. Due to considerable seasonal fluctuations in rainfall, the flow of rivers tends to drop during the winter, forcing many power stations to operate at less than <b>normal</b> <b>capacity,</b> while in the summer, on the other hand, floods often interfere with generation.|$|E

On 18 June, Apache Energy said it had commenced demolition and restoration of the damaged pipeline and expected this to be finished {{by the end of the}} following week.

25|$|Four {{helicopters}} {{supplied by}} the United States, from the Panama Canal, quickly began rescue missions. They airlifted survivors from flood waters and placed them on elevated land areas.

Food packages dropped to survivors were fought over, some people reportedly fighting each other with machetes for the supplies. During several of the later rescue missions, people died from starvation and malnutrition on board the helicopters. From nearby Belize, Britain deployed 57 soldiers with motorboats to rush food to survivors in flooded regions. A group of 41 Cuban medical experts, including 21 doctors, treated nearly 900 in a period of two days.|$|E

25|$|The {{episode of}} History Detectives, which aired on July 2, 2014, {{reviewed}} the known evidence, thoroughly disputing the sabotage theory, and then {{focused on the}} question of why the steamboat was allowed to be crowded to several times its <b>normal</b> <b>capacity</b> before departure. The report blamed quartermaster Hatch, an individual with a long history of corruption and incompetence, who was able to keep his job due to political connections: he was the younger brother of Illinois politician Ozias M. Hatch, an advisor and close friend of President Lincoln. Throughout the war, Reuben Hatch had shown incompetence as a quartermaster and competence as a thief, bilking the government out of thousands of dollars. Although brought up on courts-martial charges, Hatch managed to get letters of recommendation from such noted authorities as President Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and General of the Army Ulysses S. Grant. The letters reside in the National Archives in Washington DC. After the disaster, Hatch refused three separate subpoenas to appear before Captain Speed's trial and give testimony. Hatch died in 1871, having escaped justice due to his numerous highly placed patrons—including two presidents.|$|E

She was first commissioned with an air group of nine Mitsubishi 1MF (Type 10) fighters and three to six Mitsubishi B1M3 (Type 13) torpedo bombers. In 1928, the fighters were replaced by the A1N1 (Type 3). Three years later the air group consisted of Nakajima A2N (Type 90) fighters and Mitsubishi B2M (Type 89) torpedo bombers. In 1938 Nakajima A4N (Type 95) fighters and Yokosuka B3Y (Type 92) bombers flew from the ship.
