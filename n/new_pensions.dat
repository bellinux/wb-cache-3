25|$|The strike—probably {{the first}} workers' protest since 1958, with the {{exception}} of a September 1972 strike in the Jiu Valley—began not as an anti-Communist or even an anti-Ceaușescu movement but rather a socio-economic one in spontaneous reaction to the <b>new</b> <b>pensions</b> law, as confirmed by the miners’ inexperience, which led them to improvisation and hasty decision-making. However, once the Communist leaders were sequestered, it moved in a political direction and, given the repression that followed, was interpreted as such by the authorities. At the same time, the strike did have an intrinsically political character in the sense that the miners—thought of as essential components of the Communist working class—revolted against their ideological bosses and conditions created by the very political system that used them as part of its labour force. So while collective and unpremeditated, the protest challenged the Communist leadership of the day and ultimately the regime itself.|$|E

5000|$|These are {{pensions}} traditionally {{granted by}} the Sovereign from the Civil List upon {{the recommendation of the}} First Lord of the Treasury. The Civil List Act 1837 applied the condition that any <b>new</b> <b>pensions</b> should be [...] "granted to such persons only as have just claims on the royal beneficence or who by their personal services to the Crown, or by the performance of duties to the public, or by their useful discoveries in science and attainments in literature and the arts, have merited the gracious consideration of their sovereign and the gratitude of their country." [...] Famous recipients include Lord Byron and William Wordsworth. As of 1911, a sum of £1,200 was allotted each year from the Civil List, in addition to the pensions already in force. From a Return issued in 1908, the total of Civil List pensions payable in that year amounted to £24,665. In the financial year 2012-13 the annual cost of Civil List pensions paid to 53 people was £126,293. New Civil List pensions continue to be awarded occasionally.|$|E
