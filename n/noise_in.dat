5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of <b>noise</b> <b>in</b> European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{electronic}} {{white noise}} machines became commercially available. These are used alone {{to provide a}} pleasant background noise and to mask unpleasant noise, a similar role to conventional background music.

Also, white noise is sometimes used to mask sudden <b>noise</b> <b>in</b> facilities with research animals.|$|E

5|$|Zobel and Carson {{helped to}} {{establish}} the nature of <b>noise</b> <b>in</b> electric circuits, concluding that—contrary to mainstream belief—it is not even theoretically possible to filter out noise entirely and that noise {{will always be a}} limiting factor in what is possible to transmit. Thus, they anticipated the later work of Claude Shannon, who showed how the theoretical information rate of a channel is related to the noise of the channel.|$|E

5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random <b>noise</b> <b>in</b> the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E

The tour, like the album it supported, was commercially successful but critically panned. The critical failure of the album and tour were factors that led Bowie to look for a new way to motivate himself creatively, leading him to create the band Tin Machine in 1989 and to retire his back catalogue from live performances during his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour. Bowie did not release another solo album until Black Tie White <b>Noise</b> <b>in</b> 1993.|$|E

Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the <b>noise</b> <b>in</b> observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E

5|$|Ono {{released}} her first solo album, Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band, in 1970 as a companion piece to Lennon's better-known John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured {{a photo of}} her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon's a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and free jazz techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included Ornette Coleman, other renowned free jazz performers, and Ringo Starr. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence Meredith Monk and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal <b>noise</b> <b>in</b> lieu of words. The album reached No. 182 on the US charts.|$|E
5|$|Orchestras {{continued}} to use <b>noise</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of a}} percussion section, which expanded though the 19th century: Berlioz was perhaps the first composer to thoroughly investigate the effects of different mallets on the tone color of timpani. However, before the 20th century, percussion instruments played a very small role in orchestral music and mostly served for punctuation, to highlight passages, or for novelty. But by the 1940s, some composers were influenced by non-Western music as well as jazz and popular music, and began incorporating marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones, bells, gongs, cymbals, and drums.|$|E
5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and <b>noise</b> <b>in</b> the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E

5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted <b>noise</b> <b>in</b> relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E
