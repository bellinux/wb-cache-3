Previous studies show that <b>NOTCH</b> 3 protein forms multimers.

40|$|<b>Notch</b> signal {{transduction}} is evolutionarily conserved with essential functions identified in numerous species from C. elegans to H. Sapiens. <b>Notch</b> is critical during embryonic development, in the adult, and in cancer. In mammals {{there are four}} <b>Notch</b> receptors; much of our understanding of <b>Notch</b> signalling comes {{from the study of}} <b>NOTCH</b> 1. During embryogenesis, <b>Notch</b> 1 is widely expressed and is required in numerous processes including blood vessel formation and remodelling (angiogenesis). The view of <b>Notch</b> {{signal transduction}}, achieved primarily through studying <b>NOTCH</b> 1, is that <b>Notch</b> receptors undergo processing and are transported to the cell surface as a heterodimer. Ligand binding triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages leading to the release of the <b>Notch</b> intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription. In contrast to <b>NOTCH</b> 1, little is known about <b>NOTCH</b> 4; <b>Notch</b> 4 is expressed in endothelial cells of the circulatory system, trans-activation by ligand is difficult to detect, and a phenotype in mice, reported to be null for <b>Notch</b> 4 (<b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele), has not been identified. Here, further analysis of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 has revealed many features that are in contrast to <b>NOTCH</b> 1 : (i) unprocessed <b>NOTCH</b> 4 was present on the cell surface, (ii) ligand did not trans-activate <b>NOTCH</b> 4 signalling, (iii) <b>NOTCH</b> 4 inhibited <b>NOTCH</b> 1 signal transduction in a dose dependent manner, (iv) <b>NOTCH</b> 4 induced the differentiation of myoblasts, and (v) subcellular localisation of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 was different to <b>NOTCH</b> 1, and coexpression resulted in <b>NOTCH</b> 1 adopting the <b>NOTCH</b> 4 pattern of localisation. In addition, postnatal retinal angiogenesis was examined in mice carrying the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele. A delay in the expansion of the retinal vasculature was equally observed in both <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 +/- and <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 -/- mice. This suggested that <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 was not a null allele. Fittingly, the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele produced transcripts that encode for much of the extracellular domain of <b>NOTCH</b> 4. The expression pattern of this transcript was equivalent to <b>Notch</b> 4 in mouse embryos. Like full length <b>NOTCH</b> 4, expression of a cDNA based on this transcript also inhibited <b>NOTCH</b> 1 signal transduction. These studies reveal {{for the first time a}} function for <b>NOTCH</b> 4 that is, as an inhibitor of <b>NOTCH</b> 1. Accordingly it is postulated that <b>Notch</b> 4 will have a crucial function in angiogenesis, since <b>Notch</b> 1 is required for angiogenesis and <b>Notch</b> 4 is expressed in endothelial cells of the circulatory system...|$|R

Mice homozygous for the hypomorphic <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f allele, which removes the single O -fucose glycan in epidermal growth factor-like repeat 12 (EGF 12) of the <b>Notch</b> 1 ligand binding domain (lbd), exhibit reduced growth after weaning and defective T cell development. Mice homozygous for the inactive <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd allele express <b>Notch</b> 1 missing an ~ 20 kDa internal segment including the canonical <b>Notch</b> 1 ligand binding domain, and die at embryonic day ~E 9. 5. The embryonic and vascular phenotypes of compound heterozygous <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd embryos were compared with <b>Notch</b> 1 +/ 12 f, <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / 12 f, and <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos. Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from these embryos were also examined in <b>Notch</b> signaling assays. While <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling was stronger in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd compound heterozygotes compared to <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos and ES cells, <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling was even stronger in embryos carrying <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f and a null <b>Notch</b> 1 allele.

However, vascular defects in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd yolk sac were severe and similar to <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd yolk sac. By contrast, vascular disorganization was milder in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd compared to <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos. The expression of <b>Notch</b> 1 target genes was low in <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd yolk sac and embryo head, whereas Vegf and Vegfr 2 transcripts were increased. The severity of the compound heterozygous <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f / lbd yolk sac phenotype suggested that the allelic products may functionally interact. By contrast, compound heterozygotes with <b>Notch</b> 1 12 f in combination with a <b>Notch</b> 1 null allele (<b>Notch</b> 1 tm 1 Con) were capable of surviving to birth.

40|$|AbstractNotch 4 is a {{divergent}} {{member of}} the <b>Notch</b> family of receptors that is primarily expressed in the vasculature. Its expression implies an important role for <b>Notch</b> 4 in the vasculature; however, mice homozygous for the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 knockout allele are viable. Since {{little is known about}} the role of <b>Notch</b> 4 in the vasculature and how it functions, we further investigated <b>Notch</b> 4 in mice and in cultured cells. We found that the <b>Notch</b> 4 d 1 allele is not null as it expresses a truncated transcript encoding most of the <b>NOTCH</b> 4 extracellular domain. In cultured cells, <b>NOTCH</b> 4 did not signal in response to ligand. Moreover, <b>NOTCH</b> 4 inhibited signalling from the <b>NOTCH</b> 1 receptor. This is the first report of cis-inhibition of signalling by another <b>Notch</b> receptor. The <b>NOTCH</b> 4 extracellular domain also inhibits <b>NOTCH</b> 1 signalling when expressed in cis, raising the possibility that reported <b>Notch</b> 4 phenotypes may not be due to loss of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 function. To better address the role of <b>NOTCH</b> 4 in vivo, we generated a <b>Notch</b> 4 null mouse in which the entire coding region was deleted. <b>Notch</b> 4 null mice exhibited slightly delayed vessel growth in the retina, consistent with our novel finding that <b>NOTCH</b> 4 protein is expressed in the newly formed vasculature.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Notch</b> {{signaling}} {{is highly}} conserved in the metazoa and {{is critical for}} many cell fate decisions. <b>Notch</b> activation occurs following ligand binding to <b>Notch</b> extracellular domain. In vitro binding assays have identified epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats 11 and 12 as the ligand binding domain of Drosophila <b>Notch.</b> Here we show that an internal deletion in mouse <b>Notch</b> 1 of EGF repeats 8 – 12, including the putative ligand binding domain (lbd), is an inactivating mutation in vivo. We also show that maternal and zygotic <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd mutant embryos develop through gastrulation to mid-gestation. Results <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd embryos died at mid-gestation with a phenotype indistinguishable from <b>Notch</b> 1 null mutants. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd was expressed on the cell surface at levels equivalent to wild type <b>Notch</b> 1, but Delta 1 binding was reduced to {{the same level as}} in <b>Notch</b> 1 null cells. In an ES cell co-culture assay, <b>Notch</b> signaling induced by Jagged 1 or Delta 1 was reduced to a similar level in <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd and <b>Notch</b> 1 null cells. However, the <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd allele was expressed similarly to wild type <b>Notch</b> 1 in <b>Notch</b> 1 lbd / lbd ES cells and embryos at E 8. 75, indicating that <b>Notch</b> 1 signaling is not essential for the <b>Notch</b> 1 gene to be expressed.

However, the <b>Notch</b> 4 mutation displayed genetic interactions with a targeted mutation of the related <b>Notch</b> 1 gene.

Together, these findings infer that <b>Notch</b> 2 and <b>Notch</b> 3 act together to govern vascular development and smooth muscle differentiation.

We used genetic deletion to define receptor roles on stem cell function, cell proliferation/differentiation, and repair after injury. Loss of <b>Notch</b> 1 induced a transient secretory cell hyperplasia that spontaneously resolved over time. In contrast, deletion of <b>Notch</b> 2 had no secretory cell effect. Compound deletions of <b>Notch</b> 1 and <b>Notch</b> 2 resulted in a more severe secretory cell hyperplasia than deletion of <b>Notch</b> 1 alone. Furthermore, only double deletion of <b>Notch</b> 1 and <b>Notch</b> 2 decreased cell proliferation, suggesting a low threshold for maintenance of proliferation compared to differentiation.

However, <b>Notch</b> 2 is the predominant form expressed in spleen. The degree to which these <b>Notch</b> homologs are functionally convergent is not known. We present evidence that <b>Notch</b> 2 also signals through CBF 1. As {{is the case for}} <b>Notch</b> 1, <b>Notch</b> 2 interacted with the minimal repression domain of CBF 1 and was targeted to CBF 1 through the intracellular, subtransmembrane domain. Additional characterization suggested that the interaction domain of <b>Notch</b> may be bipartite. The intracellular domain of <b>Notch</b> 2 (<b>Notch</b> 2 IC) located to the nucleus. This activated form of <b>Notch</b> 2 transactivated expression of a target gene containing upstream CBF 1 binding sites. The use of CBF 1 mutants carrying amino acid substitutions in the transcriptional repression domain revealed that activation of gene expression by <b>Notch</b> 2 is also based on masking of CBF 1 -mediated repression. Targeting of <b>Notch</b> 1 and targeting of <b>Notch</b> 2 were found to be identical and distinguishable from targeting by EBNA 2.

In a biological examination of <b>Notch</b> 2 function in muscle cells, <b>Notch</b> 2 IC activated endogenous HES- 1 gene expression and blocked muscle cell differentiation. Overall, the data imply that at least a subset of the intracellular events following signalling in cells expressing <b>Notch</b> 2 are common to those in <b>Notch</b> 1 -expressing cells.

METHODS <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression was determined immunohistochemically in 142 primarily resected GCs using tissue microarrays and in 84 pretherapeutic biopsies from patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The results were correlated with survival, response to therapy, and clinico-pathological features. RESULTS Primarily resected patients with <b>NOTCH</b> 1 -negative tumors demonstrated worse survival. High <b>NOTCH</b> 1 expression was associated with early-stage tumors and with significantly increased survival in this subgroup. Higher <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression was associated with early-stage and intestinal-type tumors and with better survival in the subgroup of intestinal-type tumors. In pretherapeutic biopsies, higher <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression was more frequent in non-responding patients, but these differences were statistically not significant. CONCLUSION Our findings suggested that, in particular, <b>NOTCH</b> 1 expression indicated good prognosis in GC. The close relationship of high <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 expression with early tumor stages may indicate a tumor-suppressive role of <b>NOTCH</b> signaling in GC. The role of <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 in neoadjuvantly treated GC is limited...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>NOTCH</b> {{activation}} plays oncogenic {{roles in}} acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). However, whether <b>NOTCH</b> is oncogenic or tumor-suppressive in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is still controversial. Herein, {{the roles of}} <b>NOTCH</b> in AML are reviewed. AML cells express <b>NOTCH</b> and <b>NOTCH</b> ligands; however, cell-autonomous activation is not observed. Activating <b>NOTCH</b> 1 mutations are rare in AML, unlike in T-ALL. <b>NOTCH</b> ligand stimulation generally suppresses the in vitro growth of AML cells but promotes transient growth of some samples. Conversely, knockdown of <b>NOTCH</b> 1 and <b>NOTCH</b> 2 {{does not affect the}} growth of AML cells, whereas it suppresses the growth of T-ALL cells. These findings suggest that <b>NOTCH</b> is dispensable or suppressive for AML cell growth. However, the effects of <b>NOTCH</b> differ depending on cell conditions, and various stemness-relate...|$|R
5|$|The long, falcate (sickle-shaped) {{pectoral}} fins taper to narrowly pointed tips. The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is tall and}} positioned slightly closer to the pectoral fins than the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins are almost {{as large as the}} first dorsal fin and bear long, thin claspers in males. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny, with the former positioned ahead of the latter. There are crescent-shaped <b>notches</b> on the caudal peduncle at the upper and lower origins of the caudal fin. The upper caudal fin lobe is enormously elongated as is characteristic of threshers, measuring about as long {{as the rest of the}} shark; the thin, gently curving lobe is held at a steep upward angle and has a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
5|$|The skull shows a short {{front part}} (rostrum) {{and a broad}} interorbital region (located between the eyes). The roof of the braincase is marked by supraorbital shelves. The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} the front part of the palate, are very broad and extend between the first molars. The zygomatic plates, the flattened anterior portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are expansive and show well-developed <b>notches</b> at their front ends. The palate itself is flat and ends a little behind the third molars. The posterolateral palatal pits, located near the third molars, are well developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind {{the end of the}} palate, is rounded at the frond and broad. An extension of the alisphenoid bone known as the alisphenoid strut is usually present, separating two foramina (openings), the foramen ovale accessorium and the masticatory-buccinator foramen. The roof of the tympanic cavity, the tegmen tympani, is small.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 <b>notches</b> that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					<b>Notch</b> 4 is {{a member}} of the <b>Notch</b> family of receptors that is {{primarily}} expressed in the vascular endothelial cells. Genetic deletion of <b>Notch</b> 4 does not result in an overt phenotype in mice, thus the function of <b>Notch</b> 4 remains poorly understood. 				 				 					 						Methods 					We examined the requirement for <b>Notch</b> 4 in the development of breast cancer vasculature. Orthotopic transplantation of mouse mammary tumor cells wild type for <b>Notch</b> 4 into <b>Notch</b> 4 deficient hosts enabled us to delineate the contribution of host <b>Notch</b> 4 independent of its function in the tumor cell compartment. 				 				 					 						Results 					Here, we show that <b>Notch</b> 4 expression is required for tumor onset and early tumor perfusion in a mouse model of breast cancer. We found that <b>Notch</b> 4 expression is upregulated in mouse and human mammary tumor vasculature. Moreover, host <b>Notch</b> 4 deficiency delayed the onset of MMTV-PyMT tumors, wild type for <b>Notch</b> 4, after transplantation. Vessel perfusion was decreased in tumors established in <b>Notch</b> 4 -deficient hosts. Unlike in inhibition of <b>Notch</b> 1 or Dll 4, vessel density and branching in tumors developed in <b>Notch</b> 4 -deficient mice were unchanged. However, final tumor size was similar between tumors grown in wild type and <b>Notch</b> 4 null hosts. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					Our results suggest a novel role for <b>Notch</b> 4 in the establishment of tumor colonies and vessel perfusion of transplanted mammary tumors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough the {{involvement}} of the <b>Notch</b> pathway in several areas of vascular biology is now clearly established, its role in vascular inflammation at the endothelial level remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines drive a specific regulation of the <b>Notch</b> pathway in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). In arterial ECs, TNFα strongly modulates the pattern of <b>Notch</b> expression by decreasing <b>Notch</b> 4 expression while increasing <b>Notch</b> 2 expression. Changes in <b>Notch</b> expression were associated with a reduction in hes 1 and hey 2 expression and in CBF 1 reporter gene activity, suggesting that TNFα regulates both <b>Notch</b> expression and activity. <b>Notch</b> 2 and <b>Notch</b> 4 regulations occurred independently and were found to be mostly mediated by the NFκB signaling pathways and PI 3 -kinase signaling pathways, respectively. Functionally, TNF-mediated <b>Notch</b> regulation promotes caspase-dependent EC apoptosis. Finally, our findings confirmed that dysregulated <b>Notch</b> signaling also occurs upon inflammation and correlates with caspase activation and apoptosis. In conclusion, inflammatory cytokines elicit a switch in <b>Notch</b> expression characterized by <b>Notch</b> 2 predominance over <b>Notch</b> 4 leading to a reduced <b>Notch</b> activity and promoting apoptosis. Thus, here we provide evidence for a role of soluble mediators of inflammation (i. e. cytokines) in the regulation of <b>Notch</b> signaling and for the implication of a dysregulated <b>Notch</b> pathway to endothelial and vascular dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|During {{development}} of the nervous system, the fate of stem cells is regulated by a cell surface receptor called <b>Notch.</b> <b>Notch</b> is also present in the adult mammalian brain; however, because <b>Notch</b> null mice die during embryonic development, it has proven difficult to determine the functions of <b>Notch.</b> Here, we used <b>Notch</b> antisense transgenic mice that develop and reproduce normally, but exhibit reduced levels of <b>Notch,</b> to demonstrate a role for <b>Notch</b> signaling in synaptic plasticity. Mice with reduced <b>Notch</b> levels exhibit impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal CA 1 synapses. A <b>Notch</b> ligand enhances LTP in normal mice and corrects the defect in LTP in <b>Notch</b> antisense transgenic mice. Levels of basal and stimulation-induced NF-κB activity were significantly decreased in mice with reduced <b>Notch</b> levels. These findings suggest an important role for <b>Notch</b> signaling in a form of synaptic plasticity known {{to be associated with}} learning and memory processes...|$|R
