40|$|Widespread {{nitrogen}} (N) {{limitation of}} plant growth in boreal forests {{is a well}} recognized phenomenon. Yet, the mechanisms responsible {{for the development of}} N limitation are unknown. By exploring the linkage between N cycling and microbial community structure, this thesis examines the role of soil microorganisms in N limitation development. The first part of the thesis addresses effects of long-term <b>N</b> <b>additions</b> on microbial communities and N cycling in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests and if the effects are reversible after termination of <b>N</b> <b>addition.</b> <b>The</b> second part of the thesis explores the role soil microbes play in the development of N limitation in primary forest ecosystems. The general structure and biomass of soil microbial communities was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analyses. Soil and ecosystem N cycling were inferred from gross N mineralisation measurements and 15 N natural abundance in soil and foliage. Retention of the 15 N label by soil microorganisms was used to infer N retention capacity of the ecosystems. Despite unique responses in microbial communities and gross N mineralisation to long-term <b>N</b> <b>additions</b> between <b>the</b> two studies, some common patterns emerged. Gross N mineralisation, microbial community structure, and N retention were strongly linked. Microbial biomass decreased but gross N mineralisation increased after <b>N</b> <b>addition.</b> <b>The</b> increased biotic <b>N</b> retention after termination of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> coincided with increased functional role ectomycorrhizal fungi play in ecosystem N cycle as inferred from changes in 15 N natural abundance. In the land uplift chronosequence, large inputs of N through N 2 -fixation resulted in soil N accumulation but a decline in N supply rates. This coincided with increasing microbial N-immobilisation and increasing abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi suggesting their importance in N retention. I suggest that the strong N limitation typical of boreal forests can develop in about 150 years. This thesis provides strong evidence that ectomycorrhizal fungi played an important role both in the return of N limitation two decades after termination of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> and in <b>the</b> development of N limitation in a primary boreal forest. ...|$|R

The study was conducted over a two-year period with trials commencing {{at the beginning of each}} growing season. Soil enzyme activity, microbial biomass and microbial community level physiological profile (CLPP) were determined at 0 - 5 cm and 5 - 10 cm soil depths. Nitrogen was added to the soil at five rates plus a control, i. e. 0, 0. 5, 1, 3, 6 and 24 gNm⁻²y⁻¹. We hypothesized that soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass N (MBN) would firstly increase and then decrease, and CLPP would be altered with increasing <b>N</b> <b>addition,</b> due to <b>the</b> deleterious effects of higher <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> upon microbial activity. Because of the relatively higher organic matter in the upper depth of soil layers, we further hypothesized that the responses of microbial activities in the 0 - 5 cm depth would be more marked than at 5 - 10 cm. In partial support of our hypothesis, soil enzyme activities, microbial biomass and nutrient concentrations responded to <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> with <b>the</b> most significant changes occurring in the 0 - 5 cm soil depth. <b>Addition</b> of <b>N</b> resulted in an increase in MBN and a decrease in urease activity.

40|$|AbstractThe present work aims to {{investigate}} the influence of neodymium <b>addition</b> on <b>the</b> microstructure, mechanical and thermal properties of Mg-Si alloys. Different proportions of (0. 3, 0. 6, 0. 9 and 1. 2 wt. %) Nd {{has been added to}} the hypo (Mg- 1. 15 Si) and hypereutectic (Mg- 6 Si) alloys. The microstructural studies reveal that <b>the</b> <b>Nd</b> <b>additions</b> change <b>the</b> size and mor hology of Mg-halos in the hypoeutectic Mg-Si alloy. In the hypereutectic alloy, <b>the</b> <b>Nd</b> <b>additions</b> considerably reduce <b>the</b> size of the primary Mg 2 Si phase besides, modifying the Mg 2 Si morphology from a coarse dendritic to a polyhedral shape. The amount of Nd required for the optimal modification of both alloys is experimentally determined. Increase in mechanical properties obtained with <b>Nd</b> <b>addition</b> is correlated with the microstructural refinement. To understand the microfracture mechanism, the SEM analysis has been carried out...|$|R
40|$|Increases in {{nitrogen}} (N) deposition {{can greatly}} stimulate ecosystem net carbon (C) sequestration through positive N-induced effects on plant productivity. However, how net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) and its components respond to different <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> rates remains unclear. Using an <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> gradient experiment (six levels: 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32  gN m − 2  yr − 1) in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, we explored {{the responses of}} different ecosystem C fluxes to an <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> gradient and revealed mechanisms underlying the dynamic responses. Results showed that NEE, ecosystem respiration (ER), and gross ecosystem production (GEP) all increased linearly with <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> rates in <b>the</b> first year of treatment but shifted to N saturation responses {{in the second year}} with the highest NEE (− 7. 77  ±  0. 48  µmol m − 2  s − 1) occurring under an <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> rate of 8  gN m − 2  yr − 1. The saturation responses of NEE and GEP were caused by N-induced accumulation of standing litter, which limited light availability for plant growth under high <b>N</b> <b>addition.</b> <b>The</b> saturation response of ER was mainly due to an N-induced saturation response of aboveground plant respiration and decreasing soil microbial respiration along <b>the</b> <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> gradient, while decreases in soil microbial respiration under high <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> were caused by N-induced reductions in soil pH. We also found that various components of ER, including aboveground plant respiration, soil respiration, root respiration, and microbial respiration, responded differentially to <b>the</b> <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> gradient. These results reveal temporal dynamics of N impacts and the rapid shift in ecosystem C fluxes from N limitation to N saturation. Our findings bring evidence of short-term initial shifts in responses of ecosystem C fluxes to increases in N deposition, which should be considered when predicting long-term changes in ecosystem net C sequestration...|$|R
40|$|Bryophytes {{dominate}} northern peatlands. Obtaining reliable {{measurements of}} moss-growth {{and how it}} may be affected by global changes are therefore important. Several methods {{have been used to}} measure moss-growth but it is unclear how comparable they are in different conditions and this uncertainty undermines comparisons among studies. In a field experiment we measured the growth and production of Sphagnum fallax (Sphagnum) and Polytrichum strictum (Polytrichum) using two handling methods, using cut and uncut plants, and three growth-variables, heightgrowth, length-growth, and mass-growth. We aimed “benchmarking” a combination of six methodological options against exactly the same set of factorial experiments: atmospheric CO 2 enrichment and <b>N</b> <b>addition.</b> <b>The</b> two handling methods produced partly different results: in half of the cases, one method revealed a significant treatment effect but the other one did not: significant negative effects on growth were only observed on uncut plants for elevated CO 2 and on cut plants for <b>N</b> <b>addition.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> correspondence between measurements made with various growth-variables depended on the species and, to a lesser extent, treatments. Sphagnum and Polytrichum growth was inhibited under elevated CO 2, and correlated to higher ammonium values. Sphagnum was however less affected than Polytrichum and the height difference between the two species decreased. <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> reduced <b>the</b> P/N ratio and probably induced P-limiting conditions. Sphagnum growth was more inhibited than Polytrichum and the height difference between the two species increased. Our data show that such a problem indeed exists between the cut and uncut handling methods. Not only do the results differ in absolute terms by as much as 82 % but also do their comparisons and interpretations depend on the handling method—and thus the interpretation would be biased—in half of the cases. These results call for caution when comparing factorial studies based on different handling methods...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric N {{deposition}} {{is predicted}} to increase four times over its current status in tropical forests by 2030. Our ability to understand the effects of N enrichment on C and N cycles is being challenged by the large heterogeneity of the tropical forest biome. The specific response {{will depend on the}} forest's nutrient status; however, few studies of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> appear to incorporate the nutrient status in tropical forests, possibly due to difficulties in explaining how this status is maintained. We used a meta-analysis to explore the consequences of the N enrichment on C and N cycles in tropical montane and lowland forests. We tracked changes in aboveground and belowground plant C and N and in mineral soil in response to <b>N</b> <b>addition.</b> We found an increasing trend of plant biomass in montane forests, but not in lowland forests, as well as a greater increase in NO emission in montane forest compared with lowland forest. The N 2 O and NO emission increase in both forest; however, the N 2 O increase in lowland forest was significantly even at first time <b>N</b> <b>addition.</b> <b>The</b> NO emission increase showed be greater at first term compared with long term <b>N</b> <b>addition.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> increase in total soil N, ammonium, microbial N, and dissolved N concentration under N enrichment indicates a rich N status of lowland forests. The available evidence of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> experiments shows that the lowland forest is richer in N than montane forests. Finally, the greater increase in N leaching and N gas emission highlights the importance of study the N deposition effect on the global climate change...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{influence}} of nitrogen (<b>N)</b> <b>addition</b> on grassland plant communities has been widely studied, it is still unclear whether observed patterns and underlying mechanisms are constant across biomes. In this systematic review, we use meta-analysis and metaregression to investigate <b>the</b> influence of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> (here referring mostly to fertilization) upon the biodiversity of temperate mountain grasslands (including montane, subalpine and alpine zones). Forty-two studies met our criteria of inclusion, resulting in 134 measures of effect size. The main general responses of mountain grasslands to <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> were increases in phytomass and reductions in plant species richness, as observed in lowland grasslands. More specifically, the analysis reveals that negative effects on species richness were exacerbated by dose (ha(- 1) year(- 1)) and duration of N application (years) in an additive manner. Thus, sustained application of low to moderate levels of N over time had effects similar to short-term application of high N doses. The climatic context also played an important role: the overall effects of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> on plant species richness and diversity (Shannon index) were less pronounced in mountain grasslands experiencing cool rather than warm summers. Furthermore, the relative negative effect of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> on species richness was more pronounced in managed communities and was strongly negatively related to N-induced increases in phytomass, that is the greater the phytomass response to <b>N</b> <b>addition,</b> <b>the</b> greater the decline in richness. Altogether, this review not only establishes that plant biodiversity of mountain grasslands is negatively affected by <b>N</b> <b>addition,</b> but also demonstrates that several local management and abiotic factors interact with <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> to drive plant community changes. This synthesis yields essential information for a more sustainable management of mountain grasslands, emphasizing the importance of preserving and restoring grasslands with both low agricultural N application and limited exposure to N atmospheric deposition...|$|R
40|$|Serious {{nitrogen}} (N) {{deposition in}} terrestrial ecosystems causes soil acidification and changes {{the structure and}} function of the microbial community. However, {{it is unclear how}} these changes are dependent on N deposition rates, other factors induced by N (e. g., pH), and their interactions. In this study, we investigated the responses of soil prokaryotic community structure and stability after a 13 -year <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> in <b>the</b> semi-arid Leymus chinensis steppe in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results demonstrated that the prokaryotic community structure changed at <b>the</b> low <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> rate of 1. 75 g N m(- 2) yr(- 1); however, dramatic changes in microbial abundance, respiratory quotient, and prokaryotic diversity occurred at <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> rates of more than 5. 25 g N m(- 2) yr(- 1) when the soil pH dropped below 6. 0. The two patterns indicated the difference in driving forces for different microbial properties. The N-driven and pH-driven processes are likely the most important mechanisms determining the responses of bacterial community to N. Some copiotrophic/oligotrophic bacteria, e. g., Proteobacteria and Acidbacteria, changed their relative abundances with <b>the</b> <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> continuously even at a low rate, indicating that they were more sensitive to N directly. Some bacterial groups significantly changed their relative abundance at a high <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> rate when pH dropped below 6. 0, e. g., Verrucomicrobia and Armatimonadetes, indicating that they were more sensitive to pH below 6. 0. <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> altered <b>the</b> prokaryotic community structure through enrichment of copiotrophic bacteria (species adjustment) at low <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> rates and through enrichment of nitrophilous taxa and significant loss of diversity at high N rates. The results also demonstrated that a high <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> diminished <b>the</b> stability of the prokaryotic community structure and activity through reduction in species diversity and bacterial interaction. Overall, this study supported the hypothesis that the responses of prokaryota to N were dependent on deposition rates, and N-driven and pH-driven processes were the important mechanisms to control the shift of the prokaryotic community.
