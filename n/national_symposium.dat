2500|$|On 16 January 2014, at the Surface Naval Association's <b>national</b> <b>symposium,</b> {{the head}} of NAVSEA's Strategic and Theater Sealift program, Captain Henry Stevens, {{announced}} that the Bell-Boeing MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft will be evaluated for potential operations on board the Expeditionary Mobile Base (ESB) variant of the Expeditionary Transfer Dock.

2500|$|On 16 January 2014, at the Surface Naval Association's <b>national</b> <b>symposium,</b> {{the head}} of NAVSEA's Strategic and Theater Sealift program, Captain Henry Stevens, {{announced}} that the Bell-Boeing MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft (pictured) would be evaluated for potential operations on board the Expeditionary Mobile Base ESD variant. The testing and certification of MH-53E helicopters for minesweeping operations from ESB support ships was slated to begin during fiscal year 2016. [...] Additionally, Captain Stevens noted that the F-35B STOVL strike fighter was not then being considered for ESB operations because of exhaust heat from F-35B damaging the flight decks of U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships. Some outfitting and specialized equipment specific to the V-22 was needed to support it, but little engineering work or modifications to the ship needed to be done; upon Lewis B. Pullers deployment, it had been upgraded to support V-22 operations by Special Operations Forces.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, New Ways Ministry {{held its}} first <b>national</b> <b>symposium</b> on {{homosexuality}} and the Catholic Church, but Archbishop James Hickey of Washington, D.C. wrote to Catholic bishops and communities, asking them not to support the event. Despite this, more than fifty Catholic groups endorsed the program. In 1983 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith attempted unsuccessfully to block publication of Nugent's book, A Challenge to Love: Gay and Lesbian Catholics in the Church, although Cardinal Ratzinger did succeed in forcing Bishop Walter Sullivan of Richmond to remove his name from it. In May 1999 both Nugent and Grammick were formally disciplined when the Congregation imposed lifetime bans on any pastoral work involving gay people, declaring that the positions they advanced [...] "do not faithfully convey the clear and constant teaching of the Catholic Church" [...] and [...] "have caused confusion among the Catholic people". The Vatican move made Nugent and Gramick [...] "folk heroes in liberal circles", where official teaching is seen as outdated and lacking compassion.|$|E

2500|$|Roz Ward, an {{academic}} at the university's Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society (ARCSHS), co-founded a Safe Schools program for Victoria. The program aims to reduce homophobic and transphobic bullying and discrimination in schools. Research work undertaken by ARCSHS into same-sex attracted and gender diverse youth has helped underpin the program. This program has created controversy. At a <b>national</b> <b>symposium,</b> Ward said, [...] "When people do complain then school leadership can very calmly and graciously say, 'You know what? We’re doing it anyway, tough luck'! [...] [...] [...]'(It’s) not about celebrating diversity; not about stopping bullying, (It’s) about gender and sexual diversity". The Australian Christian Lobby (ACL) {{and others have}} criticised the program as [...] "radical sexual experimentation" [...] which [...] "exposed students to extreme material" [...] and asked for the withdrawal of $8 million allocated to the Australia-wide program. ACL says the program instructs students how to use facilities that match gender identities, how to have anal sex and how girls can bind their chests to change gender.|$|E
