Glock popularized this trigger in modern pistols and many other manufacturers have released pre-set striker products of their own. The primary disadvantage is that pulling the trigger a second time after a failure to fire will not re-strike the primer.

50|$|The two reissues {{are easily}} {{distinguishable}} from the 1903 originals because {{by then the}} Bureau had determined that perforated 12 stamps separated too easily to withstand <b>normal</b> <b>handling</b> in post offices, and so, a coarser gauge, perforated 10, {{was used for the}} 1917 issues. Moreover, the new versions, like all the stamps of that year, were produced on unwatermarked paper. The reprints are considerably less costly to collectors than the originals (particularly the $5, which is almost ten times as expensive in the 1902 version).|$|E

The Wächtersbach Ceramic Factory coffee cups are noted for being superbly designed—they have unusually thick circular porcelain walls that allow them to keep the coffee (or tea or hot chocolate) hot longer than regular coffee cups.

5000|$|Gas duster, {{also known}} as canned air or {{compressed}} air, is a product used for cleaning or dusting electronic equipment and other sensitive devices that cannot be cleaned using water. The products are most often a can that, when a trigger is pressed, blasts a stream of compressed gas through a nozzle. Despite the name [...] "canned air", the cans actually contain gases that are compressable into liquids. Air on the contrary, cannot be compressed into liquid at any reasonable pressure since the critical temperatures of air components (-146.9 C for nitrogen; -118.6 C for oxygen) are much beyond <b>normal</b> <b>handling</b> temperatures. Common duster gases are 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, or 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. Hydrocarbons, like butane, were often used in the past, but their flammable nature forced manufacturers to use fluorocarbons. When inhaled, gas duster fumes may produce psychoactive effects and may be harmful to health.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1854 a [...] "rotary process" [...] was {{patented}} by William Bemrose and Henry Howe Bemrose. The Bemrose machine {{was designed as}} a rouletting machine. As such, it proved impracticable for stamp separation but in 1856 was successfully converted to a perforating machine by George C. Howard of Toppan Carpenter, stamp printers for the American Government. Both the stroke and rotary processes have been refined since then, but are basically still the ones in use in the 21st century. The key decision for the perforator is the spacing of the holes; if too far apart, the stamps will not separate easily, and the stamps are likely to tear, but if too close, the stamps will tend to come apart in <b>normal</b> <b>handling.</b> In a few cases the size of the holes has been a factor. In the case of certain stamps produced by Australia for sale in rolls rather than sheets (coil stamps) a pattern can be seen on the stamp's short side of two small, ten large and two small holes.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{possibility}} of packing the B ration in units of ten was suggested early in the Second World War, progress on such an arrangement did not begin until 1943 when the Mountain ration, Jungle ration, and 5-in-1 rations were discontinued. The success of the British [...] "compo" [...] or 14-in-1 ration during the North African campaign in 1942 and the movement to classify field rations into four categories added incentive for development of the 10-in-1 ration. [...] A guide to its rapid development was furnished in the following 1943 definition:"A small-group field ration be composed of components of the standard field ration type B (modified to reduce bulk and weight) packed in basic packages of five complete rations each[...] [...] [...] The inner and outer packages are to be proof against water, vapor, moisture, and chemical agents.

5000|$|Packaging was {{primitive}} and inadequate in 1942, even for <b>normal</b> <b>handling</b> under New Guinea conditions. Cardboard boxes disintegrated, cans rusted,and wooden boxes rotted or were eaten by insects. Parachutes for air dropping were in short supply. [...] Orders for parachutes {{were placed in}} Australia, the United States and India. A request for 5,000 cargo parachutes with containers was made to Washington on 21 July. On 22 September {{it was decided to}} send 1,000 without containers by air, while the rest went by sea. Due to the shortage of parachutes, most supplies had to be [...] "free-dropped"—dropped without parachutes—so the rate of breakage was high. As the contents of the packaging usually burst, they were encased in two or more sacks, the outer being much larger than the inner, so it could contain the contents when the inner burst, and prevent them from scattering. Three layers was found necessary. Items such as sacks and blankets were preferred as packaging, as these were useful to the troops. About 12,000 blankets were used in the five weeks up to 12 October. The earlier adoption of blankets as packaging would not only have saved supplies from breakage, but would have also increased the volume of supplies delivered over the track, as thousands of blankets were sent by carrier. Without a well-organised recovery effort, less that 50 percent of what was dropped was recovered, and perhaps 70 per cent of what was recovered was found to be in a usable condition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Alpha-synuclein (a-syn) {{appears to}} {{normally}} regulate neurotransmitter release, possibly via calcium-dependent binding and dissociation from lipid domains on secretory vesicles. The pathogenic effects of a-syn leading to Parkinson’s disease (PD) appear {{to result from}} alternate toxic effects on lipid membrane. A variety of findings indicate that overexpression of wild-type a-syn, pathogenic mutations of a-syn, and dopamine-modified-a-syn promote toxic interaction between a-syn oligomers and lipids. These may disrupt transmembrane concentration gradients across secretory vesicles and other organelles and interfere with normal lysosomal or ubiqutin/proteasome mediated protein degradation or mitochondrial function. Additional causes of PD may interfere at other points with <b>normal</b> <b>handling</b> and degradation of a-syn, providing a variety of entry points to a converging neurodegenerative path underlying the disease...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a moldable cellulosic foam for use in Skylab instrument storage cushions is considered.

A study of halogenated foam components was made, including more highly chlorinated binders, halogen-containing additives, and halogenation of the cellulose. The immediate objective was to reduce the density of the foam through reduction in inorganic phosphate without sacrificing flame-retarding properties of the foams. The use of frothing techniques was investigated, with particular emphasis on a urea-formaldehyde foam. Halogen-containing flame retardants were deemphasized in favor of inorganic salts and the preparation of phosphate and sulphate esters of cellulose. Utilization of foam products for civilian applications was also considered...|$|E
