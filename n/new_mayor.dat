5|$|Pichilemu {{is governed}} by the mayor (alcalde), who manages the {{executive}} function. The City Council (concejo municipal) manages the legislative function. The mayors and the councilors are elected popularly every four years, with possibility of re-election. Marcelo Cabrera Martínez was elected in 2008 as the <b>new</b> <b>mayor</b> with 42.08percent of the vote; he served from May to August 2009, when he was permanently banned from holding public office after being convicted for adulterating tickets. Then, the municipal council elected Roberto Córdova as <b>new</b> <b>mayor</b> on 9 September 2009. Between 2007 and 2009, Pichilemu had seven mayors, after Jorge Vargas González {{was removed from the}} office for committing the crime of bribery; he was mayor for over 10 years, from 1996 to 2007. Vargas was succeeded by Victor Rojas, who was later accused of the same crime and eventually removed from the office too. Roberto Córdova was popularly elected mayor {{for the first time in}} 2012 with 47.9percent. The current councilors of Pichilemu are Aldo Polanco Contreras, Andrea Aranda Escudero, Marta Urzúa Púa, Mario Morales Cárceles, Felipe Bustamante Olivares, and Hugo Toro Galaz. Both the mayor and the councilors took office on 6 December 2012, and their term will expire on 6 December 2016.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a <b>new</b> <b>mayor</b> is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his administration, however, the Superior Audit Office of Mexico, the audit office of the Mexican federal government, {{discovered}} two irregularities in the city's spending and budget. On 30 September 2013, at the end of his mayoral administration, Galván was succeeded by Carlos Enrique Canturosas Villarreal of the PAN. That year, the <b>new</b> <b>mayor</b> opened an investigation against eleven former city officials alleged to be involved in the financial case. On November 8, 2016, one of the city's former financial heads, Juan Fernando Miranda Macías, was arrested for illegally using city resources. He was released from prison in two days after a judge concluded that the accusations against him were inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|It {{was soon}} {{established}} {{that some of}} the pirates were from Cabo Rojo, since they disembarked there. Undercover agents were sent to the town to track them, and <b>new</b> <b>mayor</b> Juan Font y Soler requested resources to deal with a larger group which was out of control. Links between the pirates and local sympathizers made arresting them difficult. The central government, frustrated with Cabo Rojo's inefficiency, demanded the pirates' capture and western Puerto Rico military commander José Rivas was ordered to exert pressure on local authorities. Although Cofresí was tracked to the beach in Peñones, near his brothers' homes in Guaniquilla, the operation only recovered the Johns sails, meat, flour, cheese, lard, butter and candles; the pirates escaped aboard a schooner. A detachment caught Juan José Mateu and charged him with conspiracy; his confession linked Cofresí to the two hijackings.|$|E

5|$|Citi Bike's massive, {{unexpected}} popularity caused {{problems within}} a year. In January 2014, the designer of Citi Bike's bicycles and docking stations {{filed for bankruptcy}} protection. Officials with Montreal, Quebec-based Public Bike System Company (also known as Bixi) said they were $46 million in debt, partly because the operators of Citi Bike and Chicago's Divvy bikeshare had withheld a combined $5 million in payments because of software glitches in the docking stations. Alta officials, who operate Citi Bike, Divvy, and Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C., said they anticipated no interruptions of service, though they did want $20 million to expand the system to 10,000 bikes and 600 stations. However, due to Citi Bike's various problems, expansions to the Upper East and Upper West Sides were delayed {{for at least a}} year. Its general manager resigned in March. The <b>new</b> <b>mayor,</b> Bill de Blasio, stated that he wanted to expand Citi Bike's reach, but that he could not make city funds available for such an expansion at that time.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor lands the TARDIS in Cardiff, {{using the}} energy of the Cardiff Rift to {{recharge}} the engines. Rose has Mickey bring her passport to the TARDIS, and together with the Doctor and Jack Harkness, they go to lunch. At lunch, the Doctor spots a newspaper article showing Margaret Blaine, a Slitheen, has become Cardiff's <b>new</b> <b>mayor.</b> The four track down and capture Margaret to find out what she is doing there after their previous encounter (in Aliens of London). The Doctor observes Blaine's scale model plans for a new nuclear power plant, but identifies that it is purposely flawed to cause a meltdown that would open the Cardiff Rift and destroy the Earth. He also discovers the model contains a functioning tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator that Margaret would have used to flee the Earth. The Doctor decides to take Margaret back to her home planet of Raxacoricofallapatorious, but she reveals that she has received a death sentence there and will be executed upon returning. The Doctor agrees to her final request to accompany her to a dinner meal. Margaret makes several half-hearted attempts to kill the Doctor but he easily avoids them. She then tries to play on the Doctor's sympathies, asking him to take her to another planet instead.|$|E
