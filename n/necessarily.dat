5|$|Depictions are <b>necessarily</b> conjectural, because {{petrification}} {{and other}} fossilization mechanisms do not preserve colors. Any reconstitution is thereby an artist's view that, {{in order to}} stay within the limits of the best knowledge at the time, must <b>necessarily</b> be inspired by other pictures already scientifically proved.|$|E

5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer in the set is a divisor, but not <b>necessarily</b> a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in the set. This problem {{does not seem to have}} been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not <b>necessarily</b> vice versa.|$|E
5|$|A strain {{known as}} Patch Hounds was {{developed}} by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do not <b>necessarily</b> have a patchwork marking.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't <b>necessarily</b> think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's <b>necessarily</b> thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{hierarchies}} of deities, traditional {{conceptions of}} Tao {{should not be}} confused with the Western theism. Being one with the Tao does not <b>necessarily</b> indicate a union with an eternal spirit in, for example, the Hindu sense.|$|E
5|$|Each {{position}} is evaluated as a win or loss {{in a certain}} number of moves. At the end of the retrograde analysis, positions which are not designated as wins or losses are <b>necessarily</b> draws.|$|E
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would <b>necessarily</b> be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would <b>necessarily</b> pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
5|$|In a footnote, {{the court}} {{clarified}} that the ruling did not <b>necessarily</b> apply at the collegiate level.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{despite a}} slight {{decrease}} {{in the percentage of}} high school graduates and significantly slower growth of college graduate, the average American is more educated today than ever before, having graduated from high school and likely, though not <b>necessarily,</b> attended college.|$|E
5|$|Paul Oppenheimer and Edward Zalta used an {{automated}} theorem prover—Prover9—to validate Anselm's ontological thesis. Prover9 subsequently discovered a simpler, formally valid (if not <b>necessarily</b> sound) ontological argument {{from a single}} non-logical premise.|$|E

5|$|The Indiana General Assembly {{is made up}} of two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Indiana has a {{part-time}} legislature that does not meet year-round. The General Assembly convenes on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January. During odd-numbered years the legislature meets for 61days (not <b>necessarily</b> consecutively) and must be adjourned by April 30. During even-numbered years the legislature meets for 30days (not <b>necessarily</b> consecutively) and must be adjourned by March 15. The General Assembly may not adjourn for more than three days without a resolution approving adjournment being passed in both houses.|$|E
5|$|The nominal working {{pressure}} is not <b>necessarily</b> {{the same as}} the actual {{working pressure}} used. Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10% and this is indicated by a '+' symbol. This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is not <b>necessarily</b> valid for US cylinders exported to countries with differing standards. The nominal gas content of these cylinders is based on the 10% higher pressure.|$|E

5|$|These points can {{be applied}} to the {{structure}} of The Waste Land, though there is not <b>necessarily</b> a fulfilment of these but merely a longing or discussion of them.|$|E
5|$|Three stages {{have been}} {{identified}} in the composition of the work. The first of these stages would have been based primarily on poems actually composed by Narihira, although the background details provided were not <b>necessarily</b> historical. The second saw poems added to the first layer that were not <b>necessarily</b> by Narihira, and had a higher proportion of fiction to fact. The third and final stage saw some later author adding the use of Narihira's name, and treating him as a legendary figure of the past.|$|E
5|$|Thus, by definition, if God {{exists as}} an idea in the mind but does not <b>necessarily</b> exist in reality, then we can imagine {{something}} that is greater than God.|$|E

5|$|Toll {{revenues}} from the two turnpikes US-412 uses are not <b>necessarily</b> used to maintain those highways. Under a practice known as cross-pledging, all OTA toll revenue is pledged against the sum of OTA's indebtedness, including bonds financing the state's other turnpikes.|$|E
5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele is not <b>necessarily</b> the ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it <b>necessarily</b> fitter.|$|E
5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset <b>necessarily</b> splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph <b>necessarily</b> separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} who is {{competent to}} stand trial is therefore also competent to plead guilty, waiving the full panoply of trial rights, but not <b>necessarily</b> competent enough to represent herself at trial {{in the face of}} a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of competence for pro se representation.|$|E
5|$|Airlines {{operating}} under Air Canada Express, Air New Zealand Link, Cimber A/S, Lufthansa Regional and United Express are not <b>necessarily</b> members of Star Alliance. However, flights are operated {{on behalf of}} the respective member airlines, carry their designator code and are Star Alliance flights.|$|E
5|$|Antlion larvae require loose soil, not <b>necessarily</b> {{but often}} sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected}} from the rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself.|$|E
5|$|Each cause presupposes the {{existence}} of the next cause, but the next cause does not <b>necessarily</b> pre-suppose {{the existence}} of the previous cause. A soul is able to advance on the spiritual ladder called , only when it is able to eliminate the above causes of bondage one by one.|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{specially}} bred for the joust, {{and heavier}} armour developed. However, {{this did not}} <b>necessarily</b> lead to significantly larger horses. Interpreters at the Royal Armouries, Leeds, re-created the joust, using specially bred horses and replica armour. Their horses accurately represented the medieval mount, being compactly built and not particularly tall.|$|E
5|$|Israeli writer Amos Oz {{writes in}} his {{biography}} A Tale of Love and Darkness that Winesburg, Ohio had a powerful influence on his writing, showing him that literature must not <b>necessarily</b> always be about heroes. Only after reading Anderson did he find the courage to start writing.|$|E
