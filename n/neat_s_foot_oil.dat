5000|$|The {{existing}} contract required {{that a second}} well be drilled within thirty days after the first one. A new agreement was negotiated which allowed Heywood to continue drilling beyond {{the bottom of the}} first well. If favorable conditions were found at 1,500 feet, he could proceed to an even greater depth. At 1,500 <b>feet,</b> no <b>oil</b> was discovered, and the team ran short of drill pipe. However, Heywood opted to order more drill pipe and continue to try. At 1,700 <b>feet,</b> <b>oil</b> was discovered in sugar sand. Additional drilling discovered 110 <b>feet</b> of <b>oil</b> sand. A casing was set with a gate valve, and after running a bailer the well gushed forth a four-inch stream of <b>oil</b> over 100 <b>feet</b> high. This spray of oil and sand lasted for seven hours and covered several acres of rice fields. However, the sand soon filled up the casing, and despite repeated attempts to clear it, the well was abandoned. Though the drilling failed, Heywood's work signaled the beginning of the oil boom in Louisiana. [...] Heywood thereafter owned and operated barges on the Mermentau River in southwestern Louisiana and constructed a pipeline from the oil fields to the railroad.|$|R

Two kinds of Metsuke were employed in the experiments. One of the Metsuke was to pay attention to the whole of the opponent putting the center of the view to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s chest, and the other was to pay close attention to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> Speed and sense of the throwing techniques were analyzed between the two Metsuke.

Five-point rating scales evaluated sense of the throwing techniques, which was strength and uncomfortable feeling. Participants were skillful judo players who participated in the national collegiate judo championships. The results demonstrated that two kinds of Metsuke influenced the sense and did not influence the speed of the throwing techniques in skillful judo players. Participants felt stronger and smoother throwing when they used Metsuke paying attention to the whole of the opponent than to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> The findings imply that Metsuke instruction influences skill improvement of throwing techniques...|$|R

40|$|The ankle foot {{orthotic}} (AFO) {{has been around}} for centuries. They were created to augment functionality of an ankle damaged due to injury or disease. A common reason a patient might be prescribed an AFO is a condition called foot drop. Foot drop can be caused by many conditions, but the most common reason is a stroke. Foot drop can be characterized by the inability to raise and/or lower a patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> This incapacitation of the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> leads to unnatural gaits and joint fatigue, as well as increasing the patient 2 ̆ 7 s likelihood of tripping and becoming seriously injured. Hard plastic AFOs that hold a patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> in a neutral position are the current standard for combating foot drop. These AFOs come in many different shapes and sizes, which emphasizes the wide variety in functionality of someone with foot drop. Unfortunately, the restrictive nature of the AFO can cause unnatural movements in the patient 2 ̆ 7 s foot; these unnatural tendencies are more exaggerated when walking down stairs and ramps, as the natural gait is to land toe first, the opposite of what the brace allows the patient to do. The purpose of this project is to create a sensor system for an AFO to help identify varying terrain. In the future this information can then be made to control an active AFO. Each terrain type will be first measured by a pair of simple infrared range finder, attached on the lower leg, one range finder looks ahead of the user and the other looks straight down at the ground. Models for the ground conditions can be established by representing each with Fourier series created using RANdom Sample Consensus (RANSAC). RANSAC coefficients will be scaled off the rate of data coming in and gait speed. Each model has a period term so the data can easily be scaled to match the pattern of walking regardless of pace. Gait speed will be measured using the downward facing ankle-mounted rangefinder, but with a threshold to determine when the foot is in contact with the ground. Once this initial set-up is completed, the system can take in data live and provide a prediction of the type of ground the patient is walking over, using pattern recognition techniques. The hope for this project is that if the system can accurately predict the change in ground type from, for example, level walking to walking down a ramp, an AFO could then be made to adjust itself, giving the patient a more natural gait, even when encountering adverse conditions. A byproduct of constantly using a patient 2 ̆ 7 s own gait to measure ground type is the ability to track a patient 2 ̆ 7 s changing gait over time, giving therapists a valuable new tool for tracking progress in a patient...|$|R
