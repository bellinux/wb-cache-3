The Directive {{requires}} {{the development and}} agency implementation of a mandatory, government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for Federal employees and contractors.

It is important to note the use of standard identification does <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> <b>your</b> existing law or OMB policy responsibilities; including the laws and policies governing personnel security...|$|E
