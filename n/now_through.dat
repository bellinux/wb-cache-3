His watercolours, mostly produced between 1841 and 1855, are an important record of many scenes {{in the early days}} of European settlement in New Zealand. Many of his works have been published in histories of New Zealand but his name is best known <b>now</b> <b>through</b> the Heaphy Track in the north-west corner of the South Island. He and Brunner were probably the first Europeans to walk through this area of the South Island and the Heaphy Track, though he never followed its route, is named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|The Baltic {{settlement}} {{patterns were}} being altered {{beginning in the}} 5th century by the Migration Period population shifts and the pressure from the westbound movement of the Slavic peoples. The Western Balts took over the lands left by the Wielbark culture people and reached {{the eastern part of}} the mouth of the Vistula. A major trade route connecting the southeastern Baltic areas with the Black Sea shores went <b>now</b> <b>through</b> the regions controlled by the Balts. Expansion of the Old Prussian tribes, for example the previously mentioned Galindians and Yotvingians, encompassed today's northeast Poland and the adjacent territories further north. Galindia (today's western Masuria), including the Olsztyn group, became in 6th and 7th centuries the most affluent of the Baltic people settled lands, with highly developed local craftsmanship supplementing the wealth of items brought from distant countries.|$|E
25|$|WildTeam {{is working}} with local {{communities}} and the Bangladesh Forest Department to reduce human-tiger conflict in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. For over 100 years people, tigers, and livestock have been injured and killed in the conflict; in recent decades up to 50 people, 80 livestock, and 3 tigers {{have been killed in}} a year. <b>Now,</b> <b>through</b> WildTeam's work, there is a boat-based Tiger Response team that provides first aid, transport, and body retrieval support for people being killed in the forest by tigers. WildTeam has also set up 49 volunteer Village Response Teams that are trained to save tigers that have strayed into the village areas and would be otherwise killed. These village teams are made up of over 350 volunteers, who are also now supporting anti-poaching work and conservation education/awareness activities. WildTeam also works to empower local communities to access the government funds for compensating the loss/injury of livestock and people from the conflict. To monitor the conflict and assess the effectiveness of actions, WildTeam have also set up a human-tiger conflict data collection and reporting system.|$|E

500|$|The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun met with mixed reviews upon its release. Derek Malcolm in The Guardian savaged the film, saying that [...] "the script is the limpest {{of the lot}} and... Roger Moore as 007 is the last man on earth {{to make it sound}} better than it is." [...] There was some praise from Malcolm, {{although}} it was muted, saying that [...] "Christopher Lee... makes a goodish villain and Britt Ekland a passable Mary Goodnight... Up to scratch in production values... the film is otherwise merely a potboiler. Maybe enough's enough." [...] Tom Milne, writing in The Observer, was even more caustic, writing that [...] "This series, which has been scraping the bottom of the barrel for some time, is <b>now</b> <b>through</b> the bottom... with depressing borrowings from Hong Kong kung fu movies, not to mention even more depressing echoes of the 'Carry On' smut." [...] He summed up the film by saying it was [...] "sadly lacking in wit or imagination." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{variant of}} Gaussian {{elimination}} called Gauss–Jordan elimination {{can be used}} for finding the inverse of a matrix, if it exists. [...] If A is a n by n square matrix, then one can use row reduction to compute its inverse matrix, if it exists. First, the n by n identity matrix is augmented to the right of A, forming a n by 2n [...] block matrix [...] <b>Now</b> <b>through</b> application of elementary row operations, find the reduced echelon form of this n by 2n matrix. The matrix A is invertible if and only if the left block can be reduced to the identity matrix I; in this case the right block of the final matrix is A−1. If the algorithm is unable to reduce the left block to I, then A is not invertible.|$|E
2500|$|Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase championed fellow Ohioan, 42-year-old Maj. Irvin McDowell. Although McDowell was a West Point graduate, {{his command}} {{experience}} was limited. In fact, {{he had spent}} most of his career engaged in various staff duties in the Adjutant General's Office. While stationed in Washington he had become acquainted with Chase, a former Ohio governor and senator. <b>Now,</b> <b>through</b> Chase's influence, McDowell was promoted three grades to brigadier general in the Regular Army and on 27 May was assigned command (by President Abraham Lincoln) of the Department of Northeastern Virginia, which included the military forces in and around Washington (Army of Northeastern Virginia). McDowell immediately began organizing {{what became known as the}} Army of Northeastern Virginia, 35,000 men arranged in five divisions. Under public and political pressure to begin offensive operations, McDowell was given very little time to train the newly inducted troops. Units were instructed in the maneuvering of regiments, but they received little or no training at the brigade or division level. He was reassured by President Lincoln, [...] "You are green, it is true, but they are green also; you are all green alike." [...] Against his better judgment, McDowell commenced campaigning.|$|E
2500|$|A {{creation}} {{unique to}} the United States was the double-bell euphonium, featuring a second smaller bell {{in addition to the}} main one; the player could switch bells for certain passages or even for individual notes by use of an additional valve, operated with the left hand. [...] Ostensibly, the smaller bell was intended to emulate the sound of a trombone (it was cylindrical-bore) and was possibly intended for performance situations in which trombones were not available. [...] The extent to which the difference in sound and timbre was apparent to the listener, however, is up for debate. [...] Harry Whittier of the Patrick S. Gilmore band introduced the instrument in 1888, and it was used widely in both school and service bands for several decades. [...] Harold Brasch (see [...] "List of important players" [...] below) brought the British-style compensating euphonium to the United States c. 1939, but the double-belled euphonium may have remained in common use even into the 1950s and 1960s. [...] In any case, they have become rare (they were last in Conn's advertisements in the 1940s, and King's catalog in the 1960s), and are generally unknown to younger players. [...] They are chiefly known <b>now</b> <b>through</b> their mention in the song [...] "Seventy-Six Trombones" [...] from the musical The Music Man by Meredith Willson.|$|E

2500|$|Worse men {{had been}} less detested, but Danby had none of the amiable virtues which often {{counteract}} the odium incurred by serious faults. John Evelyn, who knew him intimately, described him as [...] "a man of excellent natural parts but nothing of generosity or gratefulness". The Earl of Shaftesbury, doubtless no friendly witness, spoke of him as an inveterate liar, [...] "proud, ambitious, revengeful, false, prodigal and covetous to the highest degree", and Burnet supported his unfavourable judgment. His corruption, his submission to a tyrannical wife, his greed, his pale face and lean person, which had replaced the handsome features and comeliness of earlier days, were the subject of ridicule, from the witty sneers of Halifax to the coarse jests of the anonymous writers of innumerable lampoons. By his championship of the national policy he raised up formidable foes abroad without securing a single friend or supporter at home, and his fidelity to the national interests was <b>now,</b> <b>through</b> an act of personal spite, to be the occasion of his downfall. Kenyon describes the Danby administration by the autumn of 1678 as [...] "weak, discredited, unpopular and unsuccessful"; it required only the Popish Plot to bring it down. Danby was accused of using the insane [...] "revelations" [...] of Israel Tonge for his own advantage; but as Kenyon notes, the King gave Danby an explicit order to investigate Tonge's claims, and whatever Danby's personal views, {{he had no choice}} but to comply.|$|E
2500|$|On June 30, 1934, President Roosevelt {{announced}} that Richberg {{was taking a}} leave of absence from the NRA to become director of the newly created Industrial Emergency Committee. Roosevelt was experimenting with a number of coordinating bodies to assist in coordinating economic recovery efforts. He created an Executive Council on July 11, 1933, composed of most Cabinet heads and the leaders of most newly created economic recovery agencies [...] "to provide for the orderly presentation of business and to coordinate inter-agency problems of organization and work of the new governmental agencies". On November 17, 1933, he created a similar coordinating body called the National Emergency Council, composed of four key Cabinet secretaries and the heads of six economic recovery agencies, to coordinate and make [...] "more efficient and productive the work of the numerous field agencies of the Government established under, and for the purpose of carrying into effect" [...] the provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the Federal Emergency Relief Act. <b>Now,</b> <b>through</b> an Executive Order, Roosevelt made Richberg director of the Industrial Emergency Committee, composed of the secretaries of the Interior and Labor and the heads of the NRA and Federal Emergency Relief Administration, to [...] "make recommendations to the President ... with respect to problems of relief, public works, labor disputes and industrial recovery and to study and coordinate the handling of joint problems affecting these activities." [...] At the same time, Roosevelt put Richberg in charge of the Executive Council and the National Emergency Council, placed him over the Cabinet. His extensive power earned Richberg the sobriquet of [...] "assistant president." [...] But Richberg's role didn't last. [...] The Executive Council was merged with the National Emergency Council and the Industrial Emergency Committee was made a subcommittee of the new body in October 1934. By the end of December 1934, Richberg had resigned from his role as [...] "assistant president" [...] after political attacks from others in the administration.|$|E
