I was very high with him, mainly I think because I saw Steerforth and Grainger laughing at me--or at him--or at both of us. He said a man was not to be dictated to. I said a man was. He said a man was not to be insulted, then. I said he was right there--never under my roof, where the Lares were sacred, and the laws of hospitality paramount.

6000|$|If those {{speculative}} Maxims, whereof we discoursed in {{the foregoing}} chapter, have not an actual universal assent from all mankind, as we there proved, {{it is much}} more visible concerning PRACTICAL Principles, that they come short of an universal reception: and I think {{it will be hard to}} instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and ready an assent as, [...] "What is, is"; or to be so manifest a truth as this, that [...] "It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be." [...] Whereby it is evident that they are further removed from a title to be innate; and the doubt of their being native impressions on the mind is stronger against those moral principles than the other. Not that it brings their truth at all in question. They are equally true, though not equally evident. Those speculative maxims carry their own evidence with them: but moral principles require reasoning and discourse, and some exercise of the mind, to discover the certainty of their truth. They lie not open as natural characters engraved on the mind; which, if any such were, they must needs be visible by themselves, and by their own light be certain and known to everybody. But this is <b>no</b> <b>derogation</b> to their truth and certainty; no more than it is to the truth or certainty of the three angles of a triangle being equal to two right ones because it is not so evident as [...] "the whole is bigger than a part," [...] nor so apt to be assented to at first hearing. It may suffice that these moral rules are capable of demonstration: and therefore it is our own faults if we come not to a certain knowledge of them. But the ignorance wherein many men are of them, and the slowness of assent wherewith others receive them, are manifest proofs that they are not innate, and such as offer themselves to their view without searching.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{readers may}} wonder at {{not seeing the}} Ettrick Shepherd's poems among the list {{at the head of}} the article. It seems to us, however, that we have done right in omitting them. Doubtless, he too was awakened into song by the example of Burns; but he seems to us to owe little to his great predecessor, beyond the general {{consciousness}} that there was a virgin field of poetry in Scotch scenery, manners, and legends--a debt which Walter Scott himself probably owed to the Ayrshire peasant just as much as Hogg did. Indeed, we perhaps are right in saying, that had Burns not lived, neither Wilson, Galt, Allan Cunningham, or the crowd of lesser writers who have found material for their fancy in Scotch peculiarities, would have written, as they have. The three first names, Wilson's above all, must have been in any case distinguished; yet it is surely <b>no</b> <b>derogation</b> to some of the most exquisite rural sketches in [...] "Christopher North's Recreations," [...] to claim them as the intellectual foster-children of [...] "The Cottar's Saturday Night." [...] In this respect, certainly, the Ettrick Shepherd has a place in Burns's school, and, in our own opinion, one which has been very much overrated. But the deeper elements of Burns's mind, those which have especially endeared him to the working man, reappear very little, or not at all, in Hogg. He left his class too much below him; became too much of the mere aesthetic prodigy, and member of a literary clique; frittered away his great talents in brilliant talk and insincere Jacobite songs, and, in fine, worked no deliverance on the earth. It is sad to have to say this: but we had it forced upon us painfully enough a few days ago, when re-reading [...] "Kilmeny." [...] There may be beautiful passages in it; but it is not coherent, not natural, not honest. It is throughout an affectation of the Manichaean sentimental-sublime, which God never yet put into the heart of any brawny, long-headed, practical Borderer, and which he therefore probably put into his own head, or, as we call it, affected, for the time being; a method of poetry writing which comes forth out of nothing, and into nothing must return.|$|E
40|$|Indexation {{of credit}} to {{inflation}} (ex-post) is a unique legal practice in Iceland based on valorism theory on money vs. nominalism. Two rulings issued in 2014 by the EFTA Court try to clarify the legality and fairness of this particular price-variation clause under the European Economic Area consumer credit acquis. The study summarizes the rulings and analyses critically the interpretation provided by the court. It argues that the judgements defy the logic of non-contradiction since indexation of credit proves to be an impossible oxymoron under EU/EEA law. The results are confusing. On one hand, cost of credit and usury practices tend to fall {{outside the scope of}} European harmonisation (provided disclosure obligation of cost of credit and transparency ex-ante are respected). A fairness control is thus dependent on national and case circumstances to be assessed by domestic courts. On the other hand, European rules also impose with <b>no</b> <b>derogations</b> that the cost of indexation {{of credit to}} inflation is disclosed in a transparent way and calculated ex-ante. The paradox is there. Since indexation of credit operates ex-post on the basis of real inflation, it is impossible to disclose ex-ante in a transparent way. The findings of the study help to understand the situation of impasse in Iceland. Without a clear interpretation from the EFTA Court, the saga has continued at national level and will probably head for a second round of assessment at European level. ...|$|R

No: nor were the great grottos of Elephanta hewn out in an hour; nor did the Troglodytes dig Kentucky's Mammoth Cave in a sun; nor that of Trophonius, nor Antiparos; nor the Giant's Causeway. Nor were the subterranean arched sewers of Etruria channeled in a trice; nor the airy arched aqueducts of Nerva thrown over their values in the ides of a month. Nor was Virginia's Natural Bridge worn under in a year; nor, in geology, were the eternal Grampians upheaved in an age. And who shall count the cycles that revolved ere earth's interior sedimentary strata were crystalized into stone. Nor Peak of Piko, nor Teneriffe, were chiseled into obelisks in a decade; nor had Mount Athos been turned into Alexander's statue so soon.

And his whole mortal life brings not his immortal soul to maturity; nor will all eternity perfect him. Yea, with uttermost reverence, as to human understanding, increase of dominion seems increase of power; and day by day new planets are being added to elder-born Saturn, even as six thousand years ago our own Earth made one more in this system; so, in incident, not in essence, may the Infinite himself be not less than more infinite now, than when old Aldebaran rolled forth from his hand. And if time was, when this round Earth, which to innumerable mortals has seemed an empire never to be wholly explored; which, in its seas, concealed all the Indies over four thousand five hundred years; if time was, when this great quarry of Assyrias and Romes was not extant; then, time may have been, when the whole material universe lived its Dark Ages; yea, when the Ineffable Silence, proceeding from its unimaginable remoteness, espied it as an isle in the sea.

6000|$|The {{evidence}} {{of this is to}} be found also in his pictures, for I ought already to have mentioned that, for these many years (they are beginning to be many), he has indulged in the luxury of color. It is not probable that he regards himself in the first place as an illustrator, in the sense to which the term is usually restricted. He is a very vigorous and various painter, and at the Salon a constant and conspicuous exhibitor. He is fond of experiments, difficulties and dangers, and I divine that it would be his preference to be known best by his painting, in which he handles landscape with equal veracity. It is a pity that the critic is unable to contend with him on such a point without appearing to underestimate that work. Mr. Reinhart has so much to show for his preference that I am conscious of its taking some assurance to say that I am not sure he is right. This would be the case even if he had nothing else to show than the admirable picture entitled [...] "Washed Ashore" [...] ("Un Epave [...] ") which made such an impression in the Salon of 1887. It represents the dead body of an unknown man whom the tide has cast up, lying on his back, feet forward, disfigured, dishonored by the sea. A small group of villagers are collected near it, divided by the desire to look and the fear to see. A gendarme, official and responsible, his uniform contrasting with the mortal disrepair of the victim, takes down in his note-book the proc√®s-verbal of the incident, and an old sailor, pointing away with a stiffened arm, gives him the benefit of what he knows about the matter. Plain, pitying, fish-wives, hushed, with their shawls in their mouths, hang back, as if from a combination too solemn--the mixture of death and the law. Three or four men seem to be glad it isn't they. The thing is a masterpiece of direct representation, and has wonderfully the air of something seen, found without being looked for. Excellently composed but not artificial, deeply touching but not sentimental, large, close and sober, this important work gives the full measure of Mr. Reinhart's great talent and constitutes a kind of pledge. It may be perverse on my part to see in it the big banknote, as it were, which may be changed into a multitude of gold and silver pieces. I cannot, however, help doing so. [...] "Washed Ashore" [...] is painted as only a painter paints, but I irreverently translate it into its equivalent in [...] "illustrations"--half a hundred little examples, in black and white, of the same sort of observation. For this observation, immediate, familiar, sympathetic, human, and not involving a quest of style for which color is really indispensable, is a mistress at whose service there is <b>no</b> <b>derogation</b> in placing one's self. To do little things instead of big may be a derogation; a great deal will depend upon the way the little things are done. Besides, no work of art is absolutely little. I grow bold and even impertinent as I think of the way Mr. Rein-hart might scatter the smaller coin. At any rate, whatever proportion his work in this line may bear to the rest, it is to be hoped that nothing will prevent him from turning out more and more to play the rare faculty that produces it. His studies of American moeurs in association with Mr. Warner went so far on the right road that we would fain see him make {{all the rest of the}} journey. They made us ask straightway for more, and were full of intimations of what was behind. They showed what there is to see--what there is to guess. Let him carry the same inquiry further, let him carry it all the way. It would be serious work and would abound in reality; it would help us, as it were, to know what we are talking about. In saying this I feel how much I confirm the great claims I just made for the revival of illustration.|$|E
6000|$|Carlyle was, {{as we have}} suggested, a mystic, and mysticism {{was with}} him, as with all its genuine professors, only a transcendent form of common sense. Mysticism and common sense alike consist {{in a sense of}} the {{dominance}} of certain truths and tendencies which cannot be formally demonstrated or even formally named. Mysticism and common sense are alike appeals to realities that we all know to be real, but which have no place in argument except as postulates. Carlyle's work did consist in breaking through formul√¶, old and new, to these old and silent and ironical sanities. Philosophers might abolish kings a hundred times over, he maintained, they could not alter the fact that every man and woman does choose a king and repudiate all the pride of citizenship for the exultation of humility. If inequality of this kind was a weakness, it was a weakness bound up with the very strength of the universe. About hero worship, indeed, few critics have done the smallest justice to Carlyle. Misled by those hasty and choleric passages in which he sometimes expressed a preference for mere violence, passages which were a great deal more connected with his temperament than with his philosophy, they have finally imbibed the notion that Carlyle's theory of hero worship was a theory of terrified submission to stern and arrogant men. As a matter of fact, Carlyle is really inhumane about some questions, but he is never inhumane about hero worship. His view is not that human nature is so vulgar and silly a thing that it must be guided and driven; it is, on the contrary, that human nature is so chivalrous and fundamentally magnanimous a thing that even the meanest have it in them to love a leader more than themselves, and to prefer loyalty to rebellion. When he speaks of this trait in human nature Carlyle's tone invariably softens. We feel that for the moment he is kindled with admiration of mankind, and almost reaches the verge of Christianity. Whatever else was acid and captious about Carlyle's utterances, his hero worship was not only humane, it was almost optimistic. He admired great men primarily, and perhaps correctly, because he thought that they were more human than other men. The evil side of the influence of Carlyle and his religion of hero worship did not consist in the emotional worship of valour and success; that was a part of him, as, indeed, it is a part of all healthy children. Where Carlyle really did harm was in the fact that he, more than any modern man, is responsible for the increase of that modern habit of what is vulgarly called [...] "Going the whole hog." [...] Often in matters of passion and conquest it is a singularly hoggish hog. This remarkable modern craze for making one's philosophy, religion, politics, and temper all of a piece, of seeking in all incidents for opportunities to assert and reassert some favourite mental attitude, is a thing which existed comparatively little in other centuries. Solomon and Horace, Petrarch and Shakespeare were pessimists when they were melancholy, and optimists when they were happy. But the optimist of to-day seems obliged to prove that gout and unrequited love make him dance with joy, and the pessimist of to-day to prove that sunshine and a good supper convulse him with inconsolable anguish. Carlyle was strongly possessed with this mania for spiritual consistency. He wished to take the same view of the wars of the angels and of the paltriest riot at Donnybrook Fair. It was this species of insane logic which led him into his chief errors, never his natural enthusiasms. Let us take an example. Carlyle's defence of slavery is a thoroughly ridiculous thing, weak alike in argument and in moral instinct. The truth is, that he only took it up from the passion for applying everywhere his paradoxical defence of aristocracy. He blundered, of course, because he did not see that slavery has nothing in the world to do with aristocracy, that it is, indeed, almost its opposite. The defence which Carlyle and all its thoughtful defenders have made for aristocracy was that a few persons could more rapidly and firmly decide public affairs {{in the interests of the}} people. But slavery is not even supposed to be a government for the good of the governed. It is a possession of the governed avowedly for the good of the governors. Aristocracy uses the strong for the service of the weak; slavery uses the weak for the service of the strong. It is <b>no</b> <b>derogation</b> to man as a spiritual being, as Carlyle firmly believed he was, that he should be ruled and guided for his own good like a child--for a child who is always ruled and guided we regard as the very type of spiritual existence. But it is a derogation and an absolute contradiction to that human spirituality in which Carlyle believed that a man should be owned like a tool for someone else's good, as if he had no personal destiny in the Cosmos. We draw attention to this particular error of Carlyle's because we think that it is a curious example of the waste and unclean places into which that remarkable animal, [...] "the whole hog," [...] more than once led him.|$|E

40|$|From the introduction]. Using an institutionalist {{approach}} {{grounded in}} the comparative Europeanization literature, this study explores institutional change in the business-government relationship in the EU acceding countries from the post-communist region. Similar to the neo-pluralist (societal) approach (see Nowell, 1996), the institutionalist approach {{emphasizes the importance of}} business-state alliances in determining political and policy outcomes and the fulfillment of business strategic objectives. Unlike the neo-pluralist approach, however, which emphasizes primarily the desire of business to control the state (Gibbs, 1991; Cox, 1994; Ferguson, 1983, 1984, 1995; Ferguson and Rogers, 1986; Frieden, 1988; Abraham, 1986), the institutionalist approach counts for the goals of business, but regards these goals as significantly constrained ‚Äì defined and shaped ‚Äì by institutions. 3 Institutions have always played a vital role in the EU integrative processes, including EU accession; the European Union is a polity heavily grounded in institutions (Katzenstein, 1997). What matters most in the case of European integration are the European common law, the acquis communautaire, and the EU common policy content and procedures. As Christopher Preston observes, the requirements that EU candidate countries take on board the entire acquis communautaire with <b>no</b> permanent <b>derogations</b> allowed; and that the accession negotiations concentrate exclusively on the practical aspects of the adoption of the acquis by the applicants, stand on top of the list of principles applied in all EU enlargement rounds (Preston, 1997). These requirements consequently define EU integration and more specifically the EU enlargement process as a highly institutionalized one...|$|R
40|$|The {{parallel}} {{application of}} {{international humanitarian law}} (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL) to armed conflicts is widely accepted today. Its detailed legal consequences, which will help in understanding its practical effect and potential to enhance the protection of people affected by armed conflicts, remain to be analysed in many areas. This thesis investigates the relationship of state obligations under IHL and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), with a special emphasis on health-related issues in non-international armed conflicts. ICJ jurisprudence suggests that the simultaneous application of IHL and IHRL can be structured {{with the help of}} the lex specialis maxim. This thesis argues that the function of the lex specialis maxim is relative and highly situation-dependent. When this is recognised, the maxim - alongside other interpretative methods - promises to aid the flexible parallel application of IHL and economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights to non-international armed conflicts. Despite developments in customary IHL applicable to non-international armed conflicts, the distinction between international and non-international armed conflicts remains relevant in IHL. Likewise, questions remain regarding the threshold of application of some IHL rules. These factors will affect the parallel application of IHL and the ICESCR to non-international armed conflicts. The scope of state obligations under the ICESCR in times of armed conflict has received little attention so far. It is argued that this scope is determined by two Articles: the notion to 'take steps' towards the 'progressive realisation' of ESC rights in Article 2 (1) ICESCR, and by Article 4 ICESCR, the Covenant's general limitation clause. It is shown that the minimum core approach can be helpful in interpreting both Articles - minimum core rights should be implemented as a matter of highest priority even in times of armed conflict. It is further argued that <b>no</b> <b>derogations</b> are permitted from the right to health and other ESC rights in times of armed conflict, in particular not from their minimum cores. Building on these findings and focusing on health-related issues, the thesis analyses how a relative and context-sensitive lex specialis maxim can assist in easing substantial tensions between elements of the right to health and IHL relating to the targeting of military objectives, in particular so-called 'dual-use' objects. IHL rules on military targeting are found most likely to be given preference in situations of active combat. Nonetheless, the simultaneous application of the right to health will ensure that adverse long-term public health and other socio-economic consequences of NIACs for civilians are not ignored even when hostilities are ongoing and military-target decisions are made. It is also shown that IHL on the protection and care of the wounded and sick and the right to health complement each other well in mitigating the direct and indirect health consequences of armed conflicts, similarly supported by a context-sensitive use of lex specialis. With certain nuances, these findings apply to the relationship between IHL and ESC rights more generally. The operationalisation of this thesis' findings, and of the legal implications of the parallel application of other ESC rights and IHL, requires further efforts. It is concluded that the development of guidelines that assist practitioners in assessing the flexible relationship between IHL and the ICESCR in a given situation are the most functional option in that regard.

The defence which Carlyle and all its thoughtful defenders have made for aristocracy was that a few persons could more rapidly and firmly decide public affairs {{in the interests of the}} people. But slavery is not even supposed to be a government for the good of the governed. It is a possession of the governed avowedly for the good of the governors. Aristocracy uses the strong for the service of the weak; slavery uses the weak for the service of the strong. It is <b>no</b> <b>derogation</b> to man as a spiritual being, as Carlyle firmly believed he was, that he should be ruled and guided for his own good like a child--for a child who is always ruled and guided we regard as the very type of spiritual existence. But it is a derogation and an absolute contradiction to that human spirituality in which Carlyle believed that a man should be owned like a tool for someone else's good, as if he had no personal destiny in the Cosmos. We draw attention to this particular error of Carlyle's because we think that it is a curious example of the waste and unclean places into which that remarkable animal, 'the whole hog,' more than once led him.|$|E

In 1700 - 1 the Counsel on Trade was favourable to a liberal demand from the trading gentry, but dared not attack openly {{the limits on}} trade imposed by corporations' charters. This contradiction {{can be seen in}} the 1701 Edict, intended to liberalise wholesale trade, but which finally only abolished the "law of deroga¬¨ tion". To remove this ambiguity, the trading deputies launched another liberal campaign in 1754, which led to a text establishing a link between the ending of the derogation and complete freedom for wholesale trade. But opposition from the Six Paris Guilds prevented the Edict from being promulgated for ten years. It was finally published in 1765, with <b>no</b> reference to <b>derogation</b> whose abolition had in the mean time become the battle cry of the defenders of corporatism.

Market problems and agronomic problems that are related to obtaining sufficient quantities of adequate quality are reviewed. For successful production of organic seed and planting material intensive communication between and mutual commitment of farmers, traders, breeders and governmental organizations are necessary. Farmers together with traders should be involved in variety testing and in designing crop ideotypes by identifying the desired cultivar(s) and variety traits. Breeders can contribute by incorporating the desired organic traits in future breeding programmes. In addition, a great effort is needed to develop empirical knowledge and research-based information on adapting and improving cultural practices for organic seed production, developing resistant cultivars for healthy seed production, developing protocols for seed health testing, assessing disease threshold values, and designing organic seed treatments.

40|$| {{sustainability}} {{of the wolf}} population has been found. After the population management plan entered into effect, the wolf population for the entire country reached its peak in 2007, but has declined since then. The largest single collapse in the wolf population occurred in 2010, and the lowest population level was recorded in 2013, with a minimum population estimate of 120 individuals. This collapse in the wolf population {{has led to a}} situation whereby <b>no</b> <b>derogations</b> for population management have been granted for wolves ‚Äì instead, all population management has been carried out through derogations for damages. The criteria for granting the derogations in question {{have been found to be}} challenging, with the capacity utilisation of granted derogations remaining low. Regulations on the killing of large carnivores provided for under the Police Act are applied in situations where human safety is threatened. This in itself has led to a situation where the value of wolves as prey animals has been taken away and the species is seen almost exclusively as a pest with which it is difficult to occupy the same area. In addition to ecological sustainability, the social {{sustainability of}} the wolf population has also collapsed. Local residents feel that they have no influence over managing their livelihoods or daily routines. The presence of wolves instils a sense of fear and insecurity. Wolves are the biggest cause of damages to hunting dogs, thus making hunting more difficult throughout Finland. This is seen as a problem of social acceptability. There is a deep mistrust between the field and research and game management. These differences have made the monitoring of the wolf population more difficult, also due to a failure to report follow-up observations and difficulty in tagging. The withholding of information on wolf observations also calls into question the minimum wolf population estimates. Questioning the position and knowledge of this research has created a situation in society where there is debate over who owns the correct information on wolves. Where wolf population management is concerned, there is great pressure to take active measures and make immediate adjustments. The biggest challenge facing future wolf population management is placing the rights and responsibilities of people living within wolf territories at the forefront of objectives and actions, committing them to the regional management of the wolf population through these objectives and actions. This requires complete transparency in all population management measures, from objectives to action. There should also be a wide range of measures in place, including comprehensive and reliable population management methods, population management derogations and substantial economic incentives. IMPACT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON LARGE CARNIVORES The objectives for the population management of large carnivores are set in accordance with the terms for achieving favourable conservation status, as stated in the Habitats Directive. This regulatory standard based on ecological sustainability sets the conditions for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, within which the objectives of the Finnish national policy on large carnivores together with actions taken are applied. Consequently, large carnivore management has been imposed in a top-down manner and has inevitably been lacking in terms of place-based policy. Ecological sustainability has not been based on a population-level approach, which would allow for a wider range of management measures to be taken. Local and regional views concerning the objectives and actions of the national policy on large carnivores have not influenced decision-making as desired. The multilateral conflict that arises around large carnivores is manifested in tensions between local communities, central government, rural and urban areas, laymen and researchers. The denial of national population management objectives and, on the other hand, increasing the level of mistrust between the field and the authorities and the field and researchers have made systematic population control impossible where wolves are concerned. A similar trend seems to be evolving with regard to the wolverine. The large carnivore actions taken have been called into question by citizens. People do not support large carnivore policy actions carried out by actors they do not trust. This can be seen in a lack of trust in the methods used in determining a population based on large carnivore observations and the process for granting derogations, compensations for damage and the adoption of preventive measures. Not only is the large carnivore data produced not trusted, it is also widely felt that local and regional views on the objectives of large carnivore population management are not reaching decision-makers. At worst, this mistrust culminates in the illegal killing of large carnivores, which is supported by a broad front. Using public law control measures, it is possible to more effectively discover illegal killing incidents and their perpetrators as well as impose harsher sentences on them. However, it is of the utmost importance to understand that the application of these enhanced measures will not influence the level of public support, which feels that illegal killing is justified. If the needs of people living in large carnivore regions are not met by public administration, they will be met by illegal actions taken in the field. The current array of actions will not achieve the set performance objectives or the large carnivore policy impact objectives unless the objectives behind these actions are changed. This change in objectives is seen as a way of gaining public approval and support for large carnivore policy measures. INTERDEPENDENCY OF ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FACTORS In large carnivore policy measures, equal consideration should be given to ecological, economic and social factors both in objectives and actions, stating the interdependency of these three perspectives. Large carnivore policy risks identified in risk analysis groups, which were used in support of this evaluation, showed a clear interdependency between the actions and processes that aim to achieve ecological, economic or social sustainability. The majority of the risks could be categorised as social risks, in addition to which some ecological and economic risks were found to have originated from a social risk phenomenon or, alternatively, could have posed social risks if the situation had remained unchanged. This demonstrates the clear social nature of the risks inherent in the current large carnivore policy, nearly half of which were considered probable and serious. The existing policy risks and problems highlighted in the evaluation have been set as objectives for the future large carnivore policy. When defining this future policy, the objective of ecological sustainability should not undermine the objective of social sustainability but should, instead, take into account the issue raised in this evaluation. According to this, exceeding the limits of social tolerance will lead to the failure of systematic population management based on an ecological objective. DEVELOPING THE OWNERSHIP OF LARGE CARNIVORES The current conservative, top-down approach to decision-making must be phased out. National, regional and local objectives and actions should be synchronised with one another. The primary goal of managing large carnivore populations must be to develop the psychological ownership of large carnivores, particularly at the local and regional level, but also at the national level. The psychological ownership of large carnivores is more effectively developed in situations where ownership involves a sense of community and responsibility. In developing psychological ownership, a sense of ownership is created through practical measures involving rights and responsibilities, thus affecting attitudes. As a natural resource, large carnivores should be considered property whose management carries with it both rights and responsibilities. Concrete responsibilities must be required and rights should be given regionally and locally, taking into account the differences specific to each species. All actions taken should be entirely transparent. Developing ownership requires trust through all structures and between actors. PLACE-BASED AND PROBLEM-BASED POPULATION MANAGEMENT When giving consideration to regional population management, regional diversity must be recognised and regional factors and needs must be taken into account. Conflicts involving large carnivores are local and depend not only on the presence of carnivores, but also on other game resources, livelihoods and infrastructure as well as cultural capital and traditions. Large carnivore policy actions should be targeted precisely, directly and quickly at local needs. Regional cooperation forums with the ability to respond quickly, along with regional or territorial population management plans, are considered key factors for problem-based solutions to large carnivore conflicts. Regional actions should stem from local needs and activate and involve local and/or regional stakeholders, depending on the species of large carnivore and the reason for the conflict. It is possible to integrate public funding and joint stakeholder volunteer work in population management actions...|$|R
