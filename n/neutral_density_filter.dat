40|$|We have {{compared}} {{the performance of}} a variety of computer screen filters which are currently available in Australia. The filters tested included six <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters</b> and 10 mesh filters. The testing incorporated measurements of the filters’ effectiveness in reducing the luminance of specular and diffuse reflections, along with an analysis of the effect of the filters on screen luminance / contrast at a variety of viewing angles (from 0 degrees to 50 degrees). As groups, the <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters</b> with antireflection coatings and mesh filters performed significantly better than <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters</b> without antireflection coatings in reducing the luminance of specular reflections. The diffuse reflections, the <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters</b> with antireflection coatings performed significantly better than mesh filters in reducing the luminance of the reflections. The performance of mesh filters in reducing specular reflections was significantly positively correlated with the density of the mesh. All filter types caused reductions in screen luminance and contrast with increase in off-axis viewing angles...|$|R

50|$|A {{graduated}} <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter</b> is a <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter</b> {{with different}} attenuation at different points, typically clear in one half shading into a higher density in the other. It can be used, for example, to photograph a scene with part in deep shadow and part brightly lit, where otherwise either the shadows {{would have no}} detail or the highlights would be burnt out.|$|E

50|$|Some {{companies}} make adjustable <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters</b> by having two linear polarising layers. When {{they are at}} 90° to each other, they let almost zero light in, admitting more as the angle decreases.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{photographic}} {{filters are}} inconvenient without {{line of sight}} through the taking lens - notably, graduated <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters</b> are hard to use with a TLR, {{as there is no}} easy way to position the filter accurately.|$|R
50|$|Long {{exposures}} are {{easiest to}} accomplish in low-light conditions, but {{can be done in}} brighter light using neutral density filters or specially designed cameras. When using a dense <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter</b> your camera's auto focus {{will not be able to}} function. It is best to compose and focus without the filter. Then once you are happy with the composition, switch to manual focus and put the <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter</b> back on.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{important}} to note that even at 4.5%, (~N.D. 1.35) the light from the sun is still strong enough to burn the retina, and so an appropriate <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter</b> must still be used.|$|E
50|$|As an {{alternative}} to split graduated <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters,</b> some digital cameras offer built-in high-dynamic-range imaging (HDR) which allow the camera to capture and then combine different exposures of the same subject matter when shooting in RAW image format.|$|R

50|$|The mirror design {{does not}} utilize {{aperture}} blades, {{and thus the}} aperture of the lens is fixed at 8. Exposure may only be controlled by shutter speed, film or sensor sensitivity, or a rear-mounted <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Underexposing {{the shot}} {{can add to}} the {{illusion}} of darkness or moonlight. It is typical to underexpose by about two f-stops. A <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter</b> {{is often used to}} achieve this darkening, so that the camera aperture remains unchanged.|$|E

Singh-Ray manufactures some unique filters such as the Vari-ND a 2 to 8 stop <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter</b> and the Vari-N-Duo, a combination of the Vari-ND and a circular polarizer.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for capturing the extreme dynamic range of natural illumination environments {{that include the}} sun and sky, which has presented a challenge for traditional high dynamic range photography processes. We find that through careful selection of exposure times, aperture, and <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters</b> that this full range can be covered in seven exposures with a standard digital camera. We discuss the particular calibration issues such as lens vignetting, infrared sensitivity, and spectral transmission of <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters</b> which must be addressed. We present an adaptive exposure range adjustment technique for minimizing the number of exposures necessary. We demonstrate our results by showing time-lapse renderings of a complex scene illuminated by high-resolution, high dynamic range natural illumination environments...|$|R

He developed a set of graduated <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters</b> and had them produced by Singh-Ray, a filter manufacturer.

30|$|Micro-Raman {{spectrometer}} {{analyses were}} performed on cross sections at IRPA/KIK with a Renishaw inVia dispersive micro-Raman spectrometer equipped with a 785  nm laser.

50|$|Variable optical test attenuators {{generally}} use {{a variable}} <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter.</b> Despite relatively high cost, this arrangement has {{the advantages of}} being stable, wavelength insensitive, mode insensitive, and offering a large dynamic range. Other schemes such as LCD, variable air gap etc. have been tried over the years, but with limited success.|$|E
50|$|In digital {{photography}} {{the majority of}} filters used with film cameras have been rendered redundant by digital filters applied either in-camera or during post processing. Exceptions include the ultraviolet (UV) filter typically used to protect the front surface of the lens, the neutral density (ND) filter, the polarising filter and the infra red (IR) filter. The <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter</b> permits effects requiring wide apertures or long exposures {{to be applied to}} brightly lit scenes, while the graduated <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter</b> is useful in situations where the scene's dynamic range exceeds the capability of the sensor. Not using optical filters in front of the lens has the advantage of avoiding the reduction of image quality caused by the presence of an extra optical element in the light path and may be necessary to avoid vignetting when using wide-angle lenses.|$|E
50|$|A <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filter</b> (ND filter) is {{a filter}} of uniform density which attenuates light {{of all colors}} equally. It is used to allow a longer {{exposure}} (to create blur) or larger aperture (for selective focus) than otherwise required for correct exposure in the prevailing light conditions, without changing the tonal balance of the photograph.|$|E

50|$|Most astronomers use {{different}} kinds of filters {{in order to bring}} out the contrast of certain surface features. Simple <b>neutral</b> <b>density</b> <b>filters</b> are also common as they can cut down the amount of light reaching the eye by 60-95%, something that is helpful especially when observing a full or gibbous moon so the surface does not appear as washed out.|$|R
