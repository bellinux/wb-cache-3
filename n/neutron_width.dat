40|$|Recent {{experiments}} on s-wave neutron scattering from ^ 192, 194, 196 Pt {{found that the}} reduced <b>neutron</b> <b>width</b> distributions deviated significantly from the expected Porter-Thomas distribution (PTD). Several explanations have been proposed for this PTD violation within the statistical model of compound nucleus reactions. Here, we study the statistics of the reduced neutron widths in the reaction n+ ^ 194 Pt within a model that combines the standard statistical model of the compound nucleus with a realistic treatment of the neutron channel. We find that the reduced width distribution is well described by the PTD for a reasonable range of the neutron-nucleus coupling strength and depth of the neutron channel potential. We also find that the energy dependence of the average width {{in the presence of}} a near-threshold bound or virtual state of the neutron channel potential differs from the √(E) dependence, commonly assumed in experimental analysis, and is in excellent agreement with the analytic form proposed by H. A. Weidenmüller [1]. In these cases, the reduced <b>neutron</b> <b>width</b> distributions extracted using the √(E) dependence are significantly broader than the PTD.

40|$|Abstract – Neutron {{capture and}} {{transmission}} measurements were {{performed by the}} time-of-flight tech-nique at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute linac facility using metallic and liquid Gd samples. The liquid samples were isotopically enriched in either 155 Gd or 157 Gd. The capture measurements were made at the 25 -m flight station with a multiplicity-type capture detector, and the transmission measurements were performed at 15 - and 25 -m flight stations with 6 Li glass scintillation detectors. The multilevel R-matrix Bayesian code SAMMY was used to extract resonance parameters. Among the significant findings are the following. The <b>neutron</b> <b>width</b> of the largest resonance in Gd, at 0. 032 eV in 157 Gd, has been measured to be (9 6 1) % smaller than that given in ENDF/B-VI updated through release 8. The thermal (2200 m/s) capture cross section of 157 Gd has been measured to be 11 % smaller than that calculated from ENDF. The other major thermal resonance, at 0. 025 eV in 155 Gd, did not display a significant deviation from the thermal capture cross section given by ENDF. In the epithermal region, the analysis provided here represents the most extensive to date. Twenty-eight new resonances are proposed, and other resonances previously identified in the literature have been revisited. The assignment of resonances within regions of complicated structure incorporated the obser-vations of other researchers, particularly on the six occasions where ENDF resonances are recommended to be removed. The poor match of the ENDF parameters to the current data is significant, and substantial improvement {{to the understanding of}} gadolinium cross sections is presented, particularly above 180 eV where the ENDF resolved region for 155 Gd ends.

Time of flight experiments were carried out at 3. 0 meters with "on" times of 50 or 100 μsec. (microseconds) out of a period of 2500 μsec. The modulation of the source and detector was accurate to about 5 μsec. The absorption of thin Cd (0. 052 g/cm^ 2) shows a resolved resonance absorption with maximum at 0. 14 ev. The thick Cd (0. 45 g/cm^ 2) absorption was also examined and {{it was found that the}} absorption edge was not sharp, the transmission being 0. 5 at 0. 47 ev.

Experiments were carried out at a 12. 5 and 60 m measurement station. The total energy detection principle {{in combination with the}} pulse height weighting technique was applied using C 6 D 6 liquid scintillators as prompt gamma-ray detectors. The energy dependence of the neutron flux was measured with ionisation chambers based on the 10 B(n,alpha) reaction. The data were normalised to the isolated and saturated 238 U resonance at 6. 67 eV. Special procedures were applied to reduce bias effects due to the weighting function, normalization, dead time and background corrections, and corrections related to the sample properties. The total uncertainty due to the weighting function, normalization, neutron flux and sample characteristics is about 1. 5 %. Resonance parameters were derived from a simultaneous resonance shape analysis of the GELINA capture data and transmission data obtained previously at a 42 m and 150 m station of ORELA. The parameters of resonances below 500 eV are in good agreement with those resulting from an evaluation that was adopted in the main data libraries.

Past experiments have found a considerable difference between theoretical and experimental cross sections in some cases, especially for (??,??) reactions at low energy. Therefore, {{it is important to}} experimentally test theoretical cross section predictions at low, astrophysically relevant energies. Purpose: The aim is to measure reaction cross sections of Ag 107 (??,??) In 111 and Ag 107 (??,n) In 110 at low energies in order to extend the experimental database for astrophysical reactions involving ?? particles towards lower mass numbers. Reaction rate predictions are very sensitive to the optical model parameters and this introduces a large uncertainty into theoretical rates involving ?? particles at low energy. We have also used Hauser-Feshbach statistical model calculations to study the origin of possible discrepancies between prediction and data. Method: An activation technique has been used to measure the reaction cross sections at effective center of mass energies between 7. 79 MeV and 12. 50 MeV. Isomeric and ground state cross sections of the (??,n) reaction were determined separately. Results: The measured cross sections were found to be lower than theoretical predictions for the (??,??) reaction.

Accurate hafnium cross sections and resonance parameters are needed in order to quantify the effects of hafnium found in zirconium, a metal commonly used in reactors. The accuracy of the cross sections and the corresponding resonance parameters used in current nuclear analysis tools are rapidly becoming the limiting factor in reducing the overall uncertainty on reactor physics calculations. Experiments measuring neutron capture and transmission are routinely performed at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) LINAC using the time-of flight technique. {sup 6 }Li glass scintillation detectors were used for transmission experiments at flight path lengths of 15 and 25 m, respectively. Capture experiments were performed using a sixteen section NaI multiplicity detector at a flight path length of 25 m. These experiments utilized several thicknesses of metallic and isotope-enriched liquid Hf samples. The liquid Hf samples were designed to provide information on the {sup 176 }Hf and {sup 178 }Hf contributions to the 8 eV doublet without saturation. Data analyses were performed using the R-matrix Bayesian code SAMMY. A combined capture and transmission data analysis yielded resonance parameters for all hafnium isotopes from 0. 005 - 200 eV. Additionally, resonance integrals were calculated, along with errors for each hafnium isotope, using the NJOY and INTER codes. The isotopic resonance integrals calculated were significantly different than previous values. The {sup 176 }Hf resonance integral, based on this work, is approximately 73 % higher than the ENDF/B-VI value.

Accurate values of the maxwellian-averaged capture cross section for stellar temperatures ranging from kT= 5 to 100 keV, corresponding to different scenarios of s-process stellar nucleosynthesis, have been calculated. The distributions of partial radiative widths for s- and p-wave resonances have been derived. A correlation of 0. 64 between capture and reduced <b>neutron</b> <b>widths</b> is compatible with the presence of nonstatistical effects in the capture of sup 6 sup 0 Ni...|$|R
40|$|The <b>neutron</b> partial decay <b>width</b> of one-particle {{resonant}} {{levels that}} are the bandhead states in odd-N deformed nuclei is estimated in the formalism with a real-energy variable, using the width of one-particle resonance calculated in terms of eigenphase. It is shown {{that because of the}} presence of various (lj) components in a given one-particle resonant level of deformed nuclei, the <b>neutron</b> decay <b>width</b> can be quite different from the one obtained from assuming a spherically symmetric nuclear shape. As a numerical example, the formalism is applied to the case of the nucleus Be- 13 (4) 9, which lies outside the neutron drip line by 100 - 200 kcV. Considering that the core of the nucleus consisting of four protons and eight neutrons is most likely prolately deformed, we point out the possibility that two lowest lying levels have I-pi = 1 / 2 (+) for the N = 9 nucleus, and the higher lying one may have a <b>neutron</b> decay <b>width</b> that is much narrower than the one expected for an s(1 / 2) level at the same resonance energy. The structure of some Omega(pi) = 1 / 2 (+) one-particle resonant levels, which are smoothly connected to weakly bound one-particle levels as the potential strength becomes stronger, is also analyzed using the present formalism...|$|R
