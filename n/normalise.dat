5|$|In August 1917, while Lenin was in Finland, General Lavr Kornilov, the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, sent {{troops to}} Petrograd in what {{appeared}} to be a military coup attempt against the Provisional Government. Premier Alexander Kerensky turned to the Petrograd Soviet – including its Bolshevik members – for help, allowing the revolutionaries to organise workers as Red Guards to defend the city. The coup petered out before it reached Petrograd, but the events had allowed the Bolsheviks to return to the open political arena. Fearing a counter-revolution from right-wing forces hostile to socialism, the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries who dominated the Petrograd Soviet had been instrumental in pressurising the government to <b>normalise</b> relations with the Bolsheviks. Both the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries had lost much popular support because of their affiliation with the Provisional Government and its unpopular continuation of the war. The Bolsheviks capitalised on this, and soon the pro-Bolshevik Marxist Trotsky was elected leader of the Petrograd Soviet. In September, the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the workers' sections of both the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the decline {{experienced}} by the Soviet Union and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe, the Vietnamese Government began repairing diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries {{as part of a}} greater effort to rejuvenate Vietnam's shattered economy. Since its invasion in 1979, China had placed sustained pressure on the northern borders of Vietnam, with the province of Ha Tuyen regularly shelled by Chinese artillery. In September 1985, Chinese bombardment of Ha Tuyen reached a peak when 2,000 rounds were fired. To reduce the state of hostility along the border region, and ultimately <b>normalise</b> relations with China, the Vietnamese Government dropped all hostile references to China at the 6th National Party Congress in December 1986, and also adopted the Doi Moi policy. In August 1990, as the Cambodian Peace Plan, authored by Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, was being endorsed by the UN Security Council, both China and Vietnam moved towards accommodation.|$|E

25|$|The {{vulnerabilities}} of {{the victim}} are exploited {{with those who are}} particularly vulnerable being most often selected as targets. Traumatic bonding can occur between the abuser and victim as the result of ongoing cycles of abuse in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change and a climate of fear.

25|$|Internal {{controls}} are also necessary to <b>normalise</b> {{for differences in}} transfection efficiencies and gene expression in different cells.

During visualisation, one determines the fluorescence intensities of the BiFC complex and the internal control which, after subtracting background signal, becomes a ratio. This ratio represents the BiFC efficiency and can be compared with other ratios to determine the relative efficiencies of the formation of different complexes.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergency}} episode proved counterproductive {{in several}} respects.

Indeed, black opposition at this point started to become violent. Repression of the black majority by the white minority had helped to engender the terrorism that would haunt the country for decades. To deflate the crisis atmosphere {{of the state of}} emergency and yet preserve its sweeping powers as insurance against the future, the regime sought to <b>normalise</b> the exceptional measures, by incorporating them in statute law.

40|$|Temporal and {{distance}} parameters of 33 normal children {{were obtained from}} instrumented gait analysis prospectively over five consecutive years. The parameters were <b>normalised</b> to minimise the confounding effects of increasing height and leg length. Rank correlations were performed on <b>normalised</b> speed, <b>normalised</b> stride length, <b>normalised</b> cadence and <b>normalised</b> walk ratio across consecutive pairs of years to examine the ranking of these parameters for an individual child over time. Consistent trends of increasing rank correlation were observed in <b>normalised</b> stride length and <b>normalised</b> walk ratio suggesting that individual children were continuing to adjust these gait parameters towards their own characteristic position within the normal range. Consistent trends were not observed in the rank correlations for <b>normalised</b> speed and <b>normalised</b> cadence. These findings support the concept that individual children predominantly adjusted their cadence to effect changes in speed, while the development of stride length was dictated by other factors specific to the individual child. Rank correlation coefficients for walk ratio between consecutive years increased from the ages of 7 - 11 {{years of age and}} hence walk ratio appears be a feature of gait that matures beyond the age of 7 years.

25|$|Formal {{diplomatic}} relations between Philippines and India were established on 16 November 1949. The first Philippine envoy to India was the late Foreign Secretary Narciso Ramos. Seven years after India's independence in 1947, the Philippines and India signed a Treaty of Friendship on 11 July 1952 in Manila {{to strengthen the}} friendly relations existing between the two countries. Soon after, the Philippine Legation in New Delhi was established and then elevated to an Embassy. However, due to foreign policy differences {{as a result of}} the bipolar alliance structure of the Cold War, the development of bilateral relations was stunted. It was only in 1976 that relations started to <b>normalise</b> when Aditya Birla, one of India's successful industrialists, met with then President Ferdinand E. Marcos to explore possibilities of setting up joint ventures in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|By 1857, Americans and British were {{beginning}} to respond to rumours of gold in the Thompson River area. Almost overnight, some ten to twenty thousand men moved into the region around present-day Yale, British Columbia, sparking the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. Governor Douglas - who had no legal authority over New Caledonia – stationed a gunboat {{at the entrance of}} the Fraser River to exert such authority by collecting licences from prospectors attempting to make their way upstream. To <b>normalise</b> its jurisdiction, and undercut any HBC claims to the resource wealth of the mainland, the district was converted to a Crown colony on 2 August 1858 by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and given the name British Columbia. Douglas was offered the governorship of the new colony by the colonial secretary, Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, on condition that he sever his relationship with the HBC. Douglas accepted these conditions, and a knighthood.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{tensions}} between the two German states eased with the inauguration of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik. The Brandt government sought to <b>normalise</b> relations between West Germany and its eastern neighbours, and produced a series of treaties and agreements. Most significantly, on 21December 1972 the two German states signed a treaty recognising each other's sovereignty and supporting each other's applications for UN membership (achieved in September 1973). Reunification remained a theoretical objective for West Germany, but in practice the issue was put to one side by the West and was abandoned entirely by the East. The agreement had significant implications for the border. The two Germanies established a border commission (Grenzkommission) which met from 1973 to the mid-1980s to resolve practical problems related to the border. The normalisation of relations also led to a slight relaxation in the regulations for crossing the border legally, although the border fortifications were as rigorously maintained as ever.|$|E

40|$|A common way of {{describing}} antennas {{in the time}} domain is by means of their impulse response. When the time-domain antenna equations are {{expressed in terms of}} the <b>normalised</b> impulse response (<b>normalised</b> IR), they become very simple to use, because all frequency-dependent antenna characteristics are included in the <b>normalised</b> IF:. This paper describes a method for measuring the <b>normalised</b> IR experimentally, using a vector network analyser. The <b>normalised</b> IRs of different air and dielectric-filled TEM horn antennas are compared and discussed. The <b>normalised</b> IR is found to be a powerful tool for simulating antenna behaviour directly in the time domain. Thanks to the introduction of the virtual source, (i. e. an apparent point in the antenna from which the radiated field degrades by a factor 1 /r), the time-domain antenna equations can also be used near the TEM horns, although still in the far field of the antenna. Some examples of time-domain simulations and system modelling using the <b>normalised</b> IR are presented. In each example, the simulations are compared with measured data...|$|R

Zia moved away from India and the Soviet bloc, his predecessors' had worked with, developing closer relations with the United States and Western Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Zia also moved to harmonise ties with Saudi Arabia and the People's Republic of China, Pakistan's ally who had opposed Bangladesh's creation and had not recognised it until 1975. Zia moved to <b>normalise</b> relations with Pakistan. While distancing Bangladesh from India, Zia sought to improve ties with other Islamic nations. Zia's move towards Islamic state policies improved the nation's standing in the Middle East. Zia also proposed an organisation of the nations of South Asia to bolster economic and political co-operation at a regional level. This proposal materialised in 1985 under the Presidency of Hussain Muhammad Ershad with the first meeting of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation in Dhaka. Zia's vision has earned him a posthumous award from the organisation.|$|E

This initiated the Kargil War after India moved in thousands of troops to successfully flush out the infiltrators. Although the conflict {{did not result in}} a full-scale war between India and Pakistan, relations between the two reached all-time low which worsened even further following the involvement of Pakistan-based terrorists in the hijacking of the Indian Airlines Flight 814 in December 1999.
