25|$|In a {{p-channel}} 'depletion-mode' device, {{a positive}} voltage from gate to body creates a depletion layer by forcing the positively charged holes to the gate-insulator/semiconductor interface, leaving exposed a carrier-free region of immobile, negatively charged acceptor ions.

40|$|Abstract — StatCom {{is a type}} of {{device that}} can be used for {{controlling}} as well as reducing positive and <b>negative</b> sequence <b>voltages</b> produced in a system. It is a static synchronous generator which controls capacitive or inductive output current irrespective of the ac system voltage. The main source of arising of positive and <b>negative</b> sequence <b>voltages</b> are generation of unsymmetrical faults in a wind farm. Positive sequence voltage causes <b>voltage</b> instability and <b>negative</b> sequence <b>voltage</b> causes heavy generator torque oscillations which leads to mechanical vibration. Unbalanced voltage causes unbalanced heating in the machine winding. Therefore at first, current capability of StatCom can be controlled for removing positive sequence voltages for improving voltage stability and then remaining current is controlled for eliminating <b>negative</b> sequence <b>voltages.</b> Keywords—StatCom, windfarm, PWM technique, positive sequence <b>voltage</b> and <b>negative</b> sequence <b>voltage.</b> I...|$|R
25|$|Supporters modeled a nonthermal plasma. The {{justification}} is {{the high}} amount of scattering in the device center. Without a magnetic field, electrons scatter in this region. They claimed that this scattering leads to a monoenergetic distribution, like the one shown in Figure 6. This argument is supported by 2 dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Bussard argued that constant electron injection {{would have the same}} effect. Such a distribution would help maintain a <b>negative</b> <b>voltage</b> in the center, improving performance.|$|E
25|$|The polywell {{is a type}} {{of nuclear}} fusion reactor that uses an {{electric}} field to heat ions to fusion conditions. It is closely related to the fusor, the high beta fusion reactor, the magnetic mirror, and the biconic cusp. A set of electromagnets generates a magnetic field that traps electrons. This creates a <b>negative</b> <b>voltage,</b> which attracts positive ions. As the ions accelerate towards the negative center, their kinetic energy rises. Ions that collide at high enough energies can fuse.|$|E
25|$|Electron guns facing ring axis. These shoot {{electrons}} {{into the}} center of the ring structure. Once inside, the electrons are confined by the magnetic fields. This has been measured in polywells using Langmuir probes. Electrons that have enough energy to escape through the magnetic cusps can be re-attracted to the positive rings. They can slow down and return to the inside of the rings along the cusps. This reduces conduction losses, and improves the overall performance of the machine. The electrons act as a <b>negative</b> <b>voltage</b> drop attracting positive ions. This is a virtual cathode.|$|E
25|$|Klystrons and {{magnetrons}} often operate their anodes (called collectors in klystrons) {{at ground}} potential to facilitate cooling, particularly with water, without high-voltage insulation.

25|$|Aconitine binds to the {{receptor}} at the neurotoxin {{binding site}} 2 on the alpha-subunit {{of the channel}} protein. This binding results in a sodium-ion channel that stays open longer. Aconitine suppresses the conformational change in the sodium-ion channel from the active state to the inactive state. The membrane stays depolarized due to the constant sodium influx (which is 10-1000 fold greater than the potassium efflux). As a result, the membrane cannot be repolarized. The binding of aconitine to the channel also leads to the channel to change conformation from the inactive state to the active state at a more <b>negative</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are depletion-mode MOSFET devices, {{which are}} less {{commonly}} used {{than the standard}} enhancement-mode devices already described. These are MOSFET devices that are doped so that a channel exists even with zero voltage from gate to source. To control the channel, a <b>negative</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is applied to the}} gate (for an n-channel device), depleting the channel, which reduces the current flow through the device. In essence, the depletion-mode device is equivalent to a normally closed (on) switch, while the enhancement-mode device is equivalent to a normally open (off) switch. Due to their low noise figure in the RF region, and better gain, these devices are often preferred to bipolars in RF front-ends such as in TV sets. Depletion-mode MOSFET families include BF960 by Siemens and Telefunken, and the BF980 in the 1980s by Philips (later to become NXP Semiconductors), whose derivatives are still used in AGC and RF mixer front-ends.|$|E
25|$|When a {{negative}} gate-source voltage (positive source-gate) is applied, {{it creates a}} p-channel at {{the surface of the}} n region, analogous to the n-channel case, but with opposite polarities of charges and voltages. When a voltage less negative than the threshold value (a <b>negative</b> <b>voltage</b> for the p-channel) is applied between gate and source, the channel disappears and only a very small subthreshold current can flow between the source and the drain. The device may comprise a silicon on insulator (SOI) device in which a buried oxide (BOX) is formed below a thin semiconductor layer. If the channel region between the gate dielectric and a BOX region is very thin, the channel is referred to as an ultrathin channel (UTC) region with the source and drain regions formed on either side thereof in and/or above the thin semiconductor layer. Alternatively, the device may comprise a semiconductor on insulator (SEMOI) device in which semiconductors other than silicon are employed. Many alternative semiconductor materials may be employed. When the source and drain regions are formed above the channel in whole or in part, they are referred to as raised source/drain (RSD) regions.|$|E

50|$|When <b>negative</b> <b>voltages</b> are reached, it is {{possible}} that the cathode would begin to produce Ca (which is soluble in CaCl2). Ca is highly reductive and would further strip oxygen from the cathode, resulting in calciothermic reduction. However, Ca dissolved into CaCl2 results in a more conductive salt leading to reduced current efficiencies.|$|R
25|$|When {{conditions}} are conducive to stomatal opening (e.g., high light intensity and high humidity), a proton pump drives protons (H+) from the guard cells. This {{means that the}} cells' electrical potential becomes increasingly negative. The negative potential opens potassium voltage-gated channels and so an uptake of potassium ions (K+) occurs. To maintain this internal <b>negative</b> <b>voltage</b> so that entry of potassium ions does not stop, negative ions balance the influx of potassium. In some cases, chloride ions enter, while in other plants the organic ion malate is produced in guard cells. This increase in solute concentration lowers the water potential inside the cell, which results in the diffusion of water into the cell through osmosis. This increases the cell's volume and turgor pressure. Then, because of rings of cellulose microfibrils that prevent {{the width of the}} guard cells from swelling, and thus only allow the extra turgor pressure to elongate the guard cells, whose ends are held firmly in place by surrounding epidermal cells, the two guard cells lengthen by bowing apart from one another, creating an open pore through which gas can move.|$|E
2500|$|Early sets used a {{grid bias battery}} or [...] "C" [...] battery {{which was}} {{connected}} to provide a <b>negative</b> <b>voltage.</b> Since virtually no current flows through a tube's grid connection, these batteries had very low drain and lasted the longest. Even after AC power supplies became commonplace, some radio sets continued to be built with C batteries, as they would almost never need replacing. However more modern circuits were designed using cathode biasing, {{eliminating the need for}} a third power supply voltage; this became practical with tubes using indirect heating of the cathode.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ferroelectric}} memristor {{is based}} on a thin ferroelectric barrier sandwiched between two metallic electrodes. Switching the polarization of the ferroelectric material by applying a positive or <b>negative</b> <b>voltage</b> across the junction can lead to a two order of magnitude resistance variation: [...] (an effect called Tunnel Electro-Resistance). In general, the polarization does not switch abruptly. The reversal occurs gradually through the nucleation and growth of ferroelectric domains with opposite polarization. During this process, the resistance is neither RON or ROFF, but in between. When the voltage is cycled, the ferroelectric domain configuration evolves, allowing a fine tuning of the resistance value. The ferroelectric memristor's main advantages are that ferroelectric domain dynamics can be tuned, offering a way to engineer the memristor response, and that the resistance variations are due to purely electronic phenomena, aiding device reliability, as no deep change to the material structure is involved.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solution}} was to add another grid between the screen grid and the main anode, called the suppressor grid (since it suppressed secondary emission current toward the screen grid). This grid {{was held at the}} cathode (or [...] "ground") voltage and its <b>negative</b> <b>voltage</b> (relative to the anode) electrostatically repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode after all. This three-grid tube is called a pentode, meaning five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen and became generally favored over the simple tetrode. Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode (e.g. EL84/6BQ5) and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for user access (e.g. 803, 837). An alternative solution for power applications is the beam tetrode or [...] "beam power tube", discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|In operation, {{a current}} {{flows through the}} {{filament}} (heater)—a high resistance wire made of nichrome—and heats the cathode red hot (800–1000°C). This causes the cathode to release electrons into the vacuum, a process called thermionic emission. (Some valves use direct heating, in which a tungsten filament acts as both heater and cathode.) [...] The alternating voltage to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the concentric plate electrode. [...] When the plate has a positive voltage {{with respect to the}} cathode, it electrostatically attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate. [...] However, when the polarity is reversed and the plate has a <b>negative</b> <b>voltage,</b> no current flows, because the cathode electrons are not attracted to it. [...] The plate, being unheated, does not emit any electrons. So electrons can only flow through the tube in one direction, from the cathode to the anode plate.|$|E
2500|$|Photomultiplier tubes {{typically}} utilize 1000 to 2000 volts {{to accelerate}} electrons within {{the chain of}} dynodes. (See Figure near top of article.) The most <b>negative</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is connected to the}} cathode, and the most positive voltage is connected to the anode. Negative high-voltage supplies (with the positive terminal grounded) are often preferred, because this configuration enables the photocurrent to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage. However, with the photocathode at high voltage, leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted [...] "dark current" [...] pulses that may affect the operation. [...] Voltages are distributed to the dynodes by a resistive voltage divider, although variations such as active designs (with transistors or diodes) are possible. The divider design, which influences frequency response or rise time, can be selected to suit varying applications. Some instruments that use photomultipliers have provisions to vary the anode voltage to control the gain of the system.|$|E

Beyond a critical thickness of the film, film delamination starts to occur after its removal from the reaction chamber. In addition to the previously observed stress relief morphologies, sinusoidal cracking and sinusoidal removal of the film are also observed.

2500|$|Nearly all cell {{membranes}} in animals, plants and fungi maintain a voltage {{difference between the}} exterior and interior of the cell, called the membrane potential. [...] A typical voltage across an animal cell membrane is –70 mV; {{this means that the}} interior of the cell has a <b>negative</b> <b>voltage</b> of approximately one-fifteenth of a volt relative to the exterior. [...] In most types of cells the membrane potential usually stays fairly constant. Some types of cells, however, are electrically active in the sense that their voltages fluctuate over time. In some types of electrically active cells, including neurons and muscle cells, the voltage fluctuations frequently {{take the form of a}} rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall. [...] These up-and-down cycles are known as action potentials. In some types of neurons the entire up-and-down cycle takes place in a few thousandths of a second.

50|$|The process {{typically}} {{takes place}} between 900 and 1100 °C, with an anode (typically carbon) and a cathode (oxide being reduced) in a bath of molten CaCl2. Depending {{on the nature}} of the oxide it will exist at a particular potential relative to the anode, which is dependent on the quantity of CaO present in CaCl2. The cathode is then polarised to a more <b>negative</b> <b>voltages</b> versus the anode. This is simply achieved by imposing a voltage between the anode and cathode. When polarised to more <b>negative</b> <b>voltages</b> the oxide releases oxygen ions into the CaCl2 salt, which exists as CaO. To maintain charge neutrality, as oxygen ions are released from the cathode into the salt, so oxygen ions must be released from the salt to the anode. This is observed as CO or CO2 being evolved at the carbon anode. In theory an inert anode could be used to produce oxygen.|$|R
