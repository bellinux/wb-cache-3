5|$|Lacking firm {{movement}} {{because of}} weak steering currents, Gordon meandered <b>north-northeast</b> {{in the presence}} of mild west-southwesterly wind shear, unable to strengthen under the adverse conditions. By November 11, a trough prodded Gordon to the <b>north-northeast</b> at 8mph (13km/h), and it strengthened by 6mph (9km/h) as it moved through the central Caribbean Sea. The trough continued steering Gordon, bending it eastward towards Jamaica on the afternoon on November 12. Despite the warm waters, Gordon did not strengthen that day as strong upper-tropospheric shear hindered development, disorganized the upper level circulation, and reduced its winds to 40mph (65km/h).|$|E
5|$|The last {{storm to}} form in August {{developed}} on August30 to the northwest of Guam. It briefly moved to the <b>north-northeast</b> before maintaining a steady northwest track. The system attained typhoon status, later dissipating on September4 near Okinawa.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Irene {{strengthened}} as {{it moved}} northward, and reached maximum sustained winds of 70mph (115km/h) early on October 14. Operationally, Irene was upgraded to a hurricane on October 14, although later analysis after the hurricane season indicated it remained a tropical storm until later. Irene continued to move towards the <b>north-northeast,</b> crossed over the western portion of the Isla de la Juventud as a strong tropical storm, and hours later, it struck mainland Cuba near Batabano. The storm was able to strengthen further over the Florida Straits, and Irene attained hurricane status on October 15. It passed over Key West, turned more to the <b>north-northeast,</b> and struck mainland Florida at Cape Sable as an 80mph (130km/h) hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Convection shifted {{towards the}} eastern {{semicircle}} of the circulation, while the still-exposed center became malformed and elongated. On September14, the poorly organized cyclone crossed southeastern Louisiana, turned towards the <b>north-northeast</b> {{and made a}} second landfall close to the AlabamaMississippi border at 1500UTC that day, still at its peak strength. The storm dissipated rapidly as it proceeded inland, and the remnant low pressure area moved into Georgia and South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 2006, the Japan Meteorological Agency {{identified}} a tropical depression with 25-knot 10-minute average sustained winds about 500 kilometres (300mi) <b>north-northeast</b> of Yap, near latitude 14.0°N longitude 139.0°E. Later that day, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) {{picked up on}} the tropical depression and started issuing track forecasts for the system.|$|E
5|$|Upon exiting Columbia County, Little Catawissa Creek enters Union Township, Schuylkill County. It {{continues}} {{east and}} its valley becomes narrower and shallower. Over {{the next several}} miles, the creek turns east-northeast and its valley gets broader again. It then turns abruptly north and passes through a ridge. The creek briefly turns northeast before turning <b>north-northeast</b> after a few hundred feet. Approximately a mile downstream, it receives its first named tributary, Trexler Run. At this point, the creek turns abruptly east-northeast. After some distance, it begins meandering northeast for a few miles, receiving the tributary Stony Run. It then begins meandering east for a few miles, briefly entering North Union Township, Schuylkill County before reentering East Union Township. Shortly afterwards, the creek turns <b>north-northeast,</b> crosses into North Union Township again. A few tenths of a mile downstream, it reaches its confluence with Catawissa Creek.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} into Greene County, {{the road}} intersects NY23A at an undeveloped junction. NY32 remains in its straight course through the lowlands below the escarpment, passing through mostly woodlands and the hamlet of Kiskatom, then winding around {{the north side}} of Cairo Roundtop before it joins with NY23 at Cairo. After , NY32 leaves the divided highway to once again strike north as a two-lane route. It trends west to its westernmost point until turning to the <b>north-northeast</b> just south of Freehold.|$|E
5|$|After this, SR75 {{passes through}} the United States Naval Amphibious Base for a few miles before {{entering}} downtown Coronado. The highway becomes Orange Avenue and turns <b>north-northeast</b> as the main street through Coronado. SR75 intersects SR 282 at the one-way couplet of Third and Fourth Streets; SR282 continues west on Third Street and returns to SR75 on Fourth Street, while SR75 continues east on Fourth Street and heads west towards Orange Avenue on Third Street. The one-way couplet is brief, and SR75 becomes a divided highway before crossing the Coronado Bridge. While on the bridge, SR75 crosses into the city of San Diego again.|$|E
5|$|An eyewall {{replacement}} {{cycle and}} weakening convection {{along the northern}} side resulted in steady weakening starting on July10. Increasing wind shear prevented the system from reorganizing as it neared East China. Early on July11, the typhoon reached the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge and began turning {{to the north and}} later <b>north-northeast.</b> Chan-hom made landfall in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, or roughly 140km (80mi) south-southeast of Shanghai, around 08:40UTC. The JMA assessed the storm to have had winds of 140km/h (85mph) while the JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at 155km/h (100mph). Based on the JTWC estimate, Chan-hom was the strongest typhoon to pass within 160km (100mi) of Shanghai in at least 35years, and it was the strongest landfall in Zhejiang since recordkeeping began in 1949. Thereafter the storm accelerated <b>north-northeast</b> and moved over the cool waters of the Yellow Sea, prompting further degradation of its structure. Chan-hom weakened below typhoon-force around 18:00UTC on July11. The system's low-level center completely exposed on July12 as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Around 18:00UTC, Chan-hom moved ashore on the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea, southwest of the capital Pyongyang, with winds of 95km/h (60mph). By 00:00UTC on July13 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while retaining gale-force winds, and six hours later the system dissipated over north-central North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{depression}} turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly {{as it moved}} to the <b>north-northeast.</b> Through an interaction with the cold front early on October5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October8.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 24, Karl {{continued}} its <b>north-northeast</b> track over the open north-central Atlantic {{and continued to}} gradually weaken. It started to {{come in contact with}} the baroclinic zone and began to lose tropical characteristics, while still a Category1 hurricane. Karl became extratropical shortly afterward over the northern Atlantic at about 47°N, with its winds dropping below hurricane strength shortly thereafter. The extratropical storm made landfall on the Faroe Islands with hurricane-force wind gusts. As an extratropical low, the cyclone moved northeastward and eastward across the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, eventually reaching Norway before it was absorbed into another extratropical low late on September 28.|$|E
5|$|French and British patrol frigates each {{spotted the}} other's fleet around 9:30 am; both at first underestimated {{the size of}} the other fleet, leading each {{commander}} to believe the other fleet was the smaller fleet of Admiral de Barras. When the true size of the fleets became apparent, Graves assumed that de Grasse and Barras had already joined forces, and prepared for battle; he directed his line toward the bay's mouth, assisted by winds from the <b>north-northeast.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Manhattan, uptown means north (more {{precisely}} <b>north-northeast,</b> {{which is}} the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest). This usage {{differs from that of}} most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.|$|E
5|$|In {{southeast}} Broken Arrow, the Creek Turnpike {{crosses the}} county line into Wagoner County and swings towards the <b>north-northeast.</b> It then meets SH-51, {{followed by the}} Muskogee Turnpike (SH-351) near that highway's western terminus. The Creek Turnpike passes through {{the third and final}} barrier toll after re-entering Tulsa. From the toll plaza, the turnpike proceeds north to end at the I-44/US-412 interchange, which straddles the Wagoner–Rogers County county line. The portion of the interchange that sits in Rogers County also lies in the town of Fair Oaks. The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the Will Rogers Turnpike as eastbound I-44 merges onto the roadway.|$|E
5|$|Late on 7February, {{while still}} {{tracking}} to the east-southeast, Jasmine rapidly intensified, with wind speeds increasing to 185km/h (115mph), sustained for one minute. The cyclone developed a ragged eye stretching 40km (25mi) across. Later that day, Jasmine {{reached its peak}} intensity as it passed 280km (175mi) to the <b>north-northeast</b> of New Caledonia, with wind speeds of 215km/h (135mph), equivalent to a Category4 cyclone on both the Australian and Saffir-Simpson hurricane scales (SSHS). Throughout 8February, Jasmine began to show characteristics of an annular hurricane, maintaining a large, asymmetric eye and rather shallow convective features. In addition, multiple eyewall mesovorticies developed within the eye.|$|E
5|$|M-52 {{starts at}} the Ohio state line as Adrian Highway in Fairfield Township, Lenawee County, where it is the {{continuation}} of SR 109 into Michigan. The highway runs north to Adrian where it intersects US Highway 223 (US223) at the city border with Madison Township. As the highway crosses the city line, it is concurrently designated Business US 223 (Bus. US223) along Main Street into downtown Adrian. Bus. US223/M-52 intersects Beecher Street, which carries M-34 to the latter's eastern terminus in Adrian. After Beecher, Main Street turns <b>north-northeast</b> into the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|On August28, a {{tropical}} wave developed into {{a tropical}} depression near Cape Verde. After moving west-southwestward, it turned to the northwest, intensifying into a tropical storm on August31 and into a hurricane on September2. Passing northeast of the Lesser Antilles, Carol rapidly intensified to Category 5 intensity, reaching peak winds of 160mph (260km/h) on September3, making it the strongest hurricane of the season. It gradually weakened, bypassing Bermuda on September6 and producing high waves. Carol later turned to the <b>north-northeast,</b> brushing Cape Cod and causing boating accidents across New England. Four {{people were killed in}} the region. Fishing losses totaled around $1million (1953USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Ship reports {{indicates}} that a tropical storm developed on September8 at 1200UTC, while located about 175miles (280km) east of the Bissagos Islands, Guinea-Bissau. The storm gradually strengthened as it was heading west-northward. By late on September9, the system strengthened into a hurricane. It passed southwest of Cape Verde on the following day. The storm then intensified slowly, becoming a Category2 hurricane early on September12. Around that time, the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h). Later on September12, it re-curved north-northwestward. After turning <b>north-northeast,</b> the storm began executing a small cyclonic loop on September14.|$|E
5|$|The last {{storm of}} the 1957 season, Hurricane Nina, was an unusually late-forming system. It was first {{identified}} on November29 as {{a tropical storm}} to the southwest of Hawaii. Steadily tracking <b>north-northeast,</b> the storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, by which time it was given the name Nina. As it approached Hawaii, the National Weather Bureau issued warnings for the storm, advising residents to take precaution and possibly evacuate. However, the storm turned westward before moving over the Hawaiian Islands with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Gradual weakening took place as the storm continued to move over open waters. Nina eventually dissipated after turning south on December6.|$|E
5|$|The storm made {{landfall}} between Beaumont, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, on August 28. Two stations {{recorded surface}} pressures of 1002 mbar (hPa; (29.59 inHg)). As Debra moved <b>north-northeast</b> through Louisiana and Arkansas, the central pressure rose slightly. In south central Arkansas the residual low pressure system merged with a frontal trough on August 29; the frontal wave drifted into southern Illinois and traveled eastbound into the Ohio Valley {{for the next}} three days. Five tornadoes were reported from the system in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi shortly after Debra's landfall.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{appears to}} be part of a north-south {{trending}} group of rhyolitic, silicic Quaternary volcanoes (including Puelche Volcanic Field, Laguna del Maule, and Volcán Domuyo) that veers off the <b>north-northeast</b> direction of the rest of the Andes. The directional formation of this belt corresponds to the fold-and-thrust movement of the nearby Malargüe fault, which formed in the Tertiary and remained active until the early Pliocene or late Miocene. This may suggest that Calabozos' activity is more dependent on local processes than subduction of the Nazca Plate.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Amy {{originated}} from a weak trough on June24 accompanied by scattered showers and thunderstorms over Florida. The system tracked westward {{in response to}} an upper-tropospheric low over Georgia. By June26, a surface circulation developed north of the Bahamas and satellite imagery showed a significant increase in convective activity and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression early on June27. On June28, the system attained tropical storm-status while tracking <b>north-northeast</b> off the coast of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Higos was {{considered}} the third strongest typhoon to affect Tokyo since World War II. The 21st named storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, Higos developed on September25 east of the Northern Marianas Islands. It tracked west-northwestward for its first few days, steadily intensifying into a powerful typhoon by September29. Higos subsequently weakened {{and turned to the}} <b>north-northeast</b> toward Japan, making landfall in that country's Kanagawa Prefecture on October1. It weakened while crossing Honshu, and shortly after striking Hokkaidō, Higos became extratropical on October2. The remnants passed over Sakhalin and dissipated on October4.|$|E
5|$|A {{deepening}} trough {{over the}} eastern United States was forecast {{to turn the}} storm toward the north on August16. This turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated. The storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced {{from the center of}} circulation; however, upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the Gulf Stream. Later that day, Bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719UTC, following this reading, the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly after, the hurricane began to turn towards the <b>north-northeast</b> in response to a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic and the trough over the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} in {{the middle}} of September affected some of the same areas along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico as the August hurricane. It was first detected on the evening of September 10 in the southeastern Gulf, although its track may be far off from the actual storms movement {{due to a lack of}} available information. Its first data point in the hurricane database lists it as possessing sustained winds of , placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm followed a broad northward curve through the central Gulf of Mexico, making landfall along the Mississippi River Delta of Louisiana on the night of September 14. It continued toward the <b>north-northeast,</b> dissipating on September 16.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward offshore {{the coast}} of Africa. The wave traveled across the Atlantic, and organized into a tropical depression off the northern coast of Haiti on September 13. The depression turned north and strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. Hurricane Debby moved <b>north-northeast,</b> brushing Bermuda with tropical storm-force winds. It continued strengthening as it moved north, peaking at 135 miles per hour as a powerful category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Debby was the only known hurricane on record to reach category 4 north of 38°N latitude, at 38.8° North. Debby was also the second northernmost known Category 4 hurricane Atlantic hurricane, behind Hurricane Ella of 1978. Tropical storm-force winds were also recorded at Cape Race in Newfoundland when Debby passed on September 18. The storm accelerated and began weakening over the colder waters of the north Atlantic. Debby merged with a strong non-tropical system over the British Isles on September 20.|$|E
5|$|After DE 9A, DE 9 enters Wilmington {{and heads}} through urban areas as an {{undivided}} road, crossing Norfolk Southern's Shellpot Secondary before intersecting the northbound direction of US 13. At this point, DE 9 splits into a one-way pair with the northbound direction becoming concurrent with northbound US 13 on one-way New Castle Avenue and the southbound direction following southbound US 13 on South Heald Street, briefly turning east along with northbound US 13 on D Street {{at the south}} end of the one-way pair. The one-way pair, which carries two lanes in each direction, passes rowhomes and businesses, with New Castle Avenue merging onto South Heald Street. Here, US 13/DE 9 continue <b>north-northeast</b> on four-lane undivided South Heald Street, coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of DE 9A.|$|E
5|$|After being named, Gamede quickly intensified, and the JTWC {{classified}} it with {{winds of}} 120km/h (75mph) early on February 22. As it turned west-southwestward, an eye feature became evident on satellite imagery, and the JTWC upgraded Gamede to tropical cyclone status, or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane. Subsequently, its intensification rate slowed somewhat, due to restricted outflow. At 0000UTC on February 23 the MFR upgraded the storm to Tropical Cyclone Gamede, and shortly thereafter it passed over St. Brandon island. Subsequently, outflow became better established, and the JTWC unofficially estimated the cyclone attained winds of 185km/h (115mph) late on February 23 about 250km (400mi) <b>north-northeast</b> of Mauritius island. Initially it was forecast to strengthen further, though slight weakening occurred when a nearby upper-level trough restricted outflow.|$|E
5|$|After moving ashore, {{the storm}} quickly {{weakened}} into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula. Late on July19, it emerged into the Bay of Campeche. It {{turned to the}} northwest due to a ridge moving eastward, and the system re-intensified into a tropical storm on July 21. At around 0800 UTC on July 23, the storm moved ashore on Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas with winds of about 45 mph (75 km/h). The storm again weakened to a tropical depression shortly after landfall, before turning {{to the north and}} <b>north-northeast.</b> On July 24, the cyclone began interacting with a cold front, and became extratropical. It tracked slowly eastward across eastern Texas and northern Louisiana due to a high pressure area to the north. It later moved along the Mississippi River, and early on July 27, the front absorbed the depression along the border of Arkansas and Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|At landfall, a trough was {{accelerating}} Nora northwards, {{causing it}} to reach a forward speed of 30 mph (50 km/h). Late on September 25 (UTC), still a tropical storm, it entered the continental United States at the California-Arizona state line. Nora began to weaken rapidly, and was downgraded to a tropical depression three hours later, while located between Blythe and Needles, California. Nora reached Arizona while still tropical, becoming the third known system to do so. Nora degenerated over land, and the low-level center moved towards the <b>north-northeast.</b> A remnant circulation aloft persisted, however, and was likely responsible {{for a period of}} near hurricane-force winds observed at the NWS Cedar City, Utah Doppler weather radar. The remnants gradually became more diffuse over the following two days while moving generally northeastward, through portions of Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|At this crossing, US 22 heads <b>north-northeast</b> into Scotch Plains, Union County, {{coming to}} an {{interchange}} with CR 655. The route continues northeast as a four- to five-lane highway, passing near Bowcraft Amusement Park. The road continues east through Mountainside, turning northeast before entering Springfield, where it has an interchange with CR 509 Spur (signed as CR 577). Past this interchange, for 1.8 miles US 22 has an unusual wide median that contains commercial businesses and numerous U-turn ramps. In this area, the road comes to a level crossing with the abandoned Rahway Valley Railroad. It crosses the Rahway River into Union, where the wide median continues. The route briefly forms the northern border of Kenilworth before the median narrows back into a Jersey barrier. US 22 splits into two carriageways at the intersection with exits 140 and 140A of the Garden State Parkway and Route 82, site of the Union Watersphere.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with DE 1 {{just south of}} the toll road terminus {{at the south end of}} Dover Air Force Base near Dover in Kent County. Past DE 1, the route heads <b>north-northeast</b> on two-lane undivided Bayside Drive. DE 9 soon reaches an intersection with Kitts Hummock Road, which leads east to the John Dickinson Plantation, which is part of First State National Historical Park, and the community of Kitts Hummock on the Delaware Bay. Following this, the route passes between the runways of Dover Air Force Base to the west and fields to the east. Along this stretch, an access road leads west to the Air Mobility Command Museum on the base grounds. After the air base, the road continues north through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes to the west of the Little Creek Wildlife Area.|$|E
5|$|Due to New Mexico's {{position}} in the southwestern United States, there are three primary causes for flooding within {{the state in the}} autumn months: the effects of tropical cyclones, the North American Monsoon, or an approaching cold front. Tropical cyclones and they're from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans affect the state, usually in southern New Mexico. Storms that originate from the Atlantic Ocean usually move through the Gulf of Mexico on a northwest trajectory, typically during the month of September. Tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific usually maintain a fast <b>north-northeast</b> track, occasionally through the Gulf of California, and generally affect the state from the middle of September to the middle of October. The accompanying moisture of the Pacific storms encounter the mountains of the state, and through orographic lift, produce heavy rainfall. Due to the storms' fast movement, the rainfall events accompanying Pacific storms are generally shorter lasting and more concentrated than other such storms in the state.|$|E
5|$|Due to the storm's {{proximity}} to Typhoon Joan, forecast models anticipated Ivan to re-curve {{before reaching the}} Philippines; however, the storm maintained its track and {{did not take the}} northward turn until impacting the country. The typhoon began to slow and weaken, and on October20, its center made landfall in extreme northern Luzon with winds of 220km/h (140mph). After emerging into the Luzon Strait, Ivan turned to the <b>north-northeast</b> and weakened to a tropical storm. On October22, the storm briefly re-attained typhoon status before accelerating in forward speed. The system steadily weakened and the JTWC issued their final advisory on the storm on October24. The JMA continued to monitor Ivan as a tropical cyclone for another day before classifying it as extratropical. The remnants of the powerful typhoon eventually dissipated on October26.|$|E
5|$|Early on August3, Colin's {{forward motion}} increased, and the cyclone {{was unable to}} {{maintain}} a closed circulation. The tropical storm degenerated into a trough at 1800UTC, although tropical storm-force winds persisted. As the remnants passed north of the northern Leeward Islands, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system on August4, but no closed circulation was found. As the remnants approached a weakness in the subtropical ridge across the western Atlantic on August5, its forward speed gradually slowed as well. A combination of microwave and satellite imagery during the morning hours of August5 revealed the reformation of a closed low, and Colin's remnants regained tropical storm status at this time while located 280mi (450km) <b>north-northeast</b> of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|From here, {{the route}} becomes a two-lane {{undivided}} road that continues northeast through {{a mix of}} woods and farms with some development, passing under the abandoned Lackawanna Cut-Off. After passing through the community of Hainesburg, the road turns more {{to the east and}} enters Blairstown Township. Route 94 turns northeast before reaching the community of Blairstown, where the road continues east past some development before intersecting CR 521. It forms a short wrong-way concurrency with that route, along which it crosses the Paulins Kill. A short distance later, Route 94 enters Frelinghuysen Township, passing through more rural surroundings. The road turns northeast through the community of Marksboro before heading east again. After the intersection with CR 661, Route 94 makes a sharp turn to the <b>north-northeast.</b>|$|E
