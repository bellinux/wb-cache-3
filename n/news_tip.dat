5000|$|Donahue was {{encouraged}} in his investigations by Ralph Reppert, {{a reporter for}} the Baltimore Sun. In 1977, Reppert published Donahue's theory in two articles, which appeared on Sunday, May 1, and the following Sunday, with the second article accompanied by an editorial. These two men were keen to collaborate on a book on the subject, but this was cut short by Reppert's ill health and subsequent death. Donahue later also approached author John Davis in the hope that a book would still be written. The original copyright of Mortal Error read [...] "Copyright 1992 Bonar Menninger and Howard Donahue" [...] but some later editions did not mention Donahue's copyright. The Acknowledgements section (dated January 21, 1992) begins [...] "Special thanks to Nick Beltrante for a great <b>news</b> <b>tip,</b> the late Ralph Reppert for showing the way, Howard and Katie Donahue for casting their lot with me...".|$|E

Turner said: [...] "Not sure what's going on over at Amazon... All I {{can think of is}} that there were alternate versions of the art and track sequence/track titles {{when we were in the}} developmental stages of the album and that's confusing things. I sent them around to Profound Lore and the band members and the Japanese label... sooo??? Also since there are 3 labels involved in putting out the record (SIGE, Profound Lore, Daymare) maybe that's fucking things up? I'll ask Lore's Chris Bruni if he can straighten that out. Thanks for bringing this to our attention!" ...|$|E
