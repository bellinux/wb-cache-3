40|$|PURPOSE Imaging {{may produce}} {{unexpected}} or incidental findings with consequences for patients and ordering of future investigations. Chest radiography {{in patients with}} acute cough {{is among the most}} common reasons for imaging in primary care, but data on associated incidental findings are lacking. We set out to describe the type and prevalence of incidental chest radiography findings in primary care patients with acute cough. METHODS We report on data from a cross-sectional study in 16 European primary care networks on 3, 105 patients with acute cough, all of whom were undergoing chest radiography as part of a research study workup. Apart from assessment for specified signs of pneumonia and acute bronchitis, local radiologists were asked to evaluate any additional finding on the radiographs. For the 2, 823 participants with good-quality chest radiographs, these findings were categorized according to clinical relevance based on previous research evidence and analyzed for type and prevalence by <b>network,</b> <b>sex,</b> age, and smoking status. RESULTS Incidental findings were reported in 19 % of all participants, and ranged from 0 % to 25 % by primary care network, with the network being an independent contributor (P <. 001). Of all participants 3 % had clinically relevant incidental findings. Suspected nodules and shadows were reported in 1. 8 %. Incidental findings were more common is older participants and smokers (P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS Clinically relevant incidental findings on chest radiographs in primary care adult patients with acute cough are uncommon, and prevalence varies by setting...|$|E

40|$|Rates of preterm birth vary between {{different}} populations and ethnic groups. Epidemiologic {{studies have suggested}} that the incidence of preterm birth is also higher in pregnancies carrying a male fetus; the male:female difference is greater in earlier preterm pregnancy. Placental or chorion trophoblast cells from pregnancies with a male fetus produced more pro-inflammatory TNFα in response to LPS stimulation and less anti-inflammatory IL- 10 and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) than cells from pregnancies with a female fetus, more prostaglandin synthase (PTGS- 2) and less prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH). These results suggest that {{in the presence of a}} male fetus the trophoblast has the potential to generate a more pro-inflammatory environment. Maturation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and expression of placental genes, particularly 11 β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase- 2 are also expressed in a sex dependent manner, consistent with the sex-biasing influences on gene <b>networks.</b> <b>Sex</b> differences in these activities may affect clinical outcomes of pre- and post-dates pregnancies and fetal/newborn wellbeing.
