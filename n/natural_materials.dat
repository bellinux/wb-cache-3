Approach: The instrument consisted of the observation form, interview form, focus group discussion and workshop record form. The sample consisted of the persons involved in the pigments usage from <b>natural</b> <b>material</b> for painting work including the academic persons, painters, local scholars, monks and general persons. Data were concluded based on objective and categorized into groups based on research objectives. Data were investigated by Triangulation Technique and analyzed. The findings were presented by analytic description. Results: (1) Historical background of pigments from <b>natural</b> <b>material</b> in Esaan painting, found in 3 periods including pre-historical period, historical period and contemporary period, with loosed relationship regarding to material and technique. In pre-historical period, the pigments were used in painting the cave art or pattern color writing on pottery. The popular color was red called Red Ochre for transferring peoples belief ritual, lifestyle and decoration. For historical period, pigments were used as written Buddha offerings by writing on Buddhism buildings as well as adding instruction of Dharma principles, developing pleasure and showing beauty. The local pigments from <b>natural</b> <b>material</b> obtaining from plant, animal and mineral mixing with chemical substance importing from China, would be used. For contemporary period, the pigments from <b>natural</b> <b>material</b> for showing traditional uniqueness for the added value. (2) Current situation, the colored painting was decayed as the time went by. The material used to be used still existed in locality. The problem was there were no research studies of material or usage of material in developing the added value in any aspect. (3) Development of pigments from <b>natural</b> <b>material</b> for painting work, started from the selection of quality pigment powder with appropriate attribute, developing the material to produce the equipment for producing as well as modern chemical substance to be mixed with, {{the same as that}} used to be used in industrial for producing the enamel substance in present time. Conclusion/Recommendations: For the factors of success in developing pigment from <b>natural</b> <b>material</b> for painting work usage. They were based on development of material and local technique to process depending on modern technology and improvement for better products in future...|$|R

5|$|Roddenberry firmly {{believed}} that throwaway clothes were {{the future of}} the industry, and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of The Motion Picture. William Ware Theiss, the designer who created the original television series costumes, was too busy to work on the film. Instead Robert Fletcher, considered one of American theater's most successful costume and scenic designers, was selected to design the new uniforms, suits, and robes for the production. Fletcher eschewed man-made synthetics for <b>natural</b> <b>materials,</b> finding that these fabrics sewed better and lasted longer. As times had changed, the Starfleet uniforms, with their bright reds, blues, greens, and golds, had to be revised: the miniskirts worn by females in the original series would now be considered sexist. Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish, and Fletcher {{believed that}} the brightness of these old designs would work against believability when seen on the wide screen—the designer's first task was to create new, less conspicuous uniforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the restored churches seen today falls in the period between 1745 and 1770 and {{is characterized by the}} use of locally available <b>natural</b> <b>materials</b> like wood, used in the carved columns, pulpits and sets of drawers. Artistic adornments were added even after the Jesuits’ expulsion in 1767, until around 1830. Some of the altars are covered in gold. Often the walls of the mission churches were made of adobe, the same material that had been used for the houses of the natives. In San Rafael de Velasco and San Miguel de Velasco, mica also was used on the walls, giving them an iridescent effect. The {{construction of}} the church in San José de Chiquitos is an exception: inspired by an unknown baroque model, it has a stone façade. The only other example where stone was used on a grand scale is in the construction of San Juan Bautista, although only the ruins of a tower remain.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Malay {{music and}} {{performing}} arts appear to have originated in the Kelantan-Pattani region with influences from India, China, Thailand and Indonesia.

Drums and other traditional percussion instruments and are often made from <b>natural</b> <b>materials.</b> Music is traditionally used for storytelling, celebrating life-cycle events, and occasions such as a harvest. It was once used as a form of long-distance communication. In East Malaysia, gong-based musical ensembles such as agung and kulintang are commonly used in ceremonies such as funerals and weddings. These ensembles are also common in neighbouring regions such as in Mindanao in the Philippines, Kalimantan in Indonesia, and Brunei.|$|E

5|$|Amulets and idols {{fashioned}} from assorted <b>natural</b> <b>materials</b> have occupied an important place among many ethnic groups of Madagascar for centuries. Ody, personal amulets believed to protect or allocate powers to the wearer, were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. The name sampy {{was given to}} those amulets that, while physically indistinguishable from ody, were distinct in that their powers extended over an entire community. The sampy were often personifiedcomplete with a distinct personalityand offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo amassed twelve of the most reputed and powerful sampy from neighboring communities. He furthermore transformed {{the nature of the}} relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the leader's sovereignty and the integrity of the state which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampytwelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmologyand transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} as art director, Yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to {{creating}} artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded. While the game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic, {{it was meant to}} be realistic and encourage exploration. At the beginning of development, the team created a detailed profile of Hydaelyn, including its relation with other planets, ecosystems, climate, and geography. This was done to promote a sense of realism. Alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players, careful work was put into the topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive. After the environment was created, the architectural, cultural and religious elements of the world were incorporated into the environment. City and machine designs mixed metallic and <b>natural</b> <b>materials</b> to create a combined sense of wonder and familiarity for players. The game's five playable races were directly based on the five initial races from Final Fantasy XI, with design adjustments to reflect the new setting. The developers also created two different tribes, as opposed to the single tribe set-up present in XI. Characters' movements were primarily developed using motion capture, though the recorded movements were then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive. Much work was invested in creating emotes, character movements chosen by the player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in XI. To create realistic expressions, a character artist manually adjusted the faces for each expression. For the monsters, advances in hardware enabled the team to create more realistic and detailed character models, including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles.|$|E
