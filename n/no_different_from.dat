5|$|Images which play {{over the}} credits show SpongeBob wearing a large hat bearing the title 'manager', {{performing}} menial {{tasks such as}} sweeping the chimney and taking out the garbage which are <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> his old job.|$|E
5|$|In {{assisted}} reproductive technology, sperm washing is {{not necessary}} for males with hepatitis B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with hepatitis B, the risk of transmission from mother to child with IVF is <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the risk in spontaneous conception.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of other tooth-based taxa.|$|E
50|$|As {{they did}} in the Philippine provinces of Northern Luzon and Mindanao, they quickly gained {{importance}} in the areas where they settled. Thus, the state of Hawaii became <b>no</b> less <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Philippines in terms of percentage of Ilocano speakers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA nonassociative algebra B over a field K {{is called}} H-simple for a {{subgroup}} H {{of the group}} of automorphisms of B if B 2 ≠ { 0 } and if B has no H-invariant ideals except { 0 } and B. It is proved that every H-simple, finite-dimensional B is a direct sum of simple ideals which are conjugate under H. This implies that every H-simple, finite-dimensional B is simple if H has <b>no</b> normal subgroup <b>different</b> <b>from</b> H and of finite index in H or if H has <b>no</b> subgroup <b>different</b> <b>from</b> H whose index in H is a divisor of the dimension of B over K...|$|R
5000|$|Sino-Vietnamese (Vietnamese: từ Hán Việt 詞漢越 [...] "Sino-Vietnamese words") {{is a term}} {{which is}} used by modern {{scholars}} in relation to Vietnam's Chinese-language texts to emphasise local characteristics and particularly the phonology of the Chinese written in Vietnam, though in regard to syntax and vocabulary this Sino-Vietnamese was <b>no</b> more <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Chinese used in Beijing than medieval English Latin was <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Latin of Rome.|$|R
5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we cannot speak about God, and {{proposed}} that this view is <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In Brood War, the Dominion is {{invaded by}} the United Earth Directorate and Mengsk {{narrowly}} escapes capture with the reluctant help of Raynor. Faced with execution {{and the destruction}} of the Dominion as alternatives, Mengsk allies with Kerrigan and Raynor to defeat the UED, but Kerrigan eventually betrays their alliance and delivers a crippling blow to Mengsk's forces. Nevertheless, Mengsk rebuilds and the Dominion remains the dominant Terran power. In Frontline, many of the stories in the anthology paint Mengsk and the Dominion overall as tyrannical and corrupt, <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|R.I.P. 35E {{and other}} citizens' groups {{continued}} to oppose a direct connection, {{arguing that it}} would be <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> a typical freeway, since drivers {{would be more likely to}} exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route390 (I-35E) to use Route382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983.|$|E
60|$|Chauvelin was in <b>no</b> way <b>different</b> <b>from</b> his colleagues; {{the crimes}} {{in which he}} had had no hand he had condoned by {{continuing}} to serve the Government that had committed them, and his ferocity in the present case was increased a thousandfold by his personal hatred for the man who had so often fooled and baffled him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will convey your Majesty's answer," [...] {{said the}} ambassador, [...] "to my most gracious master; yet, let me say, that, {{as it is}} in <b>no</b> degree <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the evasive replies which have already been {{returned}} to his just complaints, I cannot hope that it will afford the means of re-establishing peace and friendship betwixt France and Burgundy." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{happened}} to me has been in <b>no</b> wise <b>different</b> <b>from</b> what has {{happened to}} the socialist movement as a whole in the United States. In the bourgeois mind socialism has changed from a terrible disease to a youthful vagary, and later on had its thunder stolen by the two old parties,--socialism, like a meek and thrifty workingman, being exploited became respectable.|$|R
5|$|The actors {{began working}} on the game in 2010. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they considered their performances were <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted so {{that it did not}} allow the actors to ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with approval from the directors.|$|E
5|$|Wallace visits Menado on the {{northeast}} coast of Celebes. The people of the Minahasa region are fair-skinned, unlike {{anywhere else in the}} archipelago. He stays high in the mountains by the coffee plantations, and is often cold, but finds that the animals are <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those lower down. The forest was full of orchids, bromeliads, clubmosses and mosses. He experiences an earthquake, but the low timber-framed houses survive with little damage. He finds that the people, under the guidance of missionaries, are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilised of the whole archipelago. He obtains (apparently by purchase) skulls of the babirusa (pig-deer) and the rare sapiutan (midget buffalo).|$|E
5|$|Homophile organizations—as {{homosexual}} {{groups were}} called—grew {{in number and}} spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington, D.C. He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health professionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal. In 1965, Kameny, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, organized a picket of the White House and other government buildings to protest employment discrimination. The pickets shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB. At the same time, demonstrations in the Civil Rights Movement and opposition to the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces.|$|E
25|$|All processes—chemical, biological, {{measuring}} apparatus functioning, human perception involving {{the eye and}} brain, the communication of force—are constrained by the speed of light. There is clock functioning at every level, dependent on light speed and the inherent delay at even the atomic level. Biological aging, therefore, is in <b>no</b> way <b>different</b> <b>from</b> clock time-keeping. This means that biological aging would be slowed {{in the same manner}} as a clock.|$|R
60|$|She {{smiled with}} {{pleasure}} at the undoubted admiration in his tone. In {{the new and}} fashionable clothes which she had purchased {{during the last few}} days, the artistically coiffured hair, the smart hat and carefully-thought-out details of her toilette, she was a transformed being, in <b>no</b> way <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the half a dozen other young ladies who were gathered with their escorts at the further end of the room.|$|R
40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} is {{a dynamic}} filamentous structure composed of at least actin and microtubule networks. Actin and microtubules are <b>no</b> <b>different</b> structurally <b>from</b> their animal and fungal counterparts. However, the strategies of cell differentiation and development in plants require this network to respond appropriately to plant-specific developmental cues and to environmental factors. This book views the cytoskeleton <b>from</b> <b>different</b> perspectives but, on the whole, as a network composed of structural and regulatory proteins controlled by internal and external stimuli that result in different aspects of cell differentiatio...|$|R
5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation was <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E
5|$|The last {{king of the}} Roman Kingdom, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, {{was overthrown}} in 509 BC {{by a group of}} noblemen led by Lucius Junius Brutus. Tarquin made a number of {{attempts}} to retake the throne, including the Tarquinian conspiracy, the war with Veii and Tarquinii and finally the war between Rome and Clusium, all of which failed to achieve Tarquin's objectives. The most important constitutional change during the transition from kingdom to republic involved a new form of chief magistrate. Before the revolution, a king would be elected by the senators for a life term. Now, two consuls were elected by the citizens for an annual term. Each consul would check his colleague, and their limited term in office would open them up to prosecution if they abused the powers of their office. Consular political powers, when exercised conjointly with a consular colleague, were <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of the old king.|$|E
5|$|The species {{pertaining}} to Deinosuchus since {{the resurrection of}} the generic name in 1979 have been traditionally recognized as D. rugosus from {{the eastern side of the}} Western Interior Seaway and the larger D. riograndensis from the western side, characterized by differences of the shape of their osteoderms and teeth, this view was not always favored by all researchers and in 2002 it was proposed that there was only one species, Deinosuchus rugosus, with the differences found between the two species explained as the result of the larger size of the western morph. This proposal faced support and criticism and was dropped in 2010 when new fossils of specimens from both sides of the interior seaway showed that the differences between the two morphs were not just size related, teeth from large eastern specimens retained the common characteristics of other specimens of the region and osteoderms from small specimens of the western morph were <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of large ones, supporting the specific separation of the two morphs, now formalized as D. rugosus and D. riograndensis.|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases are}} {{described}} in which, after successful removal of a cerebellar haemangioblastoma followed by several years of freedom from symptoms, there developed a progressive spinal cord compression, leading to death. At necropsy the spinal cords in both cases and the brainstem in one case, were irregularly plastered with haemangioblastoma. Although {{there was no doubt}} that malignant spread had occurred from one or more primary tumours, the histology of the tumour tissue was in <b>no</b> way <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of conventional haemangioblastoma...|$|R
60|$|By mid-afternoon Victor went mad with drink, {{and wanted}} to fight {{everybody}} and everything. I have since seen lunatics in the violent wards of asylums that seemed to behave in <b>no</b> wise <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Victor's way, save that perhaps he was more violent. Axel and I interfered as peacemakers, were roughed and jostled in the mix-ups, and finally, with infinite precaution and intoxicated cunning, succeeded in inveigling our chum down to the boat and in rowing him aboard our schooner.|$|R
500|$|The {{similarities}} between [...] Archaeopteryx, known dinosaurs and extant birds were examined and emphasized, with Thomas Huxley championing {{the idea that}} Archaeopteryx as well as modern birds had {{more in common with}} theropod dinosaurs than any other group of animals. This was at the time in opposition to the view of anatomist Sir Richard Owen of the British Museum, who viewed Archaeopteryx as <b>no</b> <b>different</b> taxonomically <b>from</b> modern birds. Huxley's work was controversial, and this climate of uncertainty and contention about bird origins persisted well into the beginning of the 20th century.|$|R
5|$|To the observatory's {{disappointment}} and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it {{appeared as a}} point, <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets, they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about as dark as asphalt and {{similar to that of}} Mercury, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of Earth. Observations also revealed that Pluto's orbit was very elliptical, far more than that of any other planet.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} the {{criminal}} as 'Everyman', morally <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the audience, was then totally abandoned; the reader could comfort himself {{with the knowledge that}} he at least, unlike the criminal, was saved.|$|E
25|$|These images show Möbius transformations stereographically {{projected}} onto the Riemann sphere. Note {{in particular that}} when {{projected onto}} a sphere, the special case of a fixed point at infinity looks <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> having the fixed points in an arbitrary location.|$|E
5000|$|Shah Muhammad Ramzan, Molvi Muhammad Ramzan (شاہ محمد رمضان) was {{a preacher}} and crusading tablighi in Haryana. He {{expressed}} by his preachings that the converted Rajputs, Meo and Jats (Muslim Rajputs) were in <b>no</b> way <b>different</b> <b>from</b> their Hindu counterparts in culture, customs and celebrations of religious festivals. He also defined by his preachings {{that they were}} not only pir-parast (Guru-worshippers) and grave worshiping (Qabr-parast); they were also idol-worshippers. They celebrated Holi, Diwali and other Hindu festivals with zeal and dressed in the Hindu fashion.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} PC {{compatibility}} as a worldwide standard changed RM's focus from complete in-house design of circuit boards, peripherals and firmware to the assembly {{and integration of}} hardware components sourced predominantly from the Far East. The hardware within RM server and desktop PCs was <b>no</b> longer significantly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> mainstream PCs from other vendors.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} complamina {{administered}} in a parenteral-cum-oral schedule {{in the treatment}} of recurrent intractable ulcer in leprosy is reported. A group of six patients belonging to tuberculoid type who had trophic plantar ulcers showed response in <b>no</b> way <b>different</b> <b>from</b> a control group receiving placebos. Four out of a group of five lepromatous patients with chronic non-plantar ulcers on legs, refractory to other lines of treatment responded extremely satisfactorily to complamina under the conditions of administration and dosage schedule. A larger trial including exclusively such non-plantar ulcers with a higher dosage schedule seems justifiabl...|$|R
25|$|Ultrasound {{is sound}} waves with {{frequencies}} {{higher than the}} upper audible limit of human hearing. Ultrasound is <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> 'normal' (audible) sound in its physical properties, except in that humans cannot hear it. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz up to several gigahertz.|$|E
25|$|In Theravadin Buddhism, Buddhas {{are born}} as unenlightened humans, {{and are not}} rulers of any paradise or pure land. Maitreya's arising would be <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the arising of Gautama Buddha, as he {{achieved}} full enlightenment {{as a human being}} and died, entering parinibbana.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, what an eruv accomplishes is {{a merger}} of {{different}} domain types into one domain type, making carrying within the area enclosed by the eruv <b>no</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> carrying within {{a room of}} a house (i.e. one domain type, namely a private domain), which is permitted.|$|E

We also discuss the complexity of other decision problems...|$|R
5000|$|Ordinary moral {{discourse}} and most philosophical systems state that a prohibition on doing harm to others as in #1 is more compelling than any duty to benefit others as in #2-4. This makes {{the concept of}} [...] "first do <b>no</b> harm" [...] <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the other aspects of beneficence. One example illustrating this concept is the trolley problem.|$|R
