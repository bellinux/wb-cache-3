40|$|Purpose: Acute {{development}} of cataracts {{that may be}} transient is known to occur during correction of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome. Nettleship in 1885 {{was the first to}} describe the presence of a transient cataract in three diabetic patients that grew worse and eventually cleared with treatment. 1 We present a case of irreversible cataracts formed by <b>nuclear</b> <b>fracture</b> of the crystalline lens after hyperglycemia correction, an entity that has not yet been described. Observations: A 67 year-old Caucasian man presented with sudden bilateral vision loss one week after a week-long hospitalization {{in the intensive care unit}} for correction of hyperglycemia in the setting of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome requiring an insulin drip. This was caused by spontaneous fractures of the lens nuclei causing bilateral irreversible cataracts. The patient underwent uncomplicated bilateral cataract extraction resulting in restoration of normal vision. Conclusions and importance: Acute transient cataracts that develop during correction of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome are thought to result from osmotic lens swelling. In this case report, internal fracture of the lens was produced by mechanical forces generated in the process of lens swelling occurring as a consequence of initial hyperglycemia and its subsequent correction. This case represents a rare ocular complication of hyperglycemia correction, and provides new evidence that mechanical forces can be part of diabetic cataractogenesis...|$|R

Such explosions were tried in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico (Project Gasbuggy, 1967), and the Piceance Basin of Western Colorado (Project Rulison, 1969, and Project Rio Blanco, 1973) but the results were disappointing, and the tests were halted. The petroleum industry turned to the new massive hydraulic fracturing technique as the way to recover tight gas.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor <b>nuclear</b> safety, <b>fracture</b> {{evaluation}} of reactor pressure vessels (RPV) under neutron irradiation is key issue. Fracture toughness from a CT specimen {{is used as}} a material constant for fracture evaluation, but {{it is well known that}} it has a large constraint, which causes lower toughness than that of flawed structures, such as a RPV with a surface flaw. In ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT) region ferritic steel which is material of RPV has a large scatter and it becomes important to know the accurate scatter of an irradiated material because of less margin of RPVâ€™s integrity after a long term operation. In this paper to establish a more precise fracture evaluation method in DBTT region for an irradiated RPV with a postulated surface flaw, a coupled model of damage mechanics for ductile fracture and Beremin model for cleavage fracture was applied for correction of the effect of a small ductile growth on the stress-strain field. To confirm the validity of the method, as the first trial, fracture tests using CT specimens were performed in several temperature conditions. The temperature dependence of the parameters of Beremin models were investigated as well...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to experimentally determine the effectiveness of fracture sealing in welded tuff using ordinary portland cement and microfine cement grouts.

Laboratory experiments have been performed on seventeen tuff cylinders. (1) tension induced cracks, (2) natural and, (3) sawcut surfaces serve as fractures. Prior to grouting, the hydraulic conductivity of the intact rock and that of the fractures themselves are measured under a range of normal stresses. Grouts are injected through axial boreholes at pressures of 0. 3 to 4. 1 MPa while holding fractures under a constant normal stress. Five grout formulations have been selected. Minor amounts of bentonite (0 to 5 percent by weight) have been added to these grouts to increase stability. Water to cement ratios range from 0. 45 to 1. 0.

Fracture coatings within the predominantly non-zeolitic Paintbrush Group vary both with depth and laterally across Yucca Mountain, whereas fracture coatings in tuffs below the Paintbrush Group are related to the mineralogy of the tuffs and follow a consistent pattern of distribution with predominantly quartz, calcite, and manganese oxides in the devitrified intervals and mordenite and clinoptilolite in the zeolitic intervals.

40|$|Project Gasbuggy was {{the first}} of three joint government-industry {{experiments}} conducted to test the effectiveness of <b>nuclear</b> explosives to <b>fracture</b> deeply buried, low-permeability natural gas reservoirs to stimulate production. The scope of this work plan is to document the environmental objectives and the proposed technical site investigation strategies that will be utilized for the site characterization of the Project Gasbuggy Site. Its goal is the collection of data in sufficient quantity and quality to determine current site conditions, support a risk assessment for the site surfaces, and evaluate if further remedial action is required to achieve permanent closure of the site that is both protective of human health and the environment. The Gasbuggy Site is located approximately 55 air miles east of Farmington, New Mexico, in Rio Arriba County within the Carson National Forest in the northeast portion of the San Juan Basin. Historically, Project Gasbuggy consisted of the joint government-industry detonation of a nuclear device on December 10, 1967, followed by reentry drilling and gas production testing and project evaluation activities in post-detonation operations from 1967 to 1976. Based on historical documentation, no chemical release sites other than the mud pits were identified; additionally, there was no material buried at the Gasbuggy Site other than drilling fluids and construction debris. Although previous characterization and restoration activities including sensitive species surveys, cultural resources surveys, surface geophysical surveys, and limited soil sampling and analysis were performed in 1978 and again in 2000, no formal closure of the site was achieved. Also, these efforts did not adequately address the site's potential for chemical contamination at the surface/shallow subsurface ground levels or the subsurface hazards for potential migration outside of the current site subsurface intrusion restrictions. Additional investigation activities will focus on the surface/shallow subsurface sampling and deep subsurface modeling. Suspected potential contaminants of concern for investigative analysis at the Gasbuggy Site include total petroleum hydrocarbons (diesel- and gasoline-range), volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, total Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, and radionuclides. The results of this characterization and risk assessment will be used to evaluate corrective action alternatives to include no further action, the implementation of institutional controls, capping on site, or off-site disposal of contaminated waste which will be presented in a subsequent corrective action decision document...|$|R
40|$|In British gas-cooled <b>nuclear</b> reactors, fast <b>fracture</b> of {{graphite}} moderator bricks may happen {{near the end}} of the reactor life because fast neutron irradiation induces internal stresses and radiolytic oxidation weakens the moderator bricks. A finite element analysis method, developed by British Energy Generation Ltd, based on a maximum stress criterion predicts the time of first failure of a moderator brick pessimistically due to the assumption that the stress-strain curve of the moderator graphite becomes linear when it is irradiated by fast neutrons. As an alternative, this work sets out to investigate, for the first time, crack growth resistance curves, R and K_R-curves, for UK moderator graphites. Crack growth resistance curves are not affected by changes in non-linearity in stress-strain curves, as the 'plastic' component of the fracture is taken into account during the measurement of R or K_R. The shapes of the crack growth resistance curves consist of an increase from crack initiation to a plateau followed by a decrease for R-curves and an increase for K_R-Curves as crack termination is approached. The shapes of the crack growth resistance curves are determined by energy dissipation mechanisms that take place ahead of the crack tip (microcracking defining a process zone) and at the back of the crack tip (crack bridging and friction defining the friction zone). Frictions and crack bridging, identified by scanning electron microscopy, are responsible for the initial increase in R and K_R, whereas microcracking is responsible for the decrease in R at crack termination. Stress and energy-based mechanical properties are reduced exponentially as a function of the increasing oxidation, with thermal oxidation being more destructive than radiolytic oxidation. After oxidation, crack growth resistance curves are shifted downwards by an exponential factor depending on the degree of oxidation, but the general shape of R-curves remains the same with an increase followed by a plateau and a decrease towards crack termination. For IM 1 - 24 graphite, pinning of glissile dislocations in the basal planes induced by fast neutron irradiation increases the value of stress-based parameters, whereas it reduces energy-based parameters. A new model predicting the shape of crack growth resistance curves for oxidised and irradiated IM 1 - 24 graphite was developed and applied to the case of a reactor brick. A methodology for using the model to predict the time of failure of reactor bricks was also proposed.

40|$|As {{more and}} more {{engineering}} applications require the correct simulation of flow and transport processes in porous media, and while many of these media present {{a certain degree of}} fracturing, this work deals with the development of numerical models that can simulate two-phase flow in large-scale fractured reservoirs. Among the applications which these models are addressing to, there are the estimation of contaminant spreading and removal, the reservoir exploitation, or more recently the CO 2 sequestration, the geothermal reservoir exploitation, and the <b>nuclear</b> waste repositories. <b>Fractured</b> systems are ubiquitous around the world and can occur on avariety of lengths and scales which makes difficult the development of a general model that can handle easily all of them. The overall purpose of this work is to improve the understanding over the concepts of the multiphase flow and processes in the fractured porous media and develop a conceptual model that allows the study of two-phase flow in fractures of arbitrary size, orientation and shape. The flow models have been roughly classified in discrete fracturemodels (DFM), continuum fracturemodels (CFM) and hybrid. The DFMs consider the fractures explicitly and thereforerequirehuge computation power,whereas CFMs require the determination of arepresentative elementary volume (REV), the appropriate effective parameters and transfer functions between continua. For alarge scale problem, like aCO 2 storage reservoir,there can be millions of fractures which might have to be considered and could be a formidable task for a DFM simulator. In this sense a continuum model, which is in this case {{in the form of a}} generalized dual-porosity representation, does not require the fine discretization of a DFM and the detailed fracturecharacterization during simulations. Thus, another goal of this work is to build areliable large scale multiphase flow simulator based on the continuum approach. Two flow simulators, 2 pDFM and 2 pMINC,have been developed and tested based on the two different fracture model concepts. Both simulators are implemented in the numerical toolbox DuMux. The 2 pDFM model simulates the two-phase flow in fractured porous media using aDFM approach, with a lower dimensional representation for the fracture network (DFM-L). The model is capable to account for storage in the fractures. The 2 pMINC model simulates two-phase flow in fractured porous media using the multiple interacting continua (MINC) method with an improved upscaling technique. The complex transient behavior of the flow processes in fractured porous media is captured by subgridding the coarse blocks in nested volume elements which have effective properties calculated from the detailed representation of the fracturesystem. In this way,the physically based approach is kept, the accuracy of the model is preserved,the common use of empirically derived transfer functions is avoided and the complexity of the problem is considerably reduced which is reflected in the speedup factors up to 1000. This research extends the applicability range of the upscaling procedure to include entry pressure effects. Moreover,a general workflow has been developed for the numerical simulation of the two-phase flow in large-scale fractured porous media. The results are verified, validated and tested in a fully comprehensive way for both models. To test the behaviour of the simulator for field scale problems they are applied to an idealized medium with periodic fracture pattern and to areal, naturally fractured reservoir from the Bristol Channel. The evaluation shows that the extended MINC model is able to reproduce both, the large-scale permeability and the dynamics of the fracture-matrix mass transfer,correctly. The extended MINC method and the simulation procedure is flexible as it allows choosing the accuracy of the solution, the computation speed, and allows working with spatial information about the fracture system of various complexity and detail.
