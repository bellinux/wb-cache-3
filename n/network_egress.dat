30|$|The above {{mentioned}} issues are typically addressed {{using a variety}} of NAT traversal protocols. NAT traversal is a generic term used to identify techniques that establish and maintain TCP and/or UDP connections across NAT gateways. The general goal of a client implementing a NAT traversal protocol is to know its own external address (i.e., the address behind which the local address space has be hidden). The client can then start the communication by advertising its external NAT address to its peers, rather than the masqueraded (local) address that is not reachable for its peers on the public network. However, NAT traversal techniques are not designed to handle dynamic <b>network</b> <b>egress</b> points, as a matter of fact, a client has no way of notifying its peers that its external address has changed. Possible solutions involve modifying currently used NAT traversal protocols (e.g., Session Traversal Utilities for NAT [19]) in order to support dynamic <b>network</b> <b>egress</b> points or implementing a Mobile IP architecture in order to allow end-users' client to roam across different public networks. Both approaches are highly invasive and as such are out of the scope of this work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Multihoming {{has been}} used by stub {{networks}} for several years as a form of redundancy, improving the availability of Internet access. More recently, Intelligent Route Control (IRC) products allow multihomed networks to dynamically switch parts of their egress or ingress traffic between ISPs, also improving cost and performance. IRC products assume that the set of upstream ISPs is given and fixed. Typically, however, a multihomed network has several ISP choices and the actual selection of ISPs can significantly affect cost, availability, and performance. In {{the first part of this}} work, we develop a methodology to select the best set of upstream ISPs, optimizing monetary cost and availability. Our results, based on measurements of actual Internet traffic and topology, show that the proposed algorithm selects the best possible set of ISPs in terms of resiliency to inter-AS single-link failures. The algorithm also performs well in the presence of double or triple link failures. In the second part of this work, we focus on the egress path selection problem. Specifically, we propose a stochastic search algorithm, based on simulated annealing, to allocate the <b>network’s</b> <b>egress</b> traffic between upstream ISPs. The objectives are to minimize cost, also ensuring that the selected paths to the major destinations of egress traffic are congestion-free. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs very well in meeting the previous objectives, when congestion-free paths exist...|$|R

40|$|Worms are {{arguably the}} most serious {{security}} threat facing the Internet. Motivated to develop a detection technique that is both efficient and accurate enough to enable automatic containment of worm propagation at the <b>network</b> <b>egress</b> points, we propose a new technique for the rapid detection of worm propagation from an enterprise network. Implemented in software, it relies on the correlation of Domain Name System (DNS) queries with outgoing connections from an enterprise network. Significant improvement over existing scanning worm detection techniques includes: (1) the possibility to detect worm propagation after only a single infection attempt; (2) the capacity to detect zero-day worms; and (3) a low false positive rate. The precision of this first-mile detection technique supports the use of automated containment and suppression strategies to stop fast scanning worms before they leave the network boundary. Furthermore, {{we believe that this}} technique can be applied with the same precision to identify other forms of malicious behavior within an enterprise network such as: mass-mailing worms, network reconnaissance activity, and covert communications. ...|$|E

This shift places greater demand on locality mechanisms to ensure the correct balance between bandwidth savings and successful timely playback. In this paper, we continue our work to resolve the strong trade-off resulted from the limited network condition in order to support efficient P 2 P live streaming services. Based on our findings we propose an OPLoc framework for supporting locality and harmonised play points in a live streaming P 2 P system. we present our results and analysis of its operation through a series of simulations which measure bandwidth consumption at <b>network</b> <b>egress</b> points, failure rates and each peers' play point relative to the live stream...|$|E

To address this problem, we propose STRUDEL, a distributed framework that tackles the problem of free-riders and consists of: (i) a mechanism for the detection of malicious peers; (ii) a formal Bayesian trust model, to assess peers’ trustworthiness; (iii) a forwarding mechanism based on the maximisation of trust-informed utility...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} minimizing network costs when grooming traffic in optical networks that support Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). While the general problem {{has been shown to}} be NP-Hard for a number of cost measures, there still exist restricted problems for which no complexity bound is known. In this research, we restrict our attention to traffic grooming for path <b>networks</b> with <b>egress</b> (all-to-one) traffic. This restricted model has practical significance for high speed (optical) access networks and can also lead to better bounds and approximations on more general network topologies (such as ring and star networks) that can be decomposed into path networks. Three important cost measures for this restricted model are studied. The first cost measure is the total number of ADMs used by the solution. Minimizing this cost was known to be NP-Complete even for egress traffic without using cross connects. We show that allowing an unbounded number of wavelengths obviates the need for digital cross connects at the nodes and hence the problem remains NP-Complete even when cross connects are allowed. The second cost measure is the number of transceivers used by the solution. We show that the problem of minimizing the number of transceivers is NP-Complete, even when restricted to egress traffic. We then develop a simple approximation scheme where the transceiver cost exceeds th...|$|R

In addition, RDM TELIC supplements the algorithms available for implementation of MPLS-TE. MPLS-TE is the whole framework of TE for the domain that includes measurement, modeling, characterization, and control of network traffic. It includes constrained shortest path first (CSPF) (constrained routing), protection routing, and load balancing. CSPF routing algorithm uses maximum bandwidth available (MBW) {{as one of the}} tie breakers for choosing links. RDM TELIC focuses on bandwidth allocation and routing.

Many approaches to bot detection have been proposed, but they either rely on end-host installations, or, if they operate on network traffic, require deep packet inspection for signature matching. In this paper, we present BOTFINDER, a novel system that detects infected hosts in a network using only high-level properties of the bot’s network traffic. BOTFINDER does not rely on content analysis. Instead, it uses machine learning to identify the key features of command-and-control communication, based on observing traffic that bots produce in a controlled environment. Using these features, BOTFINDER creates models that can be deployed at <b>network</b> <b>egress</b> points to identify infected hosts. We trained our system on a number of representative bot families, and we evaluated BOTFINDER on real-world traffic datasets – most notably, the Net-Flow information of a large ISP that contains more than 25 billion flows.

40|$|Maintaining {{the quality}} of service (QOS) and {{controlling}} the network congestion are quite complicated tasks. They cause degrading {{the performance of the}} network, and disturbing the continuous communication process. To overcome these issues, one step towards this dilemma has been taken in form of Pre-congestion notification (PCN) technique. PCN uses a packet marking technique within a PCN domain over IP networks. It is notified by egress node that works as guard at entry point of <b>network.</b> <b>Egress</b> node gives feedback to communicating servers whether rate on the link is exceeded than configured admissible threshold or within the limit. Based on this feedback, admission decisions are taken to determine whether to allow/block new coming flows or terminate already accepted. The actual question is about selection of right algorithm for PCN domain. In this paper, we investigate the analytical behavior of some known PCN algorithms. We make slide modifications in originality of PCN algorithms without disquieting working process in order to employ those within similar types of scenarios. Our goal is to simulate them either in highly congested or less congested realistic scenarios. On the basis of simulation done in ns 2, we are able to recommend each PCN algorithm for specific conditions. Finally, we develop a benchmark that helps researchers and scientific communities to pick the right algorithm. Furthermore, the benchmark is designed to achieve specific objectives according to the users' requirements without congesting the network.

40|$|Emergency {{navigation}} {{systems for}} buildings and other built environments, such as sport arenas or shopping centres, typically rely on simple sensor networks to detect emergencies and, then, provide automatic signs {{to direct the}} evacuees. The major drawbacks of such static wireless sensor network (WSN) -based emergency navigation systems are the very limited computing capacity, which makes adaptivity very difficult, and the restricted battery power, due to the low cost of sensor nodes for unattended operation. If static wireless sensor networks and cloud-computing can be integrated, then intensive computations that are needed to determine optimal evacuation routes {{in the presence of}} time-varying hazards can be offloaded to the cloud, but the disadvantages of limited battery life-time at the client side, as well as the high likelihood of system malfunction during an emergency still remain. By making use of the powerful sensing ability of smart phones, which are increasingly ubiquitous, this paper presents a cloud-enabled indoor emergency navigation framework to direct evacuees in a coordinated fashion and to improve the reliability and resilience for both communication and localization. By combining social potential fields (SPF) and a cognitive packet network (CPN) -based algorithm, evacuees are guided to exits in dynamic loose clusters. Rather than relying on a conventional telecommunications infrastructure, we suggest an ad hoc cognitive packet network (AHCPN) -based protocol to adaptively search optimal communication routes between portable devices and the <b>network</b> <b>egress</b> nodes that provide access to cloud servers, in a manner that spares the remaining battery power of smart phones and minimizes the time latency. Experimental results through detailed simulations indicate that smart human motion and smart network management can increase the survival rate of evacuees and reduce the number of drained smart phones in an evacuation process...|$|E

Network mobility (NEMO) has been proposed to enable a large number of mobile devices on a vehicle to access the Internet; however, several issues must be solved before it can be put into practice, e. g., frequent handovers, long handover latency, and poor quality of service.

40|$|Recently, much {{attention}} {{has been devoted to}} the quality of public transport and more specifically to designating individuals and areas that suffer from public transport deficiencies. Various studies conducted in the domain of transport-related social exclusion have used geographical information systems (GIS) to unravel the linkage between social disadvantage, public transport needs and public transport provision. However, much of the empirical work to date is static because it describes what is accessible by public transit from a particular origin at a single point in time yet does not consider the temporal variability in accessibility levels at multiple origins. In answer to this limitation, this study puts forward a methodology for identifying public transit gaps by drawing on the latest accomplishments in the field of modelling time-continuous, schedule-based public transport. Therefore, General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) datasets for bus, tram, metro and train as well as street network data were integrated in a GIS in order to compute a single multimodal network that accounts for all components of a public transport trip: ingress, the waiting time, the actual travel time through the transit <b>network</b> and <b>egress.</b> An automated Python script enables to determine the temporal variability in accessibility through this network, which occurs as a consequence of fluctuations in operating frequencies across the diurnal cycle, and between weekdays and weekends. These accessibility levels to key destinations at regular time intervals were compared to the public transport needs to highlight spatial mismatches between provision and need. This method was tested for Flanders (Belgium) and proved to be effective in pinpointing areas that need considerable attention in public transport planning due to an overall high need for and underprovision of public transportation. Additionally, the high degree of time variability suggested the inadequacy of applying a single time of day for transit-based accessibility research...|$|R
40|$|The {{subcellular}} {{space is}} a dense, complex environment that viral pathogens must efficiently navigate for their survival and dissemination. The prototypal poxvirus member, vaccinia virus (VACV) {{has been shown}} to subvert both host microtubule-based and actin-based transport mechanisms to this end. The utilisation of fluorescent protein technology has been at the crux of many of these discoveries, but addressing remaining questions is made difficult by the various morphological forms of VACV and the sheer number of viruses being transported at any one time in a single infected cell. We have used the development of photoswitchable fluorescent protein Dendra 2 to create a cutting edge imaging system that allows us to gain insight into the dynamics of subcellular virus dissemination. We have constructed recombinant viruses expressing core protein A 3 and envelope proteins B 5 and F 13 fused to Dendra 2 in both parental and deletion strains of the Western Reserve strain and have examined the envelopment at and egress from the trans-Golgi <b>network.</b> <b>Egress</b> of wrapped virus to the cell periphery following vaccinia virus (VACV) replication is dependent on interactions with the microtubule motor complex kinesin- 1 and is mediated by the viral envelope proteins A 36 and F 12. We have utilised a mouse-based infection model to validate the important role these transport events have during an in vivo, endemic infection. Ectromelia virus, an orthopoxvirus and the causative agent of mousepox, encodes an A 36 homologue (ECTV-Mos- 142) that is highly conserved despite a large truncation at the C terminus. Deleting the ECTV A 36 R gene leads to a {{reduction in the number of}} extracellular viruses formed and to a reduced plaque size, consistent with a role in microtubule transport. We also observed a complete loss of virus-associated actin tails, another phenotype dependent on A 36 expression during VACV infection. ECTV A 36 R was severely attenuated when used to infect the normally susceptible BALB/c mouse strain. ECTV ΔA 36 R replication and spread from the draining lymph nodes to the liver and spleen were significantly reduced in BALB/c mice and in Rag- 1 -deficient mice, which lack T and B lymphocytes. The dramatic reduction in ECTV ΔA 36 R titers early during the course of infection was not associated with an augmented immune response. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the critical role that subcellular transport pathways play not only in orthopoxvirus infection in an in vitro context but also during orthopoxvirus pathogenesis in a natural host...|$|E
40|$|A common {{assumption}} made {{in traffic}} matrix (TM) modeling and estimation is independence of a packet’s <b>network</b> ingress and <b>egress.</b> We {{argue that in}} real IP networks, this assumption should not and does not hold. The fact that most traffic consists of two-way exchanges of packets means that traffic streams flowing in opposite directions {{at any point in}} the network are not independent. In this paper we propose a model for traffic matrices based on independence of connections rather than packets. We argue that the independentconnection (IC) model is more intuitive, and has a more direct connection to underlying network phenomena than the gravity model. To validate the IC model, we show that it fits real data better than the gravity model and that it works well as a prior in the TM estimation problem. We study the model’s parameters empirically and identify useful stability properties. This justifies the use of the simpler versions of the model for TM applications. To illustrate the utility of the model we focus on two such applications: synthetic TM generation and TM estimation. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first traffic matrix model that incorporates properties of bidirectional traffic. ...|$|R
40|$|Interdomain traffic {{engineering}} (TE) controls {{the flow of}} traffic between autonomous systems (ASes) to achieve performance goals under various resource constraints. Interdomain TE can be categorized into ingress TE and egress TE, which aim to control the ingress and egress traffic flow in a network, respectively. Most interdomain TE techniques are based on BGP, which was not designed to support performance based routing. Hence even though some basic interdomain TE techniques are widely deployed, their overall effectiveness and impact on interdomain traffic are not well understood. Furthermore, systematic practices for deploying these techniques {{have yet to be}} developed. In this thesis, we explore these open issues for both ingress and egress TE. We first focus on the AS-Path prepending technique in interdomain ingress TE. We design a polynomial algorithm that takes network settings as input and produces the optimal prepending at each ingress link. We also develop methods to measure the inputs of the optimal algorithm by leveraging widely available looking glass severs and evaluate the errors of such measurement. We further propose an algorithm, based on this optimal algorithm, that is robust to input errors. We then focus on Intelligent Routing Control (IRC) systems often used at multihomed <b>networks</b> for <b>egress</b> interdomain TE. To address the possible traffic oscillation problem caused by multiple IRC systems, we design a class of randomized IRC algorithms. Through simulations, we show that the proposed algorithms can effectively mitigate oscillations. We also show that IRC systems using randomized path switching algorithms perform better than those switching path deterministically, when both types of IRC systems co-exist. To further understand the performance impact of IRC systems, we next focus on the performance of applications, such as TCP connections. We study the synergistic and antagonistic interactions between IRC and TCP connections, through a simple dual-feedback model. We first examine the impact of sudden RTT and available bandwidth changes in TCP connection. We then examine the effect of IRC measurement delays on closed loop traffic. We also show the conditions under which IRC is beneficial under various path impairment models. Ph. D.
