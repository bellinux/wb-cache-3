Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is <b>nosing</b> ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. After we learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call the numbers on the phone cards that Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that he should get a different lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends are angry about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1982, Invincibles air group {{consisted}} purely of Sea King HAS.5 anti-submarine {{helicopters and}} Sea Harrier FRS.1 aircraft. Typically, nine Sea Kings, and {{four or five}} Sea Harriers were embarked. This {{was due to the}} fact that the originally envisioned mission for the ships was to provide the heart of ASW hunter-killer groups in the North Atlantic during a war against the Soviet Union. In that context, the main weapon of the carrier would not be its fighter aircraft, but its ASW helicopters. The fighters were on board to shoot down the occasional Soviet maritime patrol aircraft <b>nosing</b> around the ship and its escorts.|$|E
25|$|Bonney {{was unable}} to find a willing test pilot and chose to fly the {{aircraft}} himself. He performed a test hop, damaging the landing gear once. On 4 May 1928 Bonney took up another aircraft on a flight, then announced he would test fly the Gull that day. Bonney was killed during the maiden flight when the aircraft nosedived into the ground from about 50 feet of altitude, seconds after taking off from Curtiss Field on Long Island. Pathé News was onsite to film the first flight. The newsreel shows the aircraft experiencing a roll to the left which was corrected, and a single oscillation in pitch before <b>nosing</b> straight down into the ground tossing out Bonney. Bonney was taken to a Mineola Hospital where he died.|$|E

25|$|In {{their fourth}} season, 1995–96, with Bradley still leading {{the team in}} scoring, second-year forward Alexander Selivanov scoring a total of 31 goals, and Roman Hamrlik (the team's first-ever draft choice except for the players drafted in the {{expansion}} draft two days earlier (Wendell Young being the first ever Lightning) in 1992) having an All-Star year on defense, the Lightning finally qualified for the playoffs, <b>nosing</b> out the defending Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils {{with a record of}} 38–33–12 with 88 points for the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference by a single win. Due to his stellar play in net, Puppa was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy (losing out to Jim Carey of the Washington Capitals). Although they lost their first round series in six games to the Philadelphia Flyers, it still remains a magical season for Lightning fans. The Thunderdome crowd of 28,183 for the April 23 playoff game against the Flyers was the largest crowd for an NHL game, a record that stood until the 2003 Heritage Classic in Edmonton.|$|E
25|$|Rats, {{like most}} mammals, also form family groups {{of a mother}} and her young. This applies to both groups of males and females. However, rats are {{territorial}} animals, meaning that they usually act aggressively or scared of strange rats. Rats will fluff up their hair, hiss, squeal, and move their tails around when defending their territory. Rats will chase each other, groom each other, sleep in group nests, wrestle with each other, have dominance squabbles, communicate, and play in various other ways with each other. Huddling is an additional important part of rat socialization. Huddling is often supposed to have a heat-conserving function. Nestling rats especially depend on heat from their mother, since they cannot regulate their own temperature. Huddling is an extreme form of herding. Other forms of interaction include: crawling under, which is literally the act of crawling underneath one another; walking over, also explained in the name; allo-grooming, so-called to distinguish it from self-grooming; and <b>nosing,</b> where a rat gently pushes with its nose at another rat near the neck.|$|E
500|$|Flying at , {{the pilot}} located his target through a bombsight {{window in the}} cockpit floor. The pilot moved the dive lever to the rear, {{limiting}} the [...] "throw" [...] of the control column. The dive brakes were activated automatically, the pilot set the trim tabs, reduced his throttle and closed the coolant flaps. The aircraft then rolled 180°, automatically <b>nosing</b> the aircraft into a dive. Red tabs protruded from the upper surfaces of the wing as a visual indicator to the pilot that, {{in case of a}} g-induced black-out, the automatic dive recovery system would be activated. The Stuka dived at a 60-90° angle, holding a constant speed of 500–600km/h (350-370mph) due to dive-brake deployment, which increased the accuracy of the Ju 87's aim.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its early}} form the Type G had a two-wheeled single axle main {{undercarriage}} mounted {{by a pair}} of struts on each side, one forward to the engine bulkhead and one rearwards to the fuselage via the main spar. Initially the wheels were supplemented {{by a pair of}} skids to avoid <b>nosing</b> over, but these were later discarded. [...] A long tail strut positioned a sprung tailskid just below the lower tip of the rudder. [...] The aircraft was powered by a 100hp (75kW) Anzani 10 radial engine. [...] The prominent pair of semicircular exhaust tubes characteristic of this engine fed a single exhaust pipe which curved away under the aircraft via a silencer, ending near the trailing edge.|$|E
2500|$|Despite their move to {{the brand-new}} ESA, the Hurricanes played lackluster hockey in 1999–2000, failing to make the playoffs. In 2000–01, however, they claimed the eighth seed, <b>nosing</b> out the Boston Bruins, and landed a first-round match-up with the {{defending}} champions, the New Jersey Devils. Although the Devils eliminated the Hurricanes in six games, the series {{is seen as the}} real [...] "arrival" [...] of hockey in the Triangle. Down 3–0 in the series, the Hurricanes extended it to a sixth game, thereby becoming only the tenth team in NHL history to do so. Game 6 in Raleigh featured their best playoff crowd that year, as well as their loudest. Despite the 5–1 loss, Carolina was given a standing ovation by their home crowd as the game ended, erasing some of the doubts that the city would not warm up to the team.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nose</b> torture is {{a classic}} Japanese form of BDSM, that usually {{involves}} a hook applied in the <b>nose</b> — so called nosehook — that pulls the <b>nose</b> backwards.

2500|$|The Type D was {{the third}} and last of Handley Page's early single-seat monoplanes (the Type B being a biplane). [...] It was a close {{relative}} of the Type A, which crashed on its first turn, and the [...] Type C which did not fly at all. [...] Like them the Type D used the wing patented by José Weiss that promised, but failed to deliver, automatic lateral stability. [...] Its structure {{was based on a}} rigid inner section, built with four spars and standard ribs with a flexible outer section carried on ribs attached fanwise {{from the end of the}} spars in a bird-like fashion. The wing was braced by wires from a tall, narrow inverted V kingpost, lifting loads being carried by symmetrical bracing to a matching V post under the fuselage. [...] This latter structure also carried the two-wheel single axle undercarriage and a long central skid to prevent <b>nosing</b> over and to hold the tail clear of the ground. After the Type A crash, Handley Page had added wing warping for lateral control to the Type C. [...] The Type D also used this system, with a steering wheel pulling on wires to the mid-wing via the kingpost. [...] The horizontal tail was an approximately 60° delta with rounded tips; most of the surface moved to form the single-piece elevator and carried the rudder post and split (above and below the elevator) rudder, so that all the control surfaces moved together as a cruciform piece. The elevator was operated by pushing or pulling the lever-mounted steering wheel and the rudder by a [...] "foot tiller". There was no fixed fin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Nose</b> {{detection}} is {{an important}} part of a 3 D face recognition process. Knowledge of the <b>nose</b> location will enable us to align an unknown 3 D face with those in a face database. Besides that, the head pose can be deduced from information obtained from the <b>nose.</b> In this paper, a method is proposed to detect the <b>nose</b> tip from a three-dimensional face range image. This method identifies potential <b>nose</b> tip candidates by investigating the surrounding pixels. The <b>nose</b> tip is then identified from the potential candidates by their mean and variance values as well as their location which must be within the <b>nose</b> area. The proposed method has the ability to locate the <b>nose</b> tip without any manual input from the user, requires no training and is able to locate the <b>nose</b> tip for faces at different angles.
