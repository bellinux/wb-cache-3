In clocked logic, it is enough that the logic settles on the desired value in time to meet the timing deadline. In our example, we are not considering clocked logic.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the briefest}} {{sketch of the}} constructions. Note that the constructions {{are exactly the same}} in ZFC and in NFU, except for the {{difference}} in the constructions of the natural numbers: since all variables are restricted to strongly cantorian sets, there is no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> stratification restrictions. Without the Axiom of Counting, it might be necessary to introduce some applications of T in a full discussion of these constructions.|$|E
25|$|Fire {{departments}} that serve areas along the wildland–urban interface {{are faced with}} unique challenges that departments based in larger cities or strictly rural areas do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about.</b> Departments in these areas often elect to use a type of fire engine {{commonly referred to as}} a wildland-urban interface engine or simply interface engines. While technically considered a wildland fire engine by many, these maintain the traditional look and feel of a standard engine.|$|E

50|$|COFFEE's memory {{management}} is handled entirely by a garbage collection process; essentially {{this means that}} it looks after itself, and the programmer seldom <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> it. However, {{it is possible to}} control the process explicitly when necessary.|$|R
25|$|Another {{method of}} {{overcoming}} the free rider {{problem is to}} simply eliminate the profit incentive for free riding by buying out all the potential free riders. A property developer that owned an entire city street, for instance, would not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> free riders when erecting street lights since he owns every business that could benefit from the street light without paying. Implicitly, then, the property developer would erect street lights until the marginal social benefit met the marginal social cost. In this case, they are equivalent to the private marginal benefits and costs.|$|E
25|$|Fixed rate {{bonds are}} subject to {{interest}} rate risk, meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, {{a decrease in the}} market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the market price of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere — perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Navy much {{preferred}} the more docile flight {{qualities of the}} F6F compared with the Vought F4U Corsair, despite the superior speed of the Corsair. This preference was especially noted during carrier landings, a critical success requirement for the Navy, in which the Corsair was fundamentally flawed in comparison. The Corsair was thus released by the Navy to the Marine Corps who, without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> carrier landings, used the Corsair to immense effect in land-based sorties. The Hellcat remained the standard USN carrier-borne fighter until the F4U series was finally cleared for U.S. carrier operations in late-1944 (the carrier landing issues had by now been tackled largely thanks to use of Corsair by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm). In addition to its good flight qualities, the Hellcat was easy to maintain and had an airframe tough enough to withstand the rigors of routine carrier operations. Like the Wildcat, the Hellcat was designed for ease of manufacture and ability to withstand significant damage.|$|E

50|$|The {{automatic}} cleanup feature has {{advantages and}} disadvantages though. The advantage is that the developer no longer <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> adding cleanup code, as it is called automatically. However, the disadvantage is that the code could potentially be a little slower, as the code to perform the cleanup <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> run each time a connection is returned from the connection pool.|$|R

500|$|Don awakens to a {{knock on}} the door. It's Andrea, still in her tight yellow dress. Don directs her to leave {{immediately}} and forces her to go out through the apartment's service elevator. After Don returns to bed, Andrea walks into his bedroom again, having entered through the unlocked back door. She seduces Don and the two end up having sex in his bed. In a post-coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off the handle and chokes her to death. Panicking, he kicks her under the bed, but one of her red shoes remains visible, recalling both the visual of Ginsberg's Cinderella pitch and the lone survivor from the Richard Speck murders. Don awakens the next morning to realize he was having a fever dream. He says nothing of his vision to Megan and tells her she doesn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> him.|$|E
500|$|Besides the {{handling}} of punishments and rewards, the court made other efforts to reestablish order in the capital region. Nonessential taxes were suspended. Nobles of the imperial clan patrolled {{the gates of the}} imperial city while rebels were still at large. Some residents in Beijing abused the order that they alert authorities of remaining culprits of the coup in order to label personal enemies as [...] "rebels" [...] to take their property. To discourage this, the emperor had several dozen of these looters beaten and paraded through the streets as criminals. In an edict of August 9, the Emperor reassured loyal Mongol officers of Baoding that Mongol participation in Cao's rebellion did not mean persecution for them. In October, Mi Duo-duo-lai, commander of Baoding and veteran Mongol officer who fought against Esen Tayisi's 1449 invasion, was ordered to stay put in Baoding, a gesture by the emperor that there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> loss of authority.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} of Stankonia began in spring of 1999 and lasted {{for about a}} year. Owning a studio helped the band expand creatively, as the duo did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> time constraints that would occur with a rented studio. André 3000 observed, [...] "You can sit there and fuck with just a kick and a snare all day long if you want to... You're not working on the clock. [...] Really, you're just working on your mind." [...] Big Boi spent {{the majority of the}} recording time in the studio, while André 3000 worked at home, creating beats and experimenting with an acoustic guitar. [...] One song that came from a jam session on the guitar was [...] "Ms. Jackson", the album's second single. [...] André 3000 also created song lyrics by writing words on the walls of his home: [...] "I had planned to paint my house anyway; writing on the walls was just something I would do." [...] One stray lyric on his wall eventually developed into [...] "Gasoline Dreams".|$|E
500|$|Erica Futterman for Rolling Stone favoured their live {{acoustic}} performances as both showing, [...] "Horan's {{ability to play}} guitar, as well as One Direction's admirable live vocals. There was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show." [...] Herald Suns Cameron Adams opined that One Direction have [...] "strong pop voices". Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, [...] "It's {{easy to get lost}} in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain." [...] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: [...] "What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert." [...] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: [...] "As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's [...] "surprisingly accomplished effort" [...] of Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody" [...] proved that One Direction are [...] "more than capable" [...] of evolving their sound.|$|E
500|$|Nick Levin of Digital Spy {{reviewed}} The Time of Our Lives, saying that, {{although not}} offering much original material, it did {{provide evidence that}} Cyrus could successfully dump her Disney Channel-affiliated image. He said that each of [...] "the six genuinely new songs" [...] are worth listening to, resulting in a worthwhile EP release. Michael Hann of The Guardian felt that Cyrus managed to project a very wholesome image of herself but argued {{that she did not}} succeed in convincing adult audiences there was anything else to her: [...] "She has her name on plenty of inventive, imaginative and precisely calibrated examples of modern chart pop, songs that would have been noticed beyond her audience of young girls had they come from a more credible source". Jessica Holland of British newspaper The Observer wrote a favorable review of the EP, noting: [...] "Still not yet 17, Miley doesn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> slipping yet." [...] Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music described the uptempo numbers on the EP as [...] "brilliantly feisty skate pop" [...] but described the record's ballads as tedious. Gill concluded that, if Cyrus were to take her music more seriously, instead of releasing albums in between various other projects, she might make a great pop album and stated that [...] "As it is, The Time Of Our Lives is a great pop EP drowning in a sea of bilge." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{creating}} the game, the team's main {{aim was to}} create an experience that emulated the original game's freedom of choice while giving mainstream players more options for defining the player character. The gameplay drew inspiration from , System Shock, Dungeon Master and [...] Due to the game being designed for both consoles and PC players, the team wanted to minimize the number of menus to navigate, maintaining the core feeling of a first-person shooter. One of the aims was to improve the stealth elements, which the team felt was [...] "broken" [...] in Deus Ex. When designing the stealth, the team received input from the team developing , which was also in production at Ion Storm. They also had staff who had worked on Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, then {{regarded as one of}} the best recent stealth-focused games. The original game's two different levelling systems of augmentations and skill points were combined into the biomod system. The use of universal ammunition was implemented so players would not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> collecting ammunition types for multiple gun types. Spector later explained these changes as a means of helping sell the game to players outside the core fanbase; with both Invisible War and Thief: Deadly Shadows, they needed a wider player base in order to make the games profitable. A multiplayer mode, which had been added to the original game via a patch, was not included in Invisible War due to time and quality concerns.|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} first started, Clement and {{his crew}} would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process. According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head {{all the way down}} his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four and a half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of. Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's [...] "voice" [...] for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is [...] "this organic process of embodying the character", and not about just [...] "sitting around the table and going, 'Let me try this voice and this voice'". Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced in the end to give it a [...] "supernatural quality" [...] and get it away from the voice Haley used as Rorschach in Watchmen.|$|E
500|$|As was {{the common}} {{practice}} for Italian films at the time, shooting was done without sound; dialogue was added later along {{with music and}} sound effects. [...] As a consequence, cast members generally spoke in their native language during filming: Quinn and Basehart in English, Masina and the others in Italian. [...] Liliana Betti, Fellini's long-time assistant, has described the director's typical procedure regarding dialogue during filming, a technique he called the [...] "number system" [...] or [...] "numerological diction": [...] "Instead of lines, the actor has to count off numbers in their normal order. [...] For instance, a line of fifteen words equals an enumeration of up to thirty. [...] The actor merely counts til thirty: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. etc." [...] Biographer John Baxter has commented on the usefulness of such a system: [...] "It helps pinpoint an instant in the speech where he [...] wants a different reaction. 'Go back to [...] "27",' he'll tell an actor, 'but this time, smile.'" [...] Since he didn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> noise while shooting a scene, Fellini would keep up a running commentary during filming, a practice that scandalized more traditional filmmakers, like Elia Kazan: [...] "He talked through each take, in fact yelled at the actors. 'No, there, stop, turn, look at her, look at her. [...] See how sad she is, see her tears? [...] Oh, the poor wretch! [...] You want to comfort her? Don't turn away; go to her. [...] Ah, she doesn't want you, does she? What? Go to her anyway!'... That's how he's able... to use performers from many countries. [...] He does part of the acting for the actors." ...|$|E

Erica Futterman (Rolling Stone) wrote in a title for the concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York, [...] "U.K. boy band relies on vocal prowess and charisma to keep fan base loyal."

For this integration to work well, however, the theory solver {{must be able to}} participate in propagation and conflict analysis, i.e., it must be able to infer new facts from already established facts, as well as to supply succinct explanations of infeasibility when theory conflicts arise. In other words, the theory solver must be incremental and backtrackable.|$|R
50|$|From its {{defensive}} origins, {{the standard}} {{way to play}} Ranging Rook openings is for the player to close their bishop (角) diagonal with a pawn (歩) advanced to the 6f square when played by Black (先手) or advanced to 4d when played by White (後手). Thus, Ranging Rook is sometimes termed Ordinary Ranging Rook or Normal Ranging Rook (ノーマル振り飛車 nōmaru furibisha) or Standard Ranging Rook (スタンダード振り飛車 sutandādo furibisha) to contrast with the newer Ranging Rook strategies that keep their bishop diagonal open. Since the traditional Ranging Rook prevents early bishop exchanges, it {{is described as a}} slow game (持久戦 jikyūsen) in Japanese.
