5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; there are risks associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be discarded. Finally, a business would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies {{tend to be the}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E
