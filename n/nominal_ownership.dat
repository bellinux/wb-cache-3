6000|$|Mr. Billow was {{supposed}} to be a retired watchmaker, living upon his savings, but he was in reality engaged in a far more profitable trade than that had ever been. At various times of the day ill-looking fellows would lounge in at the little front gate, and instead of going up the stairs to the front door, would knock at the window, and be admitted by a little door under the steps into the kitchen. Mr. Billow would then postpone his sleep for a few minutes, tell Mrs. Billow to [...] "hook it;" [...] and when alone, would enter into a low but animated conversation with his visitors, who had generally small parcels of goods to display to him; the ownership of these, after much altercation, generally changed hands--that is to say the <b>nominal</b> <b>ownership,</b> the real owner being some third person, whose rights and interests were entirely unrepresented and overlooked. Sometimes men would come in the same way late of an evening, with a bundle too large to be carried openly through the streets in the broad daylight; and on all these occasions Mrs. Billow was dismissed while the conversation was going on. Once, too, at three or four in the morning, Robert Gregory hearing a noise below, went down, stairs and found Mr. Billow engaged over a fire in the kitchen, apparently cooking. Finding that all was safe, Robert had gone up to bed again, and in the morning, Mrs. Billow mentioned casually that Mr. Billow had started very early, and that Robert had found him cooking his breakfast. But Robert knew that if Mr. Billow had required breakfast at any hour, his wife would have had to get up to prepare it; he had moreover detected that the smell of the ingredients in the pot on the fire, much more resembled the fumes of melting metal, than the savory steam of Mr. Billow's breakfast. He was therefore confirmed in what he had previously strongly suspected, namely, that his landlord was neither more nor less than a receiver of stolen goods. Sophy objected to this, [...] "Why then should he let lodgings?" [...] But Robert told her, with a laugh, that this was merely a blind to deceive the police as to the character of the house. Sophy when she made this discovery, wished at once to leave their lodgings, but Robert said that it could make no difference to them what the old rogue was; that the lodgings were clean and comfortable, and that it would be a pity to change without some better reason. And so, this time against Sophy's judgment, they determined to stay for the present as they were.|$|E

In the middle {{or the end of}} the Heian period there were two types of tax. One type of tax was corvee labor under the supervision of kuni, and the other was a tax on farm products (about three percent of rice or other farm products). To evade these taxes, peasants wanted to be ruled and protected by the shōen owners, which was usually a politically influential Buddhist temple, Shinto shrine or court noble. To achieve this protection by the shōen owners, peasants donated the <b>nominal</b> land <b>ownership</b> of the fields they cultivated to shōen owners. These fields, nominally donated to the ownership of a shōen were historically called kishinchi ("donated lands"). Then the shōen owners who received [...] "donated lands" [...] from the shōmin peasant populace negotiated with the kokushi or directly with the central government and achieved tax exempt status. Most chūsei-shōen gathered vast amounts fields through the process of receiving donated lands from peasants as kishinchi.

In The Servile State, written after his party-political career {{had come to}} an end, and other works, he criticised the modern economic order and parliamentary system, advocating distributism in opposition to both capitalism and socialism. Belloc made the historical argument that distributism was not a fresh perspective or program of economics but rather a proposed return to the economics that prevailed in Europe for the thousand years when it was Catholic. He called for the dissolution of Parliament and its replacement with committees of representatives for the various sectors of society, an idea that was also popular among Fascists, under the name of corporatism. But original corporatism, sometimes called [...] "paleo-corporatism", was a system that predates capitalism and fascism. Paleo-corporatism was based around the guilds of the Middle Ages and served to appoint legislators. Neo-corporatism is a fascist system that merges the socialistic state with the capitalistic corporations and the corporations then are directed by the state, under <b>nominal</b> private <b>ownership.</b> The owners are thus effectively disappropriated, and become mere managers {{in the service of the}} State, and those who control it.

50|$|In 1950 {{the ship}} was bought by the former Russian emigre shipowner, Alexander Vlasov. Laid up for another two years, in 1952 she was renamed Castel Forte {{and sent to the}} Newport News {{shipyard}} in the United States, intended for conversion to a refrigerated cargo ship for Vlasovs Italian-managed Sitmar Line. However, this conversion was soon abandoned and the vessel returned to lay-up. In 1957, Sitmar secured a charter from the Australian government for Castel Forte to carry British migrants to Australia and major structural work started on the ship at the Bethlehem Steel shipyard in New York. The vessel was moved to Genoa in December 1957, where the interior refitting was completed in May 1958. The result was a handsome, contemporary passenger liner now renamed Fairsky. Tourist one class accommodation for a maximum of 1,461 was provided in 461 cabins over five decks. Reflecting similar arrangements in earlier company ships Fairsea and Castel Felice, Fairsky featured just seven cabins with private facilities, located forward on the Sun Deck, beneath the Bridge Deck. Air-conditioning was installed throughout the ship and a good range of comfortable public rooms was provided, mostly on the Boat Deck. Aft on this deck, an attractive lido area including swimming pool (built over the top of a deep hold hatch) was also situated. Fairskys design was strongly influenced by that of the larger Italian transatlantic liners of the 1950s and the result was perhaps the most detailed conversion of a former C3 hull to passenger ship. On 26 June 1958 the vessel commenced service from Southampton under the command of Sitmars senior Master, Captain Jorge Petrescu. Fairsky was registered in Panama under the <b>nominal</b> <b>ownership</b> of the Fairline Shipping Corporation, though remained operated by Sitmar while in Vlasov ownership.

5000|$|In the 20th century, several {{territories of}} Chechnya changed their owners several times. After the Russian Civil War, lands {{populated}} by Terek Cossacks and Russian colonists were granted to Chechens and Ingush {{as a reward}} for their support of the Bolsheviks against the White movement. However, these were not lands foreign to Chechens and Ingush. Namely, they were the Chechen lowlands and East Prigorodny (or [...] "West Ingushetia", depending on point of view). The Chechen river lowlands were an integral and indeed, necessary from an economic perspective, part of the historical Chechen nation's land- to the point that even while Cossack settlers had forced the native inhabitants out, the clans retained <b>nominal</b> <b>ownership</b> per the Chechen clan system, which they regained de facto after the revolution. Likewise, with East Prigorodny, it had simply had been transferred to Ossete rule (during the Caucasian War {{as a reward for}} the Ossete's treachery of their neighbors) but was still populated mainly by Ingush, though in some areas the Ossetes had indeed forced the original population out or otherwise eradicated it. The return of these two regions angered the Ossetes and the Cossacks, despite the fact that their [...] "ownership" [...] of the regions was disputed not only by the clan land-ownership system of the Vainakh populace, but also {{by the fact that they}} had only lived there for barely half a century, as opposed to the multiple millennia of Vainakh habitation of the two regions. Ossete presence in East Prigorodny dated back only to the 19th century, when Ossete expansion was encouraged (and aided) by the Russian state at the expense of the Ingush (see Ossetian-Ingush conflict). Even the North Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz (in Prigorodny) was actually built on the site of the Ingush town of Zaur. Likewise, as noted on this page, Vainakh presence in the Terek region is ancient in origin (despite a mass of conflicts with Turkic settlers originating with the Mongol Invasians), compared to Cossack presence which could only date back a few centuries, and even greater compared to the recent arrival of urban Russians. Later these lands were partially returned to the Russians or Ossetians, triggering wrath among the Vainakh populace (which was, in any case, being submitted to Aardakh and mass massacre by Stalin at that point). In addition, the easternmost region of Chechenia, Akkia, the land of the Akki Chechens, was taken from Chechnya, and given to Dagestan. Just as had happened in East Prigorodny, the Chechens were sent to Siberia and Central Asia, and their homes were filled (literally) with Laks and Avars, with whom they still dispute the lands of Akkia.|$|E

In other words, big {{commercial bank}}s {{turned out to}} be slow to take risk responding to the impact of Internet finance, while it was not the case with small-and-medium-sized commercial banks, which showed relatively obvious reaction. There were some explanations to this end: first, <b>nominal</b> <b>ownership</b> of big commercial banks, long chain of principal agent, and implicit government guarantee as well as the expectation of “too big to fail” would weaken the restriction of budget, leading to slow reaction to market competition (Zhixian et al. 2015). Second, big commercial banks were large in system, diverse in management level, and various in personnel structure, so they were easily to have time lag in signaling and tackling crisis (Mulherin and Boone 2000). Third, big commercial banks, generally speaking, eyed for big SOEs; while small-and-medium-sized commercial banks and Internet finance always treated micro-small-and-medium-sized enterprises as their customers. Thus, Internet finance had an ever immediate impact on small-and-medium-sized enterprises. Fourth, big commercial banks were subject to strict policies of supervision as systematically important banks. According to the study of Beltratti and Stultz (2012), the tighter the supervision was, the more prudent risk-taking behaviors those economic subjects would make. Therefore, <b>nominal</b> <b>ownership,</b> large scale, fixed customer, and special status together resulted that big commercial banks’ risk taking were slow in responding Internet finance.|$|E

The contribution {{of this paper}} is to identify and quantify the extra inflation tax on equities that results when ownership of physical capital is separated from <b>nominal</b> <b>ownership</b> of the firm in a production economy with money. We add money to the standard stochastic growth model with production and explicitly distinguish firm ownership of physical capital from household ownership of stock certificates. We prove that the effect of this distinction is to make the value of the firm equal to the firm's capital stock divided by inflation. We then derive the standard asset-pricing conditions from the consumer's Euler equations and show that the effect of inflation on asset returns differs from the effects found in other papers by the addition of a wealth tax. The wealth tax reflects the government's ability to tax the entire future dividend stream at once by taxing the real value of stock certificates, rather than taxing the dividend flow period by period. We show analytically as well as in simulations that the wealth tax effect is significant. This suggests that the presence of the wealth tax is responsible for the greater inflation anxiety in the stock market...|$|E

One area of modernization relates to the changes in law towards women, particularly changes in law toward female cohabitants. Published in 2011, the Restatement (Third) added a new Section 28, which rejected the view that it would be immoral for one cohabitant to bring suit against the other, and relaxed the restriction on recovery in unjust enrichment for 2 ̆ 2 gratuitous 2 ̆ 2 contributions. This Article reviews societal and legal changes for women since 1937 and notes that, in adding Section 28, the Restatement (Third) followed the methodology of the Restatement (First). The Article reviews the principles of restitution and demonstrates how Section 28 follows them. Section 28 is a welcome addition to the law of restitution, but the author suggests that some of the recoveries described in the illustrations are inadequate. For example, since homemaking services do not have a market value, attempting to put a monetary value on them tends to undervalue them. Limiting recovery to the value of services also ignores the concept of tracing the value of one 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to an asset and recovering the enhanced value of the asset. The name in which the assets are titled should not negate the value of the contributions of the partner without <b>nominal</b> <b>ownership.</b> On the other hand, some illustrations to Section 28 describe adequate remedies, including sharing assets. The author notes the complexity inherent in measuring value in nonmarket, nonmarriage situations, but recommends that the illustrations with the more generous recoveries are appropriate for avoiding the unjust enrichment of one partner...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{consider}} the organization of the most representative unit of business in Japan during the Tokugawa period (1600 - 1868), the merchant house, through a comparison with pre-industrial firms from the Low Countries, the present Belgium and Netherlands. It is accepted that Tokugawa Japan possessed a well-developed commercial economy. Business organization applied by merchants from the Low Countries ranked among the most advanced in sixteenth and seventeenth century Europe. In my dissertation the method of comparative history is applied in order to highlight the common characteristics and peculiarities in the organization of firms in early modem Europe and Japan. Previous historical studies on Japanese merchant houses and comparisons with Europe have concentrated, first, on organizational aspects of the ie as an early modem Japanese type of commercial concern; these works were aimed at seeking the origins of contemporary Japanese-style management, or at discovering characteristics of the joint-stock company such as incorporation, limited liability, perpetual succession, and personal separation of management and ownership in Tokugawa merchant houses. A second current of works has focused on the role of collectivism in ie-organization, and specifically its function in modernization, as opposed to the individualism characteristic for western development. A third group of previously conducted studies considered the position of the family in the firm: although in both Europe and Japan the institution of the family served to ensure the continuity of the business, in the West the firm was subordinate to family interests, while in Japan the opposite held true. In order to assess these suggestions and offer a modified view of the role of the ie-concept in the Tokugawa merchant class, I compare characteristics of Japanese commercial houses with prevailing forms of business organization in Europe. The present study focuses on the following three points. (1) Type of business enterprise or external organization; (2) configuration of leadership and representation or internal organization; and (3) continuity of the firm and the role of family, inheritance and succession. My dissertation centers on a number of case studies concerning representative Japanese merchant families having their origin in the beginning of the early modern period. The case of Mitsui can be considered an ideal type of merchant house organization and centralized family management. In order to get a more balanced view, I add other examples, such as Izumiya-Sumitomo, an enterprise ruled as one household or ie, and the Nakai conglomerate of merchant firms originating from the Omi region. The case of Izumiya in particular offers a valuable insight into the inner workings of a large-scale concern. In addition to scholarly publications by Yasuoka Shigeaki, Miyamoto Mataji, Nakase Toshikazu, Egashira Tsuneharu and others, I examine house codes and constitutions related to organization, succession and inheritance. As a third source of information on internal merchant organization, I make use of the Oshioki reiruishtt, a collection of Tokugawa juridical verdicts and punishments, in particular on the Izumiya house feud. I further utilize examples from representative mercantile firms which were based in the Low Countries and active in international trade with Italy and Spain such as the De Groote, the delta Faille and the Van Immerseel. In addition to some samples of company contracts and testaments gathered from the archives of the Antwerp Municipal Archives and Court of Bankruptcy (Insolvente Boedelskamer), I draw on the secondary works of Roland Baetens, Wilfiid Brulez, J. Everaert and Eddy Stols. An important supplementary source is the customary commercial law of the city of Antwerp, the so-called Costumen van Antwerpen, codified in 1582 and 1608. In the second chapter I examine common types of early modem business enterprise in Europe and Japan and argue that it is important to consider the one-man firm, the partnership and the participation technique as the principal patterns. In Europe, shareholding in other firms or participation (participatie) was integrated in the private enterprise as well as the partnership. It allowed an investor or secret partner to place his money in the hands of a trader or a firm and share in profits without risking to lose more than the invested amount. The increased appearance of lasting firms based on a company contract is characteristic for the early modem period. In Antwerp the company as a firm with (yet imperfect) juridical personality was codified in 1582 : the formation of separate company capital in joint ownership led to the establishment of a compagnie (compaignie) or geselschap van handel. This type of enterprise remained the most commonly used form throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. A comparison with Japan reveals parallels concerning the existence of similar types of commercial enterprise. The main business form was the individual proprietorship, the private family firm, since Japanese commercial organization revolved around the ie. However, in reality partnerships based on either kinship or geographical ties were formed and also the single proprietorship was often compose of an alliance of related families. Participation in money-lending ventures became fairly common during the second half of the Tokugawa period. The absence of the legally established principle of limited liability can be considered an important difference with Europe. Nevertheless, two modes of business organization seem to confirm the de facto existence of limited responsibility: first, the system of <b>nominal</b> <b>ownership,</b> which allowed branch firms to function as independent units; and second, the limited partnership-type of merchant house organization in which branch families (bekke) participated in the money-ending activities of the main house. These practices closely resemble methods applied in early modern European firms: the establishment of independent branches, and participation in large firms. However, in view of the lack of a judicial basis, the suggestion that large merchant houses embodied aspects of limited responsibility, needs to be corroborated by additional evidence. More illustrations are required to substantiate both legal consequences of noon shop ownership to liability, and the possible existence of internally agreed limited liability comparable to European modes of operation. The third chapter examines the internal organization of the unit of business. During Europe 2 ̆ 7 s early modem period a shift occurred from the centralized, vertically organized firm to a decentralized, horizontally organized partnership. The former was usually headed by a pater familias, and relied on representation abroad by salaried factors, often sons or other kin, who were in charge of the local branches. Gradually more partnerships between equal partners were established. However, due to the expanded international business environment, independent subsidiaries and temporary agents working on commission (commissionairs) replaced the permanent representatives. The overall size of the firm decreased and a low degree of managerial delegation was characteristic. Management based on consultation was the contractual prerequisite, although in reality the associate who made the highest investment possessed the decisive say in management and functioned as the main coordinator of business. Also larger manufacturing enterprises, such as the Plantin-Moretus printing business, showed little separation betweenownership and control. In Japan, a reverse development can be observed in the expansion of the firm from the middle of the Tokugawa period onwards. The early separation between management and ownership and the extensive delegation of authority to salaried managers are often quoted as chief features of early modem Japanese business history. The institutionalization of consultation and the establishment of administrative bodies reduced the power of managers. On the basis of data provided by an examination of Sumitomo 2 ̆ 7 s development, I describe how the coexistence of a high degree of managerial delegation and the preservation of control by the family members constituted a salient characteristic. The Izumiya feud further reveals the conflict between the ideal of ie-collectivism and joint-management on the one hand, and personal interests leading to the formation of opposing factions on the other. The fourth chapter studies the continuity of the enterprise and the role of the family, inheritance and succession in Europe and Japan. Scholarly works often juxtapose the "perpetual existence" of Japanese houses and the a priori limited continuance of European firms. The early modem European firm was characterized by short-term commitments; a lasting concern was actually a succession of several firms, with numerous contract renewals, new partners, and diverse investors. Unlimited liability of the associates in a partnership was a factor contributing to that periodic character. Normally the partnership ended with the death of an associate. Discontinuation of the firm before the end of the contractual period was not infrequently avoided through the appointment of a successor in testaments and company contracts, or the contractual provision that associates in the partnership could continue the legacy of the deceased for the benefit of the heirs. the tendency to prevent litigation was one interesting contractual clause that aimed at promoting continuity. Family firms offered more opportunities and incentives for reinvestment of capital and pursuit of continuity, since the social status of the family was directly linked to the prosperity of the firm. In the Low Countries inheritance usually implied a division of the family estate. Efforts were made, however, to ensure the continuance of the firm through a number of methods. One or more successors to the firm title could be assigned beforehand; the widow could succeed her husband as head of the business or as partner. Occasionally undivided inheritance was stipulated in the will. Nevertheless, it is more important to consider the family and kinship relations as a means to pool capital and promote loyalty. The business was an instrument to acquire personal profit and to elevate family status. In Japan, on the other hand, the ie, including the business, was supposed to endure forever. Tokugawa society offered few chances for social promotion, so the prosperity of the ie became a goal in itself. Constant reinvestment and specialization in one central business were characteristic. Inheritance was ideally canted out as one undivided whole and the house assets were governed with the principle of collective or joint ownership, of which the house of Mitsui is a representative example. Generally the heir to the position of household head, usually but not necessarily the eldest son, singly inherited the house assets and business at the time of his succession and became the nominal owner of the estate (katoku). Again the Izumiya-Sumitomo ie presents a rare case of disparity between succession (atoshiki sozoku), nominal transfer of the katoku as estate to the heir and actual managerial authority in the house business, after family and managers forced the head Kichizaemon to retire by an appeal to the magistrate. In the concluding chapter I argue that in Japan as well as in Europe development of business organization can be regarded as an evolution to rational management. In Europe this led to the formation of the corporation, and in Japan an expansion of the business aspect of the ie was the outcome. The Japanese ie as it existed in the merchant class was suited for business, in view of the easy capital formation and spread of risk, and even possessed certain characteristics of legal personality in se: a lasting existence and a large degree of separation between ownership andmanagement. Similarities between Japanese and European business organization concern mainly aspects of the enterprise form. The ie offered opportunities to unite trustworthy partners, join capital and diffuse risks. In Europe as well particular examples of lasting firms based on undivided business can be retrieved. On the other hand, it is misleading to put too much emphasis on the similarities between Europe and Japan, or to apply Western corporate characteristics to Tokugawa business. The Japanese merchant house faced inherent disadvantages. Limited liability could only be attained indirectly and did not have a legal foundation. Since the business was a tool to promote continuity of the ie as a whole, the owners were forced to take a long-term view and adopt conservative management policies. A further disadvantage was the ingrained possibility of conflict between management and family-owners. In contrast, the firm which originated in the Low Countries partially incorporated legally codified limited liability, but management was seldom delegated and the preservation and continuous application of capital in a lasting enterprise was problematic...|$|E
