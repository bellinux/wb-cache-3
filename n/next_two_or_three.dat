Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter {{due to the lack of}} food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} before the British debate, the Dutch had offered to {{negotiate}} between Russia and the Triple Alliance, and Auckland reported that he saw documents in which Frederick Wilhelm questioned the need for the war and expressed concerns over the militant Austrian attitude (according to Polish historian Jerzy Łojek, that was either Auckland's own or Russian misinformation, or a combination of both). The debate begun on March 29. Despite criticism from the minority opponents, like Charles Fox, the House of Commons expressed its approval for the war with Russia thrice on that day. However, over the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> days, debates within Pitt's own government resulted in a drastic change of plans. The specific reasons for this sudden conflict within Pitt's government are not fully understood; Łojek suggests it was through the influence of Fox, Auckland and the Russian diplomacy on several of its members. Pitt could have forced the issue by creating a new government, but he decided that was not a viable solution, as a crisis in the government could result in an unpredictable shift of power. By mid- and late April, with William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville replacing Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds as the Foreign Secretary, the British policy was now set as pro-Russian, and anti-French.|$|E
25|$|The early Manchukuo Imperial Army {{inherited}} {{a hodgepodge of}} weapons from the former Kuomintang arsenals of the Young Marshal, which created tremendous problems with maintenance and supply. For example, there were 26 kinds of rifles and over 20 kinds of pistols in use in 1932. A priority was made to unify weaponry around the Arisaka Type 38 Rifle as a standard, along with the Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun and Type 11 Light Machine Gun. Artillery units were to be equipped with the Type 38 Field Gun and Type 41 75 mm Mountain Gun. By 1935, 50,000 Type 38 cavalry rifles had been imported from Japan and the machine guns were replaced over the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years. By {{the start of the}} Pacific War, the weaponry of the Manchukuo Imperial Army was the almost same as the Japanese Army. Mauser pistols were used by soldiers and Browning and Colt pistols were used by the officers. The rear-line defense units and militias were given captured Chinese and out-dated Japanese rifles. Some ZB-30 machine guns, popular among the Nationalists, found their way into Manchukuoan service, along with Japanese copies of German and French models. IN 1936 some of the ZBs were replaced by Type 11 light machine guns. By 1933, the number of guns in service was 77,268 rifles, 441 light machine guns and 329 heavy machine guns.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how money market news headlines {{can be used}} to forecast intraday currency exchange rate movements. The innovation of the approach is that, unlike analysis based on quantifiable information, the forecasts are produced from text describing the current status of world financial markets, as well as political and general economic news. In contrast to numeric time series data textual data contains not only the effect (e. g., the dollar rises against the Deutschmark) but also the possible causes of the event (e. g., because of a weak German bond market). Hence improved predictions are expected from this richer input. The output is a categorical forecast about currency exchange rates: the dollar moves up, remains steady or goes down within the <b>next</b> one, <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> hours respectively. On a publicly available commercial data set the system produces results that are significantly better than random prediction. The contribution of this research is the smart modeling of the prediction problem enabling the use of content rich text for forecasting purposes...|$|R

40|$|Particular moments {{during a}} game of {{basketball}} can affect a team&# 039;s probability of winning. Often, a player&# 039;s performance can be subjectively scrutinised {{for their ability to}} perform during these critical moments. However, identifying the moments that are most critical to a team&# 039;s chances of winning can be difficult. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the importance of points during a basketball game using a Brownian motion. Closely related to a random walk, and originally used to model the random motion of particles suspended in fluid, Brownian motion has been found in past research to provide a reasonable estimate of the win probability of a team during a basketball game, given the time remaining and the difference in score. By adjusting these probabilities and using an existing definition of point importance from tennis, it is possible to calculate the importance of particular points {{during a game}} of NBA basketball. Results from games across six seasons of NBA basketball suggest that the point importance can be reasonably quantified by using the Brownian motion. Furthermore, the point importance can be broken down into the importance of scoring the <b>next</b> one, <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> points. An exploration of these three components indicate that the three-point shot always has a greater importance than either a one-point shot or a two-point shot. We believe that the knowledge of point importance in basketball could be an effective tool in evaluating player performance...|$|R

Richard Burbage, after [...] "scornfully and disdainfully playing with Nicholas Bishop's nose", {{threatened}} to beat him also. At that point Cuthbert Burbage arrived, and threatened the intruders with [...] "great and horrible oaths". They were then violently thrust out of the yard. Some of the actors were attracted by the tumult, among them John Alleyn, brother of Edward Alleyn, who also put in a word for the widow Brayne, to no avail. The Admiral's Men, of which the Alleyn brothers were members, subsequently withdrew from the Theatre and went across the river to play at Henslowe's theatre. On 28 November Margaret Brayne had James Burbage arrested for being in contempt of the court order, and for the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years there was a lengthy investigation into the contempt issue which was still ongoing when Margaret Brayne died of plague in late April 1593.

40|$|Three {{negative}} reinforcement experiments employing a key-peck response are described. In Experiment I, pigeons shocked {{on the average}} of twice per minute (imposed condition) could produce, by pecking a key, an alternate condition with correlated stimuli. Delayed shocks were added, across sessions, to the alternate condition until pecking stopped. Two of three pigeons continued to peck despite a 100 % increase in shock frequency. In Experiment II, pigeons were shocked in the imposed condition four times per minute. The postresponse delay to shock was held constant by delivering, in the alternate condition, the next shock, <b>or</b> the <b>next</b> <b>two,</b> <b>three,</b> <b>or</b> four shocks from the imposed-condition shock schedule. All three subjects continued to peck with no change in delay to the first two postresponse shocks but with a 75 % reduction in shock frequency. In Experiment III, a response produced an immediate shock followed by a shock-free period. Three of four subjects continued to respond despite reduced delay to shock. Delay-to-shock or shock-frequency reduction was sufficient to maintain key pecking, but neither was necessary. The conditions that negatively reinforce the pigeon's key peck were similar to conditions that negatively reinforce the rat's bar press...|$|R
60|$|I had no {{intention}} of letting Pickering go without reminding him of our old acquaintance. He had been a very singular boy, and I was curious to see what had become of his singularity. I looked for him the <b>next</b> morning at <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> of the hotels, and at last I discovered his whereabouts. But he was out, the waiter said; he had gone to walk an hour before. I went my way, confident that I should meet him in the evening. It was the rule with the Homburg world to spend its evenings at the Kursaal, and Pickering, apparently, had already discovered a good reason for not being an exception. One of the charms of Homburg is the fact that of a hot day you may walk about for a whole afternoon in unbroken shade. The umbrageous gardens of the Kursaal mingle with the charming Hardtwald, which in turn melts away into the wooded slopes of the Taunus Mountains. To the Hardtwald I bent my steps, and strolled for an hour through mossy glades and the still, perpendicular gloom of the fir-woods. Suddenly, on the grassy margin of a by-path, I came upon a young man stretched at his length in the sun-checkered shade, and kicking his heels towards a patch of blue sky. My step was so noiseless on the turf that, before he saw me, I had time to recognise Pickering again. He {{looked as if he had}} been lounging there for some time; his hair was tossed about as if he had been sleeping; on the grass near him, beside his hat and stick, lay a sealed letter. When he perceived me he jerked himself forward, and I stood looking at him without introducing myself--purposely, to give him a chance to recognise me. He put on his glasses, being awkwardly near-sighted, and stared up at me with an air of general trustfulness, but without a sign of knowing me. So at last I introduced myself. Then he jumped up and grasped my hands, and stared and blushed and laughed, and began a dozen random questions, ending with a demand as to how in the world I had known him.|$|R
