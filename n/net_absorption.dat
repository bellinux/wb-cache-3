From these data, <b>net</b> bicarbonate <b>absorption</b> was divided into two parallel components: proton secretion and passive bicarbonate diffusion. The rate of <b>net</b> bicarbonate <b>absorption</b> was similar in hydropenic and volume-expanded rats when tubules were perfused with 24 mM bicarbonate, but was inhibited in volume-expanded rats when tubules were perfused with 5 mM bicarbonate. Volume expansion caused a 50 % increase in bicarbonate permeability, which totally accounted for the above inhibition. The rate of proton secretion was unaffected by volume expansion in both studies. The rate of <b>net</b> bicarbonate <b>absorption</b> was markedly inhibited in alkalotic expansion as compared with isohydric expansion. Bicarbonate permeabilities were not different in these two conditions, and the calculated rates of proton secretion were decreased by greater than 50 % in alkalosis. <b>Net</b> bicarbonate <b>absorption</b> was stimulated in acidotic rats compared to hydropenic rats. This stimulation was attributable to a 25 % increase {{in the rate of}} proton secretion. We conclude that (a) proton secretion is stimulated in acidosis, inhibited in alkalosis, and is not altered by volume status; (b) bicarbonate permeability is increased by volume expansion but is not altered by increases in plasma bicarbonate concentration; (c) when luminal bicarbonate concentrations {{are similar to those of}} plasma, <b>net</b> bicarbonate <b>absorption</b> is dominated by proton secretion and is thus sensitive to peritubular bicarbonate concentrations, and insensitive to extracellular fluid volume; (d) when luminal bicarbonate concentrations are low and proton secretion is slowed, bicarbonate permeability and thus extracellular fluid volume have a greater influence on <b>net</b> bicarbonate <b>absorption...</b>|$|R

The <b>net</b> GI <b>absorption</b> of alkali was estimated from the difference between simple urinary cations (Ca, Mg, Na, and K) and anions (Cl and P). In 131 normal subjects, the 24 h urinary citrate was positively correlated with the <b>net</b> GI <b>absorption</b> of alkali (r = 0. 49, p < 0. 001). In 11 patients with distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), urinary citrate excretion was subnormal relative to <b>net</b> GI alkali <b>absorption,</b> with data from most patients residing outside the 95 % confidence ellipse described for normal subjects. However, the normal relationship between urinary citrate and net absorbed alkali was maintained in 11 patients with chronic diarrheal syndrome (CDS) and in 124 stone-forming patients devoid of RTA or CDS, half of whom had "idiopathic" hypocitraturia.

Both urinary citrate and <b>net</b> GI alkali <b>absorption</b> increased, yielding a significantly positive correlation (r = 0. 62, p < 0. 0001), with the slope indistinguishable from that of normal subjects.

We {{have studied the}} effects of deoxycorticosterone, arginine vasopressin, and bradykinin on net transepithelial sodium and potassium transport in isolated, perfused rat cortical collecting ducts. Chronic administration of deoxycorticosterone to rats increased both sodium absorption and potassium secretion above very low basal levels. Consequently, deoxycorticosterone-treated rats were used for all remaining studies. Arginine vasopressin (10 - 10 M in the bath) caused a sustained fourfold increase in <b>net</b> sodium <b>absorption</b> and a sustained threefold increase in net potassium secretion.

Normal subjects were studied for comparison. The amount of calcium secreted into the duodenum by the digestive glands was found to be trivial compared to the calcium content of normal or even low calcium meals; therefore, values for net and true <b>net</b> calcium <b>absorption</b> differed only slightly. There was a linear correlation between true <b>net</b> calcium <b>absorption</b> and serum 1, 25 -D concentration. By extrapolating the short distance to a zero value for serum 1, 25 -D, D-independent true <b>net</b> calcium <b>absorption</b> was estimated. By subtracting D independent from true <b>net</b> calcium <b>absorption,</b> values for D-dependent absorption were obtained. For a given level of meal calcium intake, D-dependent calcium absorption was found to be directly proportional to serum 1, 25 -D concentration. At any given value for serum 1, 25 -D, absorption via the D-dependent mechanism was approximately the same with a low (120 mg) calcium meal as it was when meal calcium intake was increased to 300 mg. We interpret this to mean that the D-dependent mechanism is saturated or nearly saturated by low calcium meals. The D-independent absorption/secretion mechanism resulted in secretion (a loss of body calcium in the feces) when intake was low (120 mg per meal) and absorption when intake was normal. All of the increment in calcium absorption that occurs when low or normal calcium meals are supplemented with extra calcium is mediated by the D-independent mechanism...|$|R

To determine which anions are affected by these agents, we perfused cortical collecting ducts from rats treated with deoxycorticosterone and measured net chloride flux, net bicarbonate flux (measured as total CO 2), transepithelial voltage, {{and the rate of}} fluid absorption. Arginine vasopressin (10 (- 10) M in the peritubular bath) caused a sustained sixfold increase in <b>net</b> chloride <b>absorption</b> and a two- to threefold increase in the magnitude of the lumen negative transepithelial voltage. Before addition of vasopressin, the tubules secreted bicarbonate.

Infection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) results in fluid secretion and electrolyte losses in the small intestine. In the present study the effect of processed and fermented soyabean products on <b>net</b> <b>absorption</b> during ETEC infection was investigated. Soyabean was processed into an autoclaved, a cooked and a mould-fermented (tempeh) product. The soyabean products were pre-digested and the effect of the products on <b>net</b> <b>absorption</b> in the small intestine of piglets was studied. Pairs of small-intestinal segments, one non-infected and the other ETEC-infected, were perfused simultaneously with the different products during 8 h. <b>Net</b> <b>absorption</b> of fluid, DM, Na, chloride, K and total solutes was determined. Net fluid absorption was highest for cooked soyabean followed by autoclaved soyabean and tempeh {{as a result of the}} osmolality of these products. In ETEC-infected segments, cooked soyabean and tempeh showed minor fluid losses (27 (se 23) and 43 (se 20) ¿l/cm 2, respectively) compared with the saline control (260 (se 23) ¿l/cm 2). Tempeh resulted in a high uptake of solutes. Processed soyabean products, particularly cooked soyabean and tempeh, are beneficial in maintaining fluid balance during ETEC infection. Additionally, tempeh showed high DM and total solute absorption. Therefore, particularly, tempeh may be beneficial in the case of post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets and possibly in children as wel...|$|E
40|$|A {{perfusion}} {{technique has}} been used to quantitate the effect of the amino acids glycine and alanine and the dipeptides glycyl-glycine and glycyl-L-alanine on sodium and water absorption from the human jejunum. Although no <b>net</b> <b>absorption</b> of sodium and water was seen in the absence of non-electrolytes, a significant stimulation occurred in the presence of both free amino acids and dipeptides. In the case of glycine and alanine, sodium and water absorption increased linearly with increasing concentration of the amino acid and saturation was not demonstrated over the range of concentrations studied. Molar ratios for <b>net</b> <b>absorption</b> of free amino acid and sodium were approximately 1 : 1 for all but the highest concentration of alanine. In contrast, the corresponding molar ratios for the two dipeptide solutions and sodium were approximately 1 : 2. Possible explanations for these observations are discussed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Net</b> Cl- <b>absorption</b> in {{the mouse}} {{medullary}} thick ascending limb of Henle (mTALH) involves a furosemide-sensitive Na+:K+: 2 Cl- apical membrane symport mechanism for salt entry into cells, which occurs {{in parallel with}} a Ba++-sensitive apical K+ conductance. The present studies, using the in vitro microperfused mouse mTALH, assessed the concentration dependence of blockade of this apical membrane K+-conductive pathway by Ba++ to provide estimates of the magnitudes of the transcellular (Gc) and paracellular (Gs) electrical conductances (millisiemens per square centimeter). These studies also evaluated the effects of luminal hypertonicity produced by urea on the paracellular electrical conductance, the electrical Na+/Cl- permselectivity ratio, and the morphology of in vitro mTALH segments exposed to peritubular antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Increasing luminal Ba++ concentrations, {{in the absence of}} luminal K+, produced a progressive reduction in the transcellular conductance that was maximal at 20 mM Ba++. The Ba++- sensitive transcellular conductance in the presence of ADH was 61. 8 +/- 1. 7 mS/cm 2, or approximately 65 % of the total transepithelial conductance. In phenomenological terms, the luminal Ba++-dependent blockade of the transcellular conductance exhibited negative cooperativity. The transepithelial osmotic gradient produced by luminal urea produced blebs on apical surfaces, a striking increase in shunt conductance, and a decrease in the shunt Na+/Cl- permselectivity (PNa/PCl), which approached that of free solution. The transepithelial conductance obtained with luminal 800 mM urea, 20 mM Ba++, and 0 K+ was 950 +/- 150 mS/cm 2 and provided an estimate of the maximal diffusion resistance of intercellular spaces, exclusive of junctional complexes. The calculated range for junctional dilution voltages owing to interspace salt accumulation during ADH-dependent <b>net</b> NaCl <b>absorption</b> was 0. 7 - 1. 1 mV. Since the Ve accompanying ADH-dependent <b>net</b> NaCl <b>absorption</b> is 10 mV, lumen positive, virtually all of the spontaneous transepithelial voltage in the mouse mTALH is due to transcellular transport processes. Finally, we developed a series of expressions in which the ratio of <b>net</b> Cl- <b>absorption</b> to paracellular Na+ absorption could be expressed in terms of a series of electrical variables. Specifically, an analysis of paired measurement of PNa/PCl and Gs was in agreement with an electroneutral Na+:K+: 2 Cl- apical entry step. Thus, for <b>net</b> NaCl <b>absorption,</b> approximately 50 % of Na+ was absorbed via a paracellular route...|$|R
