The ED 300 mm f/4 IS Pro has an excellent image quality with low aberration, low distortion and almost no visible vignetting.|$|E
5000|$|In {{photography}} and cinematography, perspective distortion is a warping or transformation {{of an object}} and its surrounding area that differs significantly from what the object would look like with a <b>normal</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length,</b> due to the relative scale of nearby and distant features. Perspective distortion {{is determined by the}} relative distances at which the image is captured and viewed, and is due to the angle of view of the image (as captured) being either wider or narrower than the angle of view at which the image is viewed, hence the apparent relative distances differing from what is expected. Related to this concept is axial magnification -- the perceived depth of objects at a given magnification.|$|E
5000|$|Good-quality lenses with maximum {{aperture}} {{no greater}} than f/2.8 and fixed, <b>normal,</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> {{need at least}} three (triplet) or four elements (the trade name [...] "Tessar" [...] derives from the Greek tessera, meaning [...] "four"). The widest-range zooms often have fifteen or more. The reflection of light {{at each of the}} many interfaces between different optical media (air, glass, plastic) seriously degraded the contrast and color saturation of early lenses, particularly zoom lenses, especially where the lens was directly illuminated by a light source. The introduction many years ago of optical coatings, and advances in coating technology over the years, have resulted in major improvements, and modern high-quality zoom lenses give images of quite acceptable contrast, although zoom lenses with many elements will transmit less light than lenses made with fewer elements (all other factors such as aperture, focal length, and coatings being equal).|$|E

The 400 HZ power supply in the electronics unit assembly was replaced with two DC/DC converters to enable operation from 28 VDC spacecraft-type power sources. Nonessential circuit functions were deleted to minimize input power requirements. The <b>normal</b> 31 mm <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> lense assemblies were replaced with wider field-of-view 19 mm <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> lenses. Base plates for and housings were redesigned to facilitate mounting and heat-sinking of the camera in the space environment and short length (14 ") adapter cables were designed, fabricated, and tested to meet requirements for cameras configured to mount on the astronauts helmet/visor assembly.

5000|$|The {{complexity}} of a lens — {{the number of}} elements and their degree of asphericity — depends upon the angle of view, the maximum aperture, and intended price point, among other variables. An extreme wideangle lens of large aperture must be of very complex construction to correct for optical aberrations, which are worse {{at the edge of}} the field and when the edge of a large lens is used for image-forming. A long-focus lens of small aperture can be of very simple construction to attain comparable image quality: a doublet (two elements) will often suffice. Some older cameras were fitted with convertible lenses (German: [...] ) of <b>normal</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> The front element could be unscrewed, leaving a lens of twice the focal length, and half the angle of view and half the aperture. The simpler half-lens was of adequate quality for the narrow angle of view and small relative aperture. Obviously the bellows had to extend to twice the normal length.|$|E
50|$|Quoted 35 mm {{equivalent}} <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> typically ignore {{depth of}} field (DOF), which depends on both <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and aperture. The perceived DOF of smaller sensors is deeper due to the shorter <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> lenses.|$|R
50|$|The two {{fundamental}} parameters of an optical lens are the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and the maximum aperture. The lens' <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> determines the magnification {{of the image}} projected onto the image plane, and the aperture the light intensity of that image. For a given photographic system the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> determines the angle of view, short <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> giving a wider field of view than longer <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> lenses. A wider aperture, identified by a smaller f-number, allows using a faster shutter speed for the same exposure.|$|R

50|$|The narrowness of {{the band}} of colors that a {{monochromator}} can generate {{is related to the}} <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of the monochromator collimators.

Lenses are characterized by their focal length: a converging lens has positive <b>focal</b> <b>length,</b> while a diverging lens has negative <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> Smaller <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> indicates that the lens has a stronger converging or diverging effect.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of effective camera <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> {{is crucial to}} the success of panoramic image stitching. Fast techniques for estimating the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> exist, but are dependent upon a close initial approximation or the existence of a full circle panoramic image sequence. Numerical solutions of the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> demonstrate strong coupling between the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and the angles used to position each component image about the common spherical center. This paper demonstrates that parameterizing image position using distance over the sphere surface instead of angles effectively decouples the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> from the image position. This new parameterization does not require an initial <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> estimate for quick convergence, nor does it require a full circle panorama in order to refine the <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> Experiments with synthetic and real image sets demonstrate the robustness of the method and a speedup of 5 to 20 times over angle based positioning...|$|R

50|$|One can {{see that}} if {{magnification}} remains constant, a longer <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> results in a smaller axial magnification, and a smaller <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> a larger axial magnification. That is, when using a longer <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> while moving the camera/lens away from the object to maintain the same magnification M, objects seem shallower, and the axial distances between objects seem shorter. The opposite-- increased axial magnification -- happens with shorter <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> while moving the camera/lens towards the object.|$|R
