2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Windows 98, Microsoft {{released}} a Critical Update Notification Tool (later called Critical Update Notification Utility) through Windows Update, which installed a background tool on the user's computer that checked the Windows Update web site on a regular schedule for new updates that have been marked as [...] "Critical". [...] By default, this check occurred every five minutes, and when Internet Explorer was started, though the user could configure the <b>next</b> <b>check</b> to occur only at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week. The check was performed by querying the server for a file, [...] "cucif.cab", which contains {{a list of all the}} critical updates released for the user's operating system. [...] The Critical Update Notification Tool then compared this list with the list of installed updates on the user's machine, and displayed a message to the user informing them of new critical updates if they were available. [...] Once the check executed, any custom schedule defined by the user was reverted to the default; Microsoft stated that this was by design in order to ensure that users received notification of critical updates in a timely manner.|$|E
2500|$|The {{letter was}} {{delivered}} {{in an envelope}} that had a small hexagonal emblem with the letters [...] "N.Y.P.C.B.A." [...] representing [...] "New York Private Chauffeur's Benevolent Association". A janitor at the company told the police he had taken some of the stationery home but left it at his rooming house at 200 East 52nd Street when he moved out. The landlady of the rooming house said that Fish checked out of that room a few days earlier. She said that Fish's son sent him money and {{he asked her to}} hold his <b>next</b> <b>check</b> for him. William F. King was the chief investigator for the case. He waited outside the room until Fish returned. Fish agreed to go to headquarters for questioning, then brandished a razor blade. King disarmed Fish and took him to police headquarters. Fish made no attempt to deny the murder of Grace Budd, saying that he meant to go to the house to kill Edward Budd, Grace's brother. Fish said it [...] "never even entered [...] head" [...] to rape the girl, but he later claimed to his attorney that, while kneeling on Grace's chest and strangling her, he did have two involuntary ejaculations. This information was used at trial to make the claim the kidnapping was sexually motivated, thus avoiding any mention of cannibalism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Galliwasp is a {{goal-directed}} {{implementation of}} answer set programming. Unlike other answer set solvers, Galliwasp computes partial answer sets which are provably extensible to full answer sets. Galliwasp can execute arbitrary answer set programs in a top-down {{manner similar to}} SLD resolution. Galliwasp generates candidate answer sets by executing ordinary rules in a top-down, goal-directed manner using coinduction. Galliwasp <b>next</b> <b>checks</b> if the candidate answer sets are consistent with restrictions imposed by OLON rules. Those that are consistent are reported as solutions. Execution efficiency is significantly improved by performing the consistency check incrementally, i. e., as soon as {{an element of the}} candidate answer set is generated. We discuss the design of the Galliwasp system and its implementation. Galliwasp’s performance figures, which are comparable to other popular answer set solvers, are also presented. ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{now well}} strung out on {{approach}} to Piteşti, all five groups {{would make the}} navigational check point 65 mi from Ploiești. At Câmpina, the 389th Bomb Group departed as planned for its separate but synchronous approach to the mission target. Continuing from Piteşti, Col. Keith K. Compton and Gen. Ent made a navigational judgment that would prove especially costly. At Târgovişte, halfway to the <b>next</b> <b>check</b> point at Floreşti, Compton followed the incorrect railway line for his turn toward Ploiești, setting his group and Lt. Col. Addison Baker's 93rd Bomb Group on a course for Bucharest. In the process, Ent and Compton went {{against the advice of}} their airplane's navigator and the Halverson Project (HALPRO) veteran Cpt. Harold Wicklund. Now {{in the face of an}} impending disaster, many crews chose to break radio silence and draw attention to the navigational error. Meanwhile, both groups flew headlong into Gerstenberg's extensive air defenses around the Bucharest area, which they would now face in addition to those still awaiting them around Ploiești.|$|E

The new checking point has steepest descent character because the searching path is the gradient of the approximate surface. An example shows that the method presented in this article has well precision.

40|$|Abstract—Arbiters are {{commonly}} used components in elec-tronic systems to control access to shared resources. In this paper, we describe a novel method to check starvation in ran-dom priority-based arbiters. Typical implementations of random priority-based arbiters use pseudo-random number generators such as linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) which makes them sequentially deep precluding a direct analysis of the design. The proposed technique checks a stronger bounded-starvation property; if the stronger property fails, we use the counter-example to construct an underapproximation abstraction. We <b>next</b> <b>check</b> the original property on the abstraction to check for its validity. We have found the approach {{to be a very}} effective bug hunting technique to reveal starvation issues in LFSR-based arbiters.
