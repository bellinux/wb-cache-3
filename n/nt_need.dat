40|$|During the {{six years}} {{operation}} of the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME), LASP's mission analysis system has determined the attitude of this spinner to 0. 03 ° rms. Suggestions to improve future system designs to achieve more accuracy are given in terms of: 1. Thermal expansion control. 2. Reduction of eddy current drag. 3. Reduction of aerodynamic torques. 4. Averaging of horizon sensor data. 5. Use of a star scanner. 6. Commandable dynamic balance adjustments. Accuracy of 0. 001 ° seems possible and {{will be discussed in}} the context of geomagnetic mapping. I NTRODUCTI ON Spin-stabilization with magnetic torquing provides a low cost method of attitude control •. Our experience with such a system, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME), is reviewed here and system design suggestions are given for improved attitude determination. SME, launched in October, 1981, is still being operated by students and scientists of the University of Colorado. The mission operations software and has been kept up to date and now can be run on a micro VAX or a SUN work station, providing "mission ops,in a suitcase". The attitude of SME is adjusted only once or twice a day by ground control, allowing several orbits of data in which the attitude varies smoothly, without discontinuities. Averaging horizon sensor pulses over an orbit provides ar accuracy of 0. 03 ° rms, thi rty times better than traditional spinners The three sigma accuracy of 0. 1 ° promised by Ball Aerospace for spinners is thus proven state of the art. By replacing the IR horizon sensor by a star scanner or star camera, one could obtain even higher accuracies. APPLICATION TO GEOMAGNETIC MONITORING To set a goal for improved attitude determination, we shall use the example of a geomagnetic mapping mission. To obtain full earth coverage, a polar orbit with the spin axis towards Polaris would be ideal. To improve on the current knowledge of the geomagnetic field, vector measurements with a precision of one nT out of a maximum component of 50, 000 <b>nT</b> <b>need</b> to be made. This impl ies an accuracy in attitude of 0. 001 °. The component of field perpendicular to the spin axis is rotating, requiring a measurement of the phase of the AC signal to 0. 001 °...|$|E

40|$|Conservation tillage {{techniques}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular worldwide as they {{have the potential to}} generate environmental, agronomic, and economic benefits. In Mediterranean areas, studies performed on the effects of conservation tillage [in comparison with the conventional tillage technique (CT) ] on grain yield of cereal crops have reported contradictory results as well as considerable year-to-year variation, demonstrating how the impact of different soil tillage techniques on crop productivity is strongly site-specific. The present paper summarises the main results from a set of experiments carried out in Sicily during the last 20 years in which we compared no tillage (NT) to CT in terms of their respective effects on the productivity and quality of durum wheat, {{while at the same time}} varying some other crop management practices (e. g. crop sequence, N fertilisation, wheat genotype, sowing time). On average, no differences were observed between the two tillage techniques; yields were 3. 84 and 3. 87 Mg ha – 1 for CT and NT, respectively. However, NT guaranteed superior yield when water stress during the crop cycle was high, whereas CT led to higher yields when water availability was adequate. Moreover, the results suggest that the use of <b>NT</b> <b>needs</b> to be accompanied by a rational crop sequence. In fact, a cumulative detrimental effect of NT over time was found for continuous wheat. Finally, grain quality in terms of protein content was slightly higher for CT (15. 1 %) than NT (14. 4 %). Thus, when using NT, the rate of nitrogen fertiliser application should be increased to offset this difference...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The nasopharyngeal tube (NT) is a {{potential}} interface for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) available in all health care centers. The aim {{of the study was}} to describe our experience in the use of the NT for bi-level NIV in infants and its effectiveness. METHODS: Prospective obser-vational study from January 2007 to December 2010, including all patients< 6 months old admitted to the pediatric ICU (PICU) and treated with NIV with two levels of pressure using the NT. Clinical data collected before starting NIV, and at 2, 8, 12 and 24 h, were analyzed following NIV initiation: first-line or initial NIV (i-NIV), elective postextubation NIV (e-NIV), and rescue postextubation NIV (r-NIV). The need for intubation was considered to be NIV failure. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one episodes of NIV were included in the study, with 65 % of patients having bronchiolitis. e-NIV was most frequently used (48 %) (i-NIV 44 %, r-NIV 8 %), and the failure rate, 27 % in total, was highest in the i-NIV group (37 %) (e-NIV 18 %, r-NIV 25 %). Case patients with successful outcomes had shorter PICU stays (8. 5 vs 13 d, P. 001) and hospital stays (17 vs 23 d, P. 03) stays. The <b>NT</b> <b>needed</b> to be changed for another interface in only 5 case patients, few complications (4 of 151 patients) were observed, and mortality (2 of 151 patients) was unrelated to NIV. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the NT showed 73 % effectiveness, with few complications. The effective-ness was higher in e-NIV than i-NIV.

Objective: This paper aims to review evidence-based data {{on the use of}} NTs in TRD. Method: Using keywords and combined-word strategy, multiple computer searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, Quertle(R), and Medline were conducted for retrieving relevant articles published in English-language peer-reviewed journals (2000 &ndash; 2012). Those papers that addressed NTs in TRD were retained for extensive review. Results: Despite methodological challenges, a range of 30 %&ndash; 93 % of TRD patients showed substantial improvement to one of the NTs. One hundred&ndash;percent improvement was reported in two single-case studies on deep brain stimulation. Some studies reported no benefits from transcranial direct current stimulation. NTs were reported to have good clinical efficacy, better safety margin, and benign side-effect profile. Data are limited regarding randomized clinical trials, long-term efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of these approaches. Both modified electroconvulsive therapy and magnetic seizure therapy were associated with reversible but disturbing neurocognitive adverse effects. Besides clinical utility, NTs including approaches on the horizon may unlock the biological basis underlying mood disorders including TRD. Conclusion: NTs are promising in patients with TRD, as the majority of them show good clinical response measured by standardized depression scales. <b>NTs</b> <b>need</b> further technological refinements and optimization together with continuing well-designed studies that recruit larger numbers of participants with TRD.

30|$|Based on the {{information}} stored in the Srcr link table, the link updater maintains its own so called neighbor table (NT), which includes information for its neighbors. Initially, the NT is empty. The updater periodically reads the Srcr link table and updates <b>NT</b> as <b>needed.</b> The <b>NT</b> contents are updated whenever (1) a new neighbor appears, (2) an existing neighbor disappears, or (3) a certain link quality changes. In such cases, the NCRAWL updater broadcasts a packet with the new NT contents and sets a timer. When such a NT packet is received (overheard) by other nodes, their corresponding updater utility replies by broadcasting its NT, provided it has not done so recently. Specifically, {{in order to avoid}} excessive network overheads due to such messaging, we leverage a NT reply suppression threshold; while the value of this threshold is tunable (and can be configured based on network and application dynamics), we set it to be equal to the Srcr broadcasting interval period. The NT packets are used by the NCRAWL updater to maintain the so called received NT table (RNTT), which complements NT by storing information about the link quality, as measured by neighbors.|$|R
40|$|Glaucoma {{and other}} optic neuropathies are {{characterized}} by a loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a cell layer located in the posterior eye segment. Several preclinical studies demonstrate that neurotrophins (NTs) prevent RGC loss.

40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and hypoglycaemic prescription in a high risk Northern Territory Aboriginal community. Background: Screening from 1992 – 1996 in this community exposed high rates of albuminuria and diabetes; beneficial effects of treatment on blood pressure, renal disease and nonrenal and renal deaths were subsequently demonstrated. Since then, regular chronic disease testing and systematic treatment have been incorporated into adult health care plans in the NT. We assessed prevalence of treatment prescription in a repeat community-wide screen from 2004 – 2006. Methods: 920 and 1058 adults (≥ 20 years), > 85 % of the populations, participated {{in the first and}} second screens respectively. On the second screen, charts were reviewed for prescription of vasoactive and hypoglycemic medicines. Results: In males, ACEi were prescribed for 1. 8 %, 17. 6 %, 35. 2 % and 62. 3 % for ages 20 – 29 years, 30 – 39 years, 40 – 49 years and 50 + years, and 20. 2 % overall. For females, rates were 5. 1 %, 23 %, 45. 8 % and 59. 4 % respectively, and 30. 4 % overall. For males, hypoglycaemics were prescribed in 0. 5 %, 4. 6 %, 14. 2 % and 31. 3 % in those age groups, and 7. 9 % overall, and for females rates were 2. 2 %, 10. 9 %, 28 % and 39. 6 %, with 18. 1 % overall. Of those with ACR > 34, 54. 2 % of males and 63. 9 % of females were on ACEi. Among diabetics already recognized by providers, 88. 2 % of males and 84. 8 % of females had been prescribed hypoglycemics, and 81. 8 % and 68. 9 % were prescribed ACEi. Changes in health profiles between screens are compatible with good treatment effect (Scott et al, ANZSN, 2008).

40|$|Soil C {{sequestration}} {{can improve}} soil quality and reduce agriculture’s contribution to CO 2 emissions. The long-term (12 yr.) effects of tillage system and N fertilization on crop residue production and soil organic C (SOC) sequestration in two dryland cropping systems in North Dakota on a loam soil were evaluated. An annual cropping (AC) rotation [spring wheat (SW) (Triticum aestivum L.) –winter wheat (WW) –sunflower (SF) (Helianthus annuus L.) ] and a spring wheat-fallow (SW-F) rotation were studied. Tillage systems included conventional-till (CT), minimum-till (MT), and no-till (NT). Nitrogen rates were 34, 67, and 101 kg N ha‒ 1 for the AC system and 0, 22, and 45 kg N ha‒ 1 for the SW-F system. Total crop residue {{returned to the}} soil was greater with AC than with SW-F. As tillage intensity decreased, SOC sequestration increased (NT 3 ̆e MT 3 ̆e CT) in the AC system {{but not in the}} SW-F system. Fertilizer N increased crop residue quantity returned to the soil, but generally did not increase SOC sequestration in either cropping system. Soil bulk density decreased with increasing tillage intensity in both systems. The results suggest that continued use of a crop-fallow farming system, even with NT, may result in loss of SOC. With NT, an estimated 233 kg C ha‒ 1 was sequestered each year in AC system, compared with 25 kg C ha‒ 1 with MT and a loss of 141 kg C ha‒ 1 with CT.

40|$|AimsThe primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the frequency of vitD deficiency/insufficiency in an opportunistic sample of Northern Territory (NT) children. The secondary aim was to evaluate whether: (i) 25 (OH) vitD (25 (OH) D) levels differ between Indigenous/non-Indigenous children; and (ii) VitD insufficiency is associated with increased acute/infective hospitalisations. MethodsTwenty-five (OH) D levels were measured in 98 children < 16 years between August 2011 and January 2012 (children hospitalised acutely/non-acutely and well children from other studies based in Darwin). VitD deficiency was defined as 25 (OH) D < 50  nmol/L, and insufficiency was postulated to be < 75  nmol/L. Demographic data were collected, and computer records were reviewed. ResultsMedian age was 59 months (range 2 – 161); 3. 1 % were vitD deficient, 19. 4 % insufficient. There was no significant difference in mean 25 (OH) D level between Indigenous (93. 2, standard deviation (SD) 21. 9, n = 42) and non-Indigenous (97. 3, SD 27. 9, n = 56) children (P = 0. 32). Median number of hospitalisations/year were similar (P = 0. 319) between vitD sufficient (0. 34, range 0 – 12, n = 76) and insufficient (0. 22, 0 – 6, n = 22) children. There was no significant difference between number of infective admissions per year between vitD sufficient/insufficient groups (P = 0. 119). ConclusionsCompared with US data (19 % deficient, 65 % insufficient) fewer NT children are vitD deficient/insufficient. In our limited sample, being vitD insufficient was not associated with increased acute/infective hospitalisations, but a larger unbiased sample of <b>NT</b> children is <b>needed.</b> More information is needed about the optimum level of vitD for non-bone-related health in children...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince the {{discovery}} of carbon nanotubes (NTs), there has been great interest in the synthesis and characterization of similar shaped structures like inorganic nanotubes, nanorods, or nanowires. 1 However, limitations such as purity, complexity of the protocol, low-yield production, and size polydispersity still remain major impediments for industrial-scale applications. In this context, synthetic imogolites appear as an exception. Imogolites are singlewalled aluminosilicate NTs of 2 nm diameter and up to 1 μm in length with the empirical formula (OH) 3 Al 2 O 3 SiOH 2 whose structure has been determined using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), 2 solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). 3 Imogolite analogues with the generic formula (OH) 3 X 2 O 3 YOH (where X) Al, Ga, or In and Y) C, Si, Ge, or Sn) have been considered, mainly from a theoretical point of view, 4 to tailor these <b>NTs</b> to specific <b>needs.</b> However, to date, only Ge imogolite analogues 5 have been successfully synthesized. Although early reports of their synthesis involved diluted (i. e., millimolar) conditions, these imogolite analogues were recently obtained from 100 times more concentrated solutions, 6 thereby opening the route for large scale applications. These analogues have been described to be structurally identical to the Al-Si imogolite, except for a larger tube diameter (∼ 3. 3 nm) and shorter length (less than 100 nm). In the present study, the structure of two sets of samples obtained following the synthesis protocol described by Levard et al. 6 with initial Al concentrations of 0. 25 and 0. 5 M is obtained using different probes. Infrared spectroscopy (see Supporting Information (SI)) confirms that the local structure of the formed Al-Ge NTs {{is compatible with the}} one of imogolite. Their mesostructure has been examined by cryo-TEM and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). We demonstrate here that Al-Ge imogolite-like NTs synthesized at 0. 25 M are double-walled NTs with a low dispersion in diameter. SAXS data also suggest that the double-walled NTs consist of two concentric tubes of equal length and identical wall structure. At higher concentration (0. 5 M), both SAXS and cryo-TEM data confirm the formation of single-walled NTs...|$|R
