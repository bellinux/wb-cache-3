5000|$|The Dormouse is {{referenced}} {{in popular}} culture by two American rock bands: Firstly by Jefferson Airplane in the song [...] "White Rabbit", in which {{the last line of}} the song, repeated twice and building through a crescendo is [...] "Remember what the dormouse said: <b>feed</b> <b>your</b> head, <b>feed</b> <b>your</b> head". From this lyric, John Markoff derived the title of his 2005 book, What the Dormouse Said: How the 60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry. Secondly by the progressive metal band Queensrÿche in the song [...] "Right Side of My Mind": [...] "Re-engineer your head is really what the dormouse said".

They also {{have the option to}} mark mixes as unlisted, which makes them private, or not safe for work (NSFW), which hides them from users who opt into a filter. When a DJ uploads songs to the site, they appear in a list next to where the mix is created.

Each DJ has a profile which can be accessed by clicking on their name or avatar. This page displays the users basic information such as their location, a short bio that they can add, their Twitter handle, or any other website related to them {{that they would like to}} have featured. In addition, one can see all the mixes they've published, how many users follow them, and how many people they follow. To add a DJs mixes to <b>your</b> <b>feed,</b> you can follow the DJ.

40|$|This NebGuide {{explains}} how to properly test for MUN {{and interpret the}} results. Milk urea nitrogen (MUN) analyses {{can be used as}} a signal, or 2 ̆ 2 red flag 2 ̆ 2, to point out potential problems in <b>your</b> <b>feeding</b> program. In particular, high MUN values reflect excessive dietary crude protein or low rumen degradable nonfiber carbohydrates (NFC). The NFC fraction, usually composed of starch and other sugars, can be low when insufficient grain is fed, or grain is improperly processed. Appropriate MUN testing over a period of several months to fine tune a feeding management program can result in: 1. precisely meeting nutritional requirements, 2. lower feed costs, 3. increased reproductive performance, 4. increased milk protein yield, and 5. minimal nitrogen excretion into the environment...|$|R

50|$|Morkies {{need their}} teeth brushed {{regularly}} (2-3 times per week) {{in order to}} maintain good dental hygiene. Refer to <b>your</b> <b>feeding</b> guide and <b>your</b> veterinarian for proper daily feeding amounts. Yorkshire Terriers and Maltese are considered non-shedders, because they have hair not fur. However all animals shed to some degree, so they cannot be called hypoallergenic. People with mild allergies may be able to tolerate a Morkie, but others may still have allergic reactions as seen in several families. If you are concerned about allergies, it is best to choose a breed with a predictable non-shedding coat like Poodles, Bichon Frises, Shih Tzus and additionally you can also refer to AKC's list of hypoallergenic breeds for additional breeds (some more appropriate than others) http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/hypoallergenic-dogs/.|$|R
