On 13 September, they carried out another large raid on the Channel ports, sinking 80 large barges in the port of Ostend. 84 barges were sunk in Dunkirk after another raid on 17 September and by 19 September, almost 200 barges had been sunk. The loss of these barges may have contributed to Hitler's decision to postpone Operation Sea Lion indefinitely. The success of these raids was in part because the Germans had few Freya radar stations set up in France, so that air defences of the French harbours were not <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as the air defences over Germany; Bomber Command had directed some 60% of its strength against the Channel ports.|$|E

25|$|On their upper {{surfaces}} {{the main}} colours of huntsman spiders are inconspicuous shades of brown or grey, but many species have undersides {{more or less}} aposematically marked in black-and-white, with reddish patches over the mouthparts. Their legs bear fairly prominent spines, {{but the rest of}} their bodies are smoothly furry. They tend to live under rocks, bark and similar shelters, but human encounters are commonly in sheds, garages and other infrequently-disturbed places. The banded huntsman (Holconia) is large, grey to brown with striped bands on its legs. The badge huntsman (Neosparassus) is larger still, brown and hairy. The tropical or brown huntsman (Heteropoda) is also large and hairy, with mottled brown, white and black markings.

He was to suffer disappointing {{two years at}} the Bourne team, which would effectively kill off his Grand Prix career. In two years, he would muster just four finishes, with his only points scores being 6th place in the 1969 Mexican Grand Prix, and 5th in the 1970 Austrian Grand Prix. However, in 1970 he led much of the Race of Champions holding off Stewart and was a strong third {{for most of the}} Dutch and British GP. The poor result in the Austrian GP which Team boss, Lou Stanley thought he should have won, saw the best car go to Rodriquez from then on, but Oliver still led some laps at the slipstream Italian race.

[...] Hoskyns likened {{the sound of the}} album to the band [...] "turning on their own greatest 'hits' and savaging them". Hoskyns also criticised McCulloch's lyrics and the general mood of the album, noting, [...] "Only on 'Porcupine' itself do the various strains of despair coalesce", and dismissed the entire second side of the album, saying it [...] "horrifies the more for its uniform lack of inspiration, for the fact that every number cops direct from earlier songs without preserving anything of their energy or invention". Record reviewer Wayne King similarly commented that the album reused many motifs, such as Ian McCullough's octave jumps, from their previous albums. While he praised the opening tracks [...] "The Cutter" [...] and [...] "Back of Love", he remarked that Porcupine as a whole was not <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> an album as Echo and the Bunnymen's live performances showed they were capable of.|$|E

Billboards magazine critique Walter Frazier analysed the performance and commented [...] "Mars' backing band...dressed as a 1950s rockabilly group, while Mars resembled something of a modern-day Elvis, surely inspiring swoons for the [...] "SNL" [...] audience." [...] The performance was also praised by Mawuse Ziegbe, MTV reviewer, who wrote: [...] "Mars peppered the performance with hip-swaying moves Elvis would be proud of and wrapped up the set in classic rock-star style with an enthusiastic jump in the air." [...] On October 21, 2010, a soulful arrangement of the song was sung for a Billboard Tastemakers video session. On May 5, 2011 Mars expressed his apprehension about performing the song because fans have been throwing dummy grenades on stage, some of which are metal and have posed a safety hazard.|$|E

Kate Brandli of Blogcritics said [...] "Bossy" [...] "is not <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> or as catchy as Miss Lohan's previous musical attempts", while commenting that its lyrical content [...] "is an obvious reflection on Miss Lohan's relationship with the paparazzi.

Unfortunately, Miss Lohan's logic is not entirely correct—neither party {{has the authority to}} boss the other around.

50|$|Raw {{spermaceti}} is liquid {{within the}} head of the sperm whale, and is said to have a smell similar to raw milk. It is composed mostly of wax esters (chiefly cetyl palmitate) and a smaller proportion of triglycerides. Unlike other toothed whales, most of the carbon chains in the wax esters are relatively long (C10-C22). The proportion of wax esters in the spermaceti organ increases with the age of the whale: 38-51% in calves, 58-87% in adult females, and 71-94% in adult males. The blubber oil of the whale is about 66% wax. When it cools to 30 °C or below, the waxes begin to solidify.

30|$|As {{shown in}} this figure, the {{standard}} OFDM system has the worst performance due to the high ISBI. Furthermore, the proposed scheme for UFMC outperforms that of the GB OFDM under {{the condition of the}} same β. For instance, the performance of the proposed scheme is <b>nearly</b> twice <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> that of GB OFDM when Eb/N 0 is 20 dB and α is 1 / 2, and the corresponding β is 3 / 4. This result is {{the same as that of}} α= 3 / 4 (β= 7 / 8). Moreover, α also influences the BER performance of the system. For example, when α is changed from 1 / 2 to 1, the proposed UFMC becomes the conventional UFMC, and its BER increases from 10 − 3 to 10 − 2 when Eb/N 0 is 20 dB. By contrast, the performance is improved as α decreases, especially for higher Eb/N 0 (> [*] 10 dB). Note that a small α indicates a reduction in spectral efficiency. Thus, the selection of α is important for the proposed scheme. Generally, we should compromise between BER and spectral efficiency in practical applications.|$|R
