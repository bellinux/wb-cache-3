40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} role of media literacy training and counter-stereotypical <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> in prejudice reduction. Research participants read either stereotypical or counter-stereotypical <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> after exposure to a media literacy video or a con-trol video. After this, they completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire that included Likert-type scales and feeling-thermometer ratings about their feelings toward Afri-can-Americans, Asian-Indians, and Caucasian-Americans. The findings reveal that hostile prejudice {{is more likely to}} be expressed toward African-Americans and be-nevolent prejudice {{is more likely to be}} expressed toward Asian-Indians. As pre-dicted, counter-stereotypical <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> as compared to stereotypical <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> decrease prejudice toward Asian-Indians. Contrary to expectations, the media liter-acy video seems to prime prejudices rather than suppress them. Interestingly, <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> about Asian-Indians increase hostility toward African-Americans.

5|$|Along the {{northern}} coastline of Venezuela, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation and a storm surge of about 13feet (4m), which damaged 60homes. Sustained winds on Isla Margarita peaked at 26mph (42km/h), {{and the most}} affected states were Falcón, Vargas, Aragua, Carabobo, and Anzoátegui. Rough waves capsized 10boats and closed several beaches, and one person drowned due to the surf. Further inland, two people drowned when a river overflowed its banks, and near Caracas a man died after strong winds toppled a wall. The combination of rainfall and winds destroyed 21houses and blew off the roof of several others, affecting 1,376people, of whom 80 were left homeless. Power outages and lack of water were reported. In the country, the hurricane caused 127injuries, and a death toll reported between three and five. An initial <b>news</b> <b>story</b> reported 28people missing offshore on threeboats.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of optimistic <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> on first-day pricing of initial public offerings (IPOs) in Australia between 1995 and 2005. Unlike the United States, Australia has no quiet-period regulation limiting the dissemination of information from media before IPO listing dates. We find that optimistic <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> are negatively associated with IPO underpricing. Results from a relative valuation model show that IPOs which received positive <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> ahead of the first trading day are not overpriced relative to their industry benchmarks. These results suggest that optimistic <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> mitigate information asymmetry and adverse selection problems. However, optimistic <b>news</b> <b>stories</b> {{do not appear to}} inflate the share price {{on the first day of}} trading.

CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records.
