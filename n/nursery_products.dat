We specify a gravity model for each state’s seed, <b>nursery</b> <b>product,</b> and commodity trade with each other state. Within the gravity model, we examine the role of cross-state regulatory congruence arising from ecological and agronomic characteristics and interest-group lobbying. A spatial-autoregressive Tobit model is estimated with a modified expectation-maximization algorithm. Results show that weed regulatory congruence positively affects interstate trade. By fostering cross-state regulatory differences, consumer and commodity-producer lobbying reduce the value of interstate trade by about two percent per annum. interstate trade, invasive species, rent-seeking, Agribusiness, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Land Economics/Use, Political Economy, Public Economics, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods, F 1, H 7, Q 5,...|$|R

40|$|This paper's {{goal is to}} {{describe}} the current health status of the farm labor workforce from a national perspective and to suggest future directions for interventions. Ideally, data would be derived from nationally representative cross-sectional studies of hired farm workers that included comprehensive physical examinations by third-party medical professionals. Because such national data does not exist, {{it was necessary to}} consider the few available statewide crosssectional studies that included medical examinations and to forge a national perspective from them. For this paper, a hired farm worker is a person who is employed to perform tasks on a farm to directly produce an agricultural commodity intended for sale. Workers engaged in off-farm packing, handling or processing of farm products are not included. Hired livestock farm workers are considered on an equal basis with hired crop farm workers.

This paper focuses on health outcomes that are associated with occupational, environmental and individual risk factors, or are influenced by regulatory policy.

This article highlights results from a University of Maryland’s Agriculture Law Education Initiative (ALEI) needs assessment in 2013. The assessment provided the legal community {{a deeper understanding of the}} legal needs of the state’s agricultural producers. The assessment consisted of 23 structured interviews and a survey of University of Maryland Extension (UME) agricultural faculty. Legal issues related to environmental regulations, land use, Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) programs, business planning, and marketing and diversification ranked near the top on both the UME survey and the structured interviews. UME survey results show potential regional differences among the top legal issues. For instance, on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, legal issues related to the environment, divorce, and debt were important, whereas in Southern Maryland legal issues related to the environment, estate planning, and business planning were seen as important. Finally, the survey results suggest the appropriate form of outreach on many of these issues. Results from the structured interviews and UME survey provide ALEI a wealth of information and understanding on the legal issues that impact the Maryland agricultural community. The information in this initial needs assessment will also aid attorneys, state agencies, members of the Maryland General Assembly, and other groups working with the state’s agriculture community in understanding the agricultural community’s legal issues...|$|R
