40|$|Summary: Concentrations of {{immunoglobulins}} {{were determined}} by laser <b>nephelometry</b> and, for comparison, by single radial immunodiffusion assay and a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in plasma samples of normal dogs. Correlation between methods was high, although the mean IgM concentrations determined by laser <b>nephelometry</b> {{were significantly higher than}} those determined by the single radial immunodirrusion assay or ELISA. In contrast, the mean IgA concentrations were significantly lower than those determined by ELISA. Laser <b>nephelometry</b> was the most reproducible method.

40|$|Which {{method for}} {{quantifying}} urinary albumin excretion gives what outcome? A comparison of immunonephelometry with HPLC. BackgroundMicroalbuminuria {{has recently been}} identified as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population. Immunochemical urinary albumin assays only detect immunoreactive intact albumin. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is able to detect both immunoreactive and immunounreactive intact albumin. We compared both measurement methods respectively in subjects with normo-, micro-, and macroalbuminuria in the general population. MethodsWe used 24 -hour urine samples that were collected {{within the framework of}} the second screening for the PREVEND Study, a prospective cohort study on albuminuria in the city of Groningen, The Netherlands. ResultsWith <b>nephelometry</b> as immunochemical reference method, we classified 986 subjects as normoalbuminuric, 283 as microalbuminuric, and 43 subjects as macroalbuminuric. The mean ± SD albumin concentration was 6. 8 ± 4. 3 mg/L for <b>nephelometry</b> in the urine samples of the 998 subjects with a concentration < 20 mg/L according to <b>nephelometry</b> versus 17. 6 ± 10. 3 mg/L for HPLC (P < 0. 001, HPLC 159 % higher). These values were 58. 9 ± 40. 6 mg/L for <b>nephelometry</b> versus 74. 0 ± 51. 8 mg/L for HPLC (P < 0. 001, N= 280, HPLC 26 % higher) in the concentration range between 20 to 200 mg/L, and 436. 3 ± 371. 8 mg/L for <b>nephelometry</b> versus 399. 1 ± 329. 2 mg/L for HPLC above 200 mg/L (P= 0. 048, N= 34, HPLC 8. 5 % lower). Associations of 24 -hour urinary albumin excretion with cardiovascular risk factors were generally somewhat stronger for <b>nephelometry</b> than for HPLC. Logistic regression analyses with an abnormal ankle-brachial index as outcome parameter revealed adjusted odds ratios of 1. 78 (95 %CI 1. 01 – 3. 12, P < 0. 05) and 4. 67 (95 %CI 1. 68 – 12. 9, P < 0. 05) respectively for micro- and macroalbuminuria as determined by HPLC, compared to 1. 37 (95 %CI 0. 77 – 2. 41, P=NS) and 3. 85 (95 %CI 1. 53 – 9. 67, P < 0. 05) respectively for <b>nephelometry.</b> The ROC-curve showed similar sensitivity and specificity for both methods (P= 0. 25). ConclusionThe use of HPLC for determination of urinary albumin concentrations reveals higher values compared to <b>nephelometry,</b> especially in the lower concentration range, resulting in a higher prevalence of microalbuminuria. With HPLC compared to <b>nephelometry,</b> we found a 21 % higher independent odds ratio for microalbuminuria with the presence of peripheral vascular disease, and a 30 % higher independent odds ratio for macroalbuminuria.

40|$|Planar <b>Nephelometry</b> is a {{laser-based}} technique {{developed to}} determine instantaneous local number densities of particles (or droplets) in a suspension or flow.

A major advantage of Planar <b>Nephelometry</b> is that is {{does not need to}} resolve individual particles and therefore it is possible to have a large image viewing area.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a reproducible method of establishing the concentration of yeast cells per milliliter of solution. Methods: Three methods of determining the number of yeast cells in solution were compared: Neubauer’s counting chamber, spectrophotometry, and <b>nephelometry.</b> Results: All three methods were comparable and reproducible. The following formulas were highly effective in determining the number of yeast cells in solution: chamber (103 / ml) 64. 3 / 8, 206 spectrophotometry (absorbance); and chamber (103 /ml) - 0. 2 / 64 <b>nephelometry</b> (volt).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic usefulness of a gelatin based Waaler Rose assay (Serodia-RA) {{for the detection}} of rheumatoid factor (RF) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: RF was measured by Serodia-RA and rate <b>nephelometry</b> in 90 patients with RA according to the revised ACR criteria and 102 patients with rheumatological diseases other than RA. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, likelihood ratios, and area under the curve using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were determined for both tests. Agreement between assays was assessed on 1657 consecutive samples. RESULTS: At equal specificity, Serodia-RA tended to be more sensitive than rate <b>nephelometry</b> (0. 66 v 0. 58; p = 0. 04). ROC plots showed an area under the curve of 0. 843 for Serodia-RA and 0. 784 for <b>nephelometry,</b> providing further evidence that Serodia-RA was slightly better at differentiating between RA and non-RA arthropathy. Good agreement was found between both assays. CONCLUSION: Serodia-RA is slightly more accurate than rate <b>nephelometry</b> {{for the detection of}} RF in RA, and a combination of both assays only marginally improves the diagnostic usefulness of RF detection. Use of two tests for detection of RF is not recommended.

40|$|Planar <b>Nephelometry</b> is a {{laser-based}} technique {{capable of}} providing instantaneous planar local number density measurements of particles in fluid systems. This technique records laser light scattered from particles to obtain information regarding particle concentration. Planar <b>Nephelometry</b> {{does not need to}} resolve particles individually, thus enabling large image viewing areas. However, when particle loadings are sufficiently high, attenuation of the incident laser beam becomes significant. As Planar <b>Nephelometry</b> infers particle concentration from incident laser intensity, attenuation can result in erroneous concentration measurements. Planar <b>Nephelometry</b> measurements under these conditions must thus be corrected for laser attenuation to ensure accurate concentration measurements. Experiments were conducted on suspensions of neutral density spherical particles in water at various homogeneous concentrations. The attenuation correction method implemented is a ray-based extinction model which incorporates the use of scattered light from a polymer strip at a down-beam location. This method is suitable for highly turbulent flows requiring instantaneous planar information since single shot images are used in the post-processing work. The derived correction method provides an alternative to Beer-Lambert’s law for attenuation corrections in laser diagnostics techniques. The proposed method is validated experimentally using non-homogenous particle distributions in fluid suspensions. M. C. Cheong, C. H. Birzer and T. Lau[URL]...|$|E

This study compared an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to a nephelometric technique for the measurement of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) and investigated how the choice of assay influenced the estimation of inflammation in patients with stable COPD. Methods: CRP and SAA concentrations measured by ELISA and <b>nephelometry</b> in 88 patients with COPD and 45 control subjects were {{used to evaluate the}} performance of these methods in a clinical setting.
