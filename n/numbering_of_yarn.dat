40|$|Rotor spun yarn, {{despite its}} growing popularity, suffers the {{disadvantages}} of lower tenacity, limited count range, and harsh {{handle of the}} resulting fabrics. Therefore, this work probes the possibility of eliminating these drawbacks by using tensile drawing. The yarns are produced with different specifications from the same fibers. The results are encouraging, since contrary to predictions, staple yarns treated this way do perform properly. Tensile drawing especially improves rotor spun yarn quality in terms of structural/mechanical evenness and processability. Other features include increased packing density, reduced yarn diameter, enhanced mechanical rigidity, and even the potential for larger tenacity. The influence of processing variables on yarn properties is also revealed by examining the contribution <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> loops mounted on the feed roller and rewinding to drawing and the resulting products. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> loops wound on the feed roller is significant in terms of drawing tension.

One possible application is to utilize CNT yarn(s) in structural and electrical devices. This study investigated 13 different variations of CNT multi-yarns. The multi-yarns were evaluated and compared in terms of tensile load behavior and electrical conductivity as well as interrelationship and interdependence of these two properties with physical parameters and micro-structural features. The electrical conductivity of the CNT multi-yarn is not affected by the apparent diameter, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns,</b> tex or density, but instead by its interior compactness and acid treatment. The construction <b>of</b> single CNT <b>yarn</b> or multi-yarn can be tailored to achieve stress-strain behavior ranging from a stiff to ductile or highly non-linear behavior.

40|$|DE 10021341 A UPAB: 20020213 NOVELTY - The {{assembly}} to lay weft yarns, preferably in a multi-layer structure <b>of</b> multi-axial <b>yarns,</b> has a controlled yarn layer (30) {{to guide the}} wefts (20). It is moved together with rows of moving hooks on chains at the edges to hold the yarns in place and move the laid yarn layer(s) in a forward direction while retaining their orientation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In a laying cycle <b>of</b> the weft <b>yarn</b> band laying system, the yarn layer carries a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> wefts, to lay them at the moving edge hooks {{in at least two}} laying stages for different yarn orientations and at least two laying stages on the reverse movements. The width of the laid weft yarns is controlled at the side edges <b>of</b> the <b>yarn</b> layer(s) or outside the laying stages. The start position of the forward and backward layer laying stage is set according to an actual position of an oriented weft yarn band already laid in place, which is the actual growth position in relation to the hook chains. The advance movement of the hook carrier chains is controlled according to the duration <b>of</b> a <b>yarn</b> laying cycle. The hook carrier chains have a synchronized forward movement, according to the yarn laying cycle. The yarn laying cycle has a laying stage for the oriented yarns, a deflection stage around the edge hooks, and a return stage with a different yarn orientation. The gaps between the yarn guide openings (33) at the yarn layer are altered according to changes in the yarn laying orientation. Before adjustment, the yarn layer is rotated into a different angular alignment. The control sets the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> laying stages at the edge hooks for different laying cycles and/or an advance of the laid and oriented wefts in each laying cycle, according to the advance movement of the hook chains on each laying cycle. The yarn laying movement extends as far as behind the needles of a side edge fixing system. After laying a band of wefts, the orientation is set by the yarn layer at an entry point for the next laying stage. A laying stage is extended after the side edge, by the length of a racking path, while the yarn layer is lowered. As the yarn layer is lowered, an edge fixing system grips the band of wefts from above to apply a grip to fix a section <b>of</b> the laid <b>yarn</b> band. The yarn layer and edge fixing system move on a swing path to the hook laying point of the next laying stage, and the yarn is transferred at the hook laying point. As the laid yarn is moved upwards in a curved yarn laying action around the hook laying point, the next laying stage starts to apply tension to the yarn. The fixing unit has a comb structure to grip the tensed yarns to give a new hook laying width between the fixing system and the yarn layer. The laid yarns can be tensed by lowering the yarn layer to a transfer comb, to tense the yarns at it by an angled rear movement and a following upwards movement and release them from the fixing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system to lay bands <b>of</b> weft <b>yarns</b> at given orientations, by a controlled yarn layer which carries a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> weft <b>yarns,</b> to be caught at the edges by hooks on moving chains. Preferred Features: An additional yarn layer is used when laying more than three layers <b>of</b> weft <b>yarns.</b> The interval can be adjusted between the yarn guide openings at the layer, and the yarn guides (32, 34) can be in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> parts. The <b>yarn</b> layer has a slitted plate with diverging yarn channels, especially as slits. The plate can have a lateral sliding movement to set the yarn guide slits according to the width of the laid band <b>of</b> wefts. The <b>yarn</b> layer can be rotated to alter the gaps between the weft yarns. The yarn layer can have a grid bar with holes to guide the weft yarns, to be rotated into different angular alignments for a laying stage. The weft layer, to lay a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> weft <b>yarn</b> band layers, gives layers in mirror image alignments against each other. USE - The assembly is for laying bands <b>of</b> weft <b>yarns</b> to be held at the edges by hooks on moving chains. ADVANTAGE - The operation gives a smooth transfer of weft direction around the edge hooks. Weft yarn losses at the edges are reduced, with an increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> weft <b>yarns.</b> The productivity is increased without increasing the yarn laying speed...|$|R

These structures were manufactured with the same braided yarn and the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns.</b> The mechanical properties of the two structures, such as tensile strength, strain at break, work and stiffness were measured by using a constant speed gradient dynamometer. In order to determine the viscoelastic modulus of the two structures, a rheological model was proposed and the correlation between experimental and theoretical creep and relaxation curves were studied. The energy dissipation and the residual deformation were measured with an application developed by using Microsoft Visual Basic software. The obtained results showed that textile structure influences prosthesis viscoelastic and mechanical properties, material damping, hysteresis and residual deformation. The nonlinear viscoelastic model permitted to evaluate the elastic and the viscous modulus of the braided and woven structures and to describe its time-dependent deformation. This study may serve as a method for the selection of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{significant}} differences in the distributed processing enginesâ configuration settings, they were all configured in order to use the same amount of system resources. The level of parallelism of all tasks for each engine was set to 16, in order to exploit the fact that, in an optimally determined setting and during the experiments, the stage 2 partitions the dataset into 8 subsets and the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> shifts is 2. Thus, a maximum of 16 simultaneous tasks are executed in all cases. For Flink and Spark, a total of 4 task managers (one per CPU) and executors respectively were assigned 32768 MB of Java Virtual Machine (JVM) heap memory. Each task manager and executor was given a total of 4 processing slots (Flink) or executor cores (Spark). For Hadoop, the parallelism ability was set to 16 by assigning the mappers and the reducers to the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>YARN</b> containers, with 8192 MB of JVM each. Thus, the total amount of JVM heap memory assigned to each session is always 131072 MB (either 4 Â· 32768 MB, or 16 Â· 8192 MB).|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{shedding}} is {{a critical}} problem in biomedical textile debridement materials, which leads to infection and impairs wound healing. In this work, single fiber pull-out test was proposed as an in vitro evaluation for the fiber shedding property of a textile pile debridement material. Samples with different structural design (pile densities, <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> ground <b>yarns</b> and coating times) were prepared and estimated under this testing method. Results show that single fiber pull-out test offers an appropriate in vitro evaluation for the fiber shedding property of textile pile debridement materials. Pull-out force for samples without back-coating exhibited a slight escalating trend with the supplement in pile density and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ground <b>yarn</b> plies, while back-coating process significantly raised the single fiber pull-out force. For fiber shedding mechanism analysis, typical pull-out behavior and failure modes of the single fiber pull-out test were analyzed in detail. Three failure modes were found in this study, i. e., fiber slippage, coating point rupture and fiber breakage. In summary, to obtain samples with desirable fiber shedding property, fabric structural design, preparation process and raw materials selection {{should be taken into}} full consideration...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the {{presented}} master thesis was the experimental study <b>of</b> multi-filament <b>yarns</b> made <b>of</b> AR-glass and used for textile-reinforced concrete. The behavior under the tensile loading was investigated by laboratory tests. A high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> specimens (over 300) of six different lengths (from 1 cm to 74 cm) was tested to obtain statistically significant data which were subsequently corrected and statistically processed. The numerical model of the multi-filament bundle was studied and applied for prediction <b>of</b> the <b>yarn</b> performance and for later results interpretation. The model of n parallel filaments describes {{the behavior of a}} bundle with varying parameters representing different sources of disorder of the response and provides the qualitative information about the influence of their randomization on the overall bundle response. The aim of the carried experiment was to validate the model presumptions and to identify the model parameters to fit the real load-displacement curves. Unfortunately, due to unsuccessful correction of measured displacements devalued by additional non-linear contribution of the unstiff experiment device the load-displacement diagrams were not applicable to model parameters identification. The statistical evaluation was carried only for the maximal load values and the effect of the specimen size (length) on its strength was demonstrated. The size effect curve did not exclude the existence of spatial correlation of material mechanical properties modifying the classical statistical Weibull theory...|$|R
