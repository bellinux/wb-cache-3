500|$|Beginning in the 1840s, the <b>normal</b> <b>entry</b> age for {{executive}} officer cadets, those destined to command ships and fleets, was between 12 and 13, and instruction {{consisted of two}} years of classroom training, during which time trainees were rated as naval cadets. [...] Cadets who received a first-class passing grade in studies, seamanship and conduct on their final examination could receive a credit {{for up to a}} year of sea time, and could be rated as midshipmen immediately after passing out of the college. [...] After passing out of the college, cadets served aboard a special training vessel for one year. [...] Cadets were then rated as midshipmen, and served aboard the fleet another two years. Midshipmen lived in the gunroom, kept watches, and ran the ship's boats. They received instruction in navigation every day. After five total years of training and having reached the age of 19, the midshipmen were eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. [...] After passing the examination for lieutenant, midshipmen were commissioned as sub-lieutenants, and were transferred to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, which opened in 1873 as the 'University of the Navy'.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} ill-posed linear inverse problems {{involving the}} estimation of structured sparse signals. When the sensing matrix has i. i. d. standard <b>normal</b> <b>entries,</b> there is a full-fledged theory on the sample complexity and robustness properties. In this work, we propose {{a way of making}} use of this theory to get good bounds for the i. i. d. Bernoulli ensemble. We first provide a deterministic relation between the two ensembles that relates the restricted singular values. Then, we show how one can get non-asymptotic results with small constants for the Bernoulli ensemble.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{recovering}} an n-dimensional BPSK signal from m linear noise-corrupted measurements using the box relaxation method which relaxes the discrete set {± 1 }n to the convex set [- 1, 1]n to obtain a convex optimization algorithm followed by hard thresholding. When the noise and measurement matrix have iid standard <b>normal</b> <b>entries,</b> we obtain an exact expression for the bit-wise probability of error Pe {{in the limit of}} n and m growing and m/n fixed. At high SNR our result shows that the Pe of box relaxation is within 3 dB of the matched filter bound (MFB) for square systems, and that it approaches the (MFB) as m grows large compared to n. Our results also indicate that as m, n → ∞, for any fixed set of size k, the error events of the corresponding k bits in the box relaxation method are independent...|$|R

" Algorithmic developers in need of guinea pigs nearly always take random matrices with standard <b>normal</b> <b>entries</b> or perhaps close cousins, such as the uniform distribution on [1; 1].

What is a mistake is to psychologically link a random matrix with the intuitive notion of a " matrix or the vague concept of old matrix. " In contrast, we argue that matrices " are very special matrices. The larger the size of the matrix the more predictable they are because of the central limit theorem.

It has been assumed that the entry was made possible by the presence of ladders downed from above, while the most evocative hypothesis (supported by the discovery of underground tunnels near the castle) suggests the access from an underground entrance. The absence of a doorway, however, is significant of the strategic importance of the castle, which in this way was more difficult to conquer.|$|E

More precisely, suppose that the nth largest entry of the vector jfj (or of its coefficients in a fixed basis) obeys jfj(n) R 1 n 01 =p, where R> 0 and p> 0.

50|$|In {{professional}} tennis tournaments, a {{wild card}} refers to a tournament entry awarded to a player {{at the discretion of}} the organizers. All ATP and WTA tournaments have a few spots set aside for wild cards in both the main draw, and the qualifying draw, for players who otherwise would not have made either of these draws with their professional ranking. They are usually awarded to players from the home and/or sponsoring country (sometimes after a tournament where the winner is awarded the wild card), promising young players, players that are likely to draw a large crowd, have won the tournament earlier or players who were once ranked higher and are attempting a comeback (for instance, following a long-term injury). High ranked players can also ask for {{a wild card}} if they want to enter a non-mandatory tournament after the <b>normal</b> <b>entry</b> deadline, for example because they lost early in another tournament. This means a wild card player sometimes becomes the top seed. Some Grand Slam tournaments swap wild cards, like Australian Open, French Open, and US Open.|$|E

The strength required to survive impact collection is difficult to model because of the fractal shape of each CP IDP. However, the peak dynamic pressure experienced by a spherical particle during atmospheric deceleration can be modeled. A 10 μm diameter particle decelerating in the Earth’s atmosphere during a <b>normal</b> incidence <b>entry</b> experiences a peak pressure of ~ 10 N/m 2 (Brownlee, 1985), but much larger CP IDPs survive atmospheric entry intact only to break up on impact collection.

(1995). An ~ 100 μm particle decelerating in the Earth’s atmosphere during a <b>normal</b> incidence <b>entry</b> experiences a peak pressure of ~ 100 N/m 2 (Brownlee, 1985), establishing that the largest cluster IDPs must survive dynamic pressures up to ~ 100 N/m 2.|$|R
