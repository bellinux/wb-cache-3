500|$|Upon {{realising}} the anti-Japanese {{tone of the}} story, Japan's diplomats {{stationed in}} Belgium issued an official complaint, conveyed to Hergé by Lieutenant-General Raoul Pontus, president of the Sino-Belgian Friendship Association. The diplomats threatened to take their complaint to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague. In learning of this, Zhang congratulated Hergé, stating that it would only further expose the actions of Japan in China to further international scrutiny and would make Hergé [...] "world-famous". Hergé's strip also came under criticism from a Belgian general, who commented, [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> for children... It's just a problem for Asia!" [...] The story was nevertheless a commercial success, and Le Petit Vingtième organised a celebration to commemorate the return of Tintin from the Far East, sponsored by the L'Innovation and Bon Marché department stores. Taking place at the Cirque Royal, it was attended by 3000 fans of the series, {{many of whom were}} Scouts, and involved an actor portraying Tintin who accompanied Hergé, the newspaper's staff, a contortionist and a clown.|$|E
500|$|Osborn and Knight {{arrive at}} Cope's {{residence}} {{to find the}} paleontologist has died of illness. The funeral is markedly pitiful, {{with only a few}} Quakers and the two friends in attendance. Cope has bequeathed his remains to science, and requested to have his bones considered for the Homo sapiens lectotype. Back at Marsh's [...] "wigwam", Marsh's, Chief Red Cloud, examines Marsh's luxuries. Red Cloud's interest is piqued by a long tusk from a Mastodon, which the Shawnee call Yakwawi'ak. The Shawnee have an ancient legend, which Marsh relates. At one time there were giant men proportionate to the mastodons. However, when the great men grew few, the Great Spirit decided to destroy the Yakwawi'ak himself. All but one bull was killed; this last mastodon fled north, where he remains to modern times. In exchange for the loss of the Mastodon, the Great Spirit created the cranberry, a bitter reminder of the blood spilled. Chief Red Cloud remarks that it is a true story, but Marsh rebukes him, saying that science tells modern man that his ancestors were smaller, not larger, than him. Red Cloud, on his way out, responds, [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about science. It is about men." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{felt that}} creating another {{game in the}} series with the same style of gameplay had limited potential. In an attempt to imbue the game with {{the feel of a}} horror film where the protagonist is a regular person and the antagonist is powerful, they avoided the common survival horror gameplay feature of a player character who is skilled in the use of weapons. Instead they generated an unarmed player character; and examined the survival horror gameplay staple of difficult combat and sluggish opponents, inspired by zombie films and modelled after the video games Alone in the Dark (1992) and Resident Evil (1996). They also analyzed around 50 chase sequences from various films, including horror films, and the structure of slasher films, in which a powerful and intelligent antagonist pursues the protagonists. The developers drew inspiration from common childhood nightmares about running away from an unknown threat, and decided to incorporate an intelligent enemy capable of trailing and outrunning the protagonist. The chase sequences were designed to evoke a brief sense of tension and fright for the player, although the developers did not want to prolong the tension with the constant presence of monsters, and were concerned that this would become overwhelming and spoil the player's immersion in the game and interest in the story. The constant presence of monsters was also thought to be irrelevant to Shattered Memories; director Mark Simmons said, [...] "this Harry Mason is not a guy who is constantly under attack from monsters. It's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of surviving a zombie apocalypse." [...] Additionally, to make information-gathering in the game realistic and corresponding to modern life standards, the developers substituted text in scattered documents, a common element in survival horror games, for the player's interaction with the in-game environment and use of the cell phone.|$|E

500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "Gaga {{has created a}} world that, while oppressive, also looks great." [...] In a {{separate}} piece Montgomery added that [...] "... she may have finally reached the point in her career where not even she can top herself." [...] Rolling Stones Daniel Kreps called the video a [...] "cinematic epic." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly, liked the video; however, {{he had no idea}} what was going on: [...] "I can’t wait to hear Lady Gaga explain her latest video, “Alejandro.” Mostly because after watching it (twice!), I have absolutely no clue what’s going on beyond the obvious." [...] Anthony Benigno from Daily News felt that [...] "the shock songstress' new music video [...] is chock full of bed-ridden S imagery that makes it look like the softcore answer to The Matrix. Randall Roberts from Los Angeles Times said [...] "the clip reinforces the notion that no one understands the convergence of image and music right now better than Gaga." [...] Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald said that [...] "The plot [...] is hard to decipher, but it’s clearly <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that ends happily ever after." [...] Jen Dose from National Post commented [...] "Gaga’s new vid for 'Alejandro' certainly brings the crazy we’ve all come to expect from her. It’s like an 8+ minute homage to Madonna—with some gay Nazis thrown in for good measure". Amy Odell of New York said the video's outfits were not as [...] "intense" [...] as those of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] or [...] "Telephone." [...] Nate Jones of Time Magazine disliked the song, but felt the video [...] "looks fantastic... the self-conscious ballsiness of Gaga and director Steven Klein works here." [...] Jennifer Cady from E! liked the video, but did not think it was as good as Gaga's previous work. Julie Moult from Daily Mail said [...] ", no-one could accuse Lady Gaga of being the shy and retiring type." ...|$|E

Chung argued that [...] "Gran Torino might have been another [...] "“white man saves the day” story" [...] but that [...] "What Eastwood has really created is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about the white man saving the minority (though it can be read on that level and I’m sure some will) but a critical examination of an iconic brand of white macho maleness that he played a significant part in creating." ...|$|E

2500|$|Everett Richardson {{was one of}} 235 trawlermen {{from the}} tiny ports of Canso, Mulgrave and Petit de Grat who fought for better pay, safer working conditions, job {{security}} and most of all, {{for the right to}} belong to the union they had chosen, the United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union led by Homer Stevens, a member of the Communist Party of Canada. Their main adversaries were two, huge, foreign-owned fishing companies. The fishermen also faced stiff opposition from what Cameron calls the [...] "cod aristocracy," [...] rich members of the Nova Scotia elite, as well as from leading politicians, judges, government bureaucrats, members of the clergy, the province's main daily newspaper, and the Canadian labour establishment itself. [...] "In the end," [...] Cameron writes, [...] "this is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of the fishermen, or even of the labour movement. It is a story about privilege and poverty and injustice in this country, and about the social and political arrangements which cheat and oppress most Canadians, which stunt our humanity and distort our environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|An article {{published}} in Metro, entitled [...] "Doctor Who fans love River Song...", noted how praise from fans on Twitter after the airing of [...] "Day of the Moon" [...] focused heavily on Song. In 2011, Laura Pledger of Radio Times listed Kingston as the fourth best Doctor Who guest star, writing, [...] "For my money we’ve seen rather too much of River {{in the last two}} series, but there’s no denying Kingston has created a memorable character in Melody Pond." [...] Keith Phipps for The A.V. Club compared the Doctor and River's romantic storyline to The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story, [...] "if a bit more elegantly, for my money—it echoes the plight of anyone who's watched a loved one fade into the shadowlands of dementia. This is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that ends well for River and she knows it, whatever flirtatious high spirits being around The Doctor stirs in her." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker felt the character to be the Doctor's [...] "soul mate" [...] and described Alex Kingston as [...] "badass".|$|E
