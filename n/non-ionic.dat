5|$|If the {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} two interacting bodies {{is affected by the}} presence of one another, covalent interactions (<b>non-ionic)</b> also contribute to the overall energy of the compound formed. Ionic compounds are rarely purely ionic, i.e. held together only by electrostatic forces. The bonds between even the most electronegative/electropositive pairs such as those in caesium fluoride exhibit a small degree of covalency. Conversely, covalent bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some charge separation and can be considered to have a partial ionic character. The circumstances under which a compound will have ionic or covalent character can typically be understood using Fajans' rules, which use only charges and the sizes of each ion. According to these rules, compounds with the most ionic character will have large positive ions with a low charge, bonded to a small negative ion with a high charge. More generally HSAB theory can be applied, whereby the compounds with the most ionic character are those consisting of hard acids and hard bases: small, highly charged ions with a high difference in electronegativities between the anion and cation. This difference in electronegativities means that the charge separation, and resulting dipole moment, is maintained even when the ions are in contact (the excess electrons on the anions are not transferred or polarized to neutralize the cations).|$|E
25|$|Like {{ethylene}} glycol and propylene glycol, glycerol is a <b>non-ionic</b> kosmotrope that forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, competing with water-water hydrogen bonds. This disrupts the crystal lattice formation of ice unless {{the temperature is}} significantly lowered. The minimum freezing point temperature is at about 36°F / 37.8°C corresponding to 60–70% glycerol in water.|$|E
25|$|Loading aids; most PAGE {{systems are}} loaded {{from the top}} into wells within the gel. To ensure that the sample sinks {{to the bottom of}} the gel, sample buffer is {{supplemented}} with additives that increase the density of the sample. These additives should be <b>non-ionic</b> and non-reactive towards proteins to avoid interfering with electrophoresis. Common additives are glycerol and sucrose.|$|E
25|$|A large {{molecule}} with an ionized {{group is}} technically an ion, but its {{behavior may be}} largely the result of <b>non-ionic</b> interactions. For example, sodium stearate (the main constituent of traditional soaps) consists entirely of ions, yet it is a soft material quite unlike a typical ionic solid. There is a continuum between ionic solids and molecular solids with little ionic character in their bonding.|$|E
25|$|Impregnation is, in essence, the {{converse}} of extraction. A substance is dissolved in the supercritical fluid, the solution flowed past a solid substrate, and is deposited on or dissolves in the substrate. Dyeing, which is readily {{carried out on}} polymer fibres such as polyester using disperse (<b>non-ionic)</b> dyes, is a special case of this. Carbon dioxide also dissolves in many polymers, considerably swelling and plasticising them and further accelerating the diffusion process.|$|E
25|$|The {{osmolality}} of {{the contrast}} agent was previously {{believed to be}} an important factor in contrast-induced nephropathy. Today it has become increasingly clear that other physicochemical properties play a greater role, such as viscosity. Attention should be paid to using contrast agents of low viscosity. Moreover, sufficient fluids should be supplied to limit fluid viscosity of urine. Modern iodinated contrast agents are <b>non-ionic,</b> the older ionic types caused more adverse effects, and their use has diminished.|$|E
25|$|Electrodeionization: Water {{is passed}} between a {{positive}} electrode and a negative electrode. Ion exchange membranes allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the positive electrode. High purity deionized water is produced continuously, similar to ion exchange treatment. Complete removal of ions from water is possible {{if the right}} conditions are met. The water is normally pre-treated with a reverse osmosis unit to remove <b>non-ionic</b> organic contaminants, and with gas transfer membranes to remove carbon dioxide. A water recovery of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the RO inlet.|$|E
25|$|The kinetic {{process of}} destabilisation can be rather long (up to several {{months or even}} years for some products) and it is often {{required}} for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of phase inversion or chemical degradation). Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also interfacial tension in the case of <b>non-ionic</b> surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables to simulate real life conditions for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times.|$|E
25|$|The {{generally}} accepted methods of making CNT films {{involves the use}} of <b>non-ionic</b> surfactants, such as Triton X-100 and sodium lauryl sulfate, which improves their dispersibility in aqueous solution. These suspensions can then be membrane filtered under positive or negative pressure to yield uniform films. The van der Waals force's interaction between the nanotube surface and the surfactant can often be mechanically strong and quite stable and therefore there are no assurances that all the surfactant is removed from the CNT film after formation. Washing with methanol, an effective solvent in the removal of Triton X, was found to cause cracking and deformation of the film. It has also been found that Triton X can lead to cell lysis and in turn tissue inflammatory responses even at low concentrations.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern {{injected}} radiographic positive {{contrast media}} are iodine-based. Iodinated contrast comes in two forms: ionic and <b>non-ionic</b> compounds. [...] <b>Non-ionic</b> contrast is significantly {{more expensive than}} ionic (approximately {{three to five times}} the cost), however, <b>non-ionic</b> contrast tends to be safer for the patient, causing fewer allergic reactions and uncomfortable side effects such as hot sensations or flushing. [...] Most imaging centers now use <b>non-ionic</b> contrast exclusively, finding that the benefits to patients outweigh the expense.|$|E
2500|$|Low-temperature ionic liquids can be {{compared}} to ionic solutions, liquids that contain both ions and neutral molecules, and in particular to the so-called deep eutectic solvents, mixtures of ionic and <b>non-ionic</b> solid substances which have much lower melting points than the pure compounds. [...] Certain mixtures of nitrate salts can have melting points below 100°C.|$|E
2500|$|When [...] dissolves, it {{reacts with}} water to form a balance of ionic and <b>non-ionic</b> {{chemical}} species: dissolved free carbon dioxide (...) , carbonic acid (...) , bicarbonate (...) and carbonate (...) [...] The ratio of these species depends on factors such as seawater temperature and alkalinity (as shown in a Bjerrum plot). These different forms of dissolved inorganic carbon are transferred from an ocean's surface to its interior by the ocean's solubility pump.|$|E
2500|$|Johann Stichlmair {{developed}} electroextraction at the University of Essen in Germany in 1987 as {{an improvement}} on liquid-liquid extraction in an electric field. [...] Electric fields {{are applied to}} enhance the demixing of a sample in a two-phase system. [...] However, as current flows through the system, the resulting convective mixing disrupts separation. [...] Electroextraction corrects for this. [...] Two or three liquid phases that are electrically conductive and immiscible with one another are kept between electrodes, and upon addition of an electric field, charged particles travel from one phase to another separating anions and cations. [...] A two-phase system brings anions into one phase and cations into the other. [...] A three phase system extracts anions and cations into the two outer phases while leaving uncharged particles in the middle phase. [...] Convective mixing is restricted to each phase and does not travel between phases. [...] A diagram is given in figure 1. [...] Organic phases that are used typically have small amounts of water added {{in order to be}} conductive. [...] Other possible phases include mixtures of water and highly polymerized substances, or water with <b>non-ionic</b> surfactants. [...] Electroextraction has also influenced the development of similar electrophoretic separation techniques involving a membrane between the two-phase systems.|$|E
2500|$|Careful {{cleaning}} of stained glass {{can be a}} very effective means of improving its overall condition, because its appearance and function are so heavily dependent on its ability to transmit light. [...] Unfortunately, owing to the fragility of corroded glass, nearly all cleaning treatments can cause changes in the surface of the glass that can expedite corrosion rates, or damage delicate paint layers (Romich et al. 2000). [...] Thus, cleaning efforts should not necessarily be concerned with the complete removal of all encrustrations, but rather the careful thinning of these layers to a point where light can be transmitted through the glass at an acceptable level (Rauch 2004, 5). [...] The simplest cleaning can be performed using carefully applied deionised water, although other mechanical or chemical means are often necessary, and must always be done slowly, in a controlled and focused manner (Rauch 2004, 5-6; Vogel et al. 2007, 9-10). [...] Scalpels or a micro-jet process* can be used to gradually, mechanically thin out these encrustations layer by layer, in the lab. [...] Conversely, poultices or gel pads steeped in a <b>non-ionic</b> detergent or EDTA {{can be applied to the}} surface of the glass for long periods of time for “deep, focused cleaning” (Rauch 2004, 6). [...] With any of these methods, care must be taken to ensure the stability of painted layers, before treatment can take place. [...] In the event that these layers appear particularly friable, it is necessary to clean the glass delicately with cotton swabs, and in more extreme cases, manually affix the original paint lines to the surface, under a microscope, by applying small tiny drops of resin at specific points (Rauch 2004, 6; Vogel et al. 2007, 10). [...] Care should be taken not to remove any later over-painting without due consideration, as such layers may have historic value, in their own right (Rauch 2004, 7).|$|E
