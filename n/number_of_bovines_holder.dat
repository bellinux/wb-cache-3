40|$|The {{process of}} {{identification}} and registration <b>of</b> <b>bovines</b> and bovine holdings on the Maltese Islands has been computerised since 2002, {{with the introduction}} of the National Livestock Database of Malta. This is a computerised and centralised system which has made collection, management and analysis of data possible. The aims of this paper were to study in detail ten year trends in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> dairy holdings together with the bovine population on these holdings and to compare these trends with those reported in other European countries. Six trends related to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> dairy holdings and their bovine population were analysed in the study. The general trends showed that there was a significant decrease in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dairy holdings, in the bovine population and in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> female <b>bovines</b> greater than 2 years of age during the study period.

40|$|The {{creation}} of one centralised National Livestock Database (NLD) for {{the islands of}} Malta and Gozo was of crucial importance in the identification and traceability <b>of</b> <b>bovines</b> from 2002 to date. It was also important in covering legal obligations following Malta’s accession to the European Union (EU) in May 2004. This thesis describes how the processes of identification, registration and traceability <b>of</b> <b>bovines</b> have changed following Malta’s accession to the EU. The validation and integration of data originating from the different departmental sections such as the Identification and Registration section, the slaughterhouse and the National Veterinary Laboratory ensures that any discrepancies are highlighted and can be investigated. The various events recorded on the database allow for the cross-checking of compliance and eligibility <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> producers applying for EU benefits. The main drawbacks and weak points of the system include financial costs for the government department, potentially late notification of births and deaths of new born calves and the insufficient uptake {{in the use of}} the latest technology by bovine producers for the notification of events such as births, deaths and movement <b>of</b> <b>bovines.</b> The fact that the NLD is a computerised and centralised system has made collection, management and analysis of data possible. As a result principles of data mining have been used in this thesis to study in detail ten year trends in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> dairy holdings together with the bovine population on these holdings and to compare these trends with those reported in other European countries. Six trends related to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> dairy holdings and their bovine population were analysed in the study: the trend in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dairy holdings on the Maltese Islands; the trend in the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovines</b> on dairy holdings; the trend in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> female <b>bovines</b> over two years of age (F> 2 y); the trend in the average bovine population (average herd size) on dairy holdings; the trend in the average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> female <b>bovines</b> over two years of age; the trend in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> female and male bovines and their ratios. The general trends showed that there was a significant decrease in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dairy holdings, in the bovine population and in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> female <b>bovines</b> greater than 2 years of age on dairy holdings during the study period. The average herd size and the average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> females greater than 2 years of age on the individual dairy holdings showed no statistically significant changes. On the other hand, a significant increase in the ratio of female to male bovines was registered on these holdings. In the final part of this thesis, data on calf deaths was used to determine the overall mortality rates of live born calves up to 180 days of age in dairy herds on the islands of Malta and Gozo. This is the first time that data using the NLD is being used to determine the calf mortality rates from the whole dairy population of Malta and Gozo. Furthermore, five risk factors namely the island of birth, sex of calf, average herd size, the year and the season of birth were also studied. The data set used in the study consisted of a total of 44, 078 calves born between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2011. From this dataset, 28, 848 calves were born in Malta and 15, 230 in Gozo. In total 2, 821 calves were registered as having died before reaching 180 days of age. The overall calf mortality rate in live born calves up to 180 days of age was found to be 7. 08...|$|R

Bioinformatic tools have been used to detect ERVs in several vertebrates, primarily primates and rodents. Less information is available regarding ERVs in other mammalian groups, and the source of this information is basically experimental. We analyzed the genome of the cow (Bos taurus) using three different methods. A BLAST-based method detected 928 possible ERVs, LTR_STRUC detected 4, 487 elements flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs), and Retrotector detected 9, 698 ERVs. The ERVs were not homogeneously distributed across chromosomes; the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ERVs was positively correlated with chromosomal size and negatively correlated with chromosomal GC content.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Impetigo is {{a common}} {{contagious}} skin infection, mostly seen in children and caused by Staphylococcus aureus and/or group A B-hemolytic Streptococcus. Two surveys performed in general practice showed a strong geographical gradient in the incidence rates among children in the Netherlands. The incidence in the south was approximately {{twice as high as}} {{in the rest of the}} Netherlands. We hypothesized that this difference could be explained by differences in the presence of animal farms and differences in temperature. This study examined whether there is a relationship with the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovines,</b> pigs, sheep, and poultry per km 2, and temperature, which could explain the observed regional gradient in the incidence of impetigo. DESIGN AND SETTING: In this ecological study, data on the incidence of impetigo in children 0 - 17 years of age from the second Dutch national survey were linked to data on the density of farm animals from Statistics Netherlands and temperature data from the Dutch Metereological Service. Using logistic regression allowing for overdispersion, we tested the significance of the effect <b>of</b> <b>bovines,</b> pigs, sheep, and poultry per km 2, and temperature on the incidence of impetigo, correcting for known risk factors. RESULTS: Only the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sheep at the (COROP) regional level was significant; however, this effect could not explain the regional differences. CONCLUSION: The regional differences in the incidence of impetigo in children cannot be explained by the variation in the presence of farm animals or differences in temperature. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

The second problem is the mathematical modeling of the transmission dynamics <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> and mycobacterium tuberculosis in a human-buffalo population. The buffalo-only component of the resulting deterministic model undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, due to the re-infection of exposed and recovered buffalos. Furthermore, this sub-model has a unique endemic equilibrium point which is shown to be globally asymptotically stable for a special case, whenever the associated reproduction number exceeds unity. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, using data relevant to the dynamics of the two diseases in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, show that the distribution of the associated reproduction number is less than unity (hence, the diseases would not persist in the community). Crucial parameters that influence the dynamics of the two diseases are also identified.

Altogether, this study supports the hypothesis that gene segments other than VP 7 and VP 4 play a role in vaccine-induced immunity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{occurrence}} of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) outside the United Kingdom {{in relation to the}} incidence <b>of</b> indigenous <b>bovine</b> spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and to the level <b>of</b> live <b>bovines</b> and bovine products imported from the UK during the 1980 s and {{the first half of the}} 1990 s. Our study provides evidence that a country's <b>number</b> <b>of</b> vCJD cases correlates with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> live <b>bovines</b> it imported from the UK from 1980 to 1990 (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [r(s) ] 0. 73, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 42 - 0. 89, p < 0. 001). Similar correlations were observed with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> indigenous BSE cases (r(s) 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 37 - 0. 87, p = 0. 001) and carcass meat imported from the UK from 1980 to 1996 (r(s) 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 45 - 0. 89; p < 0. 001) Bovine imports from the UK may have been an important source of human exposure to BSE and may have contributed to the global risk for disease...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{are among}} the most common species {{isolated}} from bovine mastitis. The pathogenesis of this bacterium is facilitated by a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> virulence factors, including the ability to adhere to abiotic surfaces and/or host tissues often leading to biofilms formation. From the clinical perspective, the most important feature of Staphylococcus species biofilms is their high tolerance to the conventional antimicrobial therapy. So, the increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> mastitis and the higher levels of Staphylococcus species resistance to traditional antimicrobial agents are considered an important alert for the necessity to focus the future research on identification and development of new strategies to combat S. aureus mastitis. Recently, the interest in natural alternatives based on plant extracts has been rising. In addition to their health benefits, their antimicrobial potential has been increasingly reported. Taking this into consideration, the evaluation of hydromethanolic extracts of E. globulus against S. aureus biofilms was tested and compared with penicillin, one of the antibiotics most often used in the treatment of cattle infections. All mastitis isolates tested were good-biofilm producers. As expected penicillin has demonstrated poor activity against S. aureus biofilms (< 1 log reduction). However, E. globulus Labill was bactericidal, promoting a biofilm cell reduction of 2 - 3 log. Therefore, the present work showed the potential antimicrobial activity of E. globulus against S. aureus from bovine mastitis, namely in biofilm mode of growth and drew attention to its promising use as an alternative to penicillin...|$|R
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} study was performed between June 2009 and March 2010 {{to determine the}} situation <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> tuberculosis (bTB) in Rondônia. The state was divided into three regions and, in each of them, 300 farms with reproductive activity were randomly chosen and considered as primary sample units. In the selected farms, an epidemiologic questionnaire was applied. A fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> females older than two years of age was randomly selected and tested through comparative cervical tuberculin test. Considering the State of Rondônia, the apparent prevalence of bTB positive farms was 2. 3 % (95 % CI = 1. 5 – 3. 5 %). The prevalence in the regions varied from 1. 7 % (95 % CI = 0. 7 – 4 %) to 3 % (95 % CI = 1. 6 – 5. 7 %). The apparent prevalence of bTB positive animals in the State of Rondônia was 0. 12 % (95 % CI = 0. 06 – 0. 25 %) and varied from 0. 08 % (95 % CI = 0. 04 – 0. 18 %) to 0. 15 % (95 % CI = 0. 07 – 0. 33 %) in the regions. The risk factor associated to tuberculosis in the State of Rondônia was the acquisition of animals (OR = 7. 1; 95 % CI = 1. 6 – 31. 1). The State of Rondônia should implement a surveillance system to detect bTB-infected herds to certify them as bTB-free. Moreover, an efficient health education program to inform farmers to test replacement animals for bTB prior to introduction in their herds should also be implemented...|$|R
40|$|The 293 {{cell line}} that was {{generated}} by transforming human embryonic kidney cells with human adenovirus type 5 (HAV 5) early region 1 (E 1) sequences {{is an excellent}} host for generating and growing HAV 5 recombinants with E 1 deleted, {{but it does not}} support the replication <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> adenovirus type 3 (BAV 3). Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK), an established bovine cell line, is an excellent host for growing and plaquing BAV 3. For the purpose of combining the unique characteristics of these two cell lines (293 and MDBK), we generated a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> × human hybrid (BHH) cell lines. Comparison of three BHH hybrid clones—BHH 3, BHH 8, and BHH 2 C—with 293 -Puro (puromycin-resistant 293 cells) and MDBK-Neo (G 418 -resistant MDBK cells) cell lines for total cellular DNA content, species-specific surface markers, isoenzyme analysis, and karyotyping indicate that they are hybrid in nature. BHH clones constitutively expressed the E 1 proteins (E 1 A, E 1 B- 21 kDa, and E 1 B- 55 kDa) of HAV 5 and efficiently supported the replication of both wild-type and replication-incompetent bovine or human adenoviruses. Transient gene expression experiments with a plasmid encoding the bacterial β-galactosidase gene demonstrated that BHH cell hybrids seem to have better transfection efficiencies than either of the parental cell lines. These cell lines will be useful for isolating and growing replication-competent human or bovine adenovirus recombinants with E 1 deleted and for the study of cellular or viral factors important for viral replication. The development of somatic cell hybrids appears to be a simple way of combining some of the desirable characteristics present separately in two parental cell lines...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the environmental impact and level of risk associated with mercury (Hg) contamination near a derelict chlor-alkali plant in Pavlodar, Northern Kazakhstan. Several species of fish were sampled from the highly polluted Lake Balkyldak and the nearby river Irtysh, to assess the extent of Hg bioaccumulation in the aquatic food chain and potential human health risks. A small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> tissue samples, water samples, soil and plant samples from a nearby village were also investigated {{in order to make}} a preliminary assessment of potential impacts on the terrestrial food chain. Mercury levels in fish caught from Lake Balkyldak ranged from 0. 16 to 2. 2 mg kg- 1 and the majority of fish exceeded current human health criteria for Hg. Interspecies comparisons indicated that Hg is accumulated in the order dace > carp > tench. Site-specific bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were calculated for THg, and were estimated for MeHg. Fish from the river Irtysh and floodplain oxbow lakes contained between 0. 075 and 0. 159 mg kg- 1 of Hg and can be regarded as uncontaminated. Soils were found to be impacted by past atmospheric emissions of Hg. Cattle grazing in the surroundings of the factory are exposed to Hg from contaminated soils, plants and surface water, but the consumption of contaminated fish from the lake appears to be the main route of exposure for humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} and <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> herpesvirus 4 (BoHV- 4) infected CD 11 b+ leukocytes were investigated during experimental infections of New Zealand White rabbits by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) analysis. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were collected every second day, and {{the cells were}} stained with phycoerythrin-labelled CD 11 b-specific mouse monoclonal antibody and fluorescein-conjugated bovine herpesvirus 4 -specific mouse monoclonal antibody. The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> double-stained cells from PBLs of the control and inoculated groups were measured and compared in FACSTREK analyser. Double-stained cells were detected in the virus-inoculated group on postinoculation days (PID) 2 - 5 and 9 - 12. The results indicated that CD 11 b+ PBLs were permissive for BoHV- 4 infection, and are probably the main reservoir of the virus during the latent period. The data did not indicate production of infectious viral particles, but virus-specific proteins were expressed {{on the surface of}} CD 11 b+ cells. The two waves of double-stained cells gave similar results to the PCR assays from serum samples, which showed the presence of viral DNA in the serum on the same days when virus-infected CD 11 b cells were also present. Productive BoHV- 4 infection of mast cells or undifferentiated leukocytes in the bone marrow and the antiviral immune response might be responsible for this periodic appearance of the virus in CD 11 b+ PBLs and in the serum. The paper provides evidence that CD 11 b+ PBLs are the main target cell populations in the blood for BoHV- 4. ...|$|R

A new model for the transmission dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and bovine tuberculosis in a community, consisting of humans and African buffalos, is presented. The buffalo-only component of the model exhibits the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, which arises due to the reinfection of exposed and recovered buffalos, when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. This model has a unique endemic equilibrium, which is globally asymptotically stable for a special case, when the reproduction number exceeds unity. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, using data relevant to {{the dynamics of the}} two diseases in the Kruger National Park, show that the distribution of the associated reproduction number is less than unity (hence, the diseases would not persist in the community). Crucial parameters that influence the dynamics of the two diseases are also identified. Both the buffalo-only and the buffalo-humanmodel exhibit the same qualitative dynamics with respect to the local and global asymptotic stability of their respective disease-free equilibrium, as well as with respect to the backward bifurcation phenomenon. Numerical simulations of the buffalo-humanmodel show that the cumulative number ofMycobacterium tuberculosis cases in humans (buffalos) decreases with increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> tuberculosis infections in humans (buffalo). 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{feasibility}} of noninvasive thermometry using high-resolution computer tomography (CT) for the monitoring <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> liver during radiofrequency (RF) ablation. Methods: Radiofrequency probes were used to ablate bovine livers from 20 degrees C to 98 degrees C. During the heating process, images were acquired using a multidetector CT scanner with simultaneous measurement of temperature using calibrated thermal sensors. The CT scanner's thermal sensitivity was derived from the correlation between the CT numbers and temperature. The CT scanner's thermal sensitivity was used to compute a temperature map, and this temperature map was overlaid on the original CT scan using a dedicated software application. Results: The CT <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bovine</b> liver showed a linear decline with an increase in temperature and a CT thermal sensitivity of - 0. 60 +/- 0. 026 Hounsfield unit/degrees C (R- 2 = 0. 87). Temperature maps were calculated using this correlation and were superimposed onto the CT scans presenting temperature distribution around the RF probe in the bovine liver. Conclusions: Noninvasive temperature determination is feasible during RF ablation <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> liver using a high-resolution CT system. Therefore, the proposed method can be of potential use in clinical practice for noninvasive temperature mapping during ablation...|$|R
