25|$|Concurrent {{with the}} sonar readings, the {{floodlit}} camera obtained {{a pair of}} underwater photographs. Both depicted {{what appeared to be}} a rhomboid flipper, although sceptics have dismissed the images as the bottom of the loch, air bubbles, a rock, or a fish fin. The apparent flipper was photographed in different positions, indicating movement. The first flipper photo is better-known than the second, and both were enhanced and retouched from the original negatives. According to team member Charles Wyckoff, the photos were retouched to superimpose the flipper; the original enhancement showed a considerably less-distinct object. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> how the originals were altered.|$|E
25|$|Mattingly and Aaron {{struggle}} {{to find a way}} to turn on the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts Odyssey by transferring extra power from Aquarius. When the crew jettisons the Service Module, they are surprised to see the extent of the damage. As they release Aquarius and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> that Odysseys heat shield is intact. The tense period of radio silence due to ionization blackout is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
2500|$|Wu and Wong's {{match in}} the 1957 kung fu {{competition}} in Taiwan {{is the only}} documented proof of Wong's involvement in fighting competition; the only records of Wong's beimo matches are from eyewitnesses. Since beimo competition was held secretly, the loser often denied involvement in the fight afterward, or both sides would claim victory after the fight. For example, in the match between Ni Yuk Tong [...] (倪沃棠) and Wong, various accounts of the fight exist, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> of where the fight took place, how the fighters performed, and who won. Thus, while many of Wong's students have referred to him as [...] "one of the greatest fighters of this century" [...] (i.e., the 20th century), those outside the wing chun community could doubt the claim's authenticity.|$|E

But what I object to is this economic chance-world in which we live, and which we men seem to have created. It ought to be law as inflexible in human affairs as the order of day and night {{in the physical world}} that if a man will work he shall both rest and eat, and shall not be harassed with any question as to how his repose and his provision shall come. Nothing less ideal than this satisfies the reason. But in our state of things no one is secure of this. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> of finding work; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> of not losing it. I may have my work taken away from me at any moment by the caprice, the mood, the indigestion {{of a man who has}} not the qualification for knowing whether I do it well, or ill. At my time of life--at every time of life--a man ought to feel that if he will keep on doing his duty he shall not suffer in himself or in those who are dear to him, except through natural causes. But no man can feel this as things are now; and so we go on, pushing and pulling, climbing and crawling, thrusting aside and trampling underfoot; lying, cheating, stealing; and then we get to the end, covered with blood and dirt and sin and shame, and look back over the way we've come to a palace of our own, or the poor-house, which is about the only possession we can claim in common with our brother-men, I don't think the retrospect can be pleasing." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1210 Pope Innocent III excommunicated High Duke Leszek. Mieszko IV Tanglefoot quickly conquered Kraków {{and took}} the title of High Duke. The excommunication bull was issued {{at the request of}} an {{anonymous}} Duke of Silesia, probably Henry (because Mieszko IV used the title Duke of Racibórz-Opole).

50|$|They found 63 women {{engineering}} students at 20 universities, 43 {{of those at}} the University of Michigan alone.

50|$|In 830 CE, a {{group of}} Hermetic pagans in Harran needed {{protection}} by being either Muslim, Christian, Jewish, or Sabian. They took the Corpus Hermeticum as their scripture and Hermes Trismegistus as their prophet, and decided to call themselves Sabians. As <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> what the Qur'an meant by Sabian, they were accepted as being such having a monotheistic scripture and a prophet.

Because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> how successful the comic might be, Mumme only promised to pay Porto and Smith for two issues, with only <b>one</b> issue <b>was</b> guaranteed to be published.

It's a funny movie with plenty of pep, and I think a lot of moviegoers will still discover it."
