5|$|As of 2016, Australia has no <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> {{stations}} {{and the former}} Gillard Labor government was opposed to <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> for Australia. Australia has three operating uranium mines at Olympic Dam (Roxby) and Beverley – both in South Australia's north – and at Ranger in the Northern Territory. Australia has no nuclear weapons. Australia operates a research reactor which produces medical radioisotopes at OPAL.|$|E

5|$|Other {{utilities}} {{are provided by}} private entities or South Korean government-owned companies. Seorabeol City Gas, an affiliate of GS Group, provides gas to the Gyeongju residents, while, electrical power is supplied by the public enterprises, Korea Hydro & <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> via the Wolseong <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> Plant. The plant is known for the only <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant operating PHWRs (Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor) in South Korea and supplies about 5% of South Korea's electricity. The owner, Korea Hydro & <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> began to build the Wolseong 1 in the districts of Yangnam-myeon, Yangbuk-myeon and Gampo-eup in 1976. Since 1983, the power plant has been providing commercial service and operating with the PHWRs that has a capacity of 678,000kW. As the construction of each Wolseong 2, 3 and 4 with a capacity of 70,000kW were completed respectively in 1997, 1998 and 1999, Wolseong <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> plant site has been successfully operating the four PHWRs plants.

5|$|The Rudd Labor {{government}} {{elected in}} 2007 opposed <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> for Australia.

5|$|According to the anti-nuclear movement, {{most of the}} {{problems}} with <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> today are much the same as in the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to <b>nuclear</b> <b>power,</b> efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, Australia has no <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> {{stations}} but ex-Prime Minister Tony Abbott supported <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> for Australia.

Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs) is a large underground mine, Beverley, Four Mile and Honeymoon are in-situ leach mines and Ranger in an open pit mine in the Northern Territory. Uranium mined in Australia is mainly for export. Australia has no nuclear weapons or nuclear-powered vessels.|$|E

5|$|Combwich Pill, a small creek {{near the}} mouth of the river, had been used for {{shipping}} since the 14th century. From the 1830s, with the development of the brick and tile industry in the Combwich area, the wharf was used by two local brickyards to import coal and export tiles to Wales and parts of Gloucestershire. This traffic ceased in the 1930s; in the late 1950s the wharf was taken over and upgraded by the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) to bring in heavy materials for the Hinkley Point <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> stations. Construction of Hinkley Point A <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> station was ordered in 1957, with a scheduled completion date of 1960, but was not completed until 1965. This was followed by Hinkley Point B <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> station, which began operation in 1976. It is proposed to use the wharf again for the construction of Hinkley Point C.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with these}} {{proposals}} to examine <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> {{as a possible}} response to climate change, anti-nuclear campaigners and scientists in Australia emphasised claims that <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that uranium mining itself could become {{a significant source of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Anti-nuclear campaigns were given added impetus by public concern about the sites for possible reactors: fears exploited by anti-nuclear power political parties in the lead-up to a national election in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Hinkley Point C <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> {{station is}} a project to {{construct}} a 3,200 MW two reactor <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> station. On 18 October 2010, the British government announced that Hinkley Point– already {{the site of the}} disused Hinkley Point A and the still operational Hinkley Point B power stations– was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> stations. NNB Generation Company, a subsidiary of EDF, submitted an application for development consent to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on 31 October 2011. A protest group, Stop Hinkley, was formed to campaign for the closure of Hinkley Point B and oppose any expansion at the Hinkley Point site. In December 2013, the European Commission opened an investigation to assess whether the project breaks state-aid rules. On 8 October 2014 it was announced that the European Commission has approved the project, with an overwhelming majority and only four commissioners voting against the decision.|$|E

5|$|Ikata is {{the site}} of Shikoku's only <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant. The Ikata <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> Plant has two Mitsubishi 538 MWe Pressurized Water Reactor units with the Two Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the {{original}} Westinghouse design at Prairie Island, Kewaunee, and Point Beach plants) and one Mitsubishi Pressurized Water Reactor unit with the Three Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the Westinghouse Surry, North Anna, and Robinson plants). Units 1 and 2 started up on September 30, 1977 and March 19, 1981 respectively. Unit 3 is a three loop PWR rated at 846 MWe that started up on December 15, 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, General Nichols became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense. He was {{appointed}} chief {{of research and}} development when it was reorganized in 1952. In 1953, he became the general manager of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he promoted the construction of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants. He {{played a key role in}} the proceedings brought against J. Robert Oppenheimer that resulted in Oppenheimer's security clearance being revoked. In later life, Nichols became an engineering consultant on private <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{the energy}} {{consumption}} was 240 billion kilowatt hours. As Turkey imported 72 {{percent of its}} energy in 2013, the government decided to invest in <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> to reduce imports. Three <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> stations are to be built by 2023. Turkey's first <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants are planned {{to be built in}} Mersin's Akkuyu district on the Mediterranean coast; in Sinop's İnceburun district on the Black Sea coast; and in Kırklareli's İğneada district on the Black Sea coast. Turkey has the fifth highest direct utilisation and capacity of geothermal power in the world. Turkey is a partner country of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing energy security, convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles, supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.|$|E
