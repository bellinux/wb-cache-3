5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope</b> {{marks the}} end of the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope</b> remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope.</b> The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E
5|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope,</b> {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope</b> completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E

The nuclear export of ribosomal subunits is a unidirectional, saturable and energy-dependent process. An in vitro assay for the nuclear export of 60 S ribosomal subunits {{involves the use of}} resealed <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelopes.</b> The export of ribosomal subunits from resealed <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelopes</b> is enhanced by cytoplasmic proteins. Here we present evidence that the export-promoting activity was due to the cytoplasmic 90 kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp 90). Isolated, purified Hsp 90 vastly enhanced the export of 60 S ribosomal subunits from resealed <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelopes,</b> while inhibition of Hsp 90 function, either with the Hsp 90 -binding drug geldanamycin or with anti-Hsp 90 antibodies, resulted in reduced release of 60 S ribosomal subunits. To confirm these findings under in vivo conditions, corresponding experiments were performed with Xenopus oocytes using microinjection techniques; the results obtained confirmed the findings obtained with resealed <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelopes.</b> These findings suggest that Hsp 90 facilitates the nuclear export of 60 S ribosomal subunits, probably by chaperoning protein interactions during the export process...|$|R

5|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle {{that is an}} extension of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope.</b> More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope,</b> it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{pores are}} highly {{efficient}} at selectively allowing {{the passage of}} materials {{to and from the}} nucleus, because the <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope</b> has a considerable amount of traffic. RNA and ribosomal subunits must be continually transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Histones, gene regulatory proteins, DNA and RNA polymerases, and other substances essential for nuclear activities must be imported from the cytoplasm. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope</b> of a typical mammalian cell contains 3000â€“4000 pore complexes. If the cell is synthesizing DNA each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. If the cell is growing rapidly, each complex also needs to transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{conditions}} for the isolation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelopes</b> {{by the action of}} heparin on nuclei are established and a morphological and biochemical study of such isolated envelopes is presented. An almost 100 % yield of pure <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelopes</b> can be obtained by a single sedimentation step after incubation of nuclei with heparin for 40 min at 4 ~ The nuclear membrane pellet obtained in this way contains whole envelopes with a preserved perinuclear space and with ribosomes present on the outer leaflet. A single band with an apparent buoyant density of 1. 18 is obtained by sucrose density gradient analysis. The chemical composition of the pellet {{is similar to that of}} the purified membranes and corresponds to 62 % proteins, 34 % phospholipids, 3 % RNA, and 0. 5 % DNA. The presence of low concentrations of sodium phosphate (2 - 10 mM) is critical for a complete solubilization of the chromatin. A less rapid and complete solubilization is obtained with the potassium salt. Low concentrations of Mg Â§ (1 - 3 mM) counteract chromatin solubilization by heparin mainly at the level of chromatin-nuclear membrane association. The presence of EDTA in the medium leads to isolated <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelopes</b> on which neither ribosomes nor nuclear pores are visible, indicating that pore structure is dependent on the presence of Ca ++ or Mg ++.

5|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope</b> acts as {{a barrier}} that {{prevents}} both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble.

This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.|$|E
5|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope</b> {{surrounds}} the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope.</b> These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others.

5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope</b> and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|Cell nuclei contain {{most of the}} cell's genetic material, {{organized}} as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured {{in such a way}} to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expressionâ€”the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope,</b> a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope</b> {{allows the}} nucleus to control its contents, and {{separate}} {{them from the}} rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which macromolecules are translocated through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is little understood. However, recent measurements of nuclear transport in permeabilized cells showed that molecules binding to phenylalanine-glycine-rich repeats (FG repeats) in NPC proteins were translocated much faster through the NPC than molecules not interacting with FG repeats.

NTF 2, the transport receptor of RanGDP, was exported âˆ¼ 30 times faster than green fluorescent protein, an inert molecule of approximately the same size.

5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelope.</b> Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E

40|$|Mediated {{import of}} {{proteins}} into the nucleus involves multiple cytosolic factors, including the small GTPase Ran. Whether Ran functions by interacting with other cytosolic proteins or {{components of the}} nuclear pore complex has been unclear. Furthermore, the precise transport step where Ran acts has not been determined. To address these questions, we have analyzed the binding interactions of Ran using permeabilized cells and isolated <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelopes.</b> By light and electron microscope immunolocalization, {{we have found that}} Ran accumulates specifically at the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear pore complex when nuclear import in permeabilized cells is inhibited by nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP. Ran associates with a peripheral pore complex region that is similar to the area where transport ligands accumulate by depletion of ATP, which arrests an early step of transport. Binding studies with isolated <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelopes</b> in the absence of added cytosol indicate that Ran-GTP directly interacts with a pore complex protein. Using blot overlay techniques, we detected a single prominent polypeptide of isolated <b>nuclear</b> <b>envelopes</b> that binds Ran-GTP. This corresponds to the 358 -kD protein RanBP 2, a Ran binding pore complex protein recently identified by two-hybrid screening. Thus, RanBP 2 is likely to constitute the Ran-GTP-binding site detected at the cytoplasmic periphery of the pore complex. These data support a model in which initial ligand binding to the nuclear pore complex occurs at or near RanBP 2, and that hydrolysis of GTP by Ran at this site serves to define commitment to the nuclear import pathway...|$|R
