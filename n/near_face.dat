5000|$|Macuquinas, {{also known}} as [...] "cobs", were used heavily in local {{transactions}} in America, although their poor quality produced many complaints. Water-powered roller die and punch technology, capable of making high quality, round coinage was imported to Segovia, Spain from Germany in the 1580s, yet the old Royal mint at Segovia continued to make cobs. The Potosi Mint {{was the last to}} establish this advanced technology, making cobs until 1772. The macuquina's irregular shape invited clipping, leading to ever greater numbers of coins below legal weight. Clipped coin tended to migrate at a small profit in commerce to cities in need of coin (often those preparing a fleet for sail) where hard money was accepted at, or <b>near,</b> <b>face</b> value. In 1784 (by which time all macuquinas were over a decade old), King Charles III ordered macuquina in the Indies withdrawn and reminted. The order had to be reissued in 1789, but it remained unfulfilled {{due to a lack of}} resources.|$|E

This suggests that the internal support regions have more flexural ductility than the original designed amount. This ductility is obtained indirectly by determining the amount of moment that the support regions are capable of distributing. Non-linear analysis of beams designed and detailed to the design limits specified by AS 3600 shows that they have substantial reserve in moment redistribution and load capacity {{as a result of the}} inclusion of steel in the compressive zones of the supports.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{understand}} the contribution of spontaneous combustion dangerous region under U type ventilation in gob area, mathematical model describing air flow and temperature heating was established according to mass, momentum and energy conservation equations and solved by FLUENT software. The calculation results show that oxygen mainly concentrates in front of gob <b>near</b> <b>face</b> and decays along depth. Since oxygen consumes along the track, oxygen concentration in intake way is much higher than that in return way, and the air leakage speed near work face is much higher than depth of gob. Thus, dangerous region is divided by oxygen and air leakage criterion. Besides, the area near work face has lower temperature than oxidation region by the effect of heat dissipation while temperature in depth gob decreases gradually due to the low oxygen concentration. Heating process can be seen as an accelerating process. Nitrogen injection can decrease the oxidation scope effectively. Nitrogen injection position in dissipation area is better than in oxidation area. Calculation results reflect the real situation objectively and can be referenced by real engineering practices...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of deformation zones at the backfill soil of wrap faced retaining wall {{is governed by}} the shear strain accumulation. The performance of reinforced soil wall can be improved by observing the location of peak shear strains at dif-ferent depths. The wrap faced reinforced soil walls are modeled using FLAC 3 D. In modeling of wrap faced soil retaining walls, soil is modeled as elasto-plastic with Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion modified with hyperbolic soil modulus model. The geotextiles are modeled by using shell structural element. The interfaces are used between shell elements and soil elements for proper interaction. The wall is formed in layers with facing support and after placing last layer the facing support is removed. The octahedral shear strains are determined along length of backfill at different elevations of the wrap faced walls. Horizontal displacements and vertical settlements are also determined to understand the location of shear deformations of reinforced zone and unreinforced backfill. Three deformation modes: localized deformation <b>near</b> <b>face,</b> relative movement of reinforced zone from retained zone and relative compaction at end of reinforcement are observed. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{problem of}} a surface part-through cracked plate is reduced to a two-dimensional problem by introducing an equivalent through-crack model, loaded by a convenient tension and bending stress distribution along the lips of the crack. The principle of the model {{is based on a}} similar idea as in the line-spring model, introduced by Rice and Levy [1]. In this model the singularities existing at the extremities of the surface lips of the part-through crack on the <b>near</b> <b>face</b> of the plate, indicated by experiments, were taken into account, whereas, in the line-spring model these extremities were considered as free. According to this model the effect of the surface part-through crack was replaced by a continuous distribution of forces N(x, 0) and moments M(x, 0) along the near-face crack lips applied to an equivalent through crack. These forces and moments were represented by power functions completely determining the boundary conditions along the crack. In this way the two-dimensional problem, derived from the model, can be readily reduced to a well-known Hilbert problem yielding integral equations containing the functions expressing the N(x, 0) - and M(x, 0) -distributions {{along the length of the}} crack. These equations were solved by an approximate numerical procedure. From this solution the expressions of stress- and displacement-fields for the surface part-through crack may be evaluated, expressed in terms of the distribution of the stress intensity factor function calculated along the whole front of the equivalent through crack. © 1986 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{engineers}} to design deep excavation into Earth’s surface has advanced significantly {{over the last}} century. The increased power and accessibility of computer systems capable of conducting various permutations of slope stability analysis has meant that solutions to complex geotechnical problems can now be found relatively rapidly. Although, some fundamental problems still exist which challenge modern computing power {{and the ability of}} geotechnical engineers to accurately model the geo materials in which they seek to excavate. These problems include the area of discontinuous rock masses and the effect of scale on strength. In this research, the effect of measurable joint and fracture properties on rock mass strength has been examined through the use of experimental modelling techniques and statistical analysis of new and previously published datasets. Furthermore, the effect of sample size on rock strength has also been examined in order to bridge the gap and quantify the relationship between the strength of laboratory scale rock samples and the scale of the designed slopes. This research has sought to improve the understanding of these areas through the use of; laboratory studies, data analysis and empirical model development using statistical assessment methods. The laboratory testing conducted in this research has included the development and use of high pressure triaxial testing to simulate the in situ stress state of rock at depth. Additionally, uniaxial testing has provided widely comparable measurements of the strength characteristics of samples while emulating <b>near</b> <b>face</b> stress conditions. The specifications of, and procedures followed to build and conduct the tests has been extensively outlined in this work. The high pressure multi-phase triaxial testing apparatus was built to evaluate the strength of intact and jointed rock and mortar specimens. A key requirement of this equipment was its capacity to measure specimen volume change in order to quantify Poisson’s ratio. A comprehensive review of published models and, more importantly, the experimental data relating to the effect of sample size on UCS underpins the research conducted on the correlation between sample size and rock strength. Using the data found in this review, together with a substantial amount of new data, comprehensive statistical analysis was undertaken to characterise the strength-size effect more accurately for different rock types. Original experimental data pertaining to specimens ranging from 63 mm to 300 mm in diameter was also produced and included in this analysis. Additionally, the effect of specimen shape (cylindrical versus rectangular prismatic specimens) on unconfined strength, elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio were examined. Based on the current analysis no relationship was found between Young’s modulus and specimen size, nor Poisson’s ratio and specimen size, nor specimen shape (right-cylinders versus rectangular prisms of the same length to diameter ratio) and strength. However, the nexus between specimen size and strength was confirmed although some models currently used to represent this relationship provide inaccurate predictions. Recommendations have been given to improve the accuracy of the strength change with specimen size. In Chapter 5 the progressive damage stages of quartzite are defined by both stress-strain and AE methodologies. Additionally, recommendations have been made as to the practical implications of these thresholds. The recommendations include the application of the knowledge of failure stage boundaries to more consistently estimate the elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio. This methodology allows a modulus and Poisson’s ratio to be selected based on the desired design application. It may also remove some parameter variation caused by subjective interpretations of the linear regions over which to calculate parameters. These findings can be built upon and applied to other similar rock types. The strength of discontinuous rock mass containing defects, specifically the effect of a single joint, double parallel joints and a discontinuous plane of weakness or intact rock bridge were studied. The relationship between joint orientation and persistency has been quantified in a set of empirical relationships. Acoustic emission readings were collected from tests in order to build on the conclusions of Chapter 5 and study crack growth within the specimen. The assessment of this methodology was of particular importance to AE assessment of failure stages and has not traditionally been applied to specimens containing defined weakness planes. Chapter 6 developed empirical relationships for non-persistent joints of a single roughness, while Chapter 7 quantifies the effect of roughness and orientation on the strength of a rock mass. Open joints of defined roughness and orientation were subjected to triaxial stress to define an anisotropic strength criterion. Accuracy and repeatability of joint properties was ensured {{through the use of a}} water jet cutting system to cut CAD modelled JRC joint profiles into intact rock. Testing occurred under multiple in situ stress conditions to define the criterion over a stress range applicable to open pit slope designs. This data was used to create novel empirical strength versus joint orientation relationships, additionally it was analysed using the published relationships of other researchers. It was found that the empirical relationship of McLamore and Gray (1967) yielded an exceptionally good fit to both the experimental data presented in this research but also a range of experimental data contained in the literature. This finding was consolidated and recommendations have been presented as to the values of appropriate anisotropic fit variables applicable to different rock types and joint roughness. Based on these results a practical methodology for applying this anisotropic strength relationship to the modelling of anisotropic strength in slope design has been proposed...|$|E
