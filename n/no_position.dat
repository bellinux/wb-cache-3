5|$|Assisted {{suicide and}} abortion: Viewing all human life as sacred, the Assemblies of God opposes {{assisted}} suicide and abortion (unless it is medically {{confirmed that the}} mother's life is in imminent, physical danger). It believes scripture is silent {{on the use of}} contraception and therefore takes <b>no</b> <b>position</b> on this subject.|$|E
5|$|Romney took a {{leave of}} absence from Bain Capital from November 1993 to November 1994 to run for the U.S. Senate. During that time, Ampad workers went on strike and asked Romney to intervene. Against the advice of Bain Capital lawyers, Romney met the strikers, but told them he had <b>no</b> <b>position</b> of active {{authority}} in the matter.|$|E
5|$|The British, with no army in {{the field}} and behind in rearmament, was in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to {{challenge}} French strategy, which had assumed the prominent role of the Western Alliance. Having little ability to oppose the French, the British strategy for military action {{came in the form of}} strategic bombing of the Ruhr industry.|$|E
50|$|English lyrics {{were written}} by Mack David and {{numerous}} versions were recorded in the USA in 1950. Those that charted were by Tony Martin (reached the <b>No.</b> 9 <b>position</b> in the Billboard charts), Paul Weston (<b>No.</b> 12 <b>position),</b> Bing Crosby (<b>No.</b> 13 <b>position),</b> Edith Piaf (<b>No.</b> 23 <b>position),</b> Ralph Flanagan (<b>No.</b> 27 <b>position)</b> and Victor Young (<b>No.</b> 27 <b>position).</b> Louis Armstrong recorded C'est si bon and La Vie en rose in New York City with Sy Oliver and his Orchestra on June 26, 1950 and this reached the <b>No.</b> 28 <b>position</b> in the Billboard charts. Bing Crosby also recorded the song in French in 1953 for his album Le Bing: Song Hits of Paris.|$|R
50|$|The much-covered hit {{was also}} popular in 1950 in {{versions}} by Guy Lombardo (reached the <b>No.</b> 10 <b>position</b> in the Billboard charts), Percy Faith (<b>No.</b> 7 <b>position),</b> Bing Crosby with Jeff Alexander Chorus and Victor Young and His Orchestra (<b>No.</b> 11 <b>position)</b> and Dennis Day (<b>No.</b> 22 <b>position).</b> Caterina Valente also recorded the song for Decca Records in 1958.|$|R

5|$|After these defeats, Andronicus was in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to send {{substantial}} forces. In 1320, Andronicus II's grandson, Andronicus III, was disinherited {{following the}} death of his father, Michael IX, the Emperor's son and heir apparent. The following year, Andronicus III retaliated by marching on Constantinople and was given Thrace as an appanage. He kept on pressing for his inheritance and, in 1322, was made co-emperor. This culminated in the Byzantine civil war of 1321–1328, in which Serbia backed Andronicus II and the Bulgarians backed his grandson. Eventually Andronicus III emerged triumphant on May 23, 1328. As Andronicus III consolidated his hold on Byzantium, the Ottomans succeeded in taking Bursa from the Byzantines in 1326.|$|E
5|$|Bryan urged {{a system}} of bank guarantees, so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed, but Taft opposed this, {{offering}} a postal savings system instead. The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September, Carrie Nation called on Taft and demanded to know his views. Taft and Roosevelt had agreed the party platform would take <b>no</b> <b>position</b> on the matter, and Nation left indignant, to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance. Taft, at Roosevelt's advice, ignored the issue.|$|E
5|$|England and France {{were in the}} {{concluding}} stages of the Hundred Years War. The French {{did not wish to}} lose their advantage in the fight by sending knights and the English were in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to do so. Spain was {{in the final stages of}} the Reconquista. The Holy Roman Empire, never centralized enough behind the Hohenstaufen to unite the principalities, had exhausted what could be spared at Varna. Further fighting among the German princes and the Hussite wars seriously reduced the willingness of most to perform a crusade. Poland and Hungary were key participants at Varna and the defeat there along with the Polish–Teutonic Wars kept them busy and unwilling for further commitments.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, Life was a {{great success}} for radio airplay. Three songs from Life {{appeared}} on The Rock Across Australia's Top 100 Songs of 2002 year-end chart.

5|$|In Bulgaria, the {{two decades}} {{following}} the end of the rebellion marked the lowest point of decline of the Second Empire. The reigns of George Terter I (r. 1280–1292) and his successor Smilets (r. 1292–1298) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state's domestic affairs and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates. Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to regain these regions. The fortunes of the country changed for the better under George Terter I's son, Theordore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1321), when Bulgaria acquired Bessarabia from the Mongols and reconquered Northern Thrace from the Byzantines, bringing stability and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|In early 348 BC, the Athenians were {{distracted by}} events on Euboea, {{and were in}} <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to send much help to Olynthos. However, the {{expedition}} the Athenians sent to Euboea to try to maintain their position on the island was a disaster, and the Athenians had to seek peace with Chalcis, thereby effectively losing control of the island. It is possible that Philip actually incited the revolt on Euboea, though it considered more likely {{that this is a}} misreading of a speech of the Athenian politician Aeschines.|$|E
5|$|Near Decatur, Brig. Gen. John W. Sprague, {{in command}} of the 2nd Brigade, 4th Division of the XVI Corps, was {{attacked}} by Wheeler's cavalry. Wheeler had taken the Fayetteville Road, while Hardee's column took the Flat Shoals Road toward McPherson's position. The Federals fled the town in a stampede, but managed to save the ordnance and supply trains of the XV, XVI, XVII, and XX corps. With the failure of Hardee's assault, Wheeler was in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to hold Decatur, and fell back to Atlanta that night. Sprague was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.|$|E
50|$|Entering the 2008 season, the Crimson Tide {{was ranked}} No. 24 in the AP Poll {{and was not}} ranked in the Coaches' Preseason Poll. After their upset victory over Clemson in week one, Alabama moved into the <b>No.</b> 13 <b>position</b> in the AP and No. 17 in the Coaches' Poll. The Crimson Tide {{continued}} to move up in both polls each week through week seven {{when they reached the}} <b>No.</b> 2 <b>position</b> in both polls after their victory at Georgia. The Crimson Tide remained in the <b>No.</b> 2 <b>position</b> over the next four weeks until No. 1 Texas was upset by Texas Tech in week nine. In the polls released after the Texas loss, the Crimson Tide moved into the <b>No.</b> 1 <b>position</b> in both polls. Alabama remained in the <b>No.</b> 1 <b>position</b> until their loss in the SEC Championship Game to Florida when they dropped into the <b>No.</b> 4 <b>position</b> prior to their bowl game appearance. They then ended the season with a final ranking of No. 6 in both polls after their loss to Utah in the Sugar Bowl.|$|R

5|$|The Palmerston {{government}} considered {{recognizing the}} Confederacy {{as an independent}} nation. Seward was willing to wage war against Britain if it did, and drafted a strong letter for the American Minister in London, Charles Francis Adams, to read to the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell. Seward submitted it to Lincoln, who, realizing that the Union was in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to battle both the South and Britain, toned it down considerably, and made it merely a memorandum for Adams's guidance.|$|E
5|$|The {{system was}} impractical. The Hamburg air defence {{district}} controlled both air and ground defences, but each was geographically in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> {{to help the}} other. There was no combined arms synthesis, meaning that the FlaK arm did not directly support the German defences thereby forming one mass defence. Instead, fighter units protecting the coast were held there, with Kriegsmarine FlaK units, while the Hamburg air defence artillery was held too far inland. The Luftwaffe fighters and FlaK units were located too far apart to coordinate.|$|E
5|$|Wilson was a {{delegate}} to the 1848 Whig National Convention, but left the party after it nominated slave owner Zachary Taylor for president and took <b>no</b> <b>position</b> on the Wilmot Proviso, which would have prohibited slavery in territory acquired from Mexico in the Mexican-American War. Wilson and Charles Allen, another Massachusetts delegate, withdrew from the convention, {{and called for a}} new meeting of anti-slavery advocates in Buffalo, which launched the Free Soil Party.|$|E

5|$|Years {{of civil}} war had left Rome {{in a state of}} near lawlessness, but the Republic was not {{prepared}} to accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired <b>no</b> <b>position</b> of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the Roman provinces. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections—in name at least.|$|E
5|$|Buckner {{was given}} a medical leave of absence {{following}} Chickamauga, returning to Virginia, where he engaged in routine work while recovering his strength. His division was sent without him to support Longstreet in the Knoxville Campaign, while the remainder of Bragg's army was defeated in the Chattanooga Campaign. Buckner served on the court martial of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws after that subordinate of Longstreet's was charged with poor performance at Knoxville. Buckner was briefly given command of Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division in February 1864, and on March 8, he was given command of the reestablished Department of East Tennessee. The department was a shell of its former self—less than one-third its original size, badly equipped, and in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to mount an offensive. Buckner was virtually useless to the Confederacy here, and on April 28, {{he was ordered to}} join Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Cotes' {{ship was}} fit only to sail with the wind, {{and the captain}} urged his men to make greater efforts to repair their ship before Uranie {{could come up with}} them again. So engrossed was the British crew with their repairs that it was not until 16:00 that it was {{realised}} that the French frigate was no longer holding station within sight, and had completely disappeared. This led some on the British ship to assume that Uranie had sunk, although in fact the ship had simply turned away {{in an effort to make}} it back to Rochefort to repair the damage suffered in the engagement. Also apparent were a number of sails in the distance. These rapidly approached and were revealed to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unable to manoeuvre his ship or respond to the new arrivals, which were soon identified as French vessels wearing false flags. The leading frigate pulled up close to Thames and fired a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes immediately hailed the French, announcing that he was in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to fight them due to the damage his ship had suffered and that he was striking his flag.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{tentative}} {{plans for}} a joint German-Japanese approach against the USSR were hinted on in the 1936 Anti-Comintern Pact, the years 1938 and 1939 were already decisive for Japan's decision to not expand northward (i.e., against the USSR) but to the south. The Empire decisively lost two border fights against the Soviets, the Battles of Lake Khasan and Khalkin Gol, thereby convincing itself that the Imperial Japanese Army, lacking heavy tanks and the like, would be in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to challenge the Red Army at that time. Nevertheless, Hitler's anti-Soviet sentiment soon led to further rapprochements with Japan, since he still believed that Japan would join Germany in a future war against the Soviet Union, either actively by invading southeast Siberia, or passively by binding {{large parts of the}} Red Army, which was fearing an attack of Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchukuo, numbering ca. 700,000 men as of the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 18 November, the Austro-Hungarians moved into {{position}} {{to carry out a}} further assault, which began the following morning. The Austro-Hungarians' main goal was to break through the defenses of the Serbian 2nd Army, concentrated primarily around Lazarevac, and to drive the Serbian 1st Army back towards the town of Gornji Milanovac while simultaneously assaulting Serbian positions around the villages of Čovka and Vrače Brdo which threatened the Austro-Hungarian flank. The Austro-Hungarians gained a foothold at Vrače Brdo by the evening of 19 November, and seized higher ground from the Serbs further to the south. The Serbian 1st Army was forced to retreat the following day, giving the Austro-Hungarians the ability to advance down the main routes leading to Kragujevac. Potiorek believed it was possible that Putnik was trying to lure the Austro-Hungarians deeper into Serbia for the purpose of encircling them and then attacking their flanks, but correctly assessed that the Serbian Army was in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to carry out such an attack.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Morgan was {{promoted}} to brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division. When the 1st Support Group was shipped to France in May 1940, following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, it had already been stripped of its two field artillery regiments and two infantry battalions. As a result, Morgan's command included only a force of Royal Engineers and a Territorial Army (TA) battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, which {{was in the process of}} converting to an anti-aircraft/anti-tank regiment and armed only with anti-tank guns. His group was in <b>no</b> <b>position</b> to fulfil its normal role supporting the division's armoured brigades and so was sent to reinforce the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division south of the river Somme. During a confused retreat most of the Support Group was captured along with the 51st Division at Saint-Valery-en-Caux but the remainder, including Morgan, got away and were evacuated to England.|$|E
