40|$|The {{stability}} of a dual-spin satellite system during the momentum wheel spin-up maneuver is treated both analytically and numerically. The dual-spin system {{consists of a}} slowly rotating or despun main body, a momentum wheel (or rotor) which is accelerated by a torque motor to change its initial angular velocity relative to the main part to some high terminal value, and a <b>nutation</b> <b>damper.</b> A closed-form solution for {{the case of a}} symmetrical satellite indicates that when the <b>nutation</b> <b>damper</b> is physically constrained from movement (i. e., by use of a mechanical clamp) the magnitude of the vector sum of the transverse angular velocity components remains bounded during the wheel spin-up under the influence of a constant motor torque. The analysis is extended to consider such effects as the motion of the <b>nutation</b> <b>damper</b> during spin-up, and the effect of a nonsymmetrical mass distribution...|$|E

40|$|A dual-spin {{spacecraft}} {{having a}} momentum wheel spinning {{relative to a}} platform to provide bias momentum utilizes cross products of inertia (POI) existing in the platform between the spinning axis and the transverse axes to achieve <b>nutation</b> <b>damping.</b> When the platform is rotating or is displaced from a reference the cross products of inertia are also rotating or are displaced causing thereby degradation of the optimum <b>nutation</b> <b>damping</b> time constant.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of <b>nutation</b> <b>damping</b> of {{dynamically}} tuned gyroscopes (DTG). Unlike the common two-axis gyroscopes, the DTG damping torques caused by dry and viscous frictions are absent in gimbal bearings, while those due to the rotor/gaseous medium interaction are insufficient to provide the required <b>nutation</b> <b>damping.</b> A physical explanation is given to the damping torques induced in the gyroscope by the magnetoelectric torque detectors.

The nutation motions of the satellite excite fluid oscillations in the closed tube system; kinetic energy is destroyed (converted to heat) through tube/fluid friction, constriction of the stream by cross sectional change, and formation of turbulence by stream enlargement.

40|$|In {{a method}} of and {{apparatus}} for <b>damping</b> <b>nutation</b> of a spinning spacecraft, spin axis attitude disturbances are substantially reduced by controlling at least one <b>nutation</b> <b>damping</b> gas thruster to fire with nonuniform gas pulses. During {{the beginning of a}} nutation control sequence, the duration of successive gas pulses is gradually increased (up pulsed) from zero to a predetermined maximum duration.

The facility consists of an air-bearing spin table, a telemetry system, a command system, and a ground control station. The air-bearing spin table was designed to operate in a vacuum chamber. Tests were run on spacecraft components such as fuel tanks, nutation dampers, reaction wheels, and active <b>nutation</b> <b>damper</b> systems. Each of these items affected the attitude of a spinning spacecraft. An experimental approach to determine these effects was required because the dissipation of these components could not be adequately analyzed.

40|$|Perturbations of {{all sorts}} destabilise the {{rotation}} of a small body and leave it in a non-principal spin state. In such a state, the body experiences alternating stresses generated by the inertial forces. This yields nutation relaxation, i. e., evolution of the spin towards the principal rotation about the maximal-inertia axis. Knowledge of the timescales needed to <b>damp</b> the <b>nutation</b> is crucial in studies of small bodies' dynamics. In the literature hitherto, nutation relaxation has always been described with aid of an empirical quality factor Q introduced to parameterise the energy dissipation rate. Among the drawbacks of this approach was its inability to describe the dependence of the relaxation rate upon the current nutation angle. This inability stemmed from our {{lack of knowledge of}} the quality factor's dependence on the forcing frequency. In this article, we derive our description of <b>nutation</b> <b>damping</b> directly from the rheological law obeyed by the material. This renders us the <b>nutation</b> <b>damping</b> rate {{as a function of the}} current nutation angle, as well as of the shape and the rheological parameters of the body. In contradistinction from the approach based on an empirical Q -factor, our development gives a zero damping rate in the spherical-shape limit. Our method is generic and applicable to any shape and to any linear rheological law. However, to simplify the developments, here we consider a dynamically oblate rotator with a Maxwell rheology.

In this phase, damping is poorest, and the system is closely linear. During the investigation, the hydrodynamic problem is treated as three dimensional, and extensive use is made of a variational principle of least-viscous frictional power loss.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of spacecraft nutation, tracking of an inertially fixed target by the Galileo scan platform {{requires the use of}} two control loops to move the scan platform and the stator {{in such a way as}} to compensate for spacecraft motion. The effect of these control loops on spacecraft nutational stability is examined using an eigenvalue analysis approach as well as several computer analysis packages. It was found that the actions of these control loops tend to drive nutation to the point of neutralizing, and even overpowering the damping actions of the spacecraft <b>nutation</b> <b>damper,</b> for pointing directions close to the spacecraft's poles. Stable and unstable zones are mapped out for two sets of spacecraft mass properties, and contributions of rotor asymmetry and stator flexibility are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Nadir {{pointing}} satellites {{can experience}} large atmospheric torques during low perigee parking orbits. Countering these torques can quickly saturate the momentum wheels or consume unacceptable amounts of reaction gas, making earth pointing near perigee impossible or impractical. This paper describes a technique which allows dual momentum wheel spacecraft to exploit this aerodynamic torque {{to achieve a}} stable, aerodynamically neutral orientation. In addition, this torque, coupled with the spacecraft gyro-dynamics and orbit rate, results in a natural alignment of the momentum wheel bias vector with the orbit plane normal. From this known orientation, returning to nadir pointing is simple, requiring only a 90 ° rotation around the pitch axis. <b>Nutation</b> <b>damping</b> and longitudinal stability are achieved by torquing the momentum wheels using a simple control law...|$|R

40|$|Early {{telemetry}} {{from the}} spin-stabilized IMAGE spacecraft {{indicated that the}} vehicle’s initial nutation was not decaying. This behavior was especially puzzling because the spacecraft’s passive <b>nutation</b> <b>damper</b> behaved as expected while IMAGE {{was attached to the}} spinning upper stage. The lack of damping was also puzzling because the damper was a tubular ring partially filled with liquid mercury; a simple, reliable device with a long flight history. In a partially-filled ring damper, the excess kinetic energy associated with nutation is dissipated by fluid viscosity when inertial forces cause the liquid to move through the tube. However, post-launch analysis indicated that the IMAGE damper liquid was immobilized by surface tension. This was an unanticipated consequence of the vehicle’s low spin rate. When it became apparent that passive damping did not work, a ground-commanded open-loop damper was developed using the spacecraft's magnetic torquer and onboard logic that was intended for ground test of the torquer. This work-around successfully resolved the IMAGE nutation damping problem...|$|E
