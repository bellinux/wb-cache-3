40|$|Some {{progress}} has been made in a continuing effort to develop mathematical models of the behaviors of multi-agent systems known in biology, economics, and sociology (e. g., systems ranging from single or a few biomolecules to many interacting higher organisms). Living systems can be characterized by nonlinear evolution of probability distributions over different possible choices of the next steps in their motions. One of the main challenges in mathematical modeling of living systems is to distinguish between random walks of purely physical origin (for instance, Brownian motions) and those of biological origin. Following a line of reasoning from prior research, it has been assumed, in the present development, that a biological random walk can be represented by a nonlinear mathematical model that represents coupled mental and motor dynamics incorporating the psychological concept of reflection or self-image. The nonlinear dynamics impart the lifelike ability to behave in ways and to exhibit patterns that depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. Reflection or self-image has traditionally been recognized as a basic element of intelligence. The nonlinear mathematical models of the present development are denoted self-supervised dynamical systems. They include (1) equations of classical dynamics, including random components caused by uncertainties in initial conditions and by Langevin forces, coupled with (2) the corresponding Liouville or Fokker-Planck equations that describe the evolutions of probability densities that represent the uncertainties. The coupling is effected by fictitious information-based forces, denoted supervising forces, composed of probability densities and functionals thereof. The equations of classical mechanics represent motor dynamics that is, dynamics in the traditional sense, signifying <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> of motion. The evolution of the probability densities represents mental dynamics or self-image. Then the interaction between the physical and metal aspects of a monad is implemented by feedback from mental to motor dynamics, as represented by the aforementioned fictitious forces. This feedback is what makes the evolution of probability densities nonlinear. The deviation from linear evolution can be characterized, in a sense, as an expression of free will. It has been demonstrated that probability densities can approach prescribed attractors while exhibiting such patterns as shock waves, solitons, and chaos in probability space. The concept of self-supervised dynamical systems has been considered for application to diverse phenomena, including information-based neural networks, cooperation, competition, deception, games, and control of chaos. In addition, a formal similarity between the mathematical structures of self-supervised dynamical systems and of quantum-mechanical systems has been investigated...|$|R
40|$|A logical {{connection}} between the survivability of living systems and the complexity of their behavior (equivalently, mental complexity) has been established. This connection is an important intermediate result of continuing research on mathematical models that could constitute a unified representation {{of the evolution of}} both living and non-living systems. Earlier results of this research were reported in several prior NASA Tech Briefs articles, the two most relevant being Characteristics of Dynamics of Intelligent Systems (NPO- 21037), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 26, No. 12 (December 2002), page 48; and Self-Supervised Dynamical Systems (NPO- 30634) NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 27, No. 3 (March 2003), page 72. As used here, living systems is synonymous with active systems and intelligent systems. The quoted terms can signify artificial agents (e. g., suitably programmed computers) or natural biological systems ranging from single-cell organisms at one extreme to the whole of human society at the other extreme. One of the requirements that must be satisfied in mathematical modeling of living systems is reconciliation of evolution of life with the second law of thermodynamics. In the approach followed in this research, this reconciliation is effected by means of a model, inspired partly by quantum mechanics, in which the quantum potential is replaced with an information potential. The model captures the most fundamental property of life - the ability to evolve from disorder to order without any external interference. The model incorporates the equations of classical dynamics, including <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> of motion and equations for random components caused by uncertainties in initial conditions and by Langevin forces. The equations of classical dynamics are coupled with corresponding Liouville or Fokker-Planck equations that describe the evolutions of probability densities that represent the uncertainties. The coupling is effected by fictitious information-based forces that are gradients of the information potential, which, in turn, {{is a function of the}} probability densities. The probability densities are associated with mental images both self-image and nonself images (images of external objects that can include other agents). The evolution of the probability densities represents mental dynamics. Then the interaction between the physical and metal aspects of behavior is implemented by feedback from mental to motor dynamics, as represented by the aforementioned fictitious forces. The interaction of a system with its self and nonself images affords unlimited capacity for increase of complexity. There is a biological basis for this model of mental dynamics in the discovery of mirror neurons that learn by imitation. The levels of complexity attained by use of this model match those observed in living systems. To establish a mechanism for increasing the complexity of dynamics of an active system, the model enables exploitation of a chain of reflections exemplified by questions of the form, "What do you think that I think that you think [...] . ?" Mathematically, each level of reflection is represented in the form of an attractor performing the corresponding level of abstraction with more details removed from higher levels. The model can be used to describe the behaviors, not only of biological systems, but also of ecological, social, and economics ones...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{paper by}} Erik Verlinde [1] argues that gravity {{should be viewed}} not as a {{fundamental}} force, but as an emergent thermodynamic phenomenon due to some yet undetermined microscopic theory. Using well-established thermodynamic principles along with the holographic principle, Verlinde proposes that gravity {{can be seen as}} an entropic force as opposed to a fundamental one. Using this idea, Verlinde claims to be able to derive <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> 2 nd law, <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> law of universal gravitation, and Einstein gravity. We present a challenge to this reformulation of gravity. Our contention is that a detailed examination of Verlinde s argument shows that such a theory cannot correctly give <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> laws or Einstein gravity. We find that the Poisson equation for Newtonian gravity is not uniquely determined using Verlinde s theory. We are also able to show that Verlinde s theory does not uniquely determine Einstein <b>s</b> field <b>equations.</b> Specific calculations can also be done in the Reissner-Nordstrom and Schwarzschild metrics to show that the entropy of these black holes do not agree with accepted values of these entropies. _x 000 D_We will begin by introducing results by Hawking, Unruh, and Bekenstein that motivate the relationship between gravity and thermodynamics. We then summarize Verlinde s proposal of gravity being a thermodynamic phenomenon. From this new theory, we can make calculations using the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom metrics to determine if Verlinde s theory is compatible with well-known calculations for the temperature and entropy of black holes with these metrics. Finally, we will present a detailed explanation as to why we believe Verlinde s derivation of the Poisson <b>equation</b> and Einstein <b>s</b> field <b>equations</b> is flawed...|$|R

Particular focus is given to helium {{in which it is}} shown that energy conservation is only possible if the ground state has electrons at two distinct energies. If the two electrons in the ground state, per current theory, are at the same energy as the ionization energy, it is demonstrated that according to the standard theory approximately 30 eV are lost during ionization, or alternatively, about 30 eV of energy are created during ionization/electron attachment. The same issue of energy loss during relaxation of energy levels following ionization is shown to exist for all atomic species, thus demonstrating that the Pauli Exclusion Principle and energy conservation are not consistent for any atomic species.

40|$|In 1958, Preucil {{suggested}} an equation to calculate ink trap based on measurements of a printed sheet with a densitometer. Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> {{was based on}} the additivity rule and the proportional rule. However, these rules do not hold in all cases. Several alternative equations have been suggested. This study intends to examine the effectiveness of three ink trap equations using densitometry by means of comparing the calculated values to those measured by the gravimetric method. An attempt is also made to estimate the value of maximum printable density, Dm, in Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> The theoretical basis of each equation is briefly introduced. The causes attributing to the failure of additivity and proportionality are discussed as well. Also reviewed are several methods for measuring ink trap, such as colorimetric, spectrophotometric, and magnetic methods, and factors involved in the efficiency of ink trapping. In the experiment, two newsprint and one coated paper were printed with cyan, magenta, and yellow ink in a simulated wet-on-wet condition on the IGT printability tester. Each ink had a specific tack. The second-down inks were transferred on the first ink layers with low, medium, and high thickness. The percent ink trapping on printed strips were then calculated by both the densitometric methods and the gravimetric method. The factors causing poor trapping and back-trap in the experiment are discussed. Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> was found to correspond better with gravimetric trap values than Brunner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> However, both under estimated ink trap in the majority of the tested conditions. As the ink trap measured gravimetrically increased, the discrepancy of ink trap calculated by Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> increased. This applied to Brunner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> as well, but not obviously to Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> proved to reduce the differences between gravimetric ink trap and densitometric ink trap significantly. A Dm value of 1. 59 for newsprint A, 1. 99 for newsprint B, and 2. 5 for coated paper resulted in the greatest accuracy over the conditions tested. When the Dm value approaches infinity, Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> becomes the equivalent of Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> The experiment suggests that a range of Dm values between 1. 5 and 2. 5 was suitable for the tested conditions. For future research, a larger selection of various types of papers and inks are needed to specify a Dm value for general conditions. It might also be useful to specify a theoretical maximum printable density for general conditions, with which the maximum printable density of a given paper can be compared. Thus, the reproduction quality of the paper can be predicted before the printing is conducted. Since the effects of back-trap and ink contamination influence the accuracy of Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> in this experiment, studies for compensating this inaccuracy are suggested...|$|R

Then, the primary (unperturbed) field components are subtracted from the total fields. The rapidly varying phase components of the wave amplitudes are factored out. The singularities in the scattering coefficients are removed through integration by parts. Thus, the integro-differential equation is converted into an integral equation for the diffuse scattered wave magnitudes which depend on the wave vector variable only. Finally, the continuous wave vector variables are discretized and the integral equation is converted into a matrix equation (moment method). The wave magnitudes are determined by solving the matrix equation. The far field vectors at a remote observation point are obtained from the field transformation using the steepest descent approach. ^ The full-wave numerical solution for the diffuse scattered radiation fields is applied to both deterministic rough surfaces with known profile and random rough surfaces with known statistics.
