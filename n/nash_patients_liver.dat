40|$|Background Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{has become the}} most {{prevalent}} cause of liver disease in western countries. The development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis identifies the risk group with an increased incidence of liver-related deaths. AimThe aim of the present study is to investigate how accurately liver ultrasound (US) can contribute toward the prediction of the severity of liver damage in NAFLD, and to determine whether it may be an easily available, inexpensive, noninterventional, widely used screening method. MethodsFifty-four obese patients with variable degrees of BMI were recruited in the present study. Assessment of full medical history, anthropometric measurements, biochemical studies, abdominal US, liver biopsy for histological examination, and determination of the NAFLD activity score (NAS) score were carried out on all patients to identify <b>NASH</b> <b>patients.</b> <b>Liver</b> steatosis was evaluated using liver US, and graded according to a semiquantitative scale from 1 to 4. Liver histological examination was carried out to identify patients with NASH, borderline NASH, or non-NASH according to the NAS score. Results According to the NAS score, patients were divided into non-NASH patients (eight patients), borderline NASH patients (24 patients), NASH patients (20 patients), and patients with NASH and fibrosis (two patients). Alanine aminotransferase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase were significantly higher in NASH patients. Correlating the grading of hepatic steatosis by liver US and NAS score, grade 1 was found in 37. 5 % of patients with non-NASH, 33. 3 % of patients with borderline NASH, and only in 5 % of patients with NASH, whereas grade 4 steatosis was found in 20 % of NASH patients and 4. 2 % of patients with borderline NASH; none of the non-NASH patients were diagnosed with grade 4 hepatic steatosis. The sensitivity of liver US in detecting grades of steatosis in liver biopsy was 61 % in grade 1, 25 % in grade 2, and 75 % in grade 3. There was a direct correlation between grading of steatosis in the histological examination and the presence of NASH, P less than 0. 000. Conclusion Liver US is not only sensitive in the detection of hepatic steatosis, but also in the prediction of the presence of NASH; therefore, it {{can be used as a}} simple, noninvasive, low-cost method for the screening of NAFLD and for the early identification of patients in need of aggressive intervention...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground and aimIt is {{recognized}} that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may develop after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). However, {{the mechanism of}} NASH development remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the changes in gene expression associated with NASH occurrence following PD. MethodsThe expression of genes related to fatty acid/triglyceride (FA/TG) metabolism and inflammatory signaling was examined using liver samples obtained from 7 post-PD <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> and compared with 6 healthy individuals and 32 conventional <b>NASH</b> <b>patients.</b> ResultsThe <b>livers</b> of post-PD <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> demonstrated significant up-regulation of the genes encoding CD 36, FA-binding proteins 1 and 4, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase α, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ compared with normal and conventional NASH livers. Although serum apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and TG were decreased in post-PD <b>NASH</b> <b>patients,</b> the mRNAs of ApoB and microsomal TG transfer protein were robustly increased, indicating impaired TG export from the liver as very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Additionally, elevated mRNA levels of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 and superoxide dismutases in post-PD NASH livers suggested significant activation of innate immune response and augmentation of oxidative stress generation. ConclusionsEnhanced FA uptake into hepatocytes and lipogenesis, up-regulation of PPARγ, and disruption of VLDL excretion into the circulation are possible mechanisms of steatogenesis after PD.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: We have {{integrated}} {{gene expression}} profiling of <b>liver</b> biopsies of <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> with <b>liver</b> samples {{of a mouse}} model of steatohepatitis (MAT 1 A-KO) to identify a gene-pathway associated with NASH. METHODS: Affymetrix U 133 Plus 2. 0 microarrays were used to evaluate nine <b>patients</b> with <b>NASH,</b> six <b>patients</b> with steatosis, and six control subjects; Affymetrix MOE 430 A microarrays were used to evaluate wild-type and MAT 1 A-KO mice at 15 days, 1, 3, 5 and 8 months after birth. Transcriptional profiles of <b>patients</b> with <b>NASH</b> and MAT 1 A-KO mice were {{compared with those of}} their proficient controls. RESULTS: We identified a gene-pathway associated with NASH, that accurately distinguishes between <b>patients</b> with early-stage <b>NASH</b> and controls. <b>Patients</b> with steatosis have a gene expression pattern intermediate between that of NASH and controls. Promoter analysis revealed that 34 of the genes associated with NASH contained an Sp 1 element. We found that Sp 1 binding to these genes is increased in MAT 1 A-KO mice. Sp 1 is also hyperphosphorylated in MAT 1 A-KO as well as in <b>patients</b> with <b>NASH</b> and steatosis. CONCLUSIONS: A gene-pathway associated with NASH has been identified. We speculate that hyperphosphorylation of Sp 1 may be involved in the genesis of steatosis and that other factors, such as oxidative stress, may trigger its progression to NASH...|$|R

40|$|Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is found in}} {{individuals}} who do not drink or abuse alcohol and represents a significant health burden for the general community.

40|$|Objective　To {{study the}} {{clinical}} characteristics {{of patients with}} nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to obtain a significant verdict for its diagnosis. Methods　 Two hundred and six hospitalized <b>patients</b> suffering from <b>NASH</b> in 302 Hospital of PLA from May, 2008 to December, 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. Results　Body mass index (BMI) data of 152 patients were obtained. Twenty-six patients (17. 1 %) had normal BMI, 29 (19. 1 %) were overweight, 72 (47. 4 %) were slightly fat and 25 (16. 4 %) were obese. According {{to the definition of}} International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2005, 38 patients (12. 2 %) had metabolic syndromes among 156 <b>patients</b> with <b>NASH,</b> and 118 (75. 6 %) did not. By ultrasound, 172 patients (87. 8 %) suffered from fatty liver, while 24 (12. 2 %) did not. There was a statistical difference in the judgment of the degree of hepatic steatosis between live puncture and ultrasound result (χ 2 = 68. 033, P= 0. 000). NAFLD activity score (NAS) was just a semi-quantitative system, not a diagnostic procedure. There was statistical significance in difference between NAS for <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> with different degrees of fibrosis. The higher the NAS, the more severe was the fibrosis.

40|$|The liver {{is a major}} {{target of}} injury in obese <b>patients.</b> Non-alcoholic fatty <b>liver</b> disease (NAFLD) is present in 60 - 90 % of obese Americans and can range from simple {{steatosis}} to the more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The onset of a chronic inflammatory reaction marks the progression from simple steatosis to NASH {{and the expansion of}} adipose tissue is strongly associated with angiogenesis. Therefore, we determined the serum concentration of inflammatory [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL 6) ] and angiogenic [vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) ] cytokines and soluble VEGF receptors 1 and 2 (sVEGFR 1, sVEGFR 2) in the serum of an obese population with simple steatosis and NASH compared to healthy controls. Moreover, we determined the TNF alpha, IL 6, VEGF, VEGFR 1 and VEGFR 2 gene expression in the liver of these simple steatosis and <b>NASH</b> <b>patients.</b> The population consisted of 30 obese patients, which were diagnosed with simple steatosis and 32 <b>patients</b> with <b>NASH</b> and compared to 30 age-and-sex matched healthy controls.

40|$|Background: Inflammation and {{oxidative}} stress are key {{factors in the}} pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Polymorphonuclear neutrophils are capable to produce significant amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the NADPH oxidase complex. Increased hepatic neutrophil infiltration has been described in steatohepatitis. We aimed to investigate the in vitro ROS generation by neutrophils of <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> and the hepatic NADPH oxidase activity in murine steatohepatitis. Material and methods: PMNs were isolated from peripheral blood of <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> (n= 16) and healthy controls (n= 16). In vitro ROS production was measured by luminol chemiluminescence after phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized zymosan stimulation. Hepatic lipid peroxidation and NADPH oxidase activation were measured in mice fed with methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) or -supplemented (MCS) diets. Results: PMA activated oxidative burst both in patients and controls. However, ROS production was significantly increased in non-diabetic <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> (n= 9) compared to controls 30 min after the PMA stimulation. PMNs from <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> with diabetes mellitus (n= 7) did not have higher ROS production after PMA-stimulation compared to controls. The PMA-induced peak chemiluminescence was significantly higher in the non-diabetic <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> compared to controls and diabetic <b>NASH</b> <b>patients.</b> No significant difference was observed without any stimulation and in opsonized zymosan induced chemiluminescence. Consistent with the increased oxidative capacity of PMNs in <b>NASH</b> <b>patients,</b> we found increased hepatic lipid peroxidation, higher expression and activation of the NADPH oxidase complex in MCD-steatohepatitis. Conclusion: Our finding supports the role of neutrophil {{oxidative stress}} in NASH.

Histopathological images of LB slices were processed by second harmonic generation (SHG) /two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy without staining, a system called qFibrosis (quantitative fibrosis) system. Altogether 101 quantitative features of the SHG/TPEF images were acquired. The parameters of aggregated collagen in portal, septal and fibrillar areas increased significantly with stages of liver fibrosis in PBC and CHB (P 0. 05). There was a significant correlation between parameters of aggregated collagen in portal, septal and fibrillar areas and stages of liver fibrosis from CHB and PBC (P 0. 05). There was no significant correlation between NASH parameters and stages of fibrosis (P> 0. 05). For CHB and PBC patients, the highest correlation was between septal parameters and fibrosis stages, the second highest was between portal parameters and fibrosis stages and the lowest correlation was between fibrillar parameters and fibrosis stages.

A careful history was taken with special attention to alcohol intake and ultrasonography and liver biopsy were performed in those with no evidence of significant alcohol intake. A histology showing moderate to gross macrovesicular fatty change with inflammation (lobular or portal), with or without Mallory bodies, fibrosis, or cirrhosis, was considered diagnostic for <b>NASH.</b> <b>Patients</b> with mild steatosis were rechecked for the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

RNA and DNA libraries were sequenced from plasma filtrates enriched in viral particles to catalog virus populations. Hepatitis viruses were readily detected at high coverage in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C, but {{only a limited number}} of sequences resembling other viruses were found. The exception was a library from a patient diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that contained multiple sequences matching GB virus C (GBV-C).

To elucidate the relationship between lifestyle and NASH, we sur veyed exercise and dietary habits, comparing them among 171 biopsyproven <b>NASH</b> <b>patients,</b> 29 nonalcoholic fatty <b>liver</b> (NAFL) <b>patients</b> and 49 normal subjects. Dietary habits including the duration of dinner time, amount of rice at dinner, and weekly frequencies of meat, fries, Chinese noodles, sweets, and instant food consumption were significantly different in male <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> compared to normal male subjects. In women, differ ences were seen in the amount of rice at dinner, frequency of eating out, and proclivity for sweets. In male <b>NASH</b> <b>patients,</b> the frequency of physical exercise was significantly lower. The life style tendencies of NASH were almost similar to those of NAFL. In the comparison between obese NASH and nonobese NASH, no clear lifestyle differences were found. In conclusion, the most striking result of this survey was that the lifestyle of males con tributed significantly to the development of NASH. These results point to treatment of NASH in males. In female <b>NASH</b> <b>patients,</b> lifestyle differences were minimal, and the effects of other factors such as genetic background will need to be investigated...|$|R

40|$|Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is a growing}} medical problem around the world. NAFLD {{patients}} with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The ability to distinguish NASH from simple steatosis would be of great clinical significance. Ballooning hepatocytes are characteristic of typical pathological NASH; here, the polarized secretion of proteins is disrupted due to destruction of the cytoskeleton. We previously reported that fucosylated glycoproteins are secreted into bile, but not into sera in normal liver. Therefore, we hypothesized that the fucosylation-based sorting machinery would be disrupted in ballooning hepatocytes, and serum fucosylated glycoproteins would increase in <b>NASH</b> <b>patients.</b> To confirm our hypothesis, we evaluated serum fucosylated haptoglobin (Fuc-Hpt) levels in biopsy-proven NAFLD patients (n = 126) using a lectin-antibody ELISA kit. Fuc-Hpt levels were significantly increased in <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> compared with non-NASH (NAFLD <b>patients</b> without <b>NASH)</b> <b>patients.</b> Interestingly, Fuc-Hpt levels showed a significant stepwise increase with increasing hepatocyte ballooning scores. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that Fuc-Hpt levels were independent and significant determinants {{of the presence of}} ballooning hepatocytes. Moreover, Fuc-Hpt levels were useful in monitoring liver fibrosis staging. Next, to investigate the significance of serum Fuc-Hpt in a large...|$|R
40|$|Non-alcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) is {{a disease}} of unknown origin characterized histologically by alcoholic-like liver injury in the absence {{in the absence of}} significant alcohol intake. This study was conducted to assess the clinical and pathological features of <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> in Iran. <b>Patients</b> with elevated <b>liver</b> transaminases, negative serologic markers of viral or autoimmune hepatitis and no findings in favor of metabolic liver disease were enrolled. A careful history was taken with special attention to alcohol intake and ultrasonography and liver biopsy were performed in those with no evidence of significant alcohol intake. A histology showing moderate to gross macrovesicular fatty change with inflammation (lobular or portal), with or without Mallory bodies, fibrosis, or cirrhosis, was considered diagnostic for <b>NASH.</b> <b>Patients</b> with mild steatosis were rechecked for the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Fifty-three patients who met the above criteria entered the study. Thirty-two patients (60. 4 %) were male and 21 (39. 6 %) were female with the mean age of 37. 8 ± 11. 3 years. Twenty-six patients (55. 3 %) were diabetic. Mean AST to ALT ratio was 0. 95 ± 0. 52; 65. 3 %of patients had a ratio below than 1, and 95. 9 % were below of 2. Ultrasonography was abnormal in 32 (76. 2 %) <b>patients.</b> <b>Liver</b> biopsy showed mild steatosis in 35. 7 % moderate steatosis in 53. 6 % and severe forms in 10. 7 %. In 80. 2 % of patients, portal inflammation was present, and 15. 1 % had some degrees of fibrosis. The amount of increase in liver enzymes bore no relationship with the presence of fibrosis, portal inflammation, and degree of steatosis (P> 0. 05). The patients wee somewhat younger than other studies, and most of them were male which might be due to the low rate of alcohol consumption in our country. Most of the patients had body mass index (BMI) higher than normal. Our findings show that NASH must not be considered a disease confined to high-risk groups only, and its impact be larger than what is generally considered...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) {{is a part}} of histological {{spectrum of}} nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Higher incidence of cardiovascular mortality has been reported in studies including patients with NAFLD. Impaired myocardial function can be detected by a novel echocardiographic method called speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) when conventional methods were normal. Methods: Twenty-eight biopsy-proven <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> (mean age 41. 6 ± 9. 8, 16 male) without hypertension and diabetes mellitus were included in study. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography. Offline analyses of images was performed and strain (S), strain rate (SR) parameters compared between <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> and controls. Results: RSR-S values were similar but RS, RSR-E, RSR-E/A values were significantly lower and RSR-A was higher in the <b>NASH</b> <b>patients.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} CS, CSR-S, CSR-E, CSR-A and CSR-E/A values among the two groups. The most impressive results were obtained from longitudinal strain and strain rate parameters. LS, LSR-S, LSR-E, LSR-A, values were significantly lower in NASH group when compared with healty controls. Conclusions: The LV longitudinal and radial systolic functions may be deteriorated in <b>patients</b> with <b>NASH</b> even in the absence of apparent decrease in the LV ejection fraction.

40|$|Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease {{is the most}} {{prevalent}} chronic liver disease in Western countries; it can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. The importance of gut-liver-adipose tissue axis has become evident and treatments targeting gut microbiota may improve inflammatory and metabolic parameters in <b>NASH</b> <b>patients.</b> In a randomized, controlled clinical trial, involving 50 biopsy-proven <b>NASH</b> <b>patients,</b> we investigated the effects of synbiotic supplementation on metabolic parameters, hepatic steatosis, intestinal permeability, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serum levels. Patients were separated into two groups receiving Lactobacillus reuteri with guar gum and inulin for three months and healthy balanced nutritional counseling versus nutritional counseling alone. Before and after the intervention we assessed steatosis by magnetic resonance imaging, intestinal permeability by lactulose/mannitol urinary excretion and SIBO by glucose breath testing. <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> presented high gut permeability, but low prevalence of SIBO. After the intervention, only the synbiotic group presented a reduction in steatosis, lost weight, diminished BMI and waist circumference measurement. Synbiotic did not improve intestinal permeability or LPS levels. We concluded that synbiotic supplementation associated with nutritional counseling seems superior to nutritional counseling alone for NASH treatment as it attenuates steatosis and may help to achieve weight loss...|$|R
40|$|NASH {{associates}} steatosis with parenchymal {{inflammation and}} signs of hepatocellular injuy and even apoptosis. This leads in a minority of patients to fibrosis {{and in the long}} term to cirrhosis. NASH regularly occurs in a metabolic context characterized by insulin resistance. Several drugs have been tested in randomized controlled studies. Glitazones improve insulin resistance and also NASH, but are associated with side effects particularly unwelcome in <b>NASH</b> <b>patients.</b> Ursodesoxycholic acid, an hydrophilic biliary acid with hepatoprotective properties, does not improve the histological lesions of NASH. Vitamin E is the only compound which showed so far a positive effect without relevant side effects. However, {{it is too early to}} recommend its long-term use in this indication.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) is {{an increasing}} indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in the United States and other countries. However, the incidence of disease recurrence and natural course following OLT remains incompletely understood. Objective: To estimate the incidence of recurrent disease, outcome and identify risk factors associated with disease recurrence in patients undergoing OLT for NASH as compared to those undergoing OLT for HCV cirrhosis. Methods: We identified all <b>patients</b> with end-stage <b>liver</b> disease secondary to NASH (n= 53) or HCV (n= 95) cirrhosis who underwent OLT at our institution between 1998 and 2005. Protocol liver biopsies were performed (Day 7, Month 4 and yearly) after OLT, and as clinically indicated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess the fibrosis progression and survival. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with disease recurrence. Results: Five-year survival was 90. 5 % in NASH vs 88. 4 % in HCV group (p= 0. 97). The median (25 %ile, 75 %ile) follow-up to last available biopsy was 12. 7 (5. 9, 26. 3) months, during which 17 (32 %) of <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> developed persistent fatty infiltration in their graft, 8 (15 %) of whom had accompanying histologic features of recurrent NASH. There {{was no difference in}} the prevalence of post-OLT steatosis between HCV and <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> after adjusting for time of histologic follow-up (p= 0. 33). Patients with HCV infection were more likely to develop hepatic fibrosis post-OLT than those with NASH (62. 1 % vs 18. 9 %, p< 0. 001). Multivariate analysis identified post-OLT diabetes (HR= 2. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 2 – 3. 2, p= 0. 007) as an independent risk factor for fibrosis development. Additionally, NASH subjects who received steroids had a significantly higher risk of developing hepatic fibrosis post-OLT than <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> who did not receive steroids and all HCV subjects (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Recurrence of steatosis post-OLT is common. Corticosteroid use may contribute to fibrosis progression in this population...|$|R

40|$|Nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} or NASH is {{an excessive}} accumulation {{of fat in}} hepatocytes accompanied by inflammation and hepatic injury. Proinflammatory molecules such as IL- 17, CCL 20, S 100 A 8, S 100 A 9, and S 100 A 8 /A 9 {{have been shown to}} be implicated in many types of cancer. Telomerase activity has been found to be associated with chronic inflammation and cancer. NASH can progress to fibrosis then cirrhosis and finally to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our objective is to try to find a relation between inflammation and the progression of NASH into HCC. We found that there was a significant elevation in the telomerase activity, detected by real-time PCR, between NASH and fibrotic NASH in the <b>liver</b> biopsies of <b>patients.</b> The expression of S 100 A 8, S 100 A 9, S 100 A 8 /A 9, CCL 20, and IL- 17, detected by ELISA, is significantly increased in <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> with fibrosis in comparison with controls. But, in <b>NASH</b> <b>patients,</b> S 100 A 9, S 100 A 8 /A 9, and IL- 17 only are significantly elevated in comparison with controls. The same, on the mRNA level, expression of IL- 17, detected by RT-PCR, is significantly elevated in <b>NASH</b> <b>patients</b> in comparison with controls. Therefore, there is a direct link between the expression of IL- 17, CCL 20, telomerase, S 100 A 8, and S 100 A 9 in the fibrotic condition and the progression towards cancer...|$|R
