5|$|Waterways in Tameside {{include the}} rivers Medlock and Etherow, which form parts of Tameside's western and eastern {{boundaries}} respectively, and the River Tame crosses the borough north to south, giving Tameside its name. The Ashton Canal, the Hollinwood Branch Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, and the Peak Forest Canal all {{run through the}} borough. There are also several reservoirs, including the Audenshaw Reservoirs. Greenspace accounts for 63.5% of the Tameside's total area, domestic buildings and gardens comprise 17.4%, {{and the rest is}} made up of roads and <b>non-domestic</b> buildings.|$|E
5|$|The land {{within the}} town {{is made up of}} {{approximately}} 62% greenspace, 18% domestic gardens, 7% roads, 4% domestic buildings, 3% <b>non-domestic</b> buildings and 6% other uses. Since the 19th century, trade in Brownhills has been centred on the High Street. As the canal and Clayhanger Common lie immediately to the south of the High Street, the town's housing areas are mainly to the north and at the eastern and western ends of the town. Brownhills has 5,152 residential dwellings, of which 47% are semi-detached houses. Selling prices for all types of property within the town have risen significantly since 2000; in August 2007 the average selling price was £137,600, compared to £59,596 in 2000, a rise of 131%. The Aldridge and Brownhills Housing Trust owns and manages those properties formerly owned as council houses by Walsall Council.|$|E
25|$|Domestic water {{charges in}} Ireland were thus {{prohibited}} under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997, passed in May 1997 {{shortly before the}} June 1997 general elections in which Fine Gael lost to Fianna Fáil under Bertie Ahern. However, because of popular discontent, the new government chose not to pursue domestic water charges. Instead, it embarked on consultations {{which resulted in the}} 1998 Water Services Pricing Policy. This policy banned cross-subsidy of domestic services from <b>non-domestic</b> charges. For <b>non-domestic</b> users, the policy required the recovery of average operational and marginal capital costs of water services from these users. It also foresaw the metering of all <b>non-domestic</b> users by 2006. Domestic operational costs were to be paid for through a local government fund, and capital costs were to be financed through the capital programme of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.|$|E
25|$|The Immigration Control Ordinance dealt {{exclusively}} with all non-Gibraltarians seeking {{a permit to}} enter and reside in Gibraltar. This ordinance remained firmly in the Governor's area of jurisdiction, since immigration in Gibraltar {{was defined as a}} <b>non-domestic</b> matter.|$|E
25|$|A rating list is {{required}} to identify each relevant <b>non-domestic</b> property in the area, and assign a rateable value, based on a rental valuation of the property. Some types of property, such as public utilities, are valued using a statutory formula instead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-domestic</b> {{animals in}} the Boho area include the Irish hare, wild goats, foxes, badgers, red squirrels, rats, mice and shrews and the {{occasional}} pine marten. Amongst Northern Ireland's priority species are Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentoni) which was observed in a nursery roost located in Boho Caves in July 1895.|$|E
25|$|No {{standing}} {{buildings have}} survived at the modern site. Only public, <b>non-domestic</b> foundations remain, with poorly reconstructed walls. The ashlar blocks {{used in many}} of these structures were mass-produced in similar styles so that they could possibly be used for multiple purposes. Throughout the period of the site, certain buildings changed purposes, causing a mix of artifacts found today.|$|E
25|$|Palestinian {{nationalism}} {{is the national}} movement of the Palestinian people for self-determination in and sovereignty over Palestine. Originally formed in opposition to Zionism, Palestinian nationalism later resisted Pan-Arabist tendencies as well. Thus it has rejected the historic occupation of the Palestinian territories by Israel and the <b>non-domestic</b> Arab rule by Egypt over the Gaza Strip and Jordan over the West Bank.|$|E
25|$|In the 1966–67 Balkans Cup (a {{competition}} {{set up for}} Eastern European clubs from Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia {{that existed}} between the 1960–61 and 1993–94 seasons), Fenerbahçe won the cup after three matches against Greek club AEK Athens, making them the first Turkish club to win a <b>non-domestic</b> competition. This success would remain unparalleled by a Turkish club until Sarıyer and Samsunspor won the cup many years later in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Water {{resources}} are abundant in Ireland, with 82% {{of drinking water}} supplies in Ireland sourced from surface water (i.e. rivers and lakes) and 18% coming from groundwater – 10.5% from groundwater and 7.6% from springs. This high dependence on surface water is above the EU average. Approximately 2% of Ireland's water {{resources are}} abstracted for human use. Unaccounted for water constitutes 41% of total water supply, followed by supply for domestic demand (39%), and <b>non-domestic</b> demand (20%).|$|E
25|$|The {{football}} {{team of the}} club has won a record 91 domestic trophies in total, including a record 28 national championships (19 Turkish Super League, 6 National Division, and 3 Turkish Football Championship titles), amongst others. The club is also leading the all-time table of the Turkish Super League by far. In international club football, Fenerbahçe has won the Balkans Cup in 1968, which is marked as the first ever <b>non-domestic</b> trophy won by a Turkish {{football team}}.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, the Minister of Environment, Phil Hogan, {{announced}} a six-week consultation on a planned fundamental {{reform of the}} water sector. Following that, a metered domestic water charges would be introduced and a new public utility, Irish Water, would be established and take over responsibilities for drinking and waste water services from the local authorities. Independent economic regulation, through the Commission for Energy Regulation, would oversee the new utility's running costs, infrastructural investment plans and the design and level of domestic and <b>non-domestic</b> water charges.|$|E
25|$|For each {{property}} in the rating list for their area, the local authority calculates and issues a bill, which it is responsible for collecting, with powers to pursue payment. The rateable value is multiplied by the Uniform Business Rate, referred to in legislation as the <b>non-domestic</b> rating multiplier, to arrive at an annual bill. For example, a rateable value of £10,000 and a multiplier of 40p would produce an annual bill of £4000. The bill usually requires payment in instalments over the financial year.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-domestic</b> {{customers}} pay {{a combined}} charge {{for water and}} wastewater. Local authorities set the rates. In 2013, the national average water rate stood at €1.13 per m³. The national average wastewater rate was €1.19 per m³. €2.37 per m³ is the average combined rate. Some variation exists in the local authorities' rates, with Kildare County Council having a combined rate of €1.59 per m³, in contrast with €3.04 per m³ charged by Wicklow County Council. The cost of water for industrial users has remained relatively static since 2007.|$|E

This is her second number-one album in Japan. In its chart run, it sold 900,000 copies and was the third best selling album of the year, and the only <b>non-domestic</b> album in the top twenty-five. In Spain, The Best Damn Thing debuted at number nine, lower than Under My Skin, which debuted at number one. The album debuted at number one in over twenty {{countries}} and sold 784,000 copies in its first week worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Trudeau is {{the busiest}} {{airport in the}} {{province}} of Quebec, the third-busiest airport in Canada by passenger traffic with 16.6 million passengers and fourth by aircraft movements, with 225,203 movements in 2016. It is one of eight Canadian airports with United States border preclearance {{and is one of the}} main gateways into Canada with 10.1 million or 63% of its passengers being on <b>non-domestic</b> flights, the highest proportion amongst Canada's airports during 2016. It is one of four Air Canada hubs and, in that capacity, serves mainly Quebec, the Atlantic Provinces and Eastern Ontario. The air route between Montreal and Paris (CDG and ORY airports) is the busiest international route from Canada. On an average day, nearly 45,000 passengers transit through Montréal-Trudeau.|$|E
25|$|While the u-value ceased {{being the}} sole {{consideration}} in 2006, u-value limits {{similar to those}} in the 2002 regulations still apply, but are no longer sufficient by themselves. The DER, and TER (Target Emission rate) calculated through either the UK Government's Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings (SAP rating), 2005 edition, or the newer SBEM (*Simplified Building Energy Model) which is aimed at non-dwellings, became the only acceptable calculation methods. Several commercial energy modeling software packages have now also been verified as producing acceptable evidence by the BRE Global & UK Government. Calculations using previous versions of SAP had been an optional way of demonstrating compliance since 1991(?). They are now a statutory requirement (B. Reg.17C et al.) for all building regulations applications, involving new dwelling/buildings and large extensions to existing <b>non-domestic</b> buildings.|$|E
25|$|Since the Book of Genesis {{refers to}} young goats by the Hebrew phrase g'di izim, but the {{prohibition}} against boiling a kid... only {{uses the term}} g'di (גדי). Rashi, {{one of the most}} prominent talmudic commentators, argued that the term g'di must actually have a more general meaning, including calves and lambs, in addition to young goats. Rashi also argued that the meaning of g'di is still narrow enough to exclude birds, all the undomesticated kosher animals (for example, chevrotains and antelope), and all of the non-kosher animals. The Talmudic writers had a similar analysis, but believed that since domesticated kosher animals (sheep, goats, and cattle) have similar meat to birds and to the <b>non-domestic</b> kosher land-animals, they should prohibit these latter meats too, creating a general prohibition against mixing milk and meat from any kosher animal, excepting fish.|$|E
25|$|The new <b>non-domestic</b> {{rating system}} {{became known as}} {{business}} rates, or sometimes the universal business rate. It retained from its predecessors {{the concept of a}} series of local rating lists, with each property being assessed for a rateable value based on rental values. Rating lists were prepared and maintained by the Valuation Office (reconstituted in 1991 as an UK Government Executive Agency, the Valuation Office Agency), while billing and collection was the responsibility of local authorities. Previously, local authorities had decided what proportion of rateable values to charge; the new system featured a centrally set multiplier, {{often referred to as the}} Uniform Business Rate, by which the basic bill was calculated. The bill could be further modified by various reliefs, including the newly introduced transitional relief, which was designed to smooth large changes in liability due to revaluations. The multiplier was calculated to ensure that, on average, bills rose by no more than the rate of inflation.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} program {{included the}} construction of several brand-new facilities, including a jetty for flights to the United States (US Preclearance Terminal), another for other international destinations (International Terminal) and a huge international arrivals complex. An 18-gate Transborder Concourse opened in 2003, an 11-gate International Concourse opened in 2004, new customs hall and baggage claim area for <b>non-domestic</b> flights and an expanded parking garage opened in 2005. Additionally, sections of the domestic area were renovated and expanded in 2007, accompanied with additional retail space. The International part of the Aeroquay satellite was demolished in 2008, leaving the domestic part for regional carriers. The completion of the CAD716 million expansion gives Montréal–Trudeau the ability to serve 15 million passengers a year. This ironically accomplished {{one of the goals}} that was to be met with {{the construction of}} Mirabel. (In the 1970s, the federal government projected that 20 million passengers would be passing through Montreal's airports annually by 1985, with 17 million through Mirabel). Aéroports de Montréal financed all of these improvements itself, with no government grants. By the end of 2007, CAD1.5 billion had been spent to upgrade Montréal–Trudeau.|$|E
25|$|The fort {{was built}} in {{multiple}} phases. Radiocarbon dating has demonstrated that the main walls were constructed in the early historic period, possibly {{as early as the}} late 3rd century, and they were refurbished in the 6th or 7th centuries. The layout of the fort was typical of those built across Britain and France in the late Iron Age, though, suggesting that the Picts may have reoccupied an earlier stronghold and reinforced it by adding the stone fortifications. Differences in the techniques used to build the walls of the upper and lower enclosures suggest different dates of construction, and the triple ramparts and ditches that cut the enclosure off from the mainland may predate {{the main body of the}} fort and represent earlier iron age defences. Signs of earlier occupation found on the site of the fort include a Late Bronze Age spearhead, a Greek coin of the reign of Nero (54–68 AD), and a Celtic stone head found within the well. Indications of <b>non-domestic</b> occupation have been found from the Iron Age, Norse and Early Medieval periods, but no sign of occupancy of the fort survives after the 9th century, a period approximately coinciding with entries in the Annals of Ulster recording devastating Norse raids on the Kingdom of Fortriu.|$|E
25|$|Standards are set {{for sewage}} sludge {{generated}} or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs {{are referred to}} as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of <b>non-domestic</b> wastewater. Pretreatment does not thoroughly reduce pollutants level and therefore communities have to dispose rather than use sludge.|$|E

It is possible for a hereditament to be both <b>non-domestic</b> and domestic in different parts, for example a shop with living accommodation.

The Local Government Finance Act 1988 introduced business rates in England and Wales from 1990, repealing its immediate predecessor, the General Rate Act 1967. The act also introduced business rates in Scotland, but as {{an amendment to the}} existing system which had evolved separately to that in the rest of Great Britain.
