5|$|Commissioner Gordon {{announces that}} the police have arrested the Joker's men and unveils the Bat-Signal. Harvey Dent reads a note from Batman, {{promising}} that he will defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again. Vicki is taken to Wayne Manor by Alfred, who tells her that Bruce {{will be a little}} late. She responds that she is <b>not</b> <b>surprised,</b> as Batman looks at the signal's projection, standing watch over the city.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April The Observer (the Guardians sister paper) {{published}} the first photograph of Tomlinson {{lying on the}} ground next to riot police. Over the next few days the IPCC told reporters that Tomlinson's family were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> that he had had a heart attack. When journalists asked whether he had been in contact with police officers before his death, they were told the speculation would upset the family.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of aerial reconnaissance, Liman von Sanders had fairly {{accurate}} knowledge on 17 September 1918, regarding the forces deployed against his Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Armies. He understood there to be five infantry divisions and a French detachment facing the Eighth Army with another two divisions facing the Seventh Army and two mounted divisions facing the Fourth Army. Liman von Sanders was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> by the strength and location of the attack. He shifted all his available reserves and reinforcements to the west, not to the east. The strategically vital coastal plain was the most strongly defended sector of the front line. Here Liman von Sanders deployed his most experienced infantry divisions supported by heavy artillery.|$|E

5|$|Tomlinson's {{death was}} {{confirmed}} {{in a statement}} that accused protesters of having hampered police efforts to save his life. His family were not told he had died until nine hours after his death. The police and IPCC told journalists that his family were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear he had had a heart attack. Journalists who asked whether police had had any contact with Tomlinson were asked not to speculate in case it upset the family. Direct contact with the family was refused. The police issued a statement on behalf of the family instead, which said the police were keeping them informed.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish fleet arrived off Roatán at 6am on March 13, {{and after}} its {{defenders}} fired several ineffectual cannon shots, the Santa Maltilda {{and the other}} ships anchored out of range. At 8am Gálvez sent his second-in-command on the 'Santa Matilda' Enrique MacDonell, who spoke English, in to request the surrender of the island's defenders. The defenders asked for six hours to consider their options, which Gálvez granted. After that time had elapsed MacDonell came back with word that the defenders refused to surrender and were prepared to stand their ground 'to the death'. The Spanish were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> as their sailors had noticed the English appeared to be preparing defenses during grace period. An Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas, so Gálvez then held council of his eleven officers, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did not think that he would able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E

25|$|Dmitry had {{anticipated}} a clash with Germany {{for years and}} was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> at the outbreak of World War I.

25|$|The {{public library}} {{was one of}} the most {{important}} points of access for interviewees, along with the internet and bookstores. Interviewees often relied heavily on online library catalogs as safe, anonymous searches to explore lesbian fiction. Participants often did not find what they were looking for in online catalogs, but were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> by the lack of materials. Rothbauer suggests making materials more visible, and also improving the scope and currency of library holdings to reach these users.|$|E

25|$|While at Edwards, Cooper was {{intrigued}} {{to read an}} announcement saying that a contract had been awarded to McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis, Missouri, to build a space capsule. Shortly after this he was called to Washington, D.C., for a NASA briefing on Project Mercury and the part astronauts would play in it. Cooper went through the selection process with the other 109 pilots and was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> when he was accepted as {{the youngest of the}} first seven American astronauts.|$|E
25|$|According to many Rastas, the {{illegality}} of cannabis in {{many nations}} {{is evidence of}} persecution of Rastafari. They are <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> that it is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth– something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. In smoking an illegal substance, Rastas protest {{the rules and regulations}} of Babylon. Rastas have advocated the legalisation of cannabis. The Rasta usage of ganja has attracted much popular, scholarly, and legal debate.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 {{version of}} The Count started a large {{conversation}} about inequity {{in the literary}} world.

Some people were <b>not</b> <b>surprised,</b> some were surprised and angered, some were inspired to act, some questioned {{the validity of the}} methods used to collect the numbers, and some questioned whether relevant information had been excluded from the numbers.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the strangest}} moments in Zakharov's career {{occurred}} in late 1990, when, {{as a member of}} the parliamentary Australian Security Intelligence Organisation committee, she was given access to her own intelligence file. She was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> to discover that ASIO had shown interest in her membership of the Communist Party while at university; what she was not prepared for was a detailed investigation the organisation had made in 1963, after becoming concerned that John Zakharov was a bigamist. A less-than-impressed Zakharov speculated at the time that the contents of her file may have cost her at least one public service position during the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Bevin had {{no great}} faith in {{parliamentary}} politics, but had nevertheless {{been a member}} of the Labour Party from the time of its formation, and unsuccessfully fought Bristol Central at the 1918 General Election, being defeated by the Coalition Conservative Thomas Inskip. He had poor relations with the first Labour Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, and was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> when MacDonald formed a National Government with the Conservatives during the economic crisis of 1931, for which MacDonald was expelled from the Labour Party. At the 1931 general election, Bevin was persuaded by the remaining leaders of the Labour Party to contest Gateshead, on the understanding that if successful he would remain as general secretary of the TGWU. The National Government landslide resulted in Gateshead being lost by a large margin to the Liberal National Thomas Magnay.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{guilty plea}} on {{misdemeanor}} weapons charges during the 2009 offseason, Lynch met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for a disciplinary hearing. Lynch {{had been arrested}} in Culver City, California, for having {{a gun in his}} backpack in the trunk of a car he was occupying, a crime in California. On April 9, the NFL announced that Lynch would be suspended for the Bills' first three games for violations of the NFL's personal conduct policy. Lynch appealed the league's suspension on May 14 in an attempt to have it reduced or nullified, only to have it upheld by Goodell later on August 3. When interviewed on the topic, Lynch has said that he was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> when the suspension was upheld and that he loves playing too much and will try to keep himself out of situations {{in which there is a}} risk of being suspended.|$|E

25|$|The {{course of}} the battle showed that the first Carthaginian line {{performed}} better and the Gauls were less reliable. From the onset, the Romans made futile attempts to break the enemy’s resistance and were pressed hard themselves. Then Varus moved the cavalry (3,000 or 4,000 horsemen), hoping to repulse and confuse the Carthaginian lines. However, Mago was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> and moved forward the elephants just in time. The horses were stricken by fear {{and as a result}} the Roman cavalry was dispersed, chased by Mago’s light Numidian cavalry. The elephants turned on the Roman infantry, which suffered heavy losses. The battle only took a bad turn for Mago when Cornelius brought into action the legions of the second line. The elephants were showered upon by darts, with most of them falling, the rest were forced to turn back against their own ranks. Mago ordered the Gauls to stop the Roman counter-attack, but they were routed.|$|E
