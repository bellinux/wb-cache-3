40|$|Abstract. The {{automatic}} classification of galaxies {{according to the}} different Hub-ble types is a widely studied problem {{in the field of}} astronomy. The complexity of this task led to projects like Galaxy Zoo which try to obtain labeled data based on vi-sual inspection by humans. Many {{automatic classification}} frameworks are based on artificial neural networks (ANN) in combination with a feature extraction step in the pre-processing phase. These approaches rely on labeled catalogs for training the mod-els. The small size of the typically used training sets, however, limits the generalization performance of the resulting models. In this work, we present a straightforward appli-cation of support vector machines (SVM) for this type of classification tasks. The con-ducted experiments indicate that using a sufficient number of labeled objects provided by the EFIGI catalog leads to high-quality models.

Possible causes for this discrepancy are discussed.

40|$|We have {{performed}} simultaneous measurements of microwave absorption/reflection and magneto-transport {{characteristics of a}} high mobility two-dimensional electrons in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure in regime of Microwave-Induced Resistance Oscillations (MIROs). It is shown that the electrodynamic aspect {{of the problem is}} important in these experiments. In the absorption experiments a broad cyclotron resonance line was observed due to a large reflection from the highly conductive electron gas. There were <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> <b>features</b> observed related to absorption at harmonics of the cyclotron resonance. In near-field reflection experiments a very different oscillation pattern was revealed when compared to MIROs. The oscillation pattern observed in the reflection experiments is probably due to plasma effects occurring in a finite-size sample. The whole microscopic picture of MIROs is more complicated than simply a resonant absorption at harmonics of the cyclotron resonance. Nevertheless, the experimental observations are in good agreement with the model by Ryzhii et al. involving the photo-assisted scattering {{in the presence of a}} crossed magnetic field and dc bias. The observed damping factor of MIROs may be attributed to a change in the electron mobility as a function of temperature. Comment: to be published in IEEE Transactions On Nanotechnolog...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of {{atypical}} Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) that illustrates several overlapping features with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: A case is reported followed by {{a review of the}} current literature. Case report: A 16 -year-old boy with an unusual manifestation of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is described. The patient presented with fever, weight loss and severe abdominal pain, due to extensive necrotizing retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. During the course of his illness, he developed several symptoms suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) : a pericardial effusion, cotton wool spots on the retina and antibodies against nuclear antigens (ANA), Smith (Sm) and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antigens. However, <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> <b>features</b> of SLE were found. The patient subsequently fully recovered within two months, without initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. His autoantibodies became negative five months after initial presentation and he remains well at his 23 month follow up visit. Discussion: We hypothesize that the autoantibodies developed by our patient were secondary to self-antigen induced autoimmunity related to his extensive tissue necrosis. Despite initially having clinical features suggestive of SLE, our patient’s full and spontaneous recovery strongly supports the diagnosis of KFD. This illustrates the need for careful diagnosis, in order to avoid unnecessary and potentially toxic treatment with immunosuppressive agents...|$|E
