5|$|Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed {{as a threat to}} the Caliphate's survival.|$|E
5|$|Pairs {{separate}} after mating, {{and females}} provide all parenting. The gestation period lasts 93–105 days; females {{give birth to}} up to four cubs, and most commonly to two. The mother will <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> the presence of males {{after the birth of}} cubs, given a risk of infanticide; this behavior is also found in the tiger.|$|E

5|$|This species {{lives on}} hard benthic substrates, {{typically}} rocks. It lives on pebbles, sometimes on boulders, and rarely on dead wood. It tolerates mild organic pollution, low oxygen content (down to below 2mg/liter) {{but it does}} <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> long periods of droughts, or ice. It lives in mesotrophic waters, and sometimes in oligotrophic waters.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} news of Grant's death, Number 1 calls Klebb and Kronsteen onto the carpet to explain what went wrong and remind them that SPECTRE does <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> failure. Kronsteen is {{executed}} by the henchman Morzeny, with a kick from the poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe. Klebb, however, is given one last chance {{to make good on}} the mission and acquire the Lektor (which has already been promised to the Russians in a sell-back scheme).|$|E
5|$|Vizzini {{became a}} cancia – an {{intermediary}} between the peasants who wanted their wheat milled into flour and the mills that were {{located near the}} coast. Mafiosi that did <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> any competition controlled the mills. In the case of Villalba the mills were some 80 kilometres away. To get the grain safely to the mills over roads infested by bandits was no easy task.|$|E

5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> the more radical Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
5|$|Ferking {{apparently}} could <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> Augvald's overlordship of Karmøy, {{and he went}} north {{with his}} army, meeting Augvald and his army at Skeie, near Avaldsnes. In the resulting battle there many fatalities, but no clear victor. The conclusive battle {{took place at the}} Field of Stava (Stavasletta), near Ferkingstad. Ferking and his men hid between two gorges, waiting for Augvald to appear. In the fierce battle that followed Augvald and his cow were among the many who lost their lives. When his two daughters saw that Augvald was dead, they jumped into a river and drowned.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn {{territorial}} and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that {{of two or three}} females, and he will <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> intrusions by other adult males.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} marry Wallis Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people would <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> Simpson as queen. As king, Edward was the titular head of the Church of England, and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings.|$|E
5|$|Ponsford {{began his}} working {{life at the}} State Savings Bank. On his return from England in 1926, the bank advised him that they might <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> so much leave for cricket in the future. Ponsford {{received}} a lucrative offer to play for Blackpool Cricket Club, which he was inclined to accept. This news was received with dismay by Australian fans, who had earlier seen players such as Ted McDonald leave Australia and accept contracts in the professional English leagues. To keep Ponsford in Melbourne, The Herald—a local newspaper—employed him {{on the basis that}} he would remain available for all representative cricket. The new role included writing articles for the paper.|$|E

5|$|Pöck {{rejected}} all of Andressen's proposals, since {{none of them}} {{incorporated the}} characteristics specified in the March 1875 meeting. Romako took over the design process in 1878, and prepared the design for Zara, construction of which began on 1 August that year. Romako based his design on the German Zieten, though the German vessel was significantly faster than the Zara class, in part owing {{to the fact that}} Zieten had a longer, finer hull and was more lightly built. In addition, the engines and boilers used in Zara and her sister ships could <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> as high a pressure as those in Zieten, and their boilers consumed coal excessively.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} then {{defined a}} limit (the so-called Red Line), along the 15th parallel, extending from Mao to Abéché, {{and warned that}} they would <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> any incursion south of this line by Libyan or GUNT forces. Both the Libyans and the French remained on {{their side of the}} line, with France showing itself unwilling to help Habré retake the north, while the Libyans avoided starting a conflict with France by attacking the line. This led to a de facto division of the country, with Libya maintaining control of all the territory north of the Red Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperament}} of the West Highland White Terrier {{can vary}} greatly, with some being friendly towards children, whilst others prefer solitude. It will <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> rough handling {{such as a}} child pulling on its ears, and can be both food- and toy-possessive. It is normally independent, assured, and self-confident, and can make a good watchdog. It is a loyal breed that bonds with its owner, but is often always on the move, requiring good exercise (15–30 min). The Westie is highly social and is the most friendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terriers.|$|E

5|$|When World War I broke out, the United States {{maintained}} {{a policy of}} isolationism, avoiding conflict while trying to negotiate peace between the warring nations. However, when a German U-boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied and Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned that the U.S. would <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law.|$|E
5|$|Custine's {{leadership}} and character, although impugned by the Tribunal, proved fundamentally {{sound in the}} field. As an admirer of the Prussian style of drill and discipline, he was a strict disciplinarian, but his soldiers actually liked him, and felt inspired by him. Custine liked to make speeches and reportedly knew the names of his soldiers. He visited men in the hospital, demonstrated blunt good humor, and was the master of repartee. His ready wit was quoted throughout his command. He did <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> disorder or insubordination however; when encountering a troop of volunteers in 1792, who bragged {{that they were going}} to teach the army the right step (make it Republican), he ordered his cavalry to surround and disarm them.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the ranges of coyotes and gray wolves overlap, {{interference}} competition and predation by wolves has been hypothesized to limit local coyote densities. Coyote ranges expanded during the 19th and 20th centuries following the extirpation of wolves, while coyotes were driven to extinction on Isle Royale after wolves colonized the island in the 1940s. One study conducted in Yellowstone National Park, where both species coexist, concluded that the coyote population in the Lamar River Valley declined by 39% following the reintroduction of wolves in the 1990s, while coyote populations in wolf inhabited areas of the Grand Teton National Park are 33% lower than in {{areas where the}}y are absent. Wolves have been observed to <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> coyotes in their vicinity, though coyotes {{have been known to}} trail wolves to feed on their kills.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new test response compaction technique with {{any number of}} unknown logic values (X’s) in the test response bits. The technique leverages an X-tolerant response compactor (X-compact), and forces X’s that are <b>not</b> <b>tolerated</b> by X-Compact to known values. The data required to designate the X’s <b>not</b> <b>tolerated</b> by the X-compactor, also called mask data, is stored in a compressed format on the tester and decompressed onchip. We applied this technique to four industrial designs and obtained 26 -fold to 60 -fold reduction in test response data volume with no impact on test quality...|$|R
