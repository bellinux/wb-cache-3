5000|$|The {{concept of}} karma {{may have been}} of minor {{importance}} in early Buddhism. Schmithausen has questioned whether karma already {{played a role in}} the theory of rebirth of earliest Buddhism, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology." [...] Langer <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> originally karman may have been only one of several concepts connected with rebirth. Tillman Vetter <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> in early Buddhism rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance.
