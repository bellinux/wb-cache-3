40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{highlight}} {{the functioning of the}} Antibiotic Policy in the Czech Republic but there is also shortly discussed the European and the international activities on which is our program based. There is described the National Antibiotic Program aimed at assuring long-term availability, forceful, safe and cost effective of the antibiotic treatment of infectious diseases. There are also various groups of people in Antibiotic Policies such as the Central Coordination Group of the National Antibiotic Programme, Subcommittee for the Antibiotic Policy and others whose function is also described here. There are stated the priorities of the NAP and the main areas with which the <b>NAP</b> <b>Action</b> Plan 2011 - 2013 is deal with. The work includes the part of definition of the antibiotics, the description of its history, the distribution and the mechanism of its effect. There is also explained the difference between therapeutic and prophylactic administration of antibiotics and the main principles of their use. The next part describes the problem of bacterial resistance. It deals with the source, the essence of antibiotics, the mechanisms of resistance and the other aspects that are needed to know to be a system of Antibiotic Policy well understood...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionOne of six {{priorities}} of CDC’s National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP) is {{to address the}} needs of cancer survivors within the local population served by individually funded states, tribes, and territories. This report examines cancer survivorship activities implemented in five NCCCP grantees, which have initiated evidence-based activities outlined in A National Action Plan for Cancer Survivorship: Advancing Public Health Strategies (<b>NAP).</b> MethodsNCCCP <b>action</b> plans, submitted annually to CDC, from 2010 to 2014 were reviewed in February 2015 to assess implementation of cancer survivorship activities and recommended strategies consistent with the NAP. Four state-level and one tribal grantee with specific activities related to one of each of the four NAP strategies were chosen for inclusion. Brief case reports describing the initiation and impact of implemented activities were developed in collaboration with each grantee program director. ResultsNew Mexico, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington state, and Fond Du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa programs each implemented activities in surveillance and applied research; communication, education, and training; programs, policies, and infrastructure; and access to quality care and services. ConclusionsThis report provides examples for incorporating cancer survivorship activities within Comprehensive Cancer Control programs of various sizes, demographic makeup, and resource capacity. New Mexico, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington state, and Fond Du Lac Band developed creative cancer survivorship activities that meet CDC recommendations. NCCCP grantees can follow these examples by implementing evidence-based survivorship interventions that meet the needs of their specific populations...|$|R
40|$|T he European Union (EU) {{has been}} {{promoting}} {{climate change adaptation}} measures in developing countries for the last 15 years. EU support is channeled {{through a number of}} external policies, but the development cooperation policy is particularly significant. Support has traditionally been conditional upon recipient countries’ adopting a National Adaptation Plan (<b>NAP).</b> This conditionality-based <b>action</b> has not only helped to promote NAPs in developing countries but also enabled these countries to participate in international climate governance. Yet this approach by itself, combined with certain inconsistencies, has failed to achieve sustainable development, one of the overarching goals of all EU policies. On the basis of this experience, the emphasis of the EU’s external climate policy is currently shifting towards a broader approach that takes into account the three dimensions (economic, social and environmental) of sustainable development. This more comprehensive approach and corresponding tools are more in line with the EU’s legal commitment to ensure Policy Coherence for Development...|$|R
40|$|IONM is use to {{monitoring}} nervous tissues (including brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves and peripheral nerves) in real-time during surgeries, alert neurological injuries and corrective measures and prevent disability. There are various IONM monitoring techniques including evoke potentials (SSEP, BAEP, MEP), EMG (Free-running and triggered), <b>NAP</b> (Nerve <b>action</b> potential) and Electroencephalography (EEG) {{to monitor the}} functional integrity of neural structures. SSEP evaluates integrity of posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway. SSEP is clinical use in spinal cord surgeries, vascular surgeries (carotid endarterectomy, cerebral aneurysm surgery etc), and localization of sensor motor cortex. BAEP evaluates integrity of peripheral and central auditory pathway. BAEP is clinical use in CP angle tumors surgery (acoustic neuroma,meningioma), microvascular decompression of CN-VII for hemifacial spasm, CN-V for trigeminal neuralgia, CN-IX for glossopharyngeal neuralgia, skull base surgery, Suboccipital decompression (e. g. fractures/dislocation C- 1 vertebra, chiari malformation). MEP evaluates integrity of motor pathway. MEP is sensitive to neuromuscular blocker anesthetic medications. Clinical utility of MEP including any surgery risking motor pathway injury include tumor near the motor cortex or corticospinal tract, intracranial aneurysm clipping, posterior fossa surgery, tethered cord or cauda equina surgeries, spinal deformity or fracture surgery, vertebral tumor resections, and anterior cervical discectomy, descending aortic procedures, spinal arteriovenous malformation interventions and carotid endarterectomy. EMG (free running and triggered) evaluates integrity of innervating nerves and electrical activity of muscles. Clinical utility of facial and other cranial nerve monitoring in posterior fossa surgery (eg, acoustic neuroma), selective dorsal rhizotomy, tethered cord release, Pedicle screw placement and Anal or urinary sphincter function monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the UNCCD needs the identification of areas that record declining productivity of the vegetation over long-time periods. In this scope, we analyze {{the state of the}} vegetation productivity using 1982 – 1999 time series of NOAA-AVHRR NDVI data and compare it to rainfall data. For this, 354 rain gauges data distributed from yearly average isohyets 100 to 900 mm in five countries of West Africa are analyzed. We use for trends analysis, the ratio between integrated vegetation index (iNDVI) during the growing period (June to October) and the May to October sum of rainfall (RR). This ratio is a proxy of the Rain Use Efficiency is the widely accepted. Overall, 91 % and 94 % of RR and iNDVI data recorded positive trends over the 1982 – 1999 periods. Most stations in the Sahel were stable for the iNDVI/RR (49. 5 %). However, 37. 8 % showed strong to very strong negative change in the iNDVI/RR ratio, while only 1. 3 % showed positive trend. These strong negative trends recorded in more than 1 / 3 of the analyzed stations may reflect ongoing desertification processes in the Sahel and could be a starting point for the identification of hot-spots areas to determine where to take action within the National <b>Action</b> Programs (<b>NAP)</b> or Sub-Regional <b>Action</b> Programs (SRAP) to combat desertification...|$|R
40|$|The neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule L 1 is critical for brain development and {{plays a role in}} learning and memory in the adult. Ethanol inhibits L 1 -mediated {{cell adhesion}} and neurite outgrowth in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), and these actions might underlie the cerebellar dysmorphology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The peptide NAP potently blocks ethanol inhibition of L 1 adhesion and prevents ethanol teratogenesis. We used quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting of extracts of cerebellar slices, CGNs, and astrocytes from postnatal day 7 (PD 7) rats to investigate whether ethanol and NAP act in part by regulating the expression of L 1. Treatment of cerebellar slices with 20 mM ethanol, 10 − 12 M NAP, or both for 4 hours, 24 hours, and 10 days did not significantly affect L 1 mRNA and protein levels. Similar treatment for 4 or 24 hours did not regulate L 1 expression in primary cultures of CGNs and astrocytes, the predominant cerebellar cell types. Because ethanol also damages the adult cerebellum, we studied the effects of chronic ethanol exposure in adult rats. One year of binge drinking did not alter L 1 gene and protein expression in extracts from whole cerebellum. Thus, ethanol does not alter L 1 expression in the developing or adult cerebellum; more likely, ethanol disrupts L 1 function by modifying its conformation and signaling. Likewise, <b>NAP</b> antagonizes the <b>actions</b> of ethanol without altering L 1 expression...|$|R
40|$|The UN’s ‘Women, Peace and Security’ (WPS) {{agenda is}} founded on Security Council Resolution 1325, which {{was passed by the}} Council in 2000 after a period of {{sustained}} advocacy by women’s civil society organisations. The agenda is conventionally described as being comprised of four ‘pillars’: prevention (of violence); participation (in peace and security governance); protection (of rights and bodies); and relief and recovery (such that women and girls are able to benefit from and engage in a meaningful way in post-conflict reconstruction). The pillars themselves are derived from the foundational resolution and are addressed in more or less detail in the seven subsequent resolutions that together form the policy architecture of the agenda; the relevant resolutions are UNSCR 1820 (2008), UNSCR 1888 (2009), UNSCR 1889 (2009), UNSCR 1960 (2010), UNSCR 2106 (2013), UNSCR 2122 (2013), and UNSCR 2242 (2015). In this chapter, I examine three dimensions of the WPS agenda at the UN. First, I explore {{the extent to which the}} WPS resolutions are integrated into the business of the Security Council, by investigating how and in what ways the WPS resolutions and WPS concerns are referenced in other resolutions. Second, I comment briefly on the development of National <b>Action</b> Plans (<b>NAPs)</b> and Regional <b>Action</b> Plans (RAPs) for the implementation of UNSCR 1325, and the institutional support – or lack thereof – that exists for these at the UN level. Finally, I outline what I consider to be some core obstacles that continue to inhibit the progression of the WPS agenda at the UN and how these obstacles might be overcome...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} a field {{study on the}} {{implementation}} of the United Nations Convention on Combating Desertification (UNCCD) in Tigray, Ethiopia has been carried out. The objective of this thesis is to study in general the implementa-tion of the UNCCD in Ethiopia. This thesis consequently focuses on how these issues are executed in practice at different levels, thus national, regional, district and community levels. However the focus is on some of the highly prioritised action programs that are presumed to facilitate {{the implementation of the}} UNCCD, which are the Action Programs for promoting awareness and participation, Action programs to improve institutional organisation and ca-pacity as well as Action program for empowerment of women. These action programs are studied in how they are presented at the National <b>Action</b> Plan (<b>NAP)</b> and Regional <b>Action</b> Plan (RAP) as well as how they are executed at different levels, i. e. at the Federal, Regional, district and Community levels. For this purpose the region of Tigray is chosen. The result of this study shows {{that the vast majority of}} the respondents in the study areas indicated an awareness of desertification in regard to land degradation. The implementation of NAP at this stage, hasn’t reach all the regions around the country however, three regions in Ethiopia, thus the Afar, Tigray and Amhara regions have been chosen as pilot projects in attempt to implement the NAP at regional level and preparation are made to implement the con-vention at different community levels. Officially these regions have been chosen to launch pilot projects since they are situated in the dryland areas and they match the definition of the UNCCD for severely affected areas. At the re-gional level several pilot projects mainly conservation activities that involved the community members are launched in different parts of Tigray. Many opportunities to increase awareness of the land degradation and empower people are created in order to combat desertification, however the success of these activities varies from district to district and community to community and is dependent on the authorities’ intention, ambition, determination and interest as well as the relation they posses with the community members in the society...|$|R
40|$|Histone {{disassembly}} {{is one of}} {{the mechanisms}} by which the ATP dependent chromatin remodelers remodel the nucleosomes. However nucleosome remodeling is also regulated by other factors like covalent modifications marks (methylation, acetylation etc. of both histones and chromatin remodelers). and histone chaperones. All these different players act in concert inside the cell, to modulate the chromatin landscape. Histone chaperones can either act independently and or in concert with chromatin remodelers, for nucleosome disassembly. We have previously shown that SWI/SNF has the ability to mediate disassembly of a dinucleosome substrate in a two step process. The first step in this process is the displacement of one H 2 A-H 2 B dimer that occurs rapidly, followed by a slower step in which the remaining hexasome is displaced. SWI/SNF mediated disassembly does not require any free DNA as an acceptor or other factors, but does require an adjoining nucleosome. However, {{little is known about the}} mechanism by which chaperones act with remodelers in causing disassembly. 	In this study, we have investigated the role of histone chaperone Nap 1 (Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1) on the remodeling properties of the yeast remodeler RSC ((Remodels Structure of Chromatin). We focused on the effects of Nap 1 when RSC remodels short nucleosomal arrays and compared these to those with mononucleosomes. We found that Nap 1 enhances RSC mediated disassembly of nucleosome only on dinucleosome substrates but not on mononucleosomes. The enhanced disassembly is not due to increased ATP hydrolysis as the rate of ATP hydrolysis by RSC does not increase in the presence of Nap 1. Enhanced disassembly is also not due to an increase in rate of nucleosome movement. The effects of Nap 1 on RSC are limited to dinucleosome substrate, and does not affect its binding or rate of ATP hydrolysis on a free DNA substrate. To further understand the mechanism of <b>Nap</b> 1 <b>action,</b> we scanned various mutants on the surface of Nap 1, to find out the region of Nap 1 that is important for enhancing dinucleosome disassembly by RSC. We found that the same alpha chain and amino acid residues of Nap 1 that binds to histone H 2 A-H 2 B dimer in solution, is also critical for interaction with RSC during remodelling of nucleosomes, and favours disassembly. This suggests that Nap 1 interacts with nucleosomal H 2 A-H 2 B during remodeling by RSC, and hence promotes nucleosome disassembly, which the next step in the remodeling process. We have also seen that this enhancement of disassembly is specific to RSC and Nap 1, and does not occur with either SWI/SNF, which is a paralog of RSC in yeast or with histone chaperone Vps 75, only other member of NAP family in yeast. On the other hand, Nap 1 is overall inhibitory for SWI/SNF. Nap 1 reduces the rate of nucleosome movement on both mono and di-nucleosomes, by reducing the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Higher concentration of Nap 1 inhibits SWI/SNF binding to free DNA and dinucleosomes. Based on an extensive scan using twenty five Nap 1 mutants to identify the, we found that the C-terminal region of Nap 1 to be inhibitory to SWI/SNF binding to both DNA and dinucleosome while the H 2 A-H 2 B binding to inhibitory for SWI/SNF dinucleosome binding. Therefore Nap 1 regulates SWI/SNF and RSC complexes in antagonistic ways. This may help explain the activating and occasional repressive roles of RSC and SWI/SNF on gene transcription, by stimulating nucleosome disassembly by RSC and reducing nucleosome movement by SWI/SNF...|$|R
