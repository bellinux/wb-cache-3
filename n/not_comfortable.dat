5|$|Gandhi {{came from}} a poor family, and he {{had dropped out of}} the {{cheapest}} college he could afford. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.|$|E
5|$|Pre-season {{fears of}} a {{conflict}} with Keenan were realized, as the coach reduced his time on the power play and forced him into a defensive role he was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> with. Unhappy with being pushed into a checking role, and believing that the way Keenan was using him was not allowing him to give the Flames fair value on his contract, Tanguay requested a trade at the Christmas break. He and general manager Darryl Sutter agreed to keep it quiet {{so as not to}} become a distraction to the team, although Tanguay's request was revealed in the off-season. He suffered offensively, falling to 58 points.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July, {{the day of}} the ceremony, pilgrims {{spent the}} morning and early {{afternoon}} exploring the landscape of the memorial park before congregating at the monument. For the ceremony, sailors from HMCS Saguenay provided the guard of honour. Also present were The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band, French army engineers, and French-Moroccan cavalry who had fought on the site during the Second Battle of Artois. The ceremony itself was broadcast live by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission over shortwave radio, with facilities of the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitting the ceremony to Canada. Senior Canadian, British, and European officials, including French President Albert Lebrun, and a crowd of over 50,000 attended the event. Absent, though, was Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, it being well understood that he was generally <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> around veterans and felt it more appropriate for a war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance.|$|E

5|$|Shearer {{is married}} to Lainya, whom he met whilst a Southampton player. The couple lived locally with her parents during Shearer's second year at the south coast club, and were married on 8 June 1991 at St. James' Church in the city. In {{contrast}} to the portrayal of some WAGs (wives and girlfriends) of later players by the media, Lainya is described by Shearer as a quiet and reserved person, <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> in the spotlight her husband's fame sometimes brought. The couple have three children. Shearer cited not wanting to uproot his family as a key reason for remaining in England during his career, having {{had the chance to}} move to Juventus or Barcelona when leaving Blackburn. Shearer's family accompanied him onto the pitch following the striker's testimonial in May 2006 as he performed a lap of honour at St James' Park.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu left Square Enix in 2004 {{and formed}} his own {{production}} company, Smile Please. He later founded the music production company and record label Dog Ear Records in 2006. The reason for Uematsu's departure {{was that the}} company moved their office from Meguro to Shinjuku, Tokyo, and he was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> with the new location. Also, he cites {{the fact that he}} had reached an age where he should gradually take his life into his own hands. He does, however, continue to compose music as a freelancer for Square Enix. In 2005, Uematsu and several members of The Black Mages created the score for the CGI film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. Uematsu composed only the main theme for Final Fantasy XII (2006); he was originally offered the job of creating the full score, but Sakimoto was eventually assigned as the main composer instead. Uematsu was also initially going to create the theme song for Final Fantasy XIII (2010). However, after being assigned the task of creating the entire score of Final Fantasy XIV, Uematsu decided to hand the job over to the main Final Fantasy XIII composer, Hamauzu.|$|E

25|$|It is, however, <b>not</b> <b>comfortable,</b> for {{two reasons}} which work together: the cervix is full of nociceptors, and the brush used to collect cells has to be stiff enough to scrape them off of the {{surrounding}} tissue.

He was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> in public speaking, but as Doherty puts it: 'Not a self-publicist in the manner of Montgomery, McCreery managed nonetheless to gain the confidence of his soldiers who trusted him in peace and war.' An overriding sense of duty might be said to have characterised his life and career.|$|E

Hader added that in his eight years on the program, Bieber was the only host who lived up to his reputation.|$|E

She had stated previously that the triple salchow was the first triple jump she had ever landed and {{that she did not}} have a problem landing it cleanly, but she was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> using the jump in competition because it is one of her least favorite jumps. Asada added the 3S to her free skating at the 2008 NHK Trophy and 2008â€“09 Grand Prix Final.|$|E
25|$|String theory, as {{mentioned}} above, {{ran into a}} problem: another version of the equations was discovered, then another, and then another. Eventually, five major string theories were developed. The main differences between the theories were principally the number of dimensions in which the strings developed, and their characteristics (some were open loops, some were closed loops, etc.). Furthermore, all these theories appeared to be workable. Scientists were <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> with five seemingly contradictory sets of equations to describe the same thing.|$|E

25|$|This an {{intervention}} programme aimed at infants {{who have experienced}} early adverse care and disruptions in care. It aims to provide specialized help for foster carers {{in recognition of the}} fact that a young child placed in foster care has to deal with the loss of attachment figures at a time when maintaining contact with attachment figures is vital. It targets key issues: providing nurturance for infants when the carers are <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> providing nurturance, overriding tendencies to respond in kind to infant behaviors and providing a predictable interpersonal environment.|$|E
25|$|Some generic {{drugs are}} viewed with {{suspicion}} by doctors. For example, warfarin (Coumadin) has a narrow therapeutic window and requires frequent blood tests {{to make sure}} patients {{do not have a}} subtherapeutic or a toxic level. A study performed in Ontario showed that replacing Coumadin with generic warfarin was safe, but many physicians are <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> with their patients taking branded generic equivalents. In some countries (for example, Australia) where a drug is prescribed under more than one brand name, doctors may choose not to allow pharmacists to substitute a brand different from the one prescribed unless the consumer requests it.|$|E
25|$|Clothes {{were seen}} as an {{expression}} of womenâ€™s place in society and were hence, differentiated in terms of social class. Upper class women, who did not need to work, often wore a tightly laced corset over a bodice or chemisette, and paired them with a skirt adorned with numerous embroideries and trims; over layers of petticoats. Middle class women exhibited similar dress styles; however, the decorations were not as extravagant. The layering of these garments make them very heavy. Corsets were also stiff and restricted movement. Although the clothes were <b>not</b> <b>comfortable,</b> the type of fabrics and the in-numerous layers were worn as a symbol of wealth.|$|E

He returned to local politics and left the Land League. He sold the Connaught Telegraph to T.H. Gillespie in 1888 and became a full time farmer. He continued in local Government and served on Mayo County Council and Castlebar Urban District Council. Remaining a force in local politics, he supported the United Irish League and was President of the Connacht '98 Council.|$|E

Though the Qing court rejected Gordon's advice to seek a compromise with Russia in the summer of 1880, Gordon's assessment of China's military backwardness and his stark warnings that the Russians would win if a war did break out {{played an important role in}} ultimately strengthening the peace party at the court and preventing war.|$|E
25|$|According to the authors, since sexual {{identity}} and orientation is a contentious issue, many healthcare workers are <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> in approaching this topic. But if the physicians initiate the conversation, {{it is more}} likely that the veterans will provide this information. Based on their data, if the gay and lesbian veterans can divulge information about their personal medical history, values, and preferences, they may experience higher levels of patient satisfaction. It is also more likely for them to receive appropriate preventive care and diagnostic screenings for their unique health risks, such as sexually transmitted diseases. Moreover, comprehensive medical records can provide a multitude of information useful not only for medical treatments but also for evaluations, such as the fitness of the veterans for duty.|$|E
