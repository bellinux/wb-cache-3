5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes <b>non-autonomous</b> ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E

After the split of the Kaganate around 600 into the Western and Eastern Kaganates, the Uch-Karluks remained in the Western Turkic Kaganate under a <b>non-autonomous</b> home rule, as the members of the five Tele (see: Tiele) tribes that did not receive autonomy: the Karluk, Yagma, Kipchak, Basmyl and Chuban.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{women being}} {{seemingly}} independent in Taíno society, {{coming into the}} era of contact Spaniards took Taíno women as an exchange item, putting them in a <b>non-autonomous</b> position. Dr. Chanca, a physician who traveled with Christopher Columbus, reported in a letter that Spaniards took as many women as they possibly could and kept them as concubines. Some sources report that, despite women being free and powerful before the contact era, they became the first commodities up for Spaniards to trade, or often steal. This {{marked the beginning of}} a lifetime of theft and abuse of Taíno women.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity. For example, a recent study (2017) found that those who start having sex at an earlier age have higher risks of: not using a condom; not having good memories of that first experience; and having had that relationship for <b>non-autonomous</b> reasons (such as partner pressure, peer pressure or the influence of substance use). This article also summarizes other risks (found in previous studies) associated with earlier sex: having an increased number of sexual partners or of casual sexual partners; perpetrating or being a victim of forced sex; engaging in paid sex; depression and behavior problems.|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, the United States Congress {{approved}} {{a measure that}} included the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Washington D.C. and several <b>non-autonomous</b> territories including American Samoa, Guam and the United States Virgin Islands in the 50 State Quarters program. Both commonwealths and territories {{were excluded from the}} original program approved in 1998, which was followed by almost ten years of lobbying before they were included. The design on these coins was expected to feature the same George Washington image found in the obverse of the original issues, while the reverse would depict illustrations of something characteristic to that location. The Secretary of Treasury approved the design on July 31, 2008. The coins were issued, as well as [...] "proof coins" [...] and 90% silver special issues. The Puerto Rico coin was the second release in 2009. In 2012, as part of the National Park Quarters Program initiative, the United States Mint will release a quarter commemorating the inclusion of El Yunque National Forest as part of the National Forest System in 1903.|$|E
500|$|Clifton and Ebert, too, {{focussed}} on Cochrane's {{attempt to}} find and conceptualise a middle ground between the work of Regan (who advocates animal rights) and Singer (who advocates animal welfare from a utilitarian perspective), and Meijer praised it for identifying a conceptual space between animal rights and animal liberation. Clifton suggested that Cochrane's thought is actually closer to Regan's. Boisseau, though, suggested that, given that Cochrane allows some use of animals in entertainment and genetic engineering, the arguments of Animal Rights Without Liberation may come across as [...] "radically permissive" [...] when {{compared with those of}} other animal rights positions. The permissibility of some forms of animal experimentation under Cochrane's account [...] "may shock" [...] supporters of approaches based upon Regan's philosophy. Ebert concluded that [...] "the great accomplishment of Cochrane's book is to show that there is a coherent, intuitively plausible, and useful notion of animal rights that is firmly rooted in the tangible and avoids the unattractive absolutism of Regan-style rights views". Meijer felt that the book is strong on the application of Cochrane's account, but she expressed concern about Cochrane's rejection of liberty rights for animals, which, she noted, most approaches to animal rights allow. Cochrane's deploys, she noted, a narrow account of animal agency; [...] "it is", she argued, [...] "problematic to view humans as autonomous agents and other animals as nonautonomous others". Cochrane's view of animals as <b>non-autonomous,</b> she argued, is emphasised by the absence of an account of relationships and communication between humans and animals.|$|E

2500|$|In India, {{the term}} [...] "college" [...] is {{commonly}} reserved for institutions that offer degrees at year 12 ("Junior College", similar to American high schools), {{and those that}} offer the bachelor's degree; some colleges, however, offer programmes up to PhD level. Generally, colleges are located {{in different parts of}} a state and all of them are affiliated to a regional university. The colleges offer programmes leading to degrees of that university. Colleges may be either Autonomous or <b>non-autonomous.</b> [...] Autonomous Colleges are empowered to establish their own syllabus, and conduct and assess their own examinations; in <b>non-autonomous</b> colleges, examinations are conducted by the university, at the same time for all colleges under its affiliation. There are several hundred universities and each university has affiliated colleges, often a large number.|$|E

One development was a five-tier classification system that is administered by each autonomous region. <b>Non-autonomous</b> areas or wine regions whose boundaries overlap with other autonomous communities (such as Cava, Rioja and Jumilla) are administered by the Instituto Nacional de Denominaciones de Origen (INDO) based in Madrid.

Based on {{findings}} that foster children's attachments are disproportionately likely to be disorganized and foster mothers with an unresolved or dismissing state of mind were likely to have children with disorganized attachments, the interpretation of Dozier et al. is that foster children have difficulty organizing their attachment systems unless they have nurturing foster carers. The {{goal is to help}} foster parents provide nurturing care even if they are <b>non-autonomous</b> with regard to their own attachment status.|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{of machine}} tools, {{even before the}} {{numerical}} control era, sometimes figuratively said that machine tools were a unique class of machines {{because they have the}} ability to [...] "reproduce themselves" [...] by copying all of their parts. Implicit in these discussions is that a human would direct the cutting processes (later planning and programming the machines), and would then be assembling the parts. The same is true for RepRaps, which are another class of machines sometimes mentioned in reference to such <b>non-autonomous</b> [...] "self-replication". In contrast, machines that are truly autonomously self-replicating (like biological machines) are the main subject discussed here.|$|E
2500|$|Conditional {{mutation}} is a mutation {{that has}} wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under certain [...] "permissive" [...] environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under certain [...] "restrictive" [...] conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences {{at a lower}} temperature (permissive condition). These mutations are <b>non-autonomous,</b> as their manifestation depends upon presence of certain conditions, as opposed to other mutations which appear autonomously. The permissive conditions may be temperature, certain chemicals, light or mutations {{in other parts of}} the genome. In vivo mechanisms like transcriptional switches can create conditional mutations. For instance, association of Steroid Binding Domain can create a transcriptional switch that can change the expression of a gene based on the presence of a steroid ligand. Conditional mutations have applications in research as they allow control over gene expression. This is especially useful studying diseases in adults by allowing expression after a certain period of growth, thus eliminating the deleterious effect of gene expression seen during stages of development in model organisms. DNA Recombinase systems like Cre-Lox Recombination used in association with promoters that are activated under certain conditions can generate conditional mutations. Dual Recombinase technology can be used to induce multiple conditional mutations to study the diseases which manifest as a result of simultaneous mutations in multiple genes. Certain inteins have been identified which splice only at certain permissive temperatures, leading to improper protein synthesis and thus, loss of function mutations at other temperatures. Conditional mutations may also be used in genetic studies associated with ageing, as the expression can be changed after a certain time period in the organism's lifespan.|$|E
