5|$|With Hoppe {{retired as}} of 1952, there was {{excitement}} over {{who would take}} the 1953 world three-cushion crown, {{to be held in}} Chicago at the Chicago Town Club in the Sheraton Hotel. Eleven competitors were slated to play, many repeats of the prior year, including Chamaco, Katsura, Matsuyama, Bozeman, Kilgore, Procita and Rubin. New to the field were Harold Worst of Grand Rapids, Hollywood's John Fitzpatrick, Mel Lundberg of Minneapolis and Ezequiel <b>Navarra</b> of Argentina. <b>Navarra</b> was considered the favorite by experts, having won championships that year in Cuba, Colombia, Peru and Argentina and having just come off an exhibition tour with Cochran in which <b>Navarra</b> averaged a formidable 1.16, scoring 1,295 three-cushions in 1,120 innings over the length of the tour.|$|E

5|$|Vizzini {{initially}} {{supported the}} separatist movement in Sicily. On December 6, 1943, Vizzini participated {{at the first}} clandestine regional convention of the Sicilian separatists movement of the Sicilian Independence Movement (Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano - MIS) in Catania. Other prominent Mafia bosses like Giuseppe Genco Russo, Gaetano Filippone, Michele <b>Navarra</b> and Francesco Paolo Bontade did not hide their sympathies for the separatists either. The separatists benefited from covert support of the OSS. As Italy experienced a leftward drift in 1943-1944, the American military became increasingly concerned about their future prospects in Italy. The island's naval bases and strategic location in the Mediterranean provided a possible future counterbalance to a Communism on the Italian mainland. The Italian Communist Party's membership had doubled and the largely left inspired resistance movement in the north was gathering strength.|$|E

25|$|He {{was not yet}} released, however, as he had {{to stand}} trial in 1969 on charges of murdering nine of <b>Navarra's</b> men.

25|$|He {{was born}} and raised in Corleone, the third of seven brothers, born to peasants. Provenzano left school at ten without {{finishing}} primary education, and worked in the fields.

50|$|However, a vote {{majority}} in the regional parliament made it possible the creation of that panel. Opposition parties (Geroa Bai, EH Bildu, Izquierda-Ezkerra) other than the Spanish Conservatives (PP) lashed out at the Socialists for attempting to constrain the range of topics {{to be addressed in}} the scrutiny, as well as allowing with their abstention to propel the party UPN, allegedly responsible for Caja <b>Navarra's</b> demise and main opponent to the parliamentary investigation, to chair the investigation panel and hold a critical position.|$|R
50|$|Some sources {{state that}} Peter died in 1157, {{sometime}} after King Alfonso VII of León and Castile died. This year {{of death is}} also likely since the third son, also named Peter, was born in 1158. It is certain that the elder son Peter was dead by 18 July 1164, as his mother abdicated in favour of his younger brother, Ramon, rather than Peter, who had been named heir of Aragon at birth. The Corónicas <b>Navarras</b> also stated that Peter died in Huesca.|$|R

Michele <b>Navarra</b> soon drove round the corner and the gunmen opened fire, {{riddling}} the car with two hundred bullets. <b>Navarra</b> died instantly along with a friend (unconnected with the Mafia); he was giving a lift to another doctor, Giovanni Russo. Leggio proclaimed himself boss of Corleone and over the next five years he and his men hunted down and killed around fifty more of Navarra's remaining supporters.|$|E

5000|$|In late 2014, {{opposition}} {{parties of the}} Parliament of Navarre promoted {{the establishment of a}} parliamentary investigation panel to clear responsibilities. The Spanish Socialists' branch in Navarre, the PSN, voiced its misgivings, while the party at the centre of the controversy, the anti-Basque UPN, showed a frontal refusal, arguing that the case had to be left to Justice, actually Madrid tribunals (a Supreme Court ruling had recently acquitted the president of Navarre Yolanda Barcina of legal misconduct in the scandal of Caja <b>Navarra’s</b> irregular bonuses).|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Leggio, Riina and Provenzano, {{who had spent}} the last few years hunting down and killing dozens of <b>Navarra's</b> {{surviving}} supporters, were forced to go into hiding due to arrest warrants. Riina and Leggio were arrested and tried in 1969 for murders carried out earlier that decade. They were acquitted due to intimidation of the jurors and witnesses. Riina went into hiding later that year after he was indicted on a further murder charge and was to remain a fugitive for the next twenty-three years.|$|R

50|$|The {{positions}} of the various existing governments differ {{with regard to the}} promotion of Basque in areas where Basque is commonly spoken. The language has official status in those territories that are within the Basque Autonomous Community, where it is spoken and promoted heavily, but only partially in Navarre. The Ley del Vascuence ("Law of Basque"), seen as contentious by many Basques, but considered fitting <b>Navarra's</b> linguistic and cultural diversity by the main political parties of Navarre, divides Navarre into three language areas: Basque-speaking, non-Basque-speaking, and mixed. Support for the language and the linguistic rights of citizens vary, depending on the area.|$|R
