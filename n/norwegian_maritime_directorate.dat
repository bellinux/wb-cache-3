40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse foreign direct {{investments}} (FDI) in Asia by the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>maritime</b> industry. We focus on three topics: - Why do <b>Norwegian</b> <b>maritime</b> companies invest abroad? - What are {{the effects of}} maritime foreign direct investments on the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>maritime</b> milieu? - What are {{the effects of these}} investments on the host country? By analysing specific <b>Norwegian</b> <b>maritime</b> companies we find that the FDIs partly have been induced by the instability of the Norwegian policy towards this sector. Several firms also point at the importance of being closer to the Asian market as a significant reason for FDI, and Norwegian ship equipment industry tends to follow the shipping companies abroad. The domestic effects of FDI are uncertain, and are likely to depend on the motivation behind the investments. Finally, using Singapore as an example, we argue that the host country effects of FDI tend to be positive...|$|R
50|$|RMO's {{primary goal}} was to {{establish}} contacts in the cities along the Norwegian coast. The contact persons were typically harbourmasters, maritime pilots and other sea workers or harbour workers. Siem and Sverdrup had earlier cooperated with Gunnar Sønsteby, and this cooperation continued after RMO was formed. RMO used Sønsteby's courier network to bring messages to Stockholm, and Sønsteby's organization obtained reliable information on ships and traffic. In addition to Oslo, ROM had branches {{in cities such as}} Halden, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Haugesund, Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø. When Rygg moved to Stockholm in 1943, he was employed as second-in-command at the office MI II, the section for military intelligence at the Norwegian legation in Stockholm, and from then on it was possible to coordinate XU's and RMO's activities in the seaport towns. RMO also cooperated with the Milorg department for naval intelligence EV 13. The initial Trondheim group was destroyed by the Gestapo during 1943, but another group with contacts at Trondheim harbour and the submarine harbour was initiated in 1944. In Oslo RMO also had contacts at the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Directorate,</b> the Norwegian Hydrographic Service, the Lighthouse administration, the Railways and the Telegraph.|$|E

This in turn is taken to represent different executive orders in Europe.

40|$|The International Maritime Organisation {{has agreed}} {{on a plan to}} ban the use of organotin for {{antifouling}} on large ships. Basic elements in the plan are: no new application of paint containing organotin after 1 st January 2003. No use of organotin in antifouling systems for ships after 1 st January 2008. This plan implies that alternatives to TBT must be available to the shipping industry within 2003. Various non-toxic antifouling strategies have been elucidated. At present {{there seems to be no}} good biocide free method ready to use for all types of vessels. Siliconbased non-toxic systems are available for ships with a speed of more than 15 knots. At present slower ships will have to be regularly cleaned or have to rely on biocidal systems. It is expected that biocides will be a part of antifouling systems on slow ships for many years. The use of copper-nickel hull and the electrolytic approach seems to have some potential. An obstacle for the use of these two approaches is that they are toxic in nature. Antifouling systems based on compounds found in marine organisms are promising on long term basis. The development of a complete antifouling system based on such naturally occurring compounds lies at least 5 years ahead. The use of information from research on natural products to design new antifouling paints, does a priori, not necessarily infer that the active ingredient is "environmentally sound". Such compounds therefore should be tested for possible environmental effects. A further development of such tests is a recommended area of future research. <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Directorate</b> (NMD...|$|E

40|$|In Chapter 2, the {{procedure}} for designing a mooring line under Norwegian jurisdiction is discussed. The procedure is given by the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Directorate</b> through the ANCHORING REGULATION 09 and ISO 19901 - 7 (2005). The difference in the required safety factors and the environment return period between ISO 19901 - 7 (2005) Annex B and the ANCHORING REGULATION 09   has been evaluated. The effect of this difference on the annual probability of mooring line failure is investigated Chapter 4. In Chapter 3, two ways of estimating the annual probability of mooring line failure is discussed. One {{of them is the}} environmental line contour method. The method is used for the probability estimates performed in the following chapters of the report. In Chapter 4, the annual probability of mooring line failure is estimated based on model test results for the Midgard platform model. In Chapter 5, SIMO is used to analyze the line tensions of the Midgard platform. From the line tensions found by SIMO, the annual probability of mooring line failure is estimated for various safety factors. The results are compared with the results found in Chapter 4. The chapter also discusses the joint occurrence of environmental storm values. In Chapter 6, the effect of water depth on the annual probability of mooring line failure is discussed by using SIMO. Chapter 7 addresses problems raised while working on the previous chapters; The determination of the sea state which produces the largest line tensions is further discussed after first raising the topic in Chapter 2. The effect of changing the 90 % fractiles used in the environmental contour line method for deciding the annual probability of mooring line failure is investigated by using the model test results. The effect of changing the wave heading on the annual probability estimates is investigated by using SIMO after not having enough model test results of the worst sea sate in Chapter 4. The SIMO results found in Chapter 5 for 100 year environment are not a match to the results found in Chapter 4. The increase in values found by increasing the return period to 10 000 years is also not a match. The last discussion of chapter 7 is therefore the effect of the lack of matching increase. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} it is looked at how underreporting of {{maritime}} accidents affects {{the results of}} a risk assessment, from the frequency analysis to the decision-making process. As a basis, a risk model is made and the accident scenario is a ship-to-ship collision in the Oslofjord area. The risk model is based on two other models; the F-risk model from the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Directorate,</b> concerning ferry risk in Norway and the MARCS model from Det Norske Veritas. First the risk of a collision in the Oslofjord was calculated by the use of a fault tree and an event tree. The result was compared with historical accident data reported to the Norwegian Maritime Directorates database. After the risk was established, several risk control options was suggested and three of them was included in a cost-benefit assessment. Discussion regarding the use of expert opinions and risk acceptance criteria was also included. After the risk assessment was performed, the frequency data used in the fault tree analysis was changed according to correction factors and safety factors. The correction factors were in accordance with a degree of underreporting of 30 and 40 %. Based on this one could see that the changes in the frequency have a large effect on which risk control option that was found to be cost-beneficial and whether or not the calculated risk was above or below the intolerable risk limit. Three formal safety reports from IMO were studied to see how uncertainty in frequency related to underreporting is dealt with in real risk assessments. There were found little or no mentioning of underreporting in the reports, and uncertainty in data was overall little dealt with. Three approaches to correct for underreporting were suggested; correction factors, expert opinions and safety factors. None of the approaches was found to be a perfect solution. A combination of a conservative approach and some use of expert opinions where this is needed were found to be the best solution. Correction factors for underreporting cannot be established before the degree of underreporting is known. Therefore it should be focused on how to find the degree of underreporting related to maritime accidents. The road transport sector has come up with suggestions for correction factors related to unreported accident and collaboration between the different transport sectors could be beneficial. It is also mentioned that uncertainty related to underreporting {{is only one of many}} uncertainties when looking at a risk assessment. Uncertainty in general is an important aspect and should be dealt with. Sensitivity analyses should be a part of risk assessment reports. </p...|$|E
40|$|LNG is the {{preferred}} solution to meet environmental requirement and a great market growth is expected within few years. Lack of suitable infrastructure, regulation and bunkering practices poses challenges to the industry, however these barriers are currently being broken. Connect-LNG is in a conceptual phase of developing an innovative solution for LNG distribution and bunkering at inshore locations. A study of industry legislatives, normal industry practice, LNG properties and historical accident statistics, provided the basis needed to perform a HAZID of the concept. LNG is considered a hazardous cargo. The main hazards are identified as:?	Cryogenic temperatures (injury to people and to non cryogenic materials) ?	Fire, explosion or asphyxiation from potential LNG spillage?	Overpressure (thermal expansion and shock waves from potential Raphid Phase Transition (RPT) The main regulation related to the concept is ISO Interim TS 18683 - Guidelines for systems and installations for supply of LNG as fuel to ships, {{which is expected to}} enter into force during 2013. Additionally, NS-EN ISO 28460 Installation and equipment for liquefied natural gas ? Ship to shore interface and port operations and NS-EN 1473 European Norm for Installation and equipment for liquefied natural gas- Design of onshore Installation have shown high degree of relevance. Also, legislatives related to Ship-to-ship transfer are considered highly relevant. Safety requirements are generally imposed by the established regulates yielding large-scale LNG handling. However, the brutality of the consequences is often proportional to the quantity LNG handled, inherent safety. Thus for medium-to-small scale LNG facilities, the consequences of an unwanted event is assumed to be smaller. The following national regulative acts are important for the validation and responsibility decision between the relevant authorities: DSB topical guidelines, Major Accident regulations, The regulation of Fairways, The Port and Harbor Act. The authorities area of responsibility can be summarized in the following table:Authority	Responsibility DNV	LNG - carrier design approvalThe <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Directorate</b>	LNG - carrier operation and crew safety DSB	- Decisive power, approval of onshore facility and formal decision unit in the future. Inquire municipal authorities and public perceptionKystverket	 - Adequate safety in LNG carrier approaching area, ISPS Certification and piloting serviceMunicipal authorities - Decisive powerLocal port authorities - Decisive power, commonly landholderOperator (Skagerak Naturgass) - Responsible for safe operation, sufficient maintenance of facility according to given regulationThe conceivable safety distance for operation of the reel LNG can be summarized in the following table. Safety zone	DistanceOnshore, around LNG storage tank:	 25 metersAt sea, around the loading LNGC and buoy configuration: 50 metersAt sea, around the filling line: 12, 5 metersThe main, required inbound systems are listed below:-	ESD valve on buoy (Hydraulically self-contained) -	Breakoff coupling in the light loading hose-	QC/QD coupling towards the shipside -	Butterfly valves for normal operational control (open/close) -	Hose rupture safeguarding (to be located onshore) -	Riser annulus monitoring: Optical fibersThe results from the HAZID and from general industry feedback recommend a self-reliant system. This implies a further inherent operational execution and the requirements related to a minimum of manning at the onshore facility are maintained. </p...|$|E

40|$|Given China’s {{emerging}} {{presence in}} the maritime industry, specifically in shipbuilding and increasingly also in offshore shipping, {{there is a growing}} interest within the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>maritime</b> industry in opportunities in the Far East. As China is relatively young as a modern shipping nation, there are opportunities {{to be found in the}} Chinese maritime market. Hence, this thesis aims to provide insights for <b>Norwegian</b> <b>maritime</b> companies who would like to explore these opportunities. Case studies were carried out on three <b>Norwegian</b> <b>maritime</b> companies who have already succeeded in entering the market. To facilitate the analysis, background research was done on the case companies, theories such as the eclectic paradigm and foreign direct investment strategies, as well as academic literature was used. Interviews were then conducted. Through finding out how and why the case companies entered the market, and what they have been doing to ensure the continued success of the firm, the analysis reveals that there are many similarities to be drawn from the case companies that could be helpful to doing business in China. These similarities include: having a global strategy; entering through partnerships and joint ventures; hiring good leaders and focusing on recruitment and training; and instilling a strong company culture towards ethics with an emphasis on corruption. They serve as valuable lessons for <b>Norwegian</b> <b>maritime</b> companies contemplating entering China. This thesis also introduces and analyses future developments and trends such as the China (Shanghai) Free Trade Zone, which has freed up regulations within the maritime industry. The most progressive development is allowing foreign companies to be the majority shareholder (up to 51 %) of the joint ventures within the zone. The findings further reveal that potential sectors for <b>Norwegian</b> <b>maritime</b> companies to consider are niche and hightechnology ones such as deep-sea offshore shipping, cruise shipping as well as ship management. nhhma...|$|R
