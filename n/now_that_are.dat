When discussing the additional power of the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, John Vignocchi stated [...] "I’d say, specifically related to Xbox One, the graphical prowess of that system is incredible. So, we’re looking at {{what we can do}} to make sure the game looks incredible on [...] From a features perspective, I’d say the thing we’re most excited about is that players are going to be able to create Toy Boxes <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> much, much larger than they were before," [...] and [...] "In terms of what we're doing with , we're planning on making use of the graphical prowess of those machines — they can pump out some amazing-looking graphics. In addition to that, what we're planning on doing is taking advantage of the overall memory footprint. In Disney Infinity there were certain platforms that were constrained by the amount of RAM, so people couldn't truly build the toy box of their dreams. We've optimized the engine to allow the last-gen, PS3 and 360, to still build compelling Toy Box levels, but with Xbox One and PS4, the sky's the limit." [...] The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 {{versions of}} the game are more advanced than the others, as executive producer John Vignocchi said [...] "one of the most unique features of Disney Infinity 2.0 on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, just because of the memory footprint of those systems, is that the size of the toy boxes you can create are just gigantic." [...] The game engine is improved and expanded.|$|E

Perhaps our Lord {{might have}} his eye upon {{the gates of}} the temple when he spoke this word unto the people; for though {{the gates of the}} temple were six cubits wide, yet they were so strait, that none that were unclean in {{anything}} might enter in thereat (Eze 40:48), because there were placed at these gates, porters, whose office was to look that none but those that had right to enter might go in thither. And so it is written, Jehoiada set [...] "porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that none which was unclean in anything should enter in." [...] (2 Chron 23:19) Souls, God hath porters at the gates of the temple, at the gate of heaven; porters, I say, placed there by God, to look that none that are unclean in anything may come in thither.

6000|$|This was testified of old, John i. 12. [...] "But {{as many as}} {{received}} him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them who believe on his name." [...] Men want power over their sins: When sin appears to be exceeding sinful, they would overcome it, and be rid of it, when it is troublesome: And when they are under a deep conviction of the evil of it, and see the woful and miserable state that sin hath brought mankind into how they have lost the image of God and the favour of God; they then desire to be restored, and brought back again into their primitive state. You that know the truth of God, see how the work goes on in your hearts, see how the image of God is carrying on upon you. Consider, that the Lord is a holy God, of purer eyes than to behold iniquity with approbation: [...] "There is no peace to the wicked," [...] that walk in the broad way, and grieve the Holy Spirit, and do not answer his divine call. There is a two-fold call concerning man, a call to repentance, and a call to judgment. The call to repentance is in this day of God's visitation; they that receive it <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> so wise, as to answer God's call, and believe in the Son of God, and in his inward appearance, that obey his voice, when they hear his call, saying, Come away, come out of thy sins, {{come out of the}} wickedness, filthiness, and pollution of the world; come into the divine nature of the Son of God; come into his life: Into what life? Into the spiritual life, the divine life? Thou hast been dead to God and alive to the world: Now that thou mayst [sic.] be dead to sin, and alive to God, come unto him that hath all power in heaven and in earth committed to him. O come unto Christ, the dear and blessed Son of God, in this day of grace and salvation, and receive power to overcome thy sins! Then thou wilt be a conqueror, and overcome the Devil.|$|E

We just come up with different ways to release a record. I’m not trying to call people out, {{but there are a lot}} of things in modern music right <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> totally bumming me out. ... As far as releasing songs, as you get older people care less and less about what you do now. It’s more about what you’ve already done, and we’ve realized that. The term legacy act applies to our band when you refer to Less Than Jake. We do work really hard on our new songs though compared to our contemporaries, and we’re one of the few of them that do that. It’s not going be the best of the best, but it’s pretty good. Kids get it for free anyway. We’re trying to find new ways to put things out." [...] Similarly, trombonist Buddy Schaub stated, [...] "These days an EP is plenty for people to digest. It trims the fat so to speak. Putting out five quality songs is better than ten mediocre songs. And with our schedules and Roger’s studio, going in to bust out five songs at a time keeps the frequency of music into the fan’s hands at a peak." ...|$|E

Wickersham explained, [...] "It's not like we're going to start putting out a record like we've been listening to The Dead or something.

The aim is to assess whether the current crop of tablets and available software offer a viable platform for the immediate capture and dissemination of formative or summative written feedback.

We examine a range of tablet devices, covering the major operating systems and touchscreen technologies.
