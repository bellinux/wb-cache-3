5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire author George R. R. Martin {{wrote one}} episode {{in each of}} the first four seasons. Martin did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> an episode for the later seasons, since he wanted to focus on {{completing}} the sixth novel (The Winds of Winter). Jane Espenson co-wrote one first-season episode as a freelance writer.|$|E
5|$|History {{may never}} know {{the true story of}} Lee's {{intentions}} at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.|$|E

So I'll go halfway to meet them." ...|$|R

5|$|Jackson {{explored}} {{a variety}} of music genres, including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Unlike many artists, Jackson did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> his songs on paper and instead dictated into a sound recorder. When composing music, he preferred to beatbox and imitate instruments vocally rather than use instruments.|$|E
5|$|Kotok did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> {{any of the}} Spacewar! code, but he did {{travel to}} Digital to obtain a sine-cosine routine that Russell needed. Graetz {{credited}} Kotok and Saunders with building the game controllers that allowed two people to play side by side.|$|E
5|$|Amin did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> an autobiography, {{and he did}} not authorize an {{official}} written account of his life. So, there are discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources claim that he was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925. Other unconfirmed sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. Amin's son Hussein has stated that his father was born in Kampala in 1928.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{domestic}} violence case between Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} American entertainer Chris Brown, media speculated as to whether any song featured on her fourth upcoming album would be about him. In an interview with MTV News, Ne-Yo clarified that he would <b>not</b> <b>write</b> a song for Rihanna about Brown, because he considered the idea unnecessary. Harmony said {{that no matter what}} song Rihanna released as a lead single from the album, it would be looked at as a song about Brown.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann, a Dutch {{administrator}} of the Kedu region, continued Cornelius's work, and in 1835, the whole complex was finally unearthed. His interest in Borobudur was more personal than official. Hartmann did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> any reports of his activities, in particular, the alleged story that he discovered the large statue of Buddha in the main stupa. In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome, although what he discovered is unknown and the main stupa remains empty.|$|E
5|$|Mozart did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> down a cadenza for the movement, or {{at least}} there is no {{evidence}} of him having done so. Many later composers and performers, including Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni and Gabriel Fauré, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E

5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|The Magyars, {{settled in}} the Pontic-Caspian steppe by the 830s, began a westward {{migration}} after their defeat {{by a coalition of}} Pechenegs and Bulgarians in about 895. They crossed the Carpathian Mountains, invading the surrounding area. Gelou is a local ruler described in the Gesta Hungarorum as an opponent of the invading Magyars. Anonymus did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> about Simeon I of Bulgaria, Svatopluk I of Moravia or other opponents known from contemporary sources, instead chronicling Magyar battles with local rulers (including Gelou, Menumorut and Salan) not mentioned in other primary sources.|$|E

However, contemporary news media did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> of the spire's erection, nor were there any press releases celebrating the spire's erection. Even the New York Herald Tribune, which had virtually continuous coverage of the tower's construction, did not report on the spire's installation until days after the spire had been raised.|$|E

5|$|Their {{conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin is the {{principal}} subject of the Gesta Hungarorum. The Gesta was written after 1150 by an unidentified author, who {{is referred to as}} Anonymus in modern scholars' works. He wrote primarily of the Magyars' battles with six local rulers, including Menumorut, who are not named in other annals and chronicles. On the other hand, Anonymus did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> of Svatopluk I of Moravia, Luitpold of Bavaria, and other local rulers whose fights with the conquering Magyars were described in late 9th-century or early 10th-century sources.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax {{question}} Arthur Leigh Allen, {{a suspect}} in the Vallejo case. Allen behaves suspiciously during the interview. They ask to see his watch and notice that he wears a Zodiac brand wristwatch which has the same logo used by the killer. However, a handwriting expert insists that Allen did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming increasingly paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. At one point, he shares information with the Riverside Police Department, angering both Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who is bothered when Graysmith shows up at the theater where Toschi is watching a Hollywood film, Dirty Harry, loosely based on the Zodiac case, with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Mike Bullen {{vowed that}} he would <b>not</b> <b>write</b> a fifth series after the fourth ended so well in 2001, but was persuaded to write it when {{executive}} producer Andy Harries suggested he should kill off a character. James Nesbitt was not keen to return to do another series but Bullen persuaded him to by offering to have Adam's cancer return with fatal consequences (the character had recovered from a testicular cancer scare in the second series). Despite this, Bullen was unable to make Adam's death funny and, following a meeting with Harries, decided it should be Rachel who died. Harries scheduled a meeting with Helen Baxendale at the Groucho Club, where they discussed the development. The scenes where Adam talks to Rachel's spirit were inspired by Truly, Madly, Deeply and Ghost. Bullen co-wrote the script of episode three with Matt Greenhalgh.|$|E

5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might not have been able to write what would become his greatest works.|$|E
5|$|Sunny {{offers to}} help out Ringo Brown (Sam Clark) with his love letters to Donna. When Donna works out that Ringo did <b>not</b> <b>write</b> the letters, Sunny has {{to tell her that}} she wrote them for him. In a spur-of-the-moment act, Donna kisses Sunny, {{grateful}} for her honesty. Sunny is upset that her first kiss was stolen by Donna. Sunny and Zeke's first kiss occurs during the play. Sunny struggles with public displays of affection with Zeke and she lies that she told her parents about their relationship. When Sunny finds that her grades have slipped, she decides to end the relationship and admits to Zeke that she did not tell her parents about him.|$|E
5|$|The authorship of the Urantia papers is disputed. Journalist Brad Gooch {{argues in}} his 2002 {{profile of the}} Urantia {{movement}} that Sadler {{was the author of}} The Urantia Book, citing similarities between some of its passages and contents of Sadler's earlier writings. Gardner believes that Sadler wrote part of the papers, but heavily edited and revised most of them. He also contends that Sadler refused to include some material provided to him for inclusion in the book, and that he plagiarized from other works. Ken Glasziou, a supporter of the Urantia Foundation, contends that statistical evidence of the text and Sadler's other works indicates that he did <b>not</b> <b>write,</b> or extensively edit, The Urantia Book.|$|E
