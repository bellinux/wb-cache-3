5|$|Two {{series of}} {{nitrogen}} oxohalides are known: the <b>nitrosyl</b> halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO2). The first are very reactive gases {{that can be}} made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide. <b>Nitrosyl</b> fluoride (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent. <b>Nitrosyl</b> chloride (NOCl) behaves {{in much the same way}} and has often been used as an ionising solvent. <b>Nitrosyl</b> bromide (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: nitryl fluoride (FNO2) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.|$|E
5|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give <b>nitrosyl</b> halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give <b>nitrosyl</b> complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E
5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, <b>nitrosyl</b> chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E
40|$|Photoactive metal <b>nitrosyls</b> (NO {{complexes}} of metals) {{have drawn}} attention as potential drugs for delivery of nitric oxide (NO) to biological targets {{under the control}} of light. Major success in this area has been achieved with designed metal <b>nitrosyls</b> derived from ligands that contain carboxamide group(s). This thesis details the design strategies used to synthesize such carboxamide containing metal <b>nitrosyls.</b> As a first step, DFT and TDDFT calculations were used to elucidate the electronic structures and varying photoactivities of iron, manganese, and ruthenium <b>nitrosyls</b> derived from identical pentadentate ligand frames, as described in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, a set of tetradentate dicarboxamide ligand frames with different combinations of phosphine-P, phenolato-O, and/or pyridine-N donors was employed in order to uncover which atom types promote low-energy light absorption in ruthenium <b>nitrosyls.</b> Part one details the reactions of phosphine containing ligands with RuCl 3 and subsequent exposure to NO gas. Such reactions lead to the eventual isolation of diamagnetic Ru(II) complexes with oxidized ligand frames and no bound NO. The second part of Chapter 3 focuses on a set of {RuNO} 6 <b>nitrosyls</b> with dicarboxamide ligands with a varying numbers of phenolate-O and pyridine-N donors. The resulting <b>nitrosyls</b> have been characterized by X-ray crystallography. All three complexes are diamagnetic, exhibit νNO in the range 1780 - 1840 cm - 1 and rapidly release NO in solution upon exposure to low power UV light. Results of theoretical studies on these {RuNO} 6 <b>nitrosyls</b> indicate considerable contribution from ligand orbitals in the MOs involved in transitions leading to NO photolability. 	In Chapter 4, the attachment of resorufin and fluorescein derived dye chromophores was explored as a way to further sensitize ruthenium <b>nitrosyls</b> to visible light. First, the steric effects of the in-plane ligands in these dye-sensitized {RuNO} 6 <b>nitrosyls</b> on their NO photolability were examined. Next, the direct conjugation of dye chromophores was compared with dye attachment via a linker to understand the mechanism of photoactivation in these dye-bound ruthenium <b>nitrosyls.</b> In addition the fluorescence properties of these dye-conjugated <b>nitrosyls</b> were characterized and found to provide a potential signal showing when and where NO has been delivered...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of a <b>nitrosyl</b> complex to be synthesized is Roussin's red salt, which is a sodium salt of the anion 2−.

25|$|The Enemark-Feltham {{notation}} is used {{to describe}} the number of d-type electrons present in a complex. It is deliberately ambiguous, because the true oxidation state of a metal coordinated by non-innocent ligands is often unclear.

25|$|Two {{important}} biological reaction {{mechanisms of}} nitric oxide are S-nitrosation of thiols, and nitrosylation of transition metal ions. S-nitrosation involves the (reversible) conversion of thiol groups, including cysteine residues in proteins, to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). S-Nitrosation is {{a mechanism for}} dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all major classes of protein. The second mechanism, nitrosylation, involves the binding of NO to a transition metal ion like iron or copper. In this function, NO {{is referred to as}} a <b>nitrosyl</b> ligand. Typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes, thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Nitrosylated ferrous iron is particularly stable, as the binding of the <b>nitrosyl</b> ligand to ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is very strong. Hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by NO by both pathways: NO may attach directly to the heme in the nitrosylation reaction, and independently form S-nitrosothiols by S-nitrosation of the thiol moieties.|$|E
50|$|Nitric oxide {{can serve}} as a ligand in complexes. The {{resulting}} complexes are called metal <b>nitrosyls,</b> and can bond to a metal atom in two extreme modes: as NO+ and as NO−.

However, the results of many {{studies have shown that the}} ionic descriptions of the NO ligand do not correlate with metal-NO geometry.

Various iron complexes are involved in numerous steps of nitric oxide metabolism; most of these complexes contain diverse sulfur ligands. Nitric oxide is naturally generated from the amino acid arginine in the reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase. The active centre of this enzyme contains an iron porphyrin complex with one thiolate axial ligand. Iron <b>nitrosyls</b> and nitrosothiols are the most relevant agents responsible for storage and transport of the NO and related compounds.
