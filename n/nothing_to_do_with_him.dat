5|$|Soon after Vash's arrival, {{the station}} begins to {{experience}} similar power failures. In the meantime, Q appears to Vash, apparently infatuated with her. Q {{was the one}} who transported Vash to the Gamma Quadrant two years earlier, but now she wants <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> much to Q's annoyance. When Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) asks Vash out for dinner, a jealous Q uses his powers to send Bashir off to sleep. Meanwhile, Quark (Armin Shimerman) arranges to auction off various items Vash has found in the Gamma Quadrant, including an unusual crystal that might fetch a high price.|$|E

When the letter is stolen, {{it is up to the}} protagonist to travel around the village and retrieve all of its pieces.

25|$|Apart {{from serving}} as an official, Zhuge Zhan was also skilled in {{painting}} and calligraphy. Since the people of Shu deeply missed Zhuge Liang, who died in 234, they especially liked Zhuge Zhan for his talents because he reminded them of his father. Whenever the Shu government implemented a favourable policy, the people give credit to Zhuge Zhan even though it might have had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> As Zhuge Liang banned the position of official historian in the Shu government, {{it was hard to}} distinguish which policies Zhuge Zhan had a role in, although it was clear that Zhuge Zhan's reputation was greater than his actual accomplishments.|$|E

25|$|Carlton Gary {{was born}} on September 24, 1950 in Columbus, Georgia. His father was a {{construction}} worker who wanted <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and would accept no financial responsibility for him. Gary only met his father once, when he was twelve years old. Gary's mother was extremely poor and as a result, they moved around a lot. He was malnourished {{most of the time}} and was often left with his aunt or great aunt, both maids for elderly, wealthy, white women. In elementary school, Gary suffered serious head trauma when he was knocked unconscious in a playground accident, and in his teens, he was a heavy drug user. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he was arrested multiple times for robbery, arson, and assault. During that time, he also got married to a woman named Sheila, and had two children. In 1970, he moved to Albany, New York, where he had plans to become a singer, but he continued to carry out his criminal activities.|$|E
25|$|When Fraser {{made his}} next {{visit to the}} Romanov court in 1805 expecting remuneration, to his great {{disappointment}} he discovered that the new Emperor would have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Undaunted, he repeated the trip, visiting both Moscow and Saint Petersburg, but in vain. After the Emperor Paul I's assassination in March, 1801, the new Emperor Alexander I declined to recognise Fraser's appointment. Fraser petitioned his cause for two years, finally resorting to seeking assistance from the British ambassadorial corps, and was ultimately paid 6,000 rubles by royal decree in April, 1803. The Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, an enthusiastic amateur botanist herself, supported his efforts, giving him a diamond ring and commissioning him for specimens for the Imperial Gardens of Gatchina and Pavlovsk Palace. The director of the Imperial Botanic Garden at Saint Petersburg catalogued 18 of Fraser's North American species {{in the early years}} of the 19th century, with some of the specimens surviving as of 1997 in the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.|$|E
25|$|Johnstone {{was born}} into a gentry family in 1730, and {{embarked}} on a naval career. Early in his service there occurred several incidents which revealed both positive and negative aspects of his character. He was involved in encounters with the enemy where he was praised for his bravery, and incidents where he was censured for disobedience. He rose through the ranks to his own commands and had some success with small cruisers against enemy merchants and privateers. After the end of the Seven Years' War he had made friends with several powerful figures, and was appointed Governor of West Florida. He achieved some degree of success in the delicate operations of running a new colony, but ultimately clashed with his political masters and failed to cultivate support amongst the wider sections of colonial society. Returning to Britain he became active in politics, supporting conciliatory measures for the Americans, and the removal of government interference from the affairs of the East India Company. His stance on the former led to his appointment {{as a member of the}} Carlisle Peace Commission, but he was accused of offering bribes and the Americans would have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|Following the victory, McGovern harbored {{thoughts}} of {{running in the}} 1976 presidential election, but given the magnitude of his presidential defeat, the Democratic Party wanted <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> then or later. Unfamiliar and uncomfortable with Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter, McGovern secretly voted for Ford instead. McGovern's view on intervention in Southeast Asia took a turn in 1978 {{in reaction to the}} ongoing Cambodian genocide. Noting that it affected a percentage of the population which made [...] "Hitler's operation look tame", he advocated an international military intervention in Cambodia to put the Khmer Rouge regime out of power.|$|E

Dickerson had tried several years previously to reconnect with her, though she wanted <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Catherine asks her for help, and she begrudgingly agrees to see her son. She recoils when he hugs her, blaming the government for making him what he is. Rejected, Dickerson confesses to the murders. Connor is able {{to see all of}} this, his connection to it not yet uncovered. Frank Black is unconvinced that everything has been wrapped up, and realizes that Connor is involved—he wants Dickerson to himself. [...] "Stop looking" [...] was his message to Dickerson, to stop looking for affection anywhere else.|$|E

Following that, Mahendra wrote a series of [...] "sentimental musings" [...] in the Tamil magazine Kumudam under the title Shobavum Naanum (lit. Shoba and me). Their relationship was explored by K. G. George (Mahendra's junior at the FTII) in his 1983 Malayalam film Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback. When the film was released, Mahendra said that the film had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and has not discussed about it with George. In 1998, he married another actress Mounika and declared their marriage publicly in 2004.|$|E

[...] Wang wants the bar and its [...] "evil spirits" [...] shut down; his sister-in-law informs him that free enterprise cannot be shut down, and the two wonder at the foibles {{of the younger generation}} ("The Other Generation"). [...] Ta arrives home to admit that his father was right, Mei Li is the girl for him.

500|$|In {{the first}} scene of Act 2, Fleance meets his father, who asks him to take his sword and tells him he is {{reluctant}} {{to go to bed}} due to the [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, however, Banquo demands the sword be returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king. Doing so would make the throne more available for Fleance, and would fulfill the Three Witches' prophecy that his sons would become kings. Since Banquo's good nature is revolted by these thoughts, he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure he does not act on them. Still, he is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands their return. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> killing the king, but that they have revealed to him Macbeth's bloody nature. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night, but when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had these dark dreams about Macbeth, takes back his sword as a precaution. In any case, this scene adds to the dark, uncertain, unsettling tone of the play. Fleance and his father are not even certain of what time it is throughout, as Fleance says when asked {{at the beginning of the}} scene [...] "The moon is down; I have not heard the clock." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the ninth}} series, Harry reinstates Lucas {{as chief of}} Section D; this makes Lucas {{responsible}} for the integration of two new team members into the section, Beth Bailey (Sophia Myles) and Dimitri Levendis (Max Brown). Vaughn returns and hands Lucas a briefcase with possessions from his life before MI5, including photographs of him and Maya Lahan. When he visits her, however, she is so shocked at his reappearance and angry over his letting her believe him dead that at first she wants <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Later, Vaughn promises to leave Lucas alone in exchange for an MI5 file on [...] "Albany"; Lucas eventually hands him what he believes is the file. Believing he is free from Vaughn, Lucas persuades Maya to restart their relationship. However, it is revealed the file was not Albany, though it leads {{to the location of}} the actual file. Vaughn forces Lucas to find the file, which is in the possession of former Section D member Malcolm Wynn-Jones (Hugh Simon). After convincing Malcolm to give him the file, Lucas hands it over to Vaughn, but it is soon discovered that this file, too, is a fake, and Malcolm has abandoned the house where he and Lucas had met. To force Lucas to continue seeking the file hand Vaughn kidnaps Maya. By this time, Harry Pierce has discovered that Lucas is not who he claims to be. Arrested and questioned, Lucas admits his true identity and his past, but convinces Harry to save Maya. A mortally wounded Vaughn is able to [...] "wake up" [...] Lucas' true persona, who he was before MI5. Believing Harry may not honour the deal they have worked out, Lucas intends to leave the country after getting his hands on the Albany file. The file is revealed to contain directions for building a genetic weapon that Vaughn has agreed to sell to the Chinese. After Lucas acquires the real file from Harry in exchange for team member Ruth Evershed, whom he has kidnapped, Maya is killed while he is trying to escape with her. He delivers the file to the Chinese agents anyway and intends to kill Harry for revenge. During their roof-top confrontation, Lucas learns that Albany is an elaborate deception; the genetic weapon is unworkable. Lucas then forces Harry to turn around, as if he is about to execute him. Instead, Lucas throws himself from the roof, to his death.|$|E

Dee Lockett of New York described the track as Gomez's own version of Beyoncé's [...] "Partition" [...] (2014), a [...] "striptease that has her both exploring and enjoying her sexuality", while Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield deemed it a [...] "deranged obsessive Lana-like torch song about Selena dressing the part to transform herself into the girl of her dreams".
