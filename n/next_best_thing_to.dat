Plus even though he's dealing with the sophisticated likes of Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Kurt Weill, he remains essentially country".|$|E

500|$|Scouting {{reports on}} Filatov were mixed {{in advance of}} the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. Sergei Nemchinov, head coach of Russia's {{national}} junior team, said of Filatov, [...] "He definitely has an NHL upside because he can score, is a well-rounded player and is responsible in the defensive zone." [...] Independent scouting service Red Line Report at one point declared Filatov [...] "the <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> Steven Stamkos" [...] (who was eventually selected first overall in the 2008 Draft). McKeen's Hockey scouts described him as a cross between Ilya Kovalchuk and Maxim Afinogenov. His strengths included his skating and vision, as well as the inclination to play at high intensity. The NHL's Director of European Scouting, Goran Stubb, assessed Filatov's NHL readiness as, [...] "Nikita is a leader, has a great attitude, an excellent work ethic and tons of talent." [...] Other scouts were not as impressed with his defensive game, however, preferring to focus on his offensive abilities. Off the ice, Filatov does not train in a traditional gym or weight room, preferring to run outside in sand and lift objects such as trees and boulders.|$|E
500|$|DJ Shadow {{was brought}} in by Activision during November and December 2008, {{at least a year}} into the {{development}} into the game, to help select individual songs, help with creating the mixes, and provide additional input for the game, and will also be a playable DJ avatar in the game. He was able to identify old effects samples that were used in the past for scratching for the developers to include the game. To create the mixes, DJ Shadow first created a [...] "dry version" [...] of each mix which did not include any embellishments. DJ Shadow then proceeded to build off that to create the [...] "wet version" [...] with added effects that was used as the base for the gameplay's mixes. Artists Eminem and Jay-Z have also served as consultants for the game; a special edition of DJ Hero was branded with their names, and included a limited edition of the controller, a music CD of their songs, a DJ stand, and a travel case for the units. This version is titled [...] "Renegade Edition." [...] Jay-Z stated that he [...] " [...] the freedom" [...] that the game gives him, and was able to work closely with Activision to put in new mixes that he envisioned, and considered the game [...] "a DJ's universe", while Eminem believed DJ Hero was a game that he could [...] "see [...] actually playing". DJ's Z-Trip and DJ AM both created mixes for the game and will also be playable DJ's in the game; Z-Trip will also help demonstrate the game at the 2009 E3 Conference. Cut Chemist and J.Period will also be assisting in creating mixes for the game. Grandmaster Flash and DJ Jazzy Jeff have contributed remixes to the soundtrack. [...] All the Daft Punk remixes were created in-house by the team in London. All of these artists appeared as playable avatars. In the case of Daft Punk, a special venue inspired by the group's Alive 2007 tour was created, that Tim Riley, Vice President for Music Affairs at Activision, considered to be [...] "the <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> being at a Daft Punk concert". David Guetta has also contributed three mixes that were made available as downloadable content for the game; Guetta would also serve as a spokesperson in the game's European marketing.

CSPI said it was “concerned that the products' claim, ‘the <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> fruits and vegetables,’ may lead consumers to believe the pills are closer to real fruits and vegetables than is likely to be the case." [...] According to CSPI, the labels say the capsules contain high levels of vitamins A and C and folate naturally, but “do not disclose that these vitamins and minerals are added to the capsules during processing and are nutrients only characteristic of the original fruit and vegetable sources.” ...|$|E

Multiple studies have produced conflicting results as {{to the truth of}} these claims. [...] Doubts have been raised about the advertised benefits of Juice Plus by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, University of California Berkeley, Center for Science in the Public Interest, and other sources. The product has been criticized on the basis that: its marketing is unsupported by research data, it contains too little fruit and vegetable powder to offer significant clinical benefits, its effects {{can be attributed to the}} inclusion of added exogenous vitamins and micronutrients, and it is excessively priced relative to its potential benefits. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Clinic referred to Juice Plus as a “pricey supplement” that is “distributed through a multi-tiered marketing scheme with exaggerated value and cost." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vulture's Lindsey Weber {{felt that}} fans knew {{most of the}} details about the special due {{to the release of}} many clips prior to its premiere. She {{considered}} Minaj's appearance as one of the special's biggest changes and praised the scenes shot in slow motion as well as those showing the pair's daughter. In a positive review for Elle, Isabella Biedenharn called the special a [...] "predictable Carter propaganda" [...] with many [...] "lovey scenes" [...] occurring onstage between the pair and went on to praise Beyoncé's energetic performances. Jethro Nededog in an article for The Wrap opined that the [...] "'us against the world' imagery" [...] in the special denied rumours about the pair's divorce. He chose the performance of Lauryn Hill's [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] by Beyoncé as a show highlight. Chris Eggertsen from HitFix noted that most of the viewers watched the special because Beyoncé was featured in it. The A.V.

He went on to laud the pair's chemistry on the stage and during their joint performances. However, he finished his review in a more mixed note, writing [...] "But for anyone who's more interested in the Carters the less pristine they appear to be, On The Run is like being served a 60-pound steak after you've already filled up on sizzle."

5000|$|Alternative spellings of the Scandinavian Å {{have become}} a concern because of globalization, and {{particularly}} because of the popularization of the World Wide Web. This is {{to a large extent}} {{due to the fact that}} prior to the creation of IDNA system around 2005, internet domains containing Scandinavian letters were not recognized by the DNS system, and anyway do not feature on keyboards adapted for other languages. While it is recommended to keep the Å intact wherever possible, the <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>to</b> use the older, double A spelling (e.g. [...] "www.raade.com" [...] instead of [...] "www.råde.com"). This is because, as previously discussed, the Å/Aa indicates a separate sound. If the Å is represented as a common A without the overring (e.g. [...] "www.rade.com") there is no indication that the A is supposed to represent another sound entirely. Even so, (mis-)representing the Å as just an A is particularly common in Sweden, as compared to Norway and Denmark.|$|R
