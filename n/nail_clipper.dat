50|$|A <b>nail</b> <b>clipper</b> (also {{called a}} nail trimmer or nail cutter) is a hand tool used to trim fingernails, toenails and hangnails.|$|E
50|$|Nail {{clippers}} {{are usually}} made {{of stainless steel}} but can also be made of plastic and aluminium. Two common varieties are the plier type and the compound lever type. Most nail clippers usually come with another tool attached, {{which is used to}} clean dirt out from under nails. A <b>nail</b> <b>clipper</b> often has a miniature file fixed to it to allow rough edges of nails to be manicured. A nail file allows for removal of any excess nail that is jagged or has been missed. Nail clippers occasionally come with a pocket knife or a nail catcher; the multi-purpose <b>nail</b> <b>clipper</b> was invented by Hungarian inventor David Gestetner. The <b>nail</b> <b>clipper</b> consists of a head which may be concave or convex. Specialized nail clippers which have convex clipping ends are intended for trimming toenails, while concave clipping ends are for fingernails. The cutting head may be manufactured to be parallel or perpendicular to the principal axis of the cutter. Cutting heads which are parallel to the principal axis are made to address accessibility issues involved with cutting toenails.|$|E

50|$|The {{compound}} lever {{is a simple}} machine operating {{on the premise that}} the resistance from one lever in a system of levers will act as power for the next, and thus the applied force will be amplified from one lever to the next (as long as the mechanical advantage for each lever is greater than one). Almost all scales use some sort of {{compound lever}} to work. Other examples include <b>nail</b> <b>clippers</b> and piano keys.|$|R

Over 30% of manufacturing enterprises in Xiaolan are engaged in locks and hardware production. Such production accounted for nearly 50% of the total industrial outputs of Xiaolan and employed more than 30,000 people in 2002. The success of Xiaolan in this sector brought it an unprecedented honour of being certified as the critical hardware industrial base by China National Hardware Association in 2002.|$|R
50|$|A few {{examples}} of the compound lever are the scale, train brakes, and a common type of <b>nail</b> <b>clippers.</b> Another example is the elbow-joint press, which is used in printing, molding or handloading bullets, minting coins and medals, and in hole punching. Compound balances are used to weigh heavy items. These all use multiple levers to magnify force to accomplish a specific purpose. The train brake translates the force of pushing back the stick to the levers and they rub against the wheels, using friction to slow and eventually stop the train. These are everyday applications of this mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins by}} {{studying}} the Zero Tolerance policies in {{public schools in the}} 1990s, which were designed to eradicate drugs and weapons at schools. By arbitrary application of this policy via unchecked authority, soon <b>nail</b> <b>clippers,</b> key chains, and aspirin were considered dangerous and violations of the rules. This policy, combined with Columbine-inspired fear, has resulted in kindergartners being suspended for using pointed fingers as guns in games of cops and robbers and students being suspended for having Midol and Alka-Seltzer. Increasingly, issues once dealt with by the guidance counselor or a trip to the principal’s office are now handled by the police.|$|R

5000|$|The {{inventor}} of the <b>nail</b> <b>clipper</b> is not exactly known, but the first United States patent for an improvement in a finger-nail clipper (implying such a device already existed) {{seems to be in}} 1875 by Valentine Fogerty and in the United Kingdom, Hungarian inventor David Gestetner. Other patents for an improvement in finger-nail clippers are in 1876, William C. Edge, and in 1878, John H. Hollman. Filings for complete finger-nail clippers (not merely improvements) include, in 1881, Eugene Heim and Celestin Matz, in 1885, George H. Coates (for a finger-nail cutter), and, in 1905, Chapel S. Carter (son of a Connecticut Baptist church deacon) patented a finger-nail clipper with a later patent in 1922. Around 1913, Carter was secretary of the H. C. Cook Company of Ansonia, Connecticut, which was incorporated in 1903 as the H. C. Cook Machine Company by Henry C. Cook, Lewis I. Cook, and Chapel S. Carter. Around 1928, Carter was president of the company when, he claimed, about 1896, the [...] "Gem"-brand finger <b>nail</b> <b>clipper</b> made its first appearance.|$|E

While Susan Ma failed to win the series, Lord Sugar admitted he liked her plan, later investing into her skincare company Tropic in 2012.|$|R
50|$|Kōzō Okamoto {{was convicted}} and sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} in Israel. During the incarceration it is said that he requested to convert to Judaism, and that he tried to circumcise himself with <b>nail</b> <b>clippers.</b> On July 23, 1973, PFLP and JRA operatives hijacked Japan Air Lines Flight 404, demanding Okamoto's release in exchange for the hostages on board; Israel refused to comply. Okamoto was released in 1985 after 13 years in prison, as part of a prisoner exchange with Palestinian militant factions for captive Israeli soldiers. After his release from prison in Israel, Kōzō Okamoto moved to Libya, then Syria, and finally to Lebanon where he reunited {{with other members of the}} Japanese Red Army.|$|R
5000|$|... "Lacking resources, facing {{incentives}} to push out low-performing students, {{and responding to}} a handful of highly-publicized school shootings, schools have embraced zero-tolerance policies that automatically impose severe punishment regardless of circumstances. Under these policies, students have been expelled for bringing <b>nail</b> <b>clippers</b> or scissors to school. Rates of suspension have increased dramatically in recent years—from 1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000 (3) — and have been most dramatic for children of color.Overly harsh disciplinary policies push students down the pipeline and into the juvenile justice system. Suspended and expelled children are often left unsupervised and without constructive activities; they also can easily fall behind in their coursework, leading to a greater likelihood of disengagement and drop-outs. All of these factors increase the likelihood of court involvement." ...|$|R
