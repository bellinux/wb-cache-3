40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Mobile Telecommunication and Innovation at (MSc. MTI) at Strathmore UniversityConstituency Development Fund (CDF) in Kenya has been hailed {{as one of the}} most innovative creations of the <b>National</b> <b>Alliance</b> <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Coalition</b> (NARC) administration (2003 - 2007). With the Government working hard to cultivate an image of transparency and inclusiveness for good governance in Kenya, implementation of E-Governance services for creating better relations between citizens and those in power has been a real struggle. ICT has been exploited in this relationship to help transform the accessibility, quality and cost-effectiveness of public services. The emergence of mobile technologies has further accelerated the different sectors of Government in implementing faster and cost-effective means of communication. However, there have been notable challenges in the CDF Bursary Fund application process including but not limited to delayed information relay about commencement of application window and disconnect between CDF bursary officials and the applicants. This dissertation describes a study on the challenges and gaps in the bursary fund application process in the context of technological need. The study identified challenges such as delayed information relay on commencement and updates on disbursements as well as lack student historical data with regards being a bursary beneficiary. The study also aimed to develop, test and validate a mobile application that can be used to solve these challenges. In order to establish the relevant system requirements needed, data collection methodologies including interviews with stakeholders, questionnaires with CDF Bursary applicants were used to highlight the needs of the applicants. This data was then analysed using data analysis tool IDEA and used in the design of the application. Waterfall methodology was then used to develop the mobile application using Android Platform. The application included features that enabled capture of applicants data, SMS updates for applicants at the inception of the application window, after application, and during disbursements process. The application also enabled the applicants to obtain application forms easily during the application window. This solution was tested by the developer and validated by selected users who formed part of the test team. The solution proved to be a viable solution with 90 % acceptance levels...|$|E
