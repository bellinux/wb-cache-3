5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (<b>negative</b> <b>electrode)</b> to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E

25|$|Electrodeionization: Water {{is passed}} between a {{positive}} electrode and a <b>negative</b> <b>electrode.</b> Ion exchange membranes allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the <b>negative</b> <b>electrode</b> and only negative ions toward the positive electrode. High purity deionized water is produced continuously, similar to ion exchange treatment. Complete removal of ions from water is possible {{if the right}} conditions are met. The water is normally pre-treated with a reverse osmosis unit to remove non-ionic organic contaminants, and with gas transfer membranes to remove carbon dioxide. A water recovery of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the RO inlet.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that addition of carbon additives to the negative active material of lead-acid batteries increases battery charge acceptance in hybrid electric vehicle mode of operation (1). But the latest findings show that the titanium dioxide has similar effect (2). Hence this paper deals with impedance characteristics of experimental lead-acid accumulators with various amounts of titanium dioxide in active mass of <b>negative</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used for all measurements. Obtained data was subsequently fitted by equivalent circuits. It was investigated that ohmical resistivity of lead-acid cell increases with higher amounts of titanium dioxide in active mass of <b>negative</b> <b>electrodes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Post-test {{examinations}} {{were conducted}} to determine failure mechanisms, electrode morphologies, and in-cell corrosion of cell components, and to recommend appropriate design changes for improved cell performance and reliability. The reactive electrode materials required the design and construction of a special metallographic glovebox facility. Combinations of macro- and microscopic examinations determined that electrical short circuits were the predominant causes of cell failure. The major short circuit mechanism was extrusion of active material from one electrode and its subsequent contact with the opposing electrode (opposite polarity). Other mechanisms for short circuits included metallic deposits across separators, metallic deposits across the feed-through insulator (electrolyte leakage and corrosion), equipment malfunctions, cell assembly difficulties, etc. Post-test examinations confirmed that the short circuits were of mechanical origin; appropriate design changes were, therefore, recommended. Extensive microscopic examinations were conducted on both <b>negative</b> and positive <b>electrodes</b> to determine the morphology. Agglomeration of Li-Al was observed in the <b>negative</b> <b>electrodes</b> of most multi-plate cells. Examinations showed that the sulfides in the positive electrode remained as discrete particles in an electrolyte matrix. Also discussed are the results of post-test examinations to determine the following: lithium gradients in the <b>negative</b> <b>electrodes,</b> electrode expansion, materials distribution, copper deposition within electrode separators of FeS cells, Li 2 S deposits within electrode separators of FeS 3 cells, and the in-cell corrosion of current collector materials in positive and <b>negative</b> <b>electrodes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Batteries convert {{chemical}} energy directly to electrical energy. A battery consists of some number of voltaic cells. Each cell {{consists of two}} half-cells connected in series by a conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations. One half-cell includes electrolyte and the <b>negative</b> <b>electrode,</b> the electrode to which anions (negatively charged ions) migrate; the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the positive electrode to which cations (positively charged ions) migrate. Redox reactions power the battery. Cations are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode during charging, while anions are oxidized (electrons are removed) at the anode during charging. During discharge, the process is reversed. The electrodes do not touch each other, but are electrically connected by the electrolyte. Some cells use different electrolytes for each half-cell. A separator allows ions to flow between half-cells, but prevents mixing of the electrolytes.|$|E
500|$|Stott labels {{aluminium}} as a weak metal. It has {{the physical}} properties of a metal {{but some of}} the chemical properties of a nonmetal. Steele notes the paradoxical chemical behaviour of aluminium: [...] "It resembles a weak metal in its amphoteric oxide and in the covalent character of many of its compounds... Yet it is a highly electropositive metal... a high <b>negative</b> <b>electrode</b> potential". Moody says that, [...] "aluminium is on the 'diagonal borderland' between metals and non-metals in the chemical sense." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{potential}} difference and subsequent electric field pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the anode (positive electrode) while the cathode (<b>negative</b> <b>electrode)</b> pulls the nucleus. As the voltage increases, the current stresses the material (by electric polarization) beyond its dielectric limit (termed strength) into {{a stage of}} electrical breakdown, marked by an electric spark, where the material transforms from being an insulator into a conductor (as it becomes increasingly ionized). The underlying process is the Townsend avalanche, where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as {{can be seen in}} the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons. Therefore, the number of charged particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only [...] "after about 20 successive sets of collisions", mainly due to a small mean free path (average distance travelled between collisions).|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} {{a new type of}} additive with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) for stable cycling retention of silicon anodes. Diamino-Polyethylene Glycol (diamino-PEG) is used as a thermally curable additive with PAA polymeric binder for silicon nanoparticle based <b>negative</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Amino groups of the diamino-PEG form amide bonds with carboxylic acid groups of the PAA binder, which gives strong binding force even under high humidity. The highly cross linked amide bonds between diamino-PEG and PAA binder in silicon nanoparticle based <b>negative</b> <b>electrodes</b> leads to reduced electrical contact loss of silicon particles during electrochemical reaction.
