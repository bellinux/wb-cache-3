5|$|Katie is also {{patron of}} Fair Trees, the {{organisation}} {{that is trying}} to stop exploitation of cone pickers in Ambrolauri, Georgia, by the European Christmas tree industry. The local people in this region of Georgia are paid a pittance to risk their lives climbing 30m high fir trees to collect the cones from which the seeds are extracted and sent to Christmas tree nurseries in Europe. Until Fair Trees came along these cone pickers were given no safety equipment or training, <b>no</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> and very little pay; every year people are injured and even killed doing this work. Fair Trees grow and sell the only fair trade Christmas trees in the world (certified by the WFTO).|$|E
25|$|Socioeconomic {{status of}} mothers likely has a larger {{influence}} on breastfeeding adherence than race or ethnicity, {{as many women}} {{who are members of}} groups with low breastfeeding rates also have a low socioeconomic status. Among women born in the United States, women who are wealthier are more likely to breastfeed. In addition, employment can influence the decision to breastfeed. When either parent was unemployed or held a lower-status occupation (such as labor or sales), their children were more likely to never have been breastfed. In addition, women with public insurance or with <b>no</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> are more likely to never have breastfed their children, as are women who receive WIC.|$|E

25|$|Thaksin {{initiated}} two key healthcare policies: subsidised {{universal health}} care and low-cost universal access to anti-retroviral HIV medication (ARVs). Thaksin's 30-baht/visit universal healthcare program won the applause of the general public, but was criticised by many doctors and officials. Prior to the program's introduction, {{a large portion of}} the population had <b>no</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> and only limited access to healthcare. The program helped increase access to healthcare from 76% of the population to 96%. The program also increased workloads for health care employees, and caused many doctors to change to higher paying careers. It has also been criticised for being underfunded by the government. The program caused some hospitals to seek alternative sources of income, leading to a boom in medical tourism, with 1.3million foreign patients earning Thailand THB33billion (US$800million) in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Wells {{recorded}} {{an album}} for Ian Levine's Motorcity Records, {{but her voice}} began to fail, causing the singer to visit a local hospital. Doctors diagnosed Wells with laryngeal cancer. Treatments for the disease ravaged her voice, forcing her to quit her music career. Since she had <b>no</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> her illness wiped out her finances, forcing her to sell her home. As she struggled to continue treatment, old Motown friends, including Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, members of the Temptations and Martha Reeves, made donations to support her, along {{with the help of}} admirers such as Dionne Warwick, Rod Stewart, Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin and Bonnie Raitt. That same year, a benefit concert was held by fellow fan and Detroit R singer Anita Baker. Wells was also given a tribute by friends such as Stevie Wonder and Little Richard on The Joan Rivers Show.|$|E
25|$|Going {{home for}} rural {{healthcare}} in China is not ideal either. Over the past 30 years, {{that part of}} the health system has run down because government funding has fallen while everything else has become more expensive. Health facilities attempted to make up shortfalls by charging ever larger fees for diagnosis and treatment, especially for a difficult disease like tuberculosis. In China today, patients' payments keep the health services running and the medical staff have been encouraged to supply profitable health goods and services, especially drugs. Their own jobs depend on adequate operational funds, which are largely generated through user fees. Meanwhile, over the same 30 years, the socialist system of universal rural health-insurance collapsed and was not replaced apart from some pilot tests of an under-resourced community-based scheme in the 1990s. Until recently, virtually all rural residents, 900 million in all, had <b>no</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> at all. This situation will change if the current experiments with community-based health-insurance succeed and are then adopted nationally, but in the meantime as many as 10% of rural households have catastrophic medical payments (exceeding 40% of their disposable income) every year.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} facing Mississippians is the limited public health care provisions for parents. Medicaid is restrictively low with eligibility levels at 46 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. Outside of Medicaid, Mississippi has <b>no</b> state <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> program for parents. Moreover, the continual decline of employer-sponsored <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> and the prohibitive costs of private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> have led many Mississippians to forego health coverage altogether. This situation has negative consequences not only for the health of parents, but for their family's economic security and well-being. This brief uses results from the Family Resource Simulator to analyze Mississippi's work support policies. It also identifies gaps in parental <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage and recommends policy reforms that could expand coverage among Mississippi's working parents...|$|R

40|$|Among the 19 rich democracies I {{have studied}} {{for the past}} 40 years, the United States is odd-man-out in its health-care spending, organization, and results. The Obama {{administration}} might therefore find lessons from abroad helpful as it moves toward national <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> In the past hundred years, {{with the exception of}} the U. S., the currently rich democracies have all converged in the broad outlines of health care. They all developed central control of budgets with financing from compulsory individual and employer contributions and/or government revenues. All have permitted the insured to supplement government services with additional care, privately purchased. All, including the United States, have rationed health care. All have experienced a growth in doctor density and the ratio of specialists to primary-care personnel. All evidence a trend toward public funding. Our deviance consists of <b>no</b> national <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> a huge private sector, a very high ratio of specialists to primary-care physicians and nurses, and a uniquely expensive (non) system with a poor cost-benefit ratio. The cure: increase the public share to more than 65 % from its present level of 45 %. In regards to funding the transition cost and the permanent cost of guaranteed universal coverage: no rich democracy has funded national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> without relying on mass taxes, especially payroll and consumption taxes. Whatever we do to begin, broad-based taxes will be the outcome. Three explanations of "why <b>no</b> national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> in the U. S. ?" are examined. Political Science...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to organizing universal <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> First, the government divides the entire population into many large groups. Then, the government creates a federal <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system (HealthFed), modeled on the Federal Reserve System, to fill the role now played by the benefits office of a large firm. The HealthFed would create a short menu of alternatives, solicit bids for insuring the entire group, and price alternatives. There would be redistribution between groups and pricing of alternatives to reflect optimal social insurance principles. There would be <b>no</b> connection between <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> and employment. Copyright 1992 by The Econometric Society. ...|$|R
