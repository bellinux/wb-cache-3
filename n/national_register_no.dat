From 1990 to 1991 he attended the National University of Ireland, Galway, where he conducted research for an applied thesis in Ecology. Since 1993, Gian Andrea Pagnoni has worked as an independent researcher conducting environmental assessments and environmental project management (EIA, SEA, impact assessment and ecological networks). In 1998 he received his Ph.D. in Applied Ecology from the University of Parma. In 2001 he co-founded the Istituto Delta di Ecologia Applicata Srl (Delta Institute of Applied Ecology), a spin-off project of the University of Ferrara (<b>National</b> Research <b>Register</b> <b>No.</b> 53172DPY, Quality Management System UNI EN ISO 9001:2008).|$|R

40|$|From June 14 through July 4, 2001, the Center for Archaeological Research of The University of Texas at San Antonio {{conducted}} <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> of Historic Places eligibility {{testing of}} six prehistoric archaeological sites (41 LR 190, 41 LR 194, 41 LR 196, 41 LR 200, 41 LR 258, and 41 LR 259) at Camp Maxey, Lamar County, Texas, under {{contract with the}} Texas Army National Guard. The investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 2180. The Phase II testing fieldwork consisted of the excavation of twelve backhoe trenches and nineteen 1 x 1 -m test units across the sites to investigate significant cultural deposits encountered during the previous survey phase. In concert with the archaeological field investigations, lithic and native ceramic analyses and magnetic sediment susceptibility studies were performed {{to aid in the}} determination of site integrity and eligibility. The synthesis of these analyses has provided adequate data to determine temporal integrity and recommendation of <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> eligibility for site 41 LR 190. Further cultural resources investigations in the form of Phase III data recovery excavations are thus recommended for this site prior to proposed development. Conversely, due to lack of significance criteria, sites 41 LR 194, 41 LR 196, 41 LR 200, 41 LR 258, and 41 LR 259 are recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> and require <b>no</b> further cultural resources investigations...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the cultural resource monitoring {{activities of the}} Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL) Cultural Resource Management (CRM) Office during 2013. Throughout the year, thirty-eight cultural resource localities were revisited including: two locations with Native American human remains, {{one of which is}} also a cave; fourteen additional caves; seven prehistoric archaeological sites; four historic archaeological sites; one historic trail; one nuclear resource (Experimental Breeder Reactor-I, a designated National Historic Landmark); and nine historic structures located at the Central Facilities Area. Of the monitored resources, thirty-three were routinely monitored, and five were monitored to assess project compliance with cultural resource recommendations along with the effects of ongoing project activities. On six occasions, ground disturbing activities within the boundaries of the Power Burst Facility/Critical Infrastructure Test Range Complex (PBF/CITRC) were observed by INL CRM staff prepared to respond to any additional finds of Native American human remains. In addition, two resources were visited more than once as part of the routine monitoring schedule or to monitor for additional damage. Throughout the year, most of the cultural resources monitored had no visual adverse changes resulting in Type 1 determinations. However, Type 2 impacts were noted at eight sites, indicating that although impacts were noted or that a project was operating outside of culturally cleared limitations, cultural resources retained integrity and noted impacts did not threaten <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> eligibility. <b>No</b> new Type 3 or any Type 4 impacts that adversely impacted cultural resources and threatened <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> eligibility were observed at cultural resources monitored in 2013...|$|R
40|$|Prewitt and Associates, Inc., {{completed}} {{an evaluation of}} the western portion of Subarea C at 41 CV 1310 on the Fort Hood Military Reservation in June and July 2007. The work was conducted for the Texas Department of Transportation in conjunction with the proposed Northeast Copperas Cove Bypass in southern Coryell County. Fieldwork included a resurvey of the area and hand excavation of shovel tests and test units. Maximum dimensions of the tested landform, a small segment of Holocene terrace (T) adjacent to 1 House Creek, are 65 x 40 m, or 2, 600 m 2. Excavations yielded only sparse prehistoric cultural remains in questionable depositional context, and the area has no potential to contain an intact and interpretable prehistoric component. It is recommended that this portion of 41 CV 1310 is not eligible for listing in the <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> and warrants <b>no</b> further work...|$|R

40|$|During {{the months}} of October and November, 1990, staff members and volunteers of the Center of Archaeological Research (CAR), The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), {{conducted}} surface survey, mapping, subsurface testing and private collection research at 41 BX 901 and surrounding areas. 41 BX 901 is an extensive prehistoric chert stone quarry in northeastern Bexar county, Texas. The site had been selected for {{construction of a new}} middle school by the Northeast Independent School District (NEISD). Survey and testing research was performed in order to evaluate 41 BX 901 and to locate any additional archaeological remains which might be affected by school construction and operation. Extensive prehistoric archaeological remains were encountered at 41 BX 901. Surface and subsurface testing at the site produced abundant lithic remains which indicate lithic procurement and the initial stages of tool fabrication took place here during prehistoric times. However, time-diagnostic artifacts were not recovered from 41 BX 901. Chronological placement of the site depends upon neighboring, more securely dated sites which, it is proposed in this report, had a functional relationship with 41 BX 901. Although 41 BX 901 {{is one of the most}} impressive quarries yet documented in this region, the site has been largely destroyed by school construction. 41 BX 905, recorded as part of this project and likely a continuation of 41 BX 901 on neighboring property, is well preserved and will be proposed for <b>national</b> <b>register</b> status. <b>No</b> further archaeological research is recommended for 41 BX 901 due to the destruction of the site.
