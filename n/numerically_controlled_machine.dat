50|$|At the {{conclusion}} of APT I, Ross and John Francis Reintjes were interviewed for MIT science reporter television by Robert S. Woodbury. There was considerable public interest in the increasing sophistication of <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machine</b> tools. The interview is illustrative of Ross's long stated belief in the graphics potential of the computer. He showed the audience {{a photograph of a}} vector sweep image from a display scope {{in the form of a}} Disney cartoon character coupled in a coordinate space with a canonical gnomon.|$|E
50|$|In the {{manufacturing}} industry, {{with regard to}} <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machine</b> tools, the phrase machine coordinate system refers to the physical limits of {{the motion of the}} machine in each of its axes, and to the numerical coordinate which is assigned (by the machine tool builder) to each of these limits. CNC Machinery refers to machines and devices that are controlled by using programmed commands which are encoded on to a storage medium, and NC refers to the automation of machine tools that are operated by abstract commands programmed and encoded onto a storage medium.|$|E
5000|$|APT or Automatically Programmed Tool [...] is a {{high-level}} computer programming language {{most commonly used}} to generate instructions for <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machine</b> tools. Douglas T. Ross {{is considered by many}} to be the father of APT: as head of the newly created Computer Applications Group of the Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT in 1956 he led its technical effort. APT is a language and system that makes numerically controlled manufacturing possible. This early language was used widely into the 1970s and is still a standard internationally. Derivatives of APT were later developed.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, American apparel {{manufacturing}} was labor-intensive, completely without automation, and rapidly {{leaving the country}} for cheap foreign labor. Gerber developed a <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machine</b> (the GERBERcutter S-70) for cutting large quantities of tall stacks of cloth accurately—3,500 pieces for 50 men’s suits {{in less than three}} minutes. The GERBERcutter itself, which Gerber introduced in 1969, has been widely cited as the most important technological advance of the century, because it offered apparel factories significant savings in wasted cloth, which was the greatest cost factor in producing a garment, and because it enabled a computer-automated manufacturing system. Total sales of machines for cutting cloth based on Gerber’s patented inventions are in the multiple billions of dollars.> ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Gerber {{introduced}} the first automated machines for drafting. By allowing engineers and designers {{to interact with}} the design process graphically, automated drafting represented a seminal application of computers to enhance creativity. Gerber’s automated drafting technologies enabled the design of complex design products, such as the first [...] "jumbo" [...] military and commercial aircraft, the U.S. Air Force C-5 Transport by Lockheed Martin and the Boeing 747. This technology was credited with integrating the engineering design function with the <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machine</b> tools in the aircraft, automotive, and shipbuilding industries, dramatically improving cost and manufacture time. Gerber’s automated systems would capture three quarters of the automated drafting system market during the following two decades. Gerber also introduced the Automatic Line Follower, the first automated digitizer for vector graphics.|$|E
5000|$|What is it, then, {{that distinguishes}} {{information}} technology from earlier generations of machine technology? As information technology {{is used to}} reproduce, extend, and improve upon the process of substituting machines for human agency, it simultaneously accomplishes something quite different. The devices that automate by translating information into action also register data about those automated activities, thus generating new streams of information. For example, computer-based, <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machine</b> tools or microprocessor-based sensing devices not only apply programmed instructions to equipment but also convert {{the current state of}} equipment, product, or process into data. Scanner devices in supermarkets automate the checkout process and simultaneously generate data {{that can be used for}} inventory control, warehousing, scheduling of deliveries, and market analysis. The same systems that make it possible to automate office transactions also create a vast overview of an organization's operations, with many levels of data coordinated and accessible for a variety of analytical efforts."

5000|$|The LCA is {{constructed}} of aluminium-lithium alloys, carbon-fibre composites (C-FC), and titanium alloy steels. The Tejas employs C-FC materials {{for up to}} 45% of its airframe by weight, including in the fuselage (doors and skins), wings (skin, spars and ribs), elevons, tailfin, rudder, air brakes and landing gear doors. Composite materials are used to make an aircraft both lighter and stronger {{at the same time}} compared to an all-metal design, and the LCA's percentage employment of C-FCs is one of the highest among contemporary aircraft of its class. Apart from making the plane much lighter, there are also fewer joints or rivets, which increases the aircraft's reliability and lowers its susceptibility to structural fatigue cracks. The wing and fin of the compound-delta aircraft are of carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer, and were designed to provide a minimum weight structure and to serve as integral fuel tanks. The tailfin is a monolithic honeycomb structure piece, reducing the manufacturing cost by 80% compared to the [...] "subtractive" [...] or [...] "deductive" [...] method, involving the carving out of a block of titanium alloy by a computerised <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machine.</b> No other manufacturer is known to have made fins out of a single piece.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{relationship}} between technology adoption and performance in U. S. manufacturing plants take the number of technologies in use as a measure of technological sophistication. These studies generally find a positive monotonic relationship between technology counts and employment growth and earnings and productivity levels among otherwise similar plants. However, the technology count approach masks potential differences in performance among plants that adopt the same number, but different combinations, of technologies. The present study advances earlier work by examining how plant performance is associated with specific technology combinations. The analysis yields several important insights. First, there is enormous diversity in technology adoption patterns. Second, specific technology combinations (e. g., computer aided design combined with <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machines</b> vs. computer aided manufacturing combined with <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machines)</b> generally have different degrees of association with plant performance, even among the plants that adopt the same number of technologies.
