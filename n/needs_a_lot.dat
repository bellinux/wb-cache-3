25|$|For {{profitable}} hemp farming, particularly deep, humus-rich, nutrient-rich {{soil with}} controlled water flow is preferable. Waterlogged acidic, compressed or extremely light (sandy) soils primarily affect the early development of plants. Steep and high altitudes {{of more than}} 400m above sea level are best avoided. Hemp is relatively insensitive to cold temperatures and can withstand frost down to −5°C. Seeds can germinate down to 1–3°C. Hemp <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of heat, so earlier varieties come to maturation. The water requirement is 300–500l/kg dry matter. Up to 3 feet growing roots into the soil can also use water supplies from deeper soil layers. Worth noting is that the water requirement of hemp is at least 14 times {{lower than that of}} cotton, which takes between 7,000 and 29,000l/kg, according to WWF.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E

2500|$|An early {{script was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in March 2008, leading to a review by Ain't It Cool News which called it [...] " [...] just a good adaptation of a difficult book [...] a genre-defining piece of work that could well see us all arguing {{about whether or not}} a zombie movie qualifies as 'Best Picture' material". The review also noted the film appears stylistically similar to Children of Men, following Gerry Lane as he travels the post-war world and interviews survivors of the zombie war who are [...] "starting to wonder if survival is a victory of any kind." [...] Straczynski had hoped that the film would begin production by the start of 2009. In March 2009, Forster said that the script was still in development and he was not sure if World War Z would be his next film. Later in March, rumors surfaced that production offices were set up and the film was in early pre-production. In June 2009, Marc Forster told an interviewer that the film would be delayed, stating that the film's script still <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of development and is [...] "still far from realization".|$|E
2500|$|Andreas Hackel, art {{director}} at Candygun Games described {{the inspiration for}} the game's visuals. [...] "I was inspired by games like Team Fortress 2 and classic B-movies of the 1950's", stated Hackel. When asked about the reason for choosing to set it in the 1950s, Hackel replied, [...] "not many games are set in this period and there are a whole slew of very typical and interesting design elements from this time period. Elements like the cars, milk bars, chrome, juke boxes, fashion and hairstyles are all instantly recognisable as coming from the 50's." [...] Hackel commented that Candygun wanted the characters to be [...] "people from the street", and not superheroes. Roger Joswig explained their choice of using Unreal Engine 3 instead of a proprietary technology. [...] "If you're looking to release your game on , Xbox 360 and PC as we were, developing your own engine is a lot more expensive, takes a long time if you start from scratch and <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of QA support – so it wasn't really a feasible option for us as a small, start-up developer". He also noted that the engine is built to run on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows natively and that the team was familiar with the Unreal Engine tools. The in-game music was provided by the band Vampire State Building. The narrator's voice and in-game sound effects were outsourced to Periscope Studios.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} of Google Drive after its launch in April 2012, Dan Grabham of TechRadar wrote that the {{integration}} of Google Docs into Google Drive was [...] "a bit confusing", mainly due to {{the differences in the}} user interfaces (UI) between the two, where Drive offers a [...] "My Drive" [...] section with a specific [...] "Shared with me" [...] view for shared documents. He stated that [...] "We think the user interface <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more work. It's like a retread of Google Docs at the moment and Google surely needs to do work here". He considered uploading files [...] "fairly easy", but noted that folder upload was only supported through the Google Chrome web browser. The lack of native editing of Microsoft Office documents was [...] "annoying". Regarding Google Drive's computer apps, he stated that the option in Settings to synchronize only specific folders was [...] "powerful". He wrote that Drive was [...] "a great addition to Google armoury of apps and everything does work seamlessly", while again criticizing the interface for being [...] "confusing" [...] and that the file view was [...] "not quite intuitive enough" [...] without file icons. Grabham also reviewed the mobile Android app, writing that [...] "it's a pretty simple app that enables you to access your files on the move and save some for offline access should you wish", and praised Google Docs creation and photo uploading for being [...] "easy". He also praised that [...] "everything is easily searchable".|$|E
