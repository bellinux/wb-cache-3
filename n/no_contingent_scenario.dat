40|$|This paper proposes {{contingent}} behavior {{survey questions}} {{as a valuable}} supplement to observed data in travel cost models of non-market demand for recreational resources. A set of observed and contingent behavior results for each survey respondent allows the researcher to control for individual heterogeneity {{by taking advantage of}} panel data methods when exploring the nature of respondent demands. The <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios</b> also provide opportunities to (a) test for differences between observed and contingent preferences and/or (b) assess likely demands under conditionsbeyond the domain of observed variation in costs or resource attributes. Most importantly, <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios</b> allow the researcher to imposeexogenously varying travel costs. Exogenous imposition of travel costs together with panel methods reduces the omitted variables bias that plagues observed-data travel cost models of recreational demand. Using a convenience sample of data for illustrative purposes, we show how to estimate the demand for recreational angling by combining observed and contingent behavior data. We begin with simple naive pooled Poisson models and progress to more theoretically appropriate fixed effects panel Poisson specifications.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Public {{agencies}} need {{information on}} the value of recreational activities to assist in managing fish and wildlife species. Over the past two decades economists have developed and applied techniques to measure the value of such non-marketed commodities. The contingent valuation method (CVM) is one technique used by economists to measure net benefits associated with a change in the quantity or quality of a non-marketed commodity. Unlike other techniques such as the travel cost and hedonic methods, which use market data to infer willingness to pay (WTP), CVM directly elicits willingness to pay or willingness to accept (WTA) information. CVM is used in this thesis to estimate the use value of changes in the quality of the elk hunting experience. The focus of the study is elk hunting on the Starkey Research Forest in eastern Oregon. Since 1988, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) and the U. S. Forest Service have collected data on big game hunting on this area. The Starkey data sets provide unique research opportunities because of the enclosed nature of the Starkey Research Forest (25, 000 acres surrounded by 38 miles of fence) and the duration of the survey effort (10 years). Although the surveys contain questions specific to an analysis by both the contingent valuation and travel cost methods, only the contingent valuation method is considered here. Specific objectives of the thesis research include: (1) derivation of valuation functions for the two dichotomous choice WTP and WTA elicitations, (2) estimation of changes in WTA and WTP for changes in significant explanatory variables, and (3) suggestions for improvements in future Starkey surveys. Valuation functions, as used here, provide increased flexibility over point estimates. The explanatory variables in a valuation function can be changed to obtain estimates of the corresponding changes in WTP and WTA values. The valuation functions can then be used to derive estimates of central tendency for the <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Results include an estimated median value of 113 per hunter for access to hunting and an estimated mean value per trip of 287 per hunter for increases in the elk herd (to ensure an opportunity to shoot at an elk). Additionally, the flexibility of valuation functions is demonstrated by showing how changes in the values of significant (at the. 05 level) explanatory variables affect WTP and WTA values. Four policy and three methodological implications are gleaned from the results. The four policy implications are that: (1) the elk hunting recreational experience is providing substantial benefits to Starkey hunters, (2) willingness to pay values are sensitive to the size of respondents' incomes, (3) respondents are willing to pay more to increase the elk herd {{to the point where they}} would be virtually certain of having an opportunity to shoot at an elk and (4) Starkey hunters object to the tradeoff between their right to hunt and private goods. The three methodological implications are (1) a demonstration of the flexibility of WTP functions, (2) a confirmation of the importance of using specific and unambiguous wording in the <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios,</b> and (3) a confirmation of the importance of pretests to determine the initial ranges and number of bids in dichotomous choice surveys. Two problems with the current surveys are the loss of efficiency due to the low number and narrow range of bids and the lack of specificity and ambiguous wording used in some of the <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Suggestions include increases in the number and range of the bids, the inclusion of an additional question and the inclusion of a "not for sale" category...|$|R

The study based on the travel cost method, for its part, was based on low-quality census data rather than on data from surveys of visitors, as well as being based on unrealistic hypotheses regarding the calculation of transport costs, the number of visitors with a single destination, and the levels of surplus consumption of international visitors. The two studies based on the hedonic valuation method were affected by the existence of heterogeneous neighbouring market segments and their inability to obtain reliable ownership values.

The manufacturer and subcontractor decide separately on their capacity investment levels. Then demand uncertainty is resolved and both parties {{have the option to}} subcontract when deciding on their production and sales. We analyze and present outsourcing conditions for three contract types: (1) price-only contracts where an ex-ante transfer price is set for each unit supplied by the subcontractor; (2) incomplete contracts, where both parties negotiate over the subcontracting transfer; and (3) state-dependent price-only and incomplete contracts for which we show an equivalence result. While subcontracting with these three contract types can coordinate production decisions in the supply system, only state-dependent contracts can eliminate all decentralization costs and coordinate capacity investment decisions. The minimally sufficient price-only contract that coordinates our supply chain specifies transfer prices for a small number (6 in our model) of <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Our game-theoretic model allows the analysis of the role of transfer prices and of the bargaining power of buyer and supplier. We find that sometimes firms may be better off leaving some contract parameters unspecified ex-ante and agreeing to negotiate ex-post. Also, a price-focused strategy for managing subcontractors can backfire because a lower transfer price may decrease the manufacturer’s profit. Finally, as with financial options, the option value of subcontracting increases as markets are more volatile or more negatively correlated...|$|R

This study was motivated {{by the lack of}} insight in iconic value in the appraisal of infrastructure projects aspiring to become iconic artifacts in Cost-Benefit Analysis. We designed a contingent valuation experiment, with two <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios</b> and two respondent samples. One sample representing the inhabitants of the city of Rotterdam and one sample representing the inhabitants of the Netherlands excluding the inhabitants of Rotterdam. For both respondent samples significant (from zero) WTP estimates were found. Furthermore, people who virtually never use the Erasmus Bridge for transportation goals, or even see the Erasmus Bridge still have a WTP for the iconic value of the Erasmus Bridge. Allowing for uncertainties we estimated a lower bound and an upper bound for the total WTP for the iconic value of the Erasmus Bridge for inhabitants of the Netherlands. Regardless if we choose the lower bound (69. 7 million euros) or the upper bound (95. 7 million euros) the iconic value of the Erasmus Bridge is higher than the extra costs made in reality to build the Erasmus Bridge instead of a more conservative design (18 million euros). Hence, it can be concluded that the iconic value of infrastructure projects can be substantial, at least {{in the case of the}} Erasmus Bridge.

40|$|Abstract. There are {{well-known}} quasi-formal {{arguments that}} identity is a “strict” relation {{in at least}} the following three senses: (1) There is a single identity relation and a single distinctness relation; (2) There are <b>no</b> <b>contingent</b> cases of identity or distinctness; and (3) There are no vague or indeterminate cases of identity or distinctness. However, the situation is less clear cut than it at first may appear. There is a natural formal theory of identity that {{is very close to}} the standard classical theory but which does not validate the formal analogues of (1) –(3). The core idea is simple: We weaken the Principle of the Indiscernibility of Identicals from a conditional to an entailment and we adopt a weakly classical logic. This paper investigates this weakly classical theory of identity (and related theories) and discusses its philosophical ramifications. It argues that we can accept a reasonable theory of identity without committing ourselves to the uniqueness, necessity, or determinacy of identity. § 1. Introduction. The identity relation seems to be very straightforward. If asked to characterize this relation, we might respond with a near triviality – for example, “everything is identical to itself and to nothing else”. ...|$|R

There is considerable discussion about New Zealand’s clean green image, but relatively little solid information about its value. This was clear from an earlier study which the Ministry commissioned through the Sustainable Management Fund, Green Market Signals, published in 1999. The current study is, in part, a response to the suggestions received from industry groups and others at that time. The aim of this current study is to quantify the extent to which particular New Zealand exports benefit from positive perceptions about our environment. The project focuses on three export sectors: dairy, inbound tourism, and organic produce. It assesses the potential consumer reaction to an illustrative decline in New Zealand’s cleanness and greenness. The empirical work done in this study reinforces the qualitative evidence that our clean green image is valuable, and provides some useful insights into the size and nature of that value.

Explorations of the salience of the contingency task, however, produced findings apparently contrary to the predictions of the PMIR model, so the present study aimed to replicate this experiment but monitor subjective judgements of task pleasantness to ascertain whether the contingent tasks were valid.

Marisol utilized the spontaneous gesture of expression within Action painting along with the cool and collected artistic intent of Pop art. Marisol’s sculptures questioned the authenticity of the constructed self, suggesting it was instead contrived from representational parts. Art was used not as a platform of personal expression, but as an opportunity to expose the self as an imagined creation. By juxtaposing different signifiers of femininity, Marisol explained the way in which ‘femininity’ is culturally produced. But, by incorporating casts of her own hands and expressional strokes in her work, Marisol combined symbols of the ‘artist’ identity celebrated throughout art history. This approach destabilized the idea of artistic virtue as a rhetorical construct of masculine logic. Therefore, “Collapsing the distance between the role of woman and that of artist by treating the signs of artistic masculinity as <b>no</b> less <b>contingent,</b> <b>no</b> less the product of representation, than are the signs of femininity.” Marisol exposed the merit of an artist as a fictional identity that must be enacted through the repetition of representational parts.|$|R

Across two experiments, a reliable pattern of sequential effects was found in the absence of contingencies, whereby the most notable feature was that participants were fastest to respond to subsequences where the target moved in a consistent direction on consecutive trials, compared to when the target direction alternated. In Experiment 2, the direction of motion was biased to move in one direction 75 % of the time and in a subsequent transfer phase, participants showed evidence of learning this probabilistic sequence but still exhibited the same pattern of sequential effects on trials where the target moved in the more prevalent or less prevalent direction. Simulations with a connectionist model of sequence learning (the Augmented Serial Recurrent Network, Cleeremans & McClelland, 1991) produced an adequate replication of the sequential effects in both experiments in addition to an effect of sequence learning in Experiment 2.

40|$|This thesis {{sought to}} {{estimate}} the economic value of selected Sydney beaches, {{in order to provide}} the necessary information to allow local and State government agencies to identify the most appropriate management response to projected climate change impacts. Three case-study sites (Collaroy-Narrabeen, Manly Ocean Beach, and a combined site in the Hawkesbury River that included the Brooklyn Baths and Dangar Island) were selected via a weighted-criteria method using an expert panel. Valuation methods were selected in response to the key coastal management challenges in the region, vulnerability to inundation and shoreline recession. A truncated negative binomial travel cost model identified consumer surplus values of between AUD$ 2. 72 and $ 20. 63 for a beach day, depending on the site under investigation and the specification of the cost parameter. These are similar to those in the published literature. Aggregate values are derived only for comparison with costs of management options, due to concerns about the quality of visitation information. These comparisons suggest a strong economic argument for beach nourishment at the case-study beaches. The Contingent Valuation (CV) method was employed {{to estimate the}} willingness to pay (WTP) of beach visitors for prevention of climate change erosion at the case-study beaches. Screening and follow-up questions were employed to identify the influence of scenario rejection on WTP responses and values. Binary probit analysis of non-protest responses resulted in average WTP of AUD$ 116. 27 ± 69. 63 as a one-time donation. Comparison with previous studies is not possible due to difference in <b>contingent</b> <b>scenarios</b> and payment vehicles. The Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) was employed to identify price premiums for beachfront property in Collaroy-Narrabeen. Significant variation in beachfront price premiums is explained by the variation in erosion risk information linked to property titles. &# 145;Risk-free&# 146; beachfront properties were subject to price premiums around 264 %, relative to an average property in the sample. Properties in the central portion of the beach, which is subject to greater exposure to erosion, were subject to much lower premiums, in the order of 130 %. These figures are substantially higher than those in the published literature, which {{is a function of the}} exclusivity of the Sydney beachfront property market...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{planning}} in partially observable environments {{can be regarded}} as a search problem in belief space where be-liefs express the collection of states that are deemed possible. In this paper we address the problem that arises when one of the possible states is a dead-end: a state from which the goal cannot be reached. In such situations, <b>no</b> <b>contingent</b> plan ex-ists, and yet, such situations are common when planning with incomplete information. For example, if a robot has to move to a target while sensing if adjacent cells are free or not, and the map is not known, the (hidden) state where the target is to-tally blocked by occupied cells is possible and is a dead end. Of course, the robot shouldn’t get paralysed in such cases; it should move toward the target and give up only when one such state is not only possible but certain. However, contin-gent planning doesn’t help in obtaining such behavior, and neither does the introduction of probabilities. A belief state where a dead-end state is possible is itself a dead-end, and both its worst case cost and its expected cost are infinite. One option in such cases is to find contingent plans or policies that maximize ’coverage’, i. e. the set of possible states for which the solution works. This is the approach that we take in this paper, where we extend a recent action-selection mechanism for contingent planning, that uses a translation into classical planning, to work in such settings. We show that such scenar-ios are common and that the proposed mechanism has other applications as well. In particular, {{it can be used to}} deal with dead-end beliefs that do not contain dead-end states, and to generate meaningful, goal-oriented behavior in solvable but complex contingent settings where state-of-the-art contingent planners fail...|$|R

I {{have been asked to}} make some reflections regarding risk and its relationship with poverty. I will start by discussing poverty and risk at a general level using the conceptual framework of the recently developed dynamic contract theory. Then, I will argue that this conceptual framework provides an excellent tool to design and evaluate social insurance schemes. I will illustrate this point with the particular problem of unemployment insurance design, a problem I have been working in for the last several years. Consider two alternative two-peri d models useful to think about equilibrium income distributions and the relationship between efficiency and ex-post re-distributions. The first one is a model with different preferences over leisure. Thus, those with a lower marginal utility of leisure will work harder, and in equilibrium will have higher income and consumption. In this deterministic world, the solution to a Pareto problem with the competitive equilibrium weights does not require any ex-post redistribution 2. This is hardly surprising, since the first welfare theorem applies. The second one is a model with identical preferences and endowment shocks realized in the second period. If there are <b>no</b> <b>contingent</b> markets, the equilibrium will also be characterized by a non-degenerated distribution of income and consumption. In this case, as the first welfare theorem does not hold, there are efficient ex-post re-distributions. This is the case even considering the Pareto weights that replicate the competitive equilibrium. In fact, efficient ex-post re-distributions are the ones that make the variance of consumption equal to zero. 1 DO NOT QUOTE.

[...] The scenario itself may be punctuated by smaller rounds, in which teams may need to complete a simple objective such as holding a location while another team attacks.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{economic}} {{assessment of the}} loss of non-use values resulting from different oil spill scenarios along the Belgian Coast. Estimation results show that if no oil spill prevention policy action is undertaken, a significant welfare loss may result. As a matter of fact, contingent valuation estimation results show such a welfare loss ranges from 120 million Euro to 606 million Euro, depending on the size and the frequency of the oil spill under consideration. Therefore, any investment program targeted at the prevention of oil spills, and its damage on the marine environment, can be clearly defended from a cost-benefit perspective as long as its cost is no higher than 120 million Euro.

40|$|Farmers’ {{willingness}} to voluntarily reduce insecticide use {{is not considered}} when regulatory approaches to environmental protection are proposed. Regulations that require behavior that would voluntarily be undertaken are excessive and economically inefficient. Using survey data from a <b>contingent</b> valuation <b>scenario,</b> we demonstrate the willingness of crop producers in four Midwestern states in the U. S. to trade yield losses for environmental risk reduction by eliminating an insecticide application. The mean acceptable yield loss for a sample of 1, 138 producers in Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and Ohio is $ 8. 25 per acre. Acceptable yield loss increases with the rated importance of environmental goods (fish, birds, mammals, native plants and endangered species), with formal education and with farming experience. Willingness to pay increase with total expenditure on herbicides and insecticides up to $ 89 per acre, then decreases as total expenditure continues to rise. We approximate that crop farmers in the four states {{are willing to give}} up over $ 420 million in yield loss, or about 4 percent of total sales of corn and soybeans, to guarantee protection of eleven environmental goods from moderate insecticide risk. Uncertainty about risks, dominance of regulatory approaches and economic pressures undercut voluntary reductions in insecticide use...|$|R
