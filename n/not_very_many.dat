5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>many,</b> but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>many,</b> and I think we got it right.|$|E
500|$|One {{deficiency}} {{of the classical}} derivative is that <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>many</b> functions are differentiable. Nevertheless, {{there is a way}} of extending the notion of the derivative so that all continuous functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the weak derivative. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of distributions and only require that a function is differentiable [...] "on average".|$|E

And if the NFL is there for me, then I hope that I'll get to keep playing, because I love to play this game. Hopefully, it will work out." ...|$|E
500|$|After a 49–9 {{victory over}} Texas A on November 27, 2008, McCoy {{said that he}} still {{intended}} {{to come back for}} his senior year, but that it would be [...] "foolish" [...] for him not to ask the NFL to evaluate his draft prospects. McCoy said that if he were rated a first- or second-round draft pick, he might change his mind about staying. McCoy said, [...] "But at the same time, I want to play four years here. <b>Not</b> <b>very</b> <b>many</b> people {{have had the opportunity to}} do that.

I had recently gotten married, and I wanted to wear it." [...] He later described the situation as [...] "so Mulder to never have mentioned that he was married". Series creator Chris Carter later told Duchovny that the situation [...] "creates a problem. If we ever do a show that takes place seven years ago, you'll have to be married." [...] However, Duchovny reassured Carter {{by pointing out that}} there were <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>many</b> episodes, if any, that had been planned to take place seven years prior to the events in this episode. The inclusion of the detail caused an [...] "Internet frenzy" [...] and the minor detail was never resolved on screen.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture, {{once the}} {{foremost}} sector in Kreimbach-Kaulbach’s economy, nowadays plays only a subordinate role. One important industrial operation is the Palatia malthouse, which despite its importance does <b>not</b> employ <b>very</b> <b>many</b> people. Still {{important is the}} quarry, taken over in 1925 by the Rammelsbach quarrying operations, although likewise this does <b>not</b> employ <b>very</b> <b>many</b> people owing to rationalization and automation. Moreover, {{a time when the}} yield will no longer be commercially worthwhile can already be foreseen. Businesses in the village itself include two electrical installation companies, one transport company, two grocery shops, a bakery and a window installation company.

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>many</b> of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2010, {{the church}} {{announced}} that it would buy the campus outright from the city of Houston for $7.5 million, terminating the lease after 7 years. Marty Aaron, a real estate appraiser, said that while an [...] "untrained eye" [...] would [...] "wonder how Lakewood Church purchased the Compaq Center for $7.5 million, when this is not really an arms-length sale from the city to Lakewood Church." [...] Aaron explained that the church [...] "put a phenomenal amount of money into the facility after the lease was initially structured, and it's really not fair that someone else would get the benefit of that." [...] Aaron added that converting the property to a stadium-oriented facility [...] "would probably cost as much or more than it took {{to turn it into a}} church, and right now there are probably <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>many</b> organizations that would be willing to step forward and do that." [...] The Houston City Council was scheduled to vote on the matter on Wednesday March 24, 2010. City council delayed the vote. On March 30 of that year, Ronald Green, the city's chief financial officer, said that he approved of the sale of the building. On March 31, 2010 the Houston City Council voted 13–2 to sell the property to Lakewood.|$|E
