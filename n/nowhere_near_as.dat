However more runners-up medals came from the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. After Bremner scored the only goal of the semi-final clash with Wolves, Leeds went on to lose the FA Cup final 1–0 to Second Division Sunderland. They were then beaten 1–0 by Italian side A.C. Milan at the Kaftanzoglio Stadium in the European Cup Winners' Cup Final, though Bremner missed the final due to suspension.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park is {{dominated}} by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers of the last ice age. These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12,000 years. Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park {{in the form of}} U-shaped valleys, cirques, arêtes, and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers {{from the base of the}} highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, various warming and cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the Little Ice Age, which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850. During the Little Ice Age, the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced, although to <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> great an extent as they had during the Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|On 11–12 August 2012, the Saturday and Sunday {{prior to}} {{the launch of the}} second series of Red or Black?, ITV {{suffered}} the worst weekend in its 57-year history due to BBC One's coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics; it was beaten to second place in the primetime league tables by BBC Three {{for the first time ever}} and the only ITV programme on 11 August that was one of the channel's 30 most watched in the week 6–12 August 2012 was the ITV News at Ten. The Olympics closing ceremony the following night gave BBC One more than 20 times the audience share of ITV.

In the wake of grunge and gangsta rap came a fusion of soul and hip hop, called neo soul, some popularity for British Britpop {{and the rise of}} bands like Sublime and No Doubt, playing a form of pop punk influenced by Jamaican ska and British two tone ska/punk fusionists from the early 1980s.

5|$|Due to {{the high}} regard held for {{dominion}} troops {{as a result of}} their exploits in France during the war they were specifically targeted for recruitment. Indeed, some 400 to 500 men of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF)—who were in England awaiting repatriation to Australia following the end of the war—initially indicated a willingness to join, but <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> many actually enlisted. All Australians who volunteered were discharged from the AIF and re-enlisted in the British army as private soldiers for a period of one year. This was necessary because the dominions had already indicated that they were not interested in providing forces for the intervention. Ultimately about 150 Australians enlisted to serve in the NRRF, most of them recruited by Major Harry Harcourt. The Australians mainly served in the 45th Battalion and the 201st Machine Gun Battalion under Sadlier-Jackson, although some may also have served in the 46th Battalion. Despite being enlisted in the British Army the Australians wore uniforms of the AIF and were formed into two mainly Australian companies in the 45th Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E

About her voice, the critic said: [...] "Ryan’s vocals are <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> spectacular, <b>as</b> she sings “woah, oh” in a register that she clearly can’t reach.

Maher {{also said that}} the composition is confusing, because the song talks about [...] "ended right", but the performers seem sad and regretful. The critic concludes commenting: [...] "The beat also falls short, with a generic melody that reminds us of a cheesy lovesick late ’90s song with some synth thrown in there for good measure. Overall, we aren’t really digging this tune. Maybe next time, Deb!".|$|R

50|$|For {{the better}} part of 11 years Wonder was an active and bustling mining town, but the veins in the mines did not go on indefinitely, and by 1919 they had played out, and the town began to slowly slide into obscurity.

Over the last decade we have also seen an increase in investment in ECCD, including larger-scale projects, such as the World Bank lending of over $ 1. 2 billion for ECCD projects.

To those of us working within ECCD the arguments are irrefutable. ECCD is an investment that offers outstanding returns—both in human and financial terms.

The fourth ball was of fuller length, way outside the off-stump, and I put my left leg right across and prepared to push it firmly away into the covers. I am sure I went through all the motions correctly, but again missed the ball - which, this time, did not miss my leg-stump.|$|R

The foot is held onto the board with two buckle straps – one strapped {{across the top of}} the toe area, and one across the ankle area. They can be tightly ratcheted closed for a tight fit and good rider control of the board. Straps are typically padded to more evenly distribute pressure across the foot. While <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> popular as two-strap bindings, some people prefer three-strap bindings for more specialized riding such as carving. The third strap tends to provide additional stiffness to the binding.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale {{reactors}} using neutronic fuels (e.g. ITER) {{and thermal}} power production (turbine based) are most comparable to fission power from an engineering and economics viewpoint.

The main distinction is that fusion power produces no high-level radioactive waste (though activated station materials {{still need to be}} disposed of).

As long as {{the vast majority of people}} are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called herd immunity. Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan). However, the difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.|$|E
