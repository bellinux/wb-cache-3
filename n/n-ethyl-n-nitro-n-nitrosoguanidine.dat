40|$|Abstract: Mutagenic {{effectiveness}} and efficiency of-rays, EMS, NG and their combinations were studied in grasspea, cv. Dhenkanal Local. NG was 40 times effective than EMS and 1000 times effective than-rays. Combination treatments were exceptionally {{more effective than}} single treatments. All the M 1 parameters except seedling root growth showed varied response with doses and mutagens used. Hence, root length {{can serve as a}} reliable criterion for estimation of mutagen efficiency at even seedling stage. Among mutagens, NG was more efficient and EMS and-ray were more or less equiefficient, Key words:Mutagenic {{effectiveness and}} efficiency Gamma-rays Ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS) <b>N-ethyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine</b> (NG) Lathyrus sativus L. INTRODUCTION effective mutagen {{may not be the most}} efficient. In other words, different mutagens can induce same Despite high protein content (21. 8 - 40 %) and high frequency of mutation per unit dose (equieffective), abiotic stress resistance, Lathyrus sativus L. is still but they may differ in the production of undesirable remains slow runner in productivity owing to undersirable changes. The present pursuit, therefore, aimed t...|$|E
