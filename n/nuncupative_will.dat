25|$|Much of Paston's {{time from}} the mid-1450s had in fact been taken up by his {{position}} as adviser to his wife's kinsman, 'the ageing, wealthy, and childless Sir John Fastolf'. In 1456 he was appointed one of the feoffees of Fastolf's lands. In June 1459 Fastolf made a will which provided that his ten executors found a college in Caister. However, after Fastolf died on 5 November 1459, Paston claimed that on 3 November Fastolf had made a <b>nuncupative</b> <b>will</b> giving Paston exclusive authority over {{the foundation of the}} college, and providing that, after payment of 4000 marks, Paston was to have all Fastolf's lands in Norfolk and Suffolk.

25|$|Burley made a <b>nuncupative</b> <b>will</b> in October 1415, which {{suggests}} {{that he was very}} ill by this time, although he declared that his mind and memory were still intact. The contents were not greatly illuminating. After commending his soul to his Omnipotent Creator, he simply confirmed that his real property should go to his legal heirs. He had presumably made all the necessary arrangements for tax avoidance and a smooth succession well before. He left the disposition of his moveable property to his executors, whom he named as Richard Lacon and Roger Corbet. The will was proved on 18 February 1416, so he must have been dead for some time by that date.|$|E
25|$|Paston's {{claim to}} the Fastolf lands was {{challenged}} by the Duke of Norfolk, who seized Caister in 1461; by Sir William Yelverton and Gilbert Debenham, who claimed the manors of Cotton in Suffolk and Caldecott Hall near Fritton; by John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, who claimed two Norfolk manors, Hellesdon and Drayton, in 1465; and by Lord Scales, who in January 1466 forced officials {{of the city of}} Norwich to seize Paston's property there in the king's name, alleging that Paston was a 'serf of the crown'. In 1464 a legal challenge to Paston's executorship under the <b>nuncupative</b> <b>will</b> was mounted by William Yelverton, one of the ten executors who had been appointed under Sir John Fastolf's written will; however the case was still undecided at the time of Paston's death.|$|E
5000|$|A {{minority}} of U.S. states (approximately 20 as of 2009), permit <b>nuncupative</b> <b>wills</b> under certain circumstances. Under most statutes, such wills {{can only be}} made during a person's [...] "last sickness," [...] must be witnessed by at least three persons, and reduced to writing by the witnesses within a specified amount of time after the testator's death. Some states also place limits on the types and value of property that can be bequeathed in this manner. A few U.S. states permit <b>nuncupative</b> <b>wills</b> made by military personnel on active duty. Under the law in England and Wales oral wills are permitted to military personnel and merchant seamen on duty (see law report below) and it is common practice for in Commonwealth countries.|$|R
50|$|Some jurisdictions {{recognize}} a holographic will, made out {{entirely in the}} testator's own hand, or in some modern formulations, with material provisions in the testator's hand. The distinctive feature of a holographic will is less that it is handwritten by the testator and often that it need not be witnessed. In Louisiana this type of testament is called an Olographic or Mystic will. It must be entirely written, dated, and signed in the handwriting of the testator. Although the date may appear anywhere in the testament, the testator must sign the testament {{at the end of}} the testament. Any additions or corrections must also be entirely hand written to have effect. In England, the formalities of wills are relaxed for soldiers who express their wishes on active service; any such will is known as a serviceman's will. A minority of jurisdictions even recognize the validity of <b>nuncupative</b> <b>wills</b> (oral wills), particularly for military personnel or merchant sailors. However, there are often constraints on the disposition of property if such an oral will is used.|$|R
50|$|So {{much of this}} Act {{as related}} to devises or bequests of lands or tenements, or to the {{revocation}} or alteration of any devise in writing of any lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any clause thereof, or to the devise of any estate pur autre vie, or to any such estate being assets, or to <b>nuncupative</b> <b>wills,</b> or to the repeal, altering or changing of any will in writing concerning any goods or chattels or personal estate, or any clause, devise, or bequest therein was repealed by section 2 of the Wills Act 1837 (1 Vict c 26). The marginal note to that section said {{that the effect of}} this was to repeal sections 5 and 6 and 12 and 19 to 22. Legislation.gov.uk has this as sections 18 to 21 instead of 19 to 22.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Denham took a {{store in}} Water-street, where we open'd our goods; I {{attended}} the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in a little time, expert at selling.

I suffered a good deal, gave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I found myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now, some time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again. I forget what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and at length carried him off. He left me a small legacy in a <b>nuncupative</b> <b>will,</b> as a token of his kindness for me, and he left me once more to the wide world; for the store was taken into the care of his executors, and my employment under him ended.|$|E

My brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my return to my business; and Keimer tempted me with an offer of large wages by the year, to come and take the management of his printing-house, that he might better attend to his stationer's shop. I had heard a bad character of him in London from his wife and her friends, and was not for having any more to do with him. I wished for employment as a merchant's clerk, but not meeting with any, I closed again with Keimer. I found in his house these hands: Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pennsylvanian, thirty years of age, bred to country work; he was honest, sensible, a man of experience, and fond of reading, but addicted to drinking. Stephen Potts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon natural parts, and great wit and humour, but a little idle. These he had agreed with at extreme low wages per week, to be raised a shilling every three months as they should deserve by improving in their business; and the expectation of these high wages to come on hereafter was what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was to work at press, Potts at bookbinding, which he, by agreement, was to teach them, though he knew neither one nor the other. John Savage, an Irishman, brought up to no business, whose service for four years Keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship; he too was to be made a pressman. George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose time for four years he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor (of whom more presently), and David Harry, a country boy, whom he had taken apprentice.|$|E
50|$|Beneficiaries {{and their}} blood {{relations}} {{to the fourth}} degree may not be witnesses. <b>Nuncupative</b> <b>wills</b> are not recognized. Soldiers' and sailors' wills are subject to special rules as in most other countries. Full freedom of testation only exists when the testator has no ascendants or descendants, otherwise the disposable portion of his estate is constrained {{by the rules of}} forced heirship: if the testator has one child he may only dispose of half his estate, if two only one-third, if three or more only one-fourth; if he has no descendants but ascendants in both lines he may dispose of half, if ascendants in one line only he may dispose of three-fourths. The full age of testamentary capacity is 21 years, but minors over the age of 16 may dispose by will of half of the estate of which they could dispose had they been of full age. There is no restriction against married women making wills. Will substitutes such as will contracts or a pactum successorium (aka contract concerning succession) are invalid (art. 791 FrCC).|$|R
50|$|At his death, Fastolf {{left his}} affairs in disorder. As was {{customary}} in his time, he left {{many of his}} estates in Norfolk and Suffolk to feoffees including Sir William Yelverton, John Paston and his brother William, retaining the revenues for himself. His written will tasked his ten executors with founding a college at Caister. However, two days before his death, according to John Paston, Fastolf made a <b>nuncupative</b> (spoken) <b>will</b> in which he bequeathed all his lands in Norfolk and Suffolk to Paston, for a payment of 4000 marks and the duty of founding the college at Caister.|$|R
5000|$|William's date {{of birth}} is not known, though it was likely in Picquigny, Picardy, now in the Somme department, France, in the mid 11th Century. William {{inherited}} many lands in central England that had been granted to his father, Ansculf de Picquigny by William the Conqueror after the Norman conquest in 1066. William made his base at the castle built by his father in Dudley, Worcestershire. [...] He and his successors were overlords of the manors of Selly Oak and Birmingham both of which had previously been owned by Wulfwin. His ownership of Selly Oak was challenged by the Bishop of Lichfield using a <b>nuncupative</b> (oral) <b>will</b> made by Wulfwin as evidence. It would appear that William Fitz-Ansculf died during the First Crusade. Henry of Huntingdon in his âHistory of the English Peopleâ writes that: âThen {{from the middle of}} February they besieged the castle of âArqah, for almost three months. Easter was celebrated there (10 April). But Anselm of Ribemont, a very brave knight, died there, struck by a stone, and William of Picardy, and many others.â.|$|R
50|$|An oral will (or <b>nuncupative</b> <b>will)</b> is a {{will that}} has been {{delivered}} orally (that is, in speech) to witnesses, {{as opposed to the}} usual form of wills, which is written and according to a proper format.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{entries in}} Domesday Book for Selly Oak (Escelie). The first entry for Selly Oak records a <b>nuncupative</b> (oral) <b>will</b> and {{is out of}} {{conventional}} order. Wulfwin had leased the manor for the term of three lives and the newly appointed Bishop of Lichfield, Robert de Limesey, used the will to challenge {{the loss of his}} land. [...] "Wulfwin bought this manor before 1066 from the Bishop of Chester, for the lives of three men. When he was ailing and had {{come to the end of}} his life, he summoned his son, the Bishop of Li (chfield?), his wife and many of his friends and said: âHear me, my friends, I desire that my wife hold this land which I bought from the church so long as she lives, and that after her death the church from which I received it should accept it back. Let whoever shall take it away from it be excommunicatedâ. The more important men of the whole County testify that this was so." [...] The first entry records Bartley Green as an outlier, or dependency of Selly Oak, while the second entry doesnât include Bartley Green but records Selly Oak is held as two manors.The second entry also shows that Wibert had been replaced as sub-tenant by Robert suggesting the challenge may have been partially successful. The Bishop of Chester owned Lichfield and its members. These include Harborne, in Staffordshire until 1891, which was held by Robert.|$|R
50|$|In the 21st century, {{eighteen}} is {{the typical}} age of testamentary capacity. Full liberty of disposition is not universal. In particular, many states normally grant spouses {{the right to}} {{at least half the}} estate regardless of what the will says (or if no will can be found). Some require that children cannot be disinherited without good cause. In many case, children omitted in a will may still take their share. Louisiana followed French law, by which the testator can under no circumstances alienate by will more than half his property if he leave issue or ascendants. In 1911, the husband's consent was sometimes required for a married woman's will to be valid, but this is no longer the case. <b>Nuncupative</b> and holographic <b>wills</b> are valid in some states, but are forbidden in others. The former are confined to personality and must generally be reduced to writing within a short time after the words are spoken. In Louisiana the mystic or sealed will still existed in 1911. The number of witnesses necessary for the validity of a will of any kind is usually two. Vermont, the last state to require three witnesses, changed its law in 2006. To be valid, witnesses must not be heirs under the will. In 1911, wills of soldiers and sailors were privileged, as in England.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} wills of {{personalty}} was considerably different, {{but to some}} extent followed parallel lines. In both cases partial preceded complete power of disposition. The general opinion of the best authorities is that by the common law of England a man could only dispose of his whole personal property if he left no wife or children; if he left either wife or children he could only dispose of one-half, and one-third if he left both wife and children. The shares of wife and children were called their pars rationabilis. This pars rationabilis is expressly recognized in Magna Carta and was sued for by the writ de rationabili parte. At what period the right of disposition of the whole personalty superseded the old law is uncertain. That it did so is certain, and {{the places where the}} old rule still existedâthe province of York, Wales and the City of Londonâwere regarded as exceptions. The right of bequest in these places was not assimilated to the general law until comparatively recent times by Acts passed between 1693 and 1726. A will of personalty could be made by a male at fourteen, by a female at twelve. The formalities in the case of wills of personalty were not as numerous {{as in the case of}} wills of land. Up to 1838 a <b>nuncupative</b> or oral <b>will</b> was sufficient, subject, where the gift was of Â£30 or more, to the restrictions contained in the Statute of Frauds. The witnesses to a written will need not be [...] "credible," [...] and it was specially enacted by an Act of 1705 that any one who could give evidence in a court of law was a good witness to a will of personalty. A will entirely in the testator's handwriting, called a holographic will, was valid without signature. At one time the executor was entitled to the residue in default of a residuary legatee, but the Executors Act 1830 made him in such an event trustee for the next of kin.|$|R
50|$|He left a <b>nuncupative</b> <b>will,</b> dated 14 April 1632, {{by which}} he bequeathed to the library of Sion College all his {{mathematical}} books, astronomical instruments, notes, maps, and a brass clock. Among these books were some manuscripts: Congestor: Opus Mathematicum, Philosophia, Atomorum Atopia demonstrata, Corrector Analyticus Artis posthunc. Administration of the will was granted on 6 January 1633 to his sister, Susanna Tasker.|$|E
50|$|Campion made a <b>nuncupative</b> <b>will</b> on 1 March 1619/20 before 'divers {{credible}} witnesses': {{a memorandum}} {{was made that}} he did 'not longe before his death say that he did give all that he had unto Mr Phillip Rosseter, and wished that his estate had bin farre more', and Rosseter was sworn before Dr Edmund Pope to administer as principal legatee on 3 March 1619/20.|$|E
50|$|In July 1597 William Underhill was {{poisoned}} at Fillongley near Coventry, and on 6 July made a <b>nuncupative</b> <b>will,</b> naming as executors George Shirley and Thomas Shirley of Staunton Harold, Leicestershire.

50|$|Sections 18 through 20 provide {{rules for}} nuncupative (oral) wills for {{personal}} estates valued at over 30 pounds {{may be only}} made during the last illness of a testator.
