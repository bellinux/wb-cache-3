40|$|This paper investigates {{bilateral}} trade in banking services within the European Union. The {{attention has been}} addressed to two main issues. First, to test the bank’s motivations for setting up the different forms of overseas offices, and secondly, to assess the importance of barriers to entry across national European banking systems. Empirical results confirm the existence of different motivations for establishing representative offices, branches and subsidiaries in foreign locations. In addition, evidence has been achieved {{about the importance of}} <b>non-regulatory</b> <b>barriers</b> that could make difficult the existence of a single European market for banking services. Key words: cross-border banking, barriers to entry and form of representation. JEL: G 21...|$|E
40|$|The {{space heating}} by {{district}} heating infrastructures in Italy has steadily increased on average by about 16 Mm 3 /y {{over the last}} 7 years, with respect to about 8 Mm 3 /y in the previous 14 years, reaching more than 260 Mm 3 {{by the end of}} 2011. The main energy source used to feed the systems is the natural gas, though the renewable energy sources (mainly heat recovery from Waste-to-Energy and biomasses) are significantly growing. The geothermal resources are still marginal, but positive news is expected from a few new projects in Grado, Ferrara and Pomarance. Though there is a large potential for DHC in several northern Italy cities and towns, the main reason why it did not take off yet is mainly related to the high investment required to realize the distribution networks and to the lack of appropriate regulatory schemes and energy policies. The new Italian National Energy Strategy has identified priorities, actions and specific measures to save primary energy by energy efficiency and sustainable use of energy resources.

40|$|Space {{heating by}} {{district}} heating (DH) infrastructures serve more than 100 cities in Italy, since 2010. It has steadily increased on average by about 16 Mm 3 /a {{in the last}} 7 years, with respect to about 8 Mm 3 /a in the previous 14 years; {{at the end of}} 2012 it was about 280 Mm 3. The main energy source used to feed the systems is natural gas, though the renewable energy sources (mainly heat recovery from Waste-to-Energy and biomasses) are significantly growing. The geothermal resources are still marginal, but positive news are coming from a few new projects in Grado (Gorizia), Ferrara and Tuscany. Though there is a large potential for district heating and cooling (DHC) in several northern Italy cities and towns, the main reason why it did not take off yet is mainly because of the high investment required to realize the distribution networks and {{because of the lack of}} appropriate regulatory schemes and energy policies.
