This report focuses on the 3, 968 patients who received a NT of known size. Preoperative, surgical procedure and outcome data were analyzed according to NT size, dividing patients into two groups, namely small-bore (SB; nephrostomy size ≤ 18 Fr) and large-bore (LB; nephrostomy size > 18 Fr) NT. Patients who received a LB <b>NT</b> <b>had</b> a significantly lower rate of hemoglobin reduction (3. 0 vs. 4. 3 g/dL; P < 0. 001), overall complications (15. 8 vs. 21. 4 %; P < 0. 001) and a trend toward a lower rate of fever (9. 1 vs. 10. 7 %).

40|$|Targeting neurotensin as a {{potential}} novel approach {{for the treatment of}} autism Ahmad Ghanizadeh 1, 2 The pathophysiology of autism remains obscure. Recently, serum neurotensin levels in children with autistic disorder <b>have</b> been found <b>to</b> be higher than those of normal children. Neurotensin is known to intensify neuronal NMDA-mediated glutamate signaling, which may cause apoptosis in autism. Further, an imbalance of glutamate/ GABAergic system in autism has been described. These observations lead to a postulate that neurotensin may accentuate the hyperglutaminergic state in autism, leading to apoptosis. Targeting neurotensin might be a possible novel approach for the treatment of autism. A recently published study in Journal of Neuroinflammation reports the finding that neurotensin (NT) is elevated in the serum of young children with autistic disorder [1].

Methods: Expression of the c-kit protein was detected immunohistochemically in a total of 37 archival paraffin wax embedded NTs using polyclonal rabbit antihuman c-kit antibody. After immunohistochem-istry, c-kit gene associated chromosomal mutations in all cases of NT were detected with denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: Denaturing HLPC analysis did not reveal GIST-type mutations in four immunohistochemically detected c-kit positive or in 33 c-kit negative NTs. Conclusions: c-kit receptor expression and GIST-type c-kit gene mutations are rare events in NTs. Oncogenic activation of c-kit in NTs presumably differs from that of GISTs, which may influence their responsiveness to imatinib treatment. Whether c-kit has an essential role in the pathogenesis of NTs remains to be investigated. ...|$|R
