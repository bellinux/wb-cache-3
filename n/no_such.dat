5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> thing as a collective clan crest, just as there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> thing as a clan coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|A Scottish {{study showed}} that {{mortality}} in common house martins occurred mostly outside the breeding season and averaged 57%.

5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of <b>no</b> <b>such</b> compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that <b>no</b> <b>such</b> God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet weather, the airbase was completed and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, there was <b>no</b> <b>such</b> problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E
5|$|An isohedral tiling is {{a special}} {{variation}} of a monohedral tiling in which all tiles {{belong to the same}} transitivity class, that is, all tiles are transforms of the same prototile under the symmetry group of the tiling. If a prototile admits a tiling, but <b>no</b> <b>such</b> tiling is isohedral, then the prototile is called anisohedral and forms anisohedral tilings.|$|E

5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have <b>no</b> <b>such</b> constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|Architects were HRTB and {{the main}} {{contractor}} was NCC Construction. While domed stadiums have been common in North America, <b>no</b> <b>such</b> stadiums of comparable size of Telenor Arena had previously been built for football in Europe. Construction started by demolishing a hangar, which was completed in February 2007. However, because of the building boom, concrete elements needed for construction to start meant {{that the rest of}} the construction was delayed. The cornerstone was laid on 5 September.|$|E

5|$|At the {{completion}} of the regular season, the top four teams progressed to the postseason. It was contested over three weeks, following the Page playoff system. Each stage was decided by a best–of–three game series. Unlike regular season games, which made use of a variation of the International Baseball Federation's mercy rule after seveninnings, <b>no</b> <b>such</b> rule was in place for postseason games; all games went the full nineinnings, with the only exception being two games that were tied after nineinnings, therefore requiring extra innings.|$|E

5|$|Carroll {{travelled}} to England {{to press}} his case, although Hart later {{claimed that he}} had been promised <b>no</b> <b>such</b> lobbying would take place. Carroll convinced the proprietor's officials to appoint him as the proprietor's chief agent in the colony. He was further appointed to the positions of receiver general, escheator, and naval officer. These positions together effectively gave Carroll the power to oversee all money in the colony that was collected by the government or by Calvert's private organization.|$|E
