5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into <b>neurons</b> early in cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on which other developing <b>neurons</b> can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic <b>neurons</b> of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which <b>neurons</b> are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates {{the formation of the}} matrix through which <b>neurons</b> migrate. Without Tbr1, <b>neurons</b> fail to migrate properly.|$|E
5|$|The {{human brain}} is {{primarily}} composed of <b>neurons,</b> glial cells, neural stem cells, and blood vessels. Types of neuron include interneurons, pyramidal cells including Betz cells, motor <b>neurons</b> (upper and lower motor <b>neurons),</b> and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Betz cells {{are the largest}} cells (by size of cell body) in the nervous system. The adult human brain is estimated to contain 86±8 billion <b>neurons,</b> with a roughly equal number (85±10 billion) of non-neuronal cells. Out of these <b>neurons,</b> 16 billion (19%) {{are located in the}} cerebral cortex, and 69 billion (80%) are in the cerebellum.|$|E

5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest <b>neurons</b> in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous <b>neurons</b> in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's <b>neurons</b> are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E
5|$|Developing <b>neurons</b> travel {{toward the}} {{olfactory}} bulb along the RMS via glial tubes, which mark {{the division between}} the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics. Uniquely, the cells travel tangential to the brain surface, parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing <b>neurons.</b> <b>Neurons</b> that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe {{this is not the}} case. Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes. They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology. Furthermore, these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression, a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells. The developing <b>neurons</b> are identified by their expression of the cell surface molecule, a polysialylated (PSA) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) called PSA-NCAM, as well as β-tubulin, a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts, proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into <b>neurons</b> and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb. With the removal of NCAM, the neuroblasts scatter, proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation. The <b>neurons</b> form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes.|$|E

5|$|In {{humans and}} many other mammals, new <b>neurons</b> are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain {{contains}} substantially more <b>neurons</b> than the adult brain. There are, however, a few areas where new <b>neurons</b> continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb, which {{is involved in the}} sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new <b>neurons</b> play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of <b>neurons</b> that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{developing}} <b>neurons</b> reach {{the core of}} the olfactory bulb, they detach from the RMS, which is initiated by Reelin and tenascin and move radially toward glomeruli, this migration is dependent on tenascin-R, and differentiate into subtypes of interneurons.

5|$|Tbr1 is {{expressed}} mainly in early-born postmitotic <b>neurons</b> {{of the developing}} cerebral cortex—in particular, the preplate and layer VI <b>neurons.</b> The preplate forms the architectural network of <b>neurons</b> that help developing <b>neurons</b> migrate. Successive migrations of <b>neurons</b> divide the preplate such that its inner cells form the cortical plate while its outer cells form the marginal zone. The cortical plate and the marginal zone eventually develop into six cortical layers, known as the neocortex, present in the mature cerebral cortex. These layers are numbered I-VI with layer VI being the deepest and forming first, while the remaining layers grow outward from it (from V to I). Layers II-VI develop from the cortical plate and layer I forms from the marginal zone. The subplate, intermediate zone, subventricular zone, and ventricular zone are found progressively deeper to these developing cortical layers. High expression of Tbr1 {{is seen in the}} marginal zone, cortical plate, and subplate of the developing cortex whereas little expression is seen in the subventricular zone. No Tbr1 expression has been observed in the ventricular zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of <b>neurons.</b> The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP <b>neurons</b> stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART <b>neurons</b> stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus <b>neurons</b> are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E
