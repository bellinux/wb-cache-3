5|$|Set in the People's Republic of China {{during the}} 1990s, the film {{centers on a}} 13-year-old {{substitute}} teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese countryside. Called in to substitute for a village teacher for one month, Wei is told <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> any students. When {{one of the boys}} takes off in search of work in the big city, she goes looking for him. The film addresses education reform in China, the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.|$|E

During {{the first few days}} on the Island, Rose is in shock, and keeps herself away from the other survivors, attracting the attention of Jack. While Jack believes that Bernard is dead, Rose is adamant that he is still alive. After Claire (Emilie de Ravin) is kidnapped by the Island's inhabitants (known to the survivors as the Others), Rose comforts Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), who believes it is not his fault and encourages him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> hope and prays for him.|$|E
5|$|The British {{were eager}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> any useful {{inhabitants}} and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists; ultimately 112 French colonists remained in Mobile. The first permanent Jewish settlers came to Mobile in 1763 {{as a result}} of the new British rule and religious tolerance. Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the Code Noir, a decree passed by France's King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism, and ordered all Jews out of France's colonies. Most of these colonial-era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders from Sephardic Jewish communities in Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina; they added to the commercial development of Mobile. In 1766 the total population was estimated to be 860, though the town's borders were smaller than during the French colonial period. During the American Revolutionary War, West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for loyalists fleeing the other colonies.|$|E

5|$|This failure {{prompted}} the German command to rethink its strategy. To reinforce {{the troops and}} replace the losses, additional personnel were transferred from the 163rd Infantry Division based in Southern Finland. With a combined effort by all the German forces, extensive air-support by Luftflotte 5, {{as well as a}} supportive flanking attack by the Finnish 6th Division, they finally broke through the Soviet defenses on 6 July and captured Salla. A heavy Soviet counterattack drove them back out of the town but on 8 July, a general Soviet retreat of the 122nd Rifle Division allowed the German forces to recapture the town. The Soviet troops had to leave most of their artillery behind and in the heavy fighting some 50 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> momentum, the SS Division Nord pursued the 122nd Rifle Division toward Lampela, while the 169th Division turned east toward Kayraly. Meanwhile, the Finnish 6th Division was making good progress in its flanking manoeuvre to the east to circumvent Kayraly and Lape Apa.|$|E

25|$|Because file {{names have}} to be {{exchanged}} between software environments (think network file transfer, file system storage, backup and file synchronization software, configuration management, data compression and archiving, etc.), {{it is very important}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> file name information between applications.

For those parts, the show wanted to cast unknown actors.|$|E
25|$|When {{changes are}} {{introduced}} to the project, {{the viability of the}} project has to be re-assessed.

Successful project management identifies these components, and tracks and monitors progress so as to stay within time and budget frames already outlined at the commencement of the project.|$|E

Anxious <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> face, Taylor auditioned O'Keefe and signed him to the label.|$|E

25|$|Sessions of play often {{influence}} tactics a team might employ in a match, {{especially as}} natural light varies {{over the course}} of the day, and the pitch wears {{over the course of}} a match, whether one-day or Test. For example, cricketing teams usually choose opening Test batsmen who can navigate opening bowlers, who often bowl aggressively in the first session of a Test match. Similarly, Test teams often deploy a nightwatchman during the closing session of a day in Test matches so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> important wickets in conditions that might be difficult for a batsman to manage.|$|E
25|$|The {{imperial}} couple {{would not}} hold their capital for long. In July 1261, Alexios Strategopoulos, a general of Nicaea, was sent {{with a small}} advance force of 800 soldiers, most of them Cumans, to keep a watch on the Bulgarians and spy out the defences of the Latins. When the Byzantine force reached the village of Selymbria, they learned from independent local farmers (thelematarioi) that the entire Latin garrison, and the Venetian fleet, were absent conducting a raid against the Nicaean island of Daphnousia. Although initially hesitant, due to both {{the small size of}} his force, which might be fatal if the Latin army returned, and because he would exceed his orders, Strategopoulos eventually decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> such a golden opportunity to retake the city.|$|E
25|$|Peierls {{commenced}} {{school a}} year late because he needed glasses, {{and his parents}} did not trust him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> them or break them. After two years at the local preparatory school, he entered his local gymnasium, the , where {{he spent the next}} nine years, passing his abitur examinations in 1925. He wanted to study engineering, but his parents, who doubted his practical abilities, suggested physics instead. He entered the University of Berlin, where he listed to lectures by Max Planck, Walther Bothe and Walther Nernst. Fellow students included Kurt Hirsch and Käte Sperling. The physics laboratory classes were overcrowded, so the first year students were encouraged to take theoretical physics courses instead. Peierls found that he liked the subject.|$|E

25|$|In the Lefay Fragment, Digory is {{born with}} the ability to speak to trees and animals, and lives with an Aunt Gertrude, a former school {{mistress}} with an officious, bullying nature, who has ended up as a Government minister after a lifetime of belligerent brow-beating of others. Whenever his aunt is absent, Digory finds solace with the animals and trees, including a talking squirrel named Pattertwig. Polly enters the story as a girl next door who is unable to understand the speech of non-human creatures. She wants to build a raft to explore a stream which leads to an underground world. Digory helps construct the raft, but ends up sawing a branch from a talking tree necessary to complete it, in order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> face with Polly. This causes him to lose his supernatural powers of speech. The following day he is visited by his godmother MrsLefay who knows that Digory has lost his abilities and gives him a card with the address of a furniture shop which she instructs him to visit. At this point the fragment ends.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{one and a}} {{half days}} was lost to rain at Edgbaston, but when play finally got underway, Surrey tried their best to force a result - needing a win in this match to avoid losing too much ground to Middlesex in the relegation battle. As a result, seven of the {{dismissals}} were outfield catches, as Surrey were bowled out for 225 in the 60 overs possible on day two. Hosts Warwickshire started strongly, Ian Westwood and Nick Knight adding 93 for the first wicket, but Jade Dernbach had two men bowled as Surrey started to eye a hope. Scores of 60 from Alex Loudon and Michael Powell, along with 117 from Knight, saw Warwickshire to 338, a lead of 113. Losing three wickets early, Surrey went on the defensive in order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> further points, and 127 from Mark Ramprakash along with solid contributions from Rikki Clarke and wicket-keeper Jonathan Batty lifted them to 313 for 5. Surrey declared when Ramprakash was dismissed, giving Warwickshire 11 overs to bat, and Knight and Westwood batted out without loss to draw the game.|$|E
