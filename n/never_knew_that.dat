5|$|The {{funds from}} the robbery were {{originally}} kept {{at the house of}} Stalin's friends in Tiflis, Mikha and Maro Bochoridze. The money was sewn into a mattress so that it could be moved and stored easily without arousing suspicion. The mattress was moved to another safe house, then later put on the director's couch at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory, possibly because Stalin had worked there. Some sources claim that Stalin himself helped put the money in the observatory. The director stated that he <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the stolen money had been stored under his roof.|$|E

25|$|Umar was strong, fit, {{athletic}} and good at wrestling. He {{is said to}} have participated in the wrestling matches {{on the occasion of the}} annual fair of Ukaz. From first hand accounts of his physical appearance Umar is said to be vigorous, robust and a very tall man, in markets he would tower above the people. The front part of his head was bald, always A'sara Yusran (working with two hands), both his eyes were black, with yellow skin, however, ibn Sa'ad in his book stated that he <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> 'Umar had yellow skin, except if the people took into criterion a certain part of his life where his color changed because he always ate oil at that part of his life. Others say he had reddish-white skin. His teeth were ashnabul asnan (very white shining). He would always color his beard and take care of his hair using a type of plant.|$|E

25|$|The Elector Ernest Augustus {{commissioned}} Leibniz {{to write}} {{a history of the}} House of Brunswick, going back to the time of Charlemagne or earlier, hoping that the resulting book would advance his dynastic ambitions. From 1687 to 1690, Leibniz traveled extensively in Germany, Austria, and Italy, seeking and finding archival materials bearing on this project. Decades went by but no history appeared; the next Elector became quite annoyed at Leibniz's apparent dilatoriness. Leibniz never finished the project, in part because of his huge output on many other fronts, but also because he insisted on writing a meticulously researched and erudite book based on archival sources, when his patrons would have been quite happy with a short popular book, one perhaps little more than a genealogy with commentary, to be completed in three years or less. They <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he had in fact carried out a fair part of his assigned task: when the material Leibniz had written and collected for his history of the House of Brunswick was finally published in the 19th century, it filled three volumes.|$|E

By the late 1850s, they began to suspect a northern white abolitionist was secretly enticing their slaves away.

It's like I never saw anything at all before. It's like I am filling up, like a wine-glass when it's filled with wine. I watch the acts before her and they are like nothing—they're like dust. Then she walks on the stage and—she is so pretty; and her suit is so nice; and her voice is so sweet... She makes me want to smile and weep, at once... I never saw a girl like her before.

2500|$|Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac {{was born}} at his parents' home in Bristol, England, on 8 August 1902, {{and grew up in}} the Bishopston area of the city. His father, Charles Adrien Ladislas Dirac, was an {{immigrant}} from Saint-Maurice, Switzerland, who worked in Bristol as a French teacher. His mother, Florence Hannah Dirac, [...] Holten, the daughter of a ship's captain, was born in Cornwall, England, and worked as a librarian at the Bristol Central Library. Paul had a younger sister, Béatrice Isabelle Marguerite, known as Betty, and an older brother, Reginald Charles Félix, known as Felix, who committed suicide in March 1925. Dirac later recalled: [...] "My parents were terribly distressed.

2500|$|In 2007 Clapton {{learned more}} about his father, a Canadian soldier who left the UK after the war. Although Clapton's {{grandparents}} eventually told him the truth about his parentage, he only knew that his father's name was Edward Fryer. This {{was a source of}} disquiet for Clapton, as witnessed by his 1998 song [...] "My Father's Eyes". A Montreal journalist named Michael Woloschuk researched Canadian Armed Forces service records and tracked down members of Fryer's family, and finally pieced together the story. He learned that Clapton's father was Edward Walter Fryer, born [...] 1920, in Montreal and died [...] in Newmarket, Ontario. Fryer was a musician (piano and saxophone) and a lifelong drifter who was married several times, had several children, and apparently <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he was the father of Eric Clapton. Clapton thanked Woloschuk in an encounter at Macdonald Cartier Airport, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Yates claimed that, {{despite his}} urging to check her medical records for prior treatment, Dr. Saeed {{had refused to}} {{continue}} her regimen of the antipsychotic Haldol, the treatment that had worked for her during her first breakdown in 1999."The real question to me is: How could she have been so ill and the medical community not diagnose her, not treat her, and obviously not protect our family from her...Rusty testified that he <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> she had visions and voices; he said he never knew she had considered killing the children. Neither did Dr. Saeed, even though the delusions could {{have been found in}} medical records from 1999 ... he reluctantly prescribed Haldol, the same drug that worked in a drug cocktail for her in 1999. But after a few weeks, he took her off the drug, citing his concerns about side effects ... though her condition seemed to be worsening two days before the drownings, when Rusty drove her to Dr. Saeed's office, he testified, the doctor refused to try Haldol longer or return her to the hospital" [...] He added that his wife was too sick to be discharged from her last stay in the hospital in May 2001. He said he noticed the staff lower their heads as if in shame and embarrassment, turning away without saying a word. The hospital had no other choice due to the ten-day psychiatric hospitalization insurance constraints of their provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, subcontracted by Magellan Health Services.|$|E

2500|$|... was an eighteen-year-old {{castrated}} {{boy that}} served as Iason's former Furniture, Riki's caretaker and {{was responsible for the}} household chores. Like all Furnitures in Tanagura, Daryl was raised in Ceres at the orphanage, Guardian, along with Riki. Despite being three years older than Riki and having never met him in Guardian, Daryl knew Riki by his reputation and admired him. Daryl loved him because of his pride and his will not to bow down, which continued when Daryl met Riki again when he first came to Tanagura. As Riki's caretaker, Daryl tried his best effort to look after Riki, much to Riki's annoyance, while still maintaining his distance. Although Riki never treated with Daryl with a lot of respect, he found a comfortable companion in Daryl, who was dutiful, kind, and taught him the rules of Tanagura. Like Katze, Daryl was skilled at hacking, and used this talent to hack Eos Tower's security system to help Riki escape. Having aided an escape attempt and hacking Tanagura's system, he is executed for his crimes; however, Daryl did not regret his actions, as he was happy that Riki was still himself. Although most of Eos Tower knows of Daryl's fate, Riki <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Daryl tried to helped him or that he was killed for his actions. Knowing that Riki will feel guilty for Daryl's death and would keep Daryl's memory in his heart, Iason kept Riki in the dark and told him that Daryl was replaced by Cal due to rearrangement with the Furnitures. In the first drama CD, Daryl is voiced by Ryōtarō Okiayu and by [...] in the later drama CDs and remake OVAs.|$|E
