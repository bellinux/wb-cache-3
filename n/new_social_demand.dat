Os objetivos foram: Discutir as representações mentais das mulheres assistidas pelas enfermeiras sobre o parto e a prática obstétrica; Discutir o habitus da enfermeira obstétrica percebido pela mulher e Analisar as relações de poder simbólico entre os agentes envolvidos no processo de parturição. Trata-se de uma pesquisa qualitativa que utilizou a história oral temática e o teste de associação de palavras como técnicas de coleta de dados. Para a análise do material, utilizamos o método da análise de conteúdo de Bardin. A fim de dar sustentação teórica ao estudo, adotamos os conceitos de: campo, capitais, habitus, poder simbólico, trocas linguísticas, identidade e representações mentais, desenvolvidos por Pierre Bourdieu. Os resultados encontrados foram agrupados em duas categorias: As representações mentais das mulheres sobre o parto e a prática obstétrica: as percepções construídas e desconstruídas com o processo de parturição e O habitus da enfermeira obstétrica percebido pelas mulheres durante o processo de parturição: o poder simbólico destas agentes na construção de uma nova demanda social para o campo obstétrico. A primeira categoria apresentou as representações construídas pela socialização e as transformações das representações mentais das mulheres consequente à interação com a enfermeira no campo obstétrico. Neste sentido, as percepções das mulheres sobre o parto e a prática obstétrica confirmaram a forte influência do modelo tecnocrático nos depoimentos. Além disso, a prática humanizada da enfermeira contribuiu para a construção de uma nova visão de mundo nas mulheres pesquisadas que provocou um confronto entre suas representações mentais. A segunda categoria desvelou a identidade da enfermeira obstétrica percebida pelas mulheres através dos atributos profissionais e dos sinais distintivos que resultaram na associação de estereótipos a estas agentes. Ainda revelou que a manifestação do poder simbólico da enfermeira obstétrica foi percebido de diversas formas: pelo efeito de mobilização na mulher, em associação com as tecnologias de cuidado e através do fortalecimento da mulher para o parto. Concluímos que no contato com a mulher, a enfermeira exerceu um poder simbólico por estar em melhores posições no campo obstétrico. Tal fato, para as mulheres, resultou em transformações das suas representações mentais em relação ao processo de parturição, o que contribuiu para a construção de uma nova demanda para o campo obstétrico. Por outro lado, a enfermeira obstétrica, ao ser reconhecida pelas usuárias estudadas, fortaleceu a posição de sua prática no campo. The {{object of}} this study is the womens mental {{representations}} produced by obstetric nurses in labor care. Aims: To discuss the mental representations of women assisted by nurses on labor and the obstetric practice; to discuss the habitus of the obstetric nurse perceived by the women, and to analyze the symbolic power relationships among the agents involved in the labor process. It is a qualitative study that used the thematic oral history and the word association test as data collection technique. As for the material analysis, we used Bardin's content analysis methodology; In order to provide theoretical support to the study, we adopted the following concepts: field, capitals, habitus, symbolic power, linguistic exchange, identity and mental representations developed by Pierre Bourdieu. The results found were grouped into two categories: The womens mental representations on labor and the obstetric practice: the constructed and deconstructed perceptions with the labor process and The obstetric nurses habitus perceived by women during the labor process: the symbolic power of these agents in building a <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>demand</b> for the obstetric area. The first category presented the representations constructed from the socialization and the transformations of the womens mental representations {{as a result of the}} interaction with the nurse in the obstetric area. In this sense, the womens perceptions on labor and the obstetric practice confirmed the strong influence of the technocratic model on the testimonies. In addition, the nurses humanized practice contributed to the construction of a new vision of the world among the women studied, which resulted in a crash in their mental representations. The second category unveiled the identity of the obstetric nurse as perceived by women through their professional attributes and the distinctive features that resulted in the association of stereotypes to these agents. It also revealed that the manifestation of symbolic power of the obstetric nurse was perceived under several forms: by the mobilization effect on women, by the association of the care technologies, and by the strengthening of women for labor. We concluded that the nurse, in the contact with women, has exercised a symbolic power by occupying a privileged position in the obstetric area. Such fact resulted, for the women, in transformations of their mental representations in relation to the labor process, which contributed to the construction of a new demand in the obstetric area. On the other hand, the recognition of the obstetric nurse by the users strengthened the position of her field practice...|$|E

Of the 60 psychologists who answered the survey, corresponding to 13 % of the total population of students graduated in the period, 81, 7 % work as psychologists whereas 18, 3 % work in activities not related to psychology or are currently unemployed. The areas in which these professionals work are divided in organizational and work psychology (35, 8 %); clinic (30, 6 %); social psychology /health/ community (20 %) and school psychology (12 %). Many professionals work in two or even three distinct areas in different locations or in two activities in the same institution. From the collected data, one can observe the variety of professional activities carried out by psychologists in the region, specially related to the fields of health and social assistance, focusing the suffering of the population groups attended.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} the management model of the Espírito Santo State Military Police (PMES-Brazil), its connections with the bureaucratic model, besides its change to business management approach. For that, the history of military organizations in Brazil is discussed (Demoner, 1985; Carvalho, 2005). After that, the bureaucratic model (Weber, 1978) of traditional public administration and its transformation to the logic of business management (Bresser-Pereira, 1999) are discussed, and further, both approaches are analyzed in depth having the PMES as a context, for studying the relationships between these models. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews with eleven Generals who were commanders in chief and a documentary research was developed as a complement. The data were analyzed using content analysis (Bardin, 2006). The results shows that the PMES – having its cult of won traditions and management ways – is changing very slowly to deal with the <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>demands</b> in spite of historical changes that already occurred in Brazil.

Nevertheless, the euphoria permeating the discourse can be also seen in the perspective of a new alliance between artists and lower classes emerging from the civil society’s spontaneous reaction to the crisis, specifically from a series of collective actions promoting horizontality, participation and solidarity between social groups.

It now seems clearly insufficient for higher education institutions to create awareness, to build spaces for reflection and personal growth, to cultivate a sense of community and social engagement, or to prepare for the exercise of a profession.

40|$|The {{literature}} on neo-corporatist agreements {{in social and}} labor market policy in the 1990 s points to a decline of concertation in European countries with a long-standing tradition of corporatist negotiation. This article identifies a similar trend in Switzerland and argues that three destabilizing factors account for it: 1) retrenchment pressure and ideological polarization prevent compromises; 2) the emergence of <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>demands</b> and interests challenges the homogeneity and legitimacy of peak organizations and thus their bargaining power; 3) increasing media coverage tends {{to open up the}} traditionally confidential and selective sphere of corporatist negotiation and weakens the social partners’ ability to reach agreements. The impact of these factors on neo-corporatist bargaining is tested in Switzerland, a case where corporatist negotiations used to be particularly decisive in social policy making. Empirical evidence comes from a cross-time comparison of two major social policies: Unemployment insurance and pension reforms in the 1970 s and in the 1990 s.

40|$|Part 3 : Big and Open DataInternational audienceGovernments {{are under}} {{pressure}} to meet <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>demands</b> and seek <b>new</b> forms of management. As well as this, {{the fact that they}} make considerable use of information technology, has led to the growth of their databases, and made governments and the respective government organizations, fertile ground for open data initiatives. Having access to budgetary data and being able to make use of it (with regard to revenue and expenditure), has traditionally always aroused great interest in society. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the potential benefits and possible obstacles that can affect the intermediaries who take action on the basis of budgetary data. A number of intermediaries (members of society and government policymakers) from four Latin-American countries were interviewed. The results show that the structural barriers of governments have an adverse effect on their activities because they impair the quality of the information that is made available. Nonetheless, the benefits that allow a greater degree of transparency as well as the ability to reveal more knowledge of the inside operations of governments, encourage the intermediaries to take part in this “ecosystem”...|$|R

Consequences of these processes are the segmentation of rural space, the disappearance of indigenous cultures and techniques, and the depopulation of vast areas. Dynamics of rural spaces are discconnected from agricultural development, because space {{is no longer the}} physical place where polyvalent forms {{of production}} and social organization are composed. Instead, food is produced in the economic space for optimal allocation of resources. The diffusion of industrial techniques in agriculture, while successfully increasing production and yields, nonetheless is limited in its ability to manage excess farmland and to guarantee an efficient reproduction of natural productivity and renewable natural resources. Economic and social crisis, as well as growing urbanization, have allowed <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>demands</b> for rural space to emerge, particularly for health and environmental protection and recreational activilies. Even adjusted "Fordist" techniques do not seem able to satisfy them. Finally, the co-evolution of economic, social and technical factors may favor {{the emergence of a new}} science-based and information intensive technical paradigm, for the management of diversified and sustainable models of agricultural development...|$|R
