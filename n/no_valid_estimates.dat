5000|$|Geological {{evidence}} from the Earth suggests that [...] may be high; life on Earth appears to have begun {{around the same time}} as favorable conditions arose, suggesting that abiogenesis may be relatively common once conditions are right. However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains anthropic bias, as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical hypothesis testing standpoint, there are zero degrees of freedom, permitting <b>no</b> <b>valid</b> <b>estimates</b> to be made. If life were to be found on Mars that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for [...] close to 1. While this would raise the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.|$|E
40|$|Whenever possible, {{experiments}} {{should be}} comparative. For example, {{if you are}} testing a modification, the modified and unmodified procedures should be run {{side by side in}} the same experiment. ” Box,Hunter, and Hunter [1] “It is possible, and indeed it is all too frequent, for an experiment to be so conducted that <b>no</b> <b>valid</b> <b>estimate</b> of error is available. In such a case the experiment cannot be said,strictly,tobe capable of proving anything. ” R. A. Fisher [2] Two methodological practices are well established in other scientific disciplines yet remain rare in computersecurity research: comparativeexperimentsand statistical inferences. Comparative experiments offer the only way to control factors that might vary from one study to the next. Statistical inferences enable a researcher to drawgeneralconclusionsfromempiricalresults. Despite their widespread use in other sciences, these practices are haphazardly used in security research. Choosing keystroke dynamics as an example to study, we survey the literature. Of 80 papers wherein these practices would be appropriate, only 43 (53. 75 %) performed comparative experiments, and only 6 (7. 5 %) drewstatistical inferences. In disciplines such as medicine, comparative experiments and statistical inferencessave lives and cut costs. Rigorous methodological standards are required. We see no reason why security research, another discipline wherethestakesarecriticallyhigh,cannotorshouldnot adoptthese practicesaswell. Failureto takeamorescientific approach to security research stalls progress and leavesusvulnerable. ...|$|R
40|$|Locally linear {{classification}} by pairwise coupling {{addresses a}} nonlinear classification problem by three basic phases: decompose the classes of complex concepts into linearly separable subclasses, learn a linear classifier for each pair, and combine pairwise classifiers {{into a single}} classifier. A number of methods have been proposed in this framework. However, these methods have several deficiencies: 1) lack of a systematic evaluation of the framework, 2) naive application of general clustering algorithms to generate subclasses, and 3) <b>no</b> <b>valid</b> method to <b>estimate</b> and optimal number of subclasses. This paper proves the equivalence between three popular combination schemas under general settings, defines several global criterion functions for measuring the goodness of subclasses, and presents a supervised greedy clustering algorithm to minimize the proposed criterion functions. Extensive experiments has also been conducted {{on a set of}} benchmark data to validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{measures}} of need {{for health care}} {{and their relationship to}} utilization of health services in different racial and ethnic groups in California. DATA SOURCE: Telephone interviews obtained by random-digit dialing and conducted between April 1993 and July 1993 in California, with 7, 264 adults (ages 18 - 64) : 601 African Americans, 246 Asians, 917 Latinos interviewed in English; 1, 045 Latinos interviewed in Spanish; and 4, 437 non-Latino whites. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from a stratified, probability telephone sample. DATA COLLECTION: Interviews collected self-reported indicators of need for health care: self-rated health, activity limitation, major chronic conditions, need for ongoing treatment, bed days, and prescription medication. The outcome was self-reported number of physician visits in the previous three months. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to whites, {{one or more of the}} other ethnic groups varied significantly (p <. 05) on each of the six need-for-care measures after adjustment for health insurance, age, sex, and income. Latinos interviewed in Spanish reported lower percentages and means on five of the need measures but the highest percentage with fair or poor health (32 percent versus 7 percent in whites). Models regressing each need measure on the number of outpatient visits found significant interactions of ethnic group with need compared to whites. After adjustment for insurance and demographics, the estimated mean number of visits in those with the indicator of need was consistently lower in Latinos interviewed in Spanish, but the differences among the other ethnic groups varied depending on the measure used. CONCLUSION: <b>No</b> single <b>valid</b> <b>estimate</b> of the relationship between need for health care and outpatient visits was found for any of the six indicators across ethnic groups. Applying need adjustment to the use of health care services without regard for ethnic variability may lead to biased conclusions about utilization...|$|R

30|$|In a {{study by}} Hansen et al. [25], {{normalisation}} by eTIV decreased the sample sizes needed to detect a volume difference in hippocampal volume between two hypothetical groups. Linear normalisation by eTIV even outperformed linear normalisation using more <b>valid</b> <b>estimates.</b> However, {{it seems to be}} assumed that the mean volume {{difference between the two groups}} will not be affected by normalisation. Under this assumption, the smallest sample sizes will be achieved using intracranial volume estimates that explain the most variance in the volume of interest. The additional variance that eTIV explains compared to the more <b>valid</b> <b>estimates</b> risks being variance due to the total-brain-volume-dependent bias, which in reality might reduce the mean volume difference between the two groups during normalisation, thus reducing the gain of the normalisation.|$|R
