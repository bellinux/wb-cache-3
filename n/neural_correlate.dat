40|$|What are the <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of {{conscious}} visual awareness? Tackling this question requires contrasting <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of stimulus processing culminating in visual awareness with <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of stimulus processing unaccompanied by awareness. To produce these two neural states, {{one must be}} able to erase an otherwise visible stimulus from awareness. This article describes and assesses visual phenomena involving dissociation of physical stimulation and conscious awareness: degraded stimulation, visual masking, visual crowding, bistable figures, binocular rivalry, motioninduced blindness, inattentional blindness, change blindness and attentional blink. No single approach stands above the others, but those producing changing visual awareness despite invariant physical stimulation are clearly preferable. Such phenomena can help lead us ultimately to a comprehensive account of the <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> {{of conscious}} awareness...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) may {{be described}} by {{a large number of}} different feature types and automated feature selection methods are needed in order to reliably identify features which correlate with continuous independent variables. NEW METHOD: A method is presented for the automated identification of features that differentiate two or more groups in neurological datasets based upon a spectral decomposition of the feature set. Furthermore, the method is able to identify features that relate to continuous independent variables. RESULTS: The proposed method is first evaluated on synthetic EEG datasets and observed to reliably identify the correct features. The method is then applied to EEG recorded during a music listening task and is observed to automatically identify <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of music tempo changes similar to <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> identified in a previous study. Finally, the method is applied to identify <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of music-induced affective states. The identified <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> reside primarily over the frontal cortex and are consistent with widely reported <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of emotions. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The proposed method is compared to the state-of-the-art methods of canonical correlation analysis and common spatial patterns, in order to identify features differentiating synthetic event-related potentials of different amplitudes and is observed to exhibit greater performance as the number of unique groups in the dataset increases. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is able to identify <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of continuous variables in EEG datasets and is shown to outperform canonical correlation analysis and common spatial patterns...|$|R

40|$|Word {{learning}} is a first fundamental step in language acquisition. Understanding underlying <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> during the progress of verbal {{learning is}} of interest for improving language therapies for naming disorders. In order to study <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of verbal learning, 14 healthy participants learnt 40 pseudowords each with three belonging semantics in a standardized training program. In three fMRI scans the <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of verbal learning were studied. During the first fMRI scan, accomplished before the pseudoword training started, {{participants were asked to}} name 40 black-white drawings plus three associated semantics. The second fMRI scan took place {{on the first day of}} the pseudoword training, the last fMRI scan after the end of training. In scan 2 and 3 pseudoword naming and naming of the learnt semantics were requested. Participants learnt pseudowords successfully during the training. Familiar word naming activated typical <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of speech production as frontal and temporal regions. Interestingly, for pseudoword learning occipital areas and the inferior parietal lobule showed elevated responses next to typical speech production areas. Regarding the change of <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> during the learning progress, bilateralized caudate and right cerebellum were more strongly activated during the first acquisition phase. Cerebellar involvement in verbal working memory activity was recently found, while caudate activation could reflect suppression of unwanted responses. When the pseudowords became better consolidated the inferior parietal lobule showed increased activation maybe reflecting phonological storage. Activation of inferior and inferior parietal areas, as well as orbitofrontal areas correlated also with learning success. It will be interesting for future research to compare our findings of <b>neural</b> <b>correlates</b> of verbal learning in healthy subjects with those of aphasic or schizophrenic patients, in order to refine treatment possibilities...|$|R
