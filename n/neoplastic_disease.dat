2500|$|Biopsy of {{affected}} {{lymph nodes}} or organs confirms the diagnosis, although a needle aspiration of an affected lymph node can increase suspicion of the disease. X-rays, ultrasound and bone marrow biopsy reveal other {{locations of the}} cancer. There are now a range of blood tests that can be utilised {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of lymphoma. Flow cytometry detects antibodies linked to tumour cell surface antigens in fluid samples or cell suspensions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR) identifies circulating tumour cells based on unique genetic sequences. The canine Lymphoma Blood Test (cLBT) measures multiple circulating biomarkers and utilises a complex algorithm to diagnose lymphoma. This test utilises the acute phase proteins (C-Reactive Protein and Haptoglobin). In combination with basic clinical symptoms, it gives in differential diagnosis the sensitivity 83.5% [...] and specificity 77%. The TK canine cancer panel is an indicator of general <b>neoplastic</b> <b>disease.</b> The stage of the disease is important to treatment and prognosis. Certain blood tests have also been shown to be prognostic.|$|E

40|$|Background. Pediatric {{patients}} with <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are more likely}} to develop nosocomial infections (NIs). NIs may prolong their hospital stay, and increase morbidity and mortality. Objectives. The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) the incidence of NIs, (2) sites of NIs, (3) causal organisms, and (4) outcomes of NIs among pediatric {{patients with}} <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Methods. This study was a prospective cohort study of pediatric patients with <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases</b> who were admitted to the Chiang Mai University Hospital, Thailand. Results. A total of 707 pediatric patients with <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases</b> were admitted. Forty-six episodes of NIs in 30 patients were reported (6. 5 NIs/ 100 admission episodes and 7 NIs/ 1000 days of hospitalization). Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had the highest number of NIs (41. 3 %). The most common causal organisms were gramnegative bacteria (47. 1 %). Patients who had undergone invasive procedures were more likely to develop NIs than those who had not (P <. 05). The mortality rate of patients with NIs was 19. 6 %. Conclusion. Pediatric patients with <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are more likely to}} develop NIs after having undergone invasive procedures. Pediatricians should be aware of this and strictly follow infection control guidelines in order to reduce morbidity and mortality rates related to NIs. Copyright © 2009 Peninnah Oberdorfer et al.

40|$|ABSTRACT Patients with {{neoplasia}} who {{are severely}} immunocompromised {{have a higher}} risk of fungal infections. There are limited data in the literature regarding the frequency of dermatophyte infections and efficacy of antifungals in patients with malignancies. Objective was assessment of the incidence of dermatophyte infections and antifungal susceptibility, determination of dermatophyte species isolated from patients with <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases.</b> 138 patients diagnosed with various malignancies and 160 immunocompetent patients who were referred to the Department of Dermatology in Brasov, Romania, for suspicion of dermatophyte infections were included in the study. Nail clippings or skin scrapings were examined by direct microscopy and cultures in Sabouraud agar medium. Susceptibility tests for antifungals were conducted in vitro using a method of broth microdilution.   Infections with dermatophytes were identified in 30. 4 % of patients with <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases</b> and in 29. 37 % in the control group. There was a significantly higher frequency of dermatophyte infections in patients with hematologic malignancies (52 %) compared to those with solid cancers (25. 66 %) (P= 0. 01). The clinical aspects of dermatophyte infections in patients with <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases</b> were not different from those of patients without cancer; though in some cases the infections were more extensive. There were no statistically significant differences between mean values of minimum inhibitory concentration of antifungals compared with controls. Terbinafine had the highest antidermatophyte activity for all tested dermatophyte species isolated from patients with <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases.</b> There were no differences in frequency of dermatophyte infections and antifungal susceptibility to dermatophytes between patients with <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases</b> and immunocompetent patients.   KEY WORDS: dermatophyte; neoplasia; antifungals; in vitro susceptibility</p...|$|R

40|$|Caspase- 14, {{a member}} of caspase family, only exists in mammals. As the most {{divergent}} member in the family of mammalian caspases, caspase- 14 displays a variety of unique characteristics. It is expressed in {{a limited number of}} tissues and has the shortest amino acid sequence within the caspase protein family. At present, it has been found that caspase- 14 is functionally different from the inflammatory reaction group of typical caspase family members. It exerts a certain effect in the promotion of final differentiation of epidermal cells and hydration of stratum corneum so as to maintain the steady state of skin barrier. In recent years, caspase- 14 expression has been discovered in <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Translational medicine integrates experimental research results and clinical guidance into the optimal implementation criteria for promoting the prediction, prevention and treatment of diseases. Via human genomics and molecular biology, translational medicine offers a possibility of screening molecular markers {{so that it can be}} used to diagnose the <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases.</b> In this article, the biological characteristics and substrates of caspase- 14 as well as its expression in embryonic period and <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases</b> were reviewed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAimsMany {{studies of}} human {{subjects}} {{have demonstrated the}} utility of assessing serum levels of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and big ET- 1 as clinical biomarkers in cardiopulmonary and <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases.</b> In this study we explored the feasibility of using serum big ET- 1 as a reliable veterinary marker in dogs with various cardiopulmonary and <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Main methodsSerum big ET- 1 levels were measured by ELISA in dogs with cardiopulmonary (n= 21) and <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases</b> (n= 57). Dogs exhibiting cardiopulmonary disease {{were divided into two}} groups based on the velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation (3. 0 >m/s) measured by ultrasound: without and with pulmonary hypertension. Big ET- 1 levels for the dogs with the diseases were compared with levels in normal healthy dogs (n= 17). Key findingsDogs with cardiopulmonary disease (4. 6 ± 4. 6 pmol/l) showed a significantly (P< 0. 01) higher level of big ET- 1 than healthy control dogs (1. 1 ± 0. 53 pmol/l). Serum levels in the dogs with pulmonary hypertension (6. 2 ± 5. 3 pmol/l) were significantly (P< 0. 01) higher than those without pulmonary hypertension (2. 0 ± 0. 6 pmol/l). Dogs with hemangiosarcoma (5. 6 ± 2. 2 pmol/l), adenocarcinoma (2. 0 ± 1. 8 pmol/l), histiocytic sarcoma (3. 3 ± 1. 9 pmol/l), chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma (3. 0 ± 1. 6 pmol/l) and hepatocellular carcinoma (2. 7 ± 1. 8 pmol/l) showed significantly (P< 0. 05) higher levels than healthy control dogs. SignificanceThese findings point to the potential of serum big ET- 1 as a clinical marker for cardiopulmonary and <b>neoplastic</b> <b>diseases</b> in dogs...|$|R

50|$|Upregulation of eEF1A {{has been}} {{reported}} in breast cancer samples. Though its role in metastasis remains unclear, the role of eEF1A in cytoskeleton organization may promote tumor cell motility and thus spread. Alternatively, apoptotic cells may secrete antigens, including eEF1A and other elongation factors, to induce an autoimmune response during cancer. It is postulated that high expression and secretion of elongation factors from tumor tissues, combined with altered levels of eEF1A-derived bacterial peptides in <b>neoplastic</b> <b>disease,</b> may lead to autoimmunity in breast cancer.|$|E
