5|$|Mathematical {{notation}} was decimal, {{and based}} on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written {{as many times as}} necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively. Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a <b>numerator</b> greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this. Some common fractions, however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.|$|E
25|$|The {{quotient}} (without the remainder) {{becomes the}} whole number {{part of the}} mixed number. The remainder becomes the <b>numerator</b> of the fractional part. In the example, 2 is the whole number part and 3 is the <b>numerator</b> of the fractional part.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminology}} {{used to describe}} algebraic fractions {{is similar to that}} used for ordinary fractions. For example, an algebraic fraction is in lowest terms if the only factors common to the <b>numerator</b> and the denominator are 1 and −1. An algebraic fraction whose <b>numerator</b> or denominator, or both, contain a fraction, such as , is called a complex fraction.|$|E

25|$|Common {{fractions}} can {{be classified}} as either proper or improper. When the <b>numerator</b> and the denominator are both positive, the fraction is called proper if the <b>numerator</b> {{is less than the}} denominator, and improper otherwise. In general, a common fraction {{is said to be a}} proper fraction if the absolute value of the fraction is strictly less than one—that is, if the fraction is greater than −1 and less than 1.|$|E
25|$|If two {{positive}} fractions {{have the}} same <b>numerator,</b> then the fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger number. When a whole is divided into equal pieces, if fewer equal pieces are needed {{to make up the}} whole, then each piece must be larger. When two positive fractions {{have the same}} <b>numerator,</b> they represent the same number of parts, but in the fraction with the smaller denominator, the parts are larger.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of calculating two-loop three-point {{diagrams}} with irreducible <b>numerators</b> (i. e. <b>numerators</b> which cannot be {{expressed in terms of}} the denominators). For the case of massless internal particles and arbitrary (off-shell) external momenta, exact results are obtained in terms of polylogarithms. We also consider the tensor decomposition of two-loop three-point diagrams, and show how it is connected with irreducible <b>numerators.</b> Comment: 12 pages, latex, 3 figures, ps-file available at ftp://vsfys 1. fi. uib. no/davydychev/bergen 94 - 17. p...|$|R
40|$|We find simple {{expressions}} for the kinematic <b>numerators</b> of one-loop MHV amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang [...] Mills {{theory and}} supergravity, for any multiplicity. The gauge theory <b>numerators</b> satisfy the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) duality between color and kinematics, {{so that the}} gravity <b>numerators</b> are simply {{the square of the}} gauge theory ones. The duality holds because the <b>numerators</b> can be written in terms of structure constants of a kinematic algebra, which is familiar from the BCJ organization of self-dual gauge theory and gravity. The close connection that we find between one-loop amplitudes in the self-dual case and in the maximally supersymmetric case is the converse to the dimension-shifting formula. The starting point for arriving at our expressions is the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional amplitudes obtained in the field-theory limit of open superstrings...|$|R

40|$|By {{expanding}} the reduced Pfaffian {{in the tree}} level Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) integrands for Yang-Mills (YM) and nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), {{we can get the}} Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) <b>numerators</b> in Del Duca-Dixon-Maltoni (DDM) form for arbitrary number of particles in any spacetime dimensions. In this work, we give a set of very straightforward graphic rules based on spanning trees for a direct evaluation of the BCJ <b>numerators</b> for YM and NLSM. Such rules can be derived from the Laplace expansion of the corresponding reduced Pfaffian. For YM, the each one of the $(n- 2) !$ DDM form BCJ <b>numerators</b> contains exactly $(n- 1) !$ terms, corresponding to the increasing trees with respect to the color order. For NLSM, the number of nonzero <b>numerators</b> is at most $(n- 2) !-(n- 3) !$, less than those of several previous constructions. Comment: 29 pages, 3 captioned figure...|$|R
