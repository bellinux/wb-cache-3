2500|$|New York City's {{high rate}} of transit use saved [...] of oil in 2006 and $4.6 billion in {{gasoline}} costs. New York saves {{half of all the}} oil saved by transit nationwide. The reduction in oil consumption meant 11.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution was kept out of the air. The city's extraordinary public transit use means that New Yorkers emit far fewer greenhouse gases on a per capita basis than the average American. New York City's greenhouse gas emissions are 7.1 metric tons per person compared with the national average of 24.5. <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> <b>are</b> collectively responsible for one percent of the nation's total greenhouse gas emissions though comprising 2.7% of the nation's population.|$|E

2500|$|Environmental {{concerns}} in the city involve managing the city's extraordinary population density. [...] Mass transit use is {{the highest in the}} nation and gasoline consumption in the city is at the rate the national average was in the 1920s. New York City's dense population and low automobile dependence help make New York among the most energy efficient in the United States. The city's greenhouse gas emission levels are relatively low when measured per capita, at 7.1 metric tons per person, below San Francisco, at 11.2 metric tons, and the national average, at 24.5. [...] <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> <b>are</b> collectively responsible for one percent of the nation's total greenhouse gas emissions, though comprise 2.7% of the nation's population.

Calla lilies, all sorts of geraniums, passion flowers, moss roses--I do not know the names of a tenth part of them. I only know that while <b>New</b> <b>Yorkers</b> <b>are</b> burdened with banks and drifts of snow, Californians are burdened with banks and drifts of flowers, if they only keep their hands off and let them grow. And I have heard that they have also that rarest and most curious of all the flowers, the beautiful Espiritu Santo, as the Spaniards call it--or flower of the Holy Spirit --though I thought it grew only in Central America--down on the Isthmus. In its cup is the daintiest little facsimile of a dove, as pure as snow. The Spaniards have a superstitious reverence for it. The blossom has been conveyed to the States, submerged in ether; and the bulb has been taken thither also, but every attempt to make it bloom after it arrived, has failed.|$|E

At {{the request of the}} Mayor’s office, the Department of City Planning studied supermarket need in the city and, in April 2008, found a widespread shortage of supermarkets. This shortage causes a lack of healthy, fair-priced food options for many New Yorkers who live in a food desert.
