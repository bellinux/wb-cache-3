The {{equation}} u - v = at implies that the greater the acceleration the shorter the time <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> speed. The stopping distance s is also shortest when acceleration a is at the highest possible value compatible with road conditions: the equation s = ut + 1/2 at2 makes s low when a is high and t is low.|$|E
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

Beginning on September 14, 1899, Aguinaldo accepted the advice of General Gregorio del Pilar and authorized the use of guerilla warfare tactics in subsequent military operations in Bulacan.|$|E

The Local Government Board took {{over the role of}} the Poor Law Board after the passing of the Second Great Reform Act. The Reform Act enfranchised a greater number of people meaning that Parliament became more concerned with welfare.|$|E

Pemex was founded through the nationalization of foreign oil interests, and the Mexican constitution bans major outside investments. Changing Pemex could transform the psychology of Mexico's business sector and involve cultural and political changes that cannot be rushed. President Lázaro Cárdenas seized foreign oil company assets in 1938 to form Pemex, which {{has served as a}} symbol of national identity.|$|E
25|$|To {{study the}} Sun at all latitudes the probe <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> its orbital {{inclination}} {{and leave the}} plane of the Solar System – to change the orbital inclination of a spacecraft a large change in heliocentric velocity is needed. However the necessary amount of velocity change to achieve a high inclination orbit of about 80° far exceeded the capabilities of any launch vehicle. Therefore, to reach the desired orbit around the Sun a gravity assist manoeuvre around Jupiter was chosen, but this Jupiter encounter meant that Ulysses could not be powered by solar cells – the probe instead was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG).|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1980s, Birmingham City Council {{decided that}} they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the image Birmingham had to the public, and improve the livability of the city. The first main aim was to target the areas in the city centre {{that had not been}} {{developed}} following World War II, such as the canals. The council worked closely with Argent, a developer, who redeveloped the area around the canals into a mixed use scheme Brindleyplace, which began in 1994 and was completed in early 2009. This development followed the construction of the National Indoor Arena and the International Convention Centre, which were both completed in 1991.|$|E

25|$|The first plans by the proprietors of the Trent & Mersey Canal Company to {{construct}} a canal from the summit level to Leek were considered in January 1773. This {{would have been a}} tub-boat canal, as the boats were designed to carry just 5 tons, and rather than using locks, inclined planes were to be used at points where the level of the canal <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Two more plans were considered, and the third included extra reservoirs which would supply the summit level of the existing main line. At a similar time, an independent company was planning a link to Leek, but the Trent & Mersey managed to block this. Having secured contracts with several owners of limestone quarries in the Caldon Low area, the company sought an Act of Parliament to authorise construction of the new works, which it obtained in May 1776.|$|E
25|$|Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, {{the nephew}} of Napoleon Bonaparte, became the first elected {{president}} of France in 1848. In 1850, he started an ambitious project to connect the Louvre to the Hotel de Ville in Paris by extending the Rue de Rivoli and create a new park, the Bois de Boulogne, {{on the outskirts of}} the city, but he was exasperated by the slow progress made by the incumbent prefect of the Seine, Jean-Jacques Berger. Louis-Napoleon was highly popular, but he was blocked from running for re-election by the constitution of the Second French Republic. While he had a majority of the votes in the legislature at his disposal, he did not have the two-thirds majority <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the constitution. At the end of December 1851, he staged a coup d'état, and in 1852 declared himself Emperor of the French under the title Napoleon III. A plebiscite in November 1852 overwhelmingly approved Napoleon's assumption of the throne, and he soon began searching for a new prefect of the Seine to carry out his Paris reconstruction program.|$|E
25|$|After Avellone and Parker {{joined the}} team, they {{organized}} {{a meeting in}} order to set a firm direction for the game and settled on the features that would be included and excluded in the game. Among the cut features include parkour, chase scenes with a motorcycle and yacht, and environmental interaction. A female character known as Uli Booi was completely scrapped after the meeting. The game structure was modified {{with the introduction of}} safehouses to make the game less linear. The minigames were also changed significantly. While the team initially wanted to remove them completely, Sega objected and as a result, the team modified them, making them faster. With all these changes, both Sega's confidence to the game and the team's morale were restored. However, while the team had settled on the game's design, more features were cut or downgraded due to time constraints. The artificial intelligence originally designed for the game drained the game's technical performance thus they had to lower its complexity so that the game could run better. A female version of Micheal Thorton was planned, but it was canceled in order to save budget as the team would have <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> dialogue and created new animations for the character. The mission debrief showing up after the player completed a mission was initially a bug discovered by one of the game's testers, before the team redeveloped it to become an official feature. Obsidian also added and refined most of the role-playing elements in early and mid 2009 per Sega's request.|$|E
