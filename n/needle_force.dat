40|$|Sewability is very {{significant}} for industrial sewing machines and has received much attention and improvement. In this research, four on-line monitoring sensors are developed for industrial sewing machines {{in order to}} measure sewing parameters and help to detect sewability problems. Specifically, the developed sensors are thread length measurement sensor, thread tension sensor, thread tension setting sensor, and <b>needle</b> <b>force</b> sensor. These sensors can provide detailed information on thread consumption, instantaneous thread tension, thread tension setup, and needle penetration force. The thread length measurement sensor can measure the top thread length that goes into a given sew: According to the experimental results, it is found that this sensor can be used to set up the thread tension properly. Therefore, it can help to minimize the sewability problems. The thread tension sensor can measure the instantaneous thread tension during sewing stitches. Hence, it can detect an improper thread tension setup and help to minimize the sewability problems. However, its high cost limits its application. The thread tension setting sensor is then developed in order for sewing operators to set up the thread tension properly and quickly. It is also a cost-effective sensor that can provide data leading to solutions to the sewability problems. The <b>needle</b> <b>force</b> sensor can measure the instantaneous <b>needle</b> <b>force</b> during needle penetration and withdrawal. The new design of the sensor ensures that the measurements are more accurate than other measurement methods. This sensor can be used to help detect sewability problems resulting from an improper needle penetration force. In summary, the developed sensors can not only be used to measure the sewing parameters and help to detect the sewability problems, but they can also provide a data acquisition method for the automatic control of industrial sewing machines. With these sensors instrumented on industrial sewing machines, the sewability problems will be minimized. Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

40|$|Abstract—A {{methodology}} for estimating the force distribution that occurs along a needle shaft during insertion is described. An experimental system for measuring planar tissue phantom defor-mation during needle insertions {{has been developed}} and is pre-sented. A two-dimensional linear elastostatic material model, dis-cretised using the finite element method, is used to derive con-tact force information that is not directly measurable. This ap-proach provides a method for quantifying the needle forces and soft tissue deformations that occur during general needle trajecto-ries in multiple dimensions. The <b>needle</b> <b>force</b> distribution is used for graphical and haptic real-time simulations of needle insertion. Since the force displacement relationship is required only along the needle, a condensation technique is shown to achieve very fast in-teractive simulations.

Following drug delivery injections where drugs {{did not reach}} their target will squander research time, experimental animals and other resources. An ultrasound-guided robot developed at Robarts Research Institute was revised to implement closed-loop force feedback to compensate for tissue deformation during micro-interventions. Force sensors can detect puncture events as the needle penetrates tissue membranes, thereby reducing damage to surrounding tissues by preventing the needle from overshooting its target. Changing the angle of injection determined that the range of detectable forces during injections into tissue-mimicking phantoms suggests that sensors accurately measure projection of the <b>needle</b> <b>force</b> onto the vertical direction and are sensitive to puncture events through relatively thick (0. 15 mm) membranes.

40|$|Background: To date, much {{research}} has been conducted to measure needle manipulation quantitatively and objectively. This study was performed to quantitatively measure the differences in the amount of stimulation caused by various rotation frequencies and angles in twisting–rotating acupuncture needle manipulation. Methods: The torque Z force exerted on a tissue was measured at various rotation frequencies and angles by rotating a needle with a <b>needle</b> <b>force</b> measurement system attached to a needle insertion tissue model. Results: The results show that with rotation frequency at 60 °, the torque Z force increased significantly from 0. 023  N mm to 0. 118  N mm as the rotation angle increased (p  0. 88; p <  0. 001].

40|$|The {{previous}} {{models for}} predicting the forces {{acting on a}} needle during insertion into very soft organs (such as, e. g. brain) relied on oversimplifying assumptions of linear elasticity and specific experimentally derived functions for determining needle-tissue interactions. In this contribution, we propose a more general approach in which the needle forces are determined directly from the equations of continuum mechanics using fully non-linear finite element procedures that account for large deformations (geometric non-linearity) and non-linear stress-strain relationship (material non-linearity) of soft tissues. We applied these procedures to model needle insertion into a swine brain using the constitutive properties determined from the experiments on tissue samples obtained from the same brain (i. e. the subject-specific constitutive properties were used). We focused on the insertion phase preceding puncture of the brain meninges and obtained a very accurate prediction of the <b>needle</b> <b>force.</b> This demonstrates the utility of non-linear finite element procedures in patient-specific modelling of needle insertion into soft organs such as, e. g. brain...|$|E

Moreover, the performance of fuzzy logic model is compared with that of the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The <b>needle</b> penetration <b>force</b> was measured on the Instron tensile tester. In order to plan the fuzzy logic model, the sewing needle size, number of fabric layers and fabric weight were taken into account as input parameters. The output parameter is <b>needle</b> penetration <b>force.</b> In addition, the same parameters and data are used in artificial neural network model. The results indicate that the <b>needle</b> penetration <b>force</b> can be predicted in terms of sewing parameters by using the fuzzy logic model. The difference between performance of fuzzy logic and neural network models is not meaningful (RFL= 0. 971 and RANN= 0. 982).

These dosages correspond to ones 10 times greater applied intravenously. The measurements were made using <b>needle</b> <b>force</b> probes which were implanted into the myocardial offstream area in the left ventricular wall. Bypass flow was measured simultaneously by an electromagnetic flow probe. There is a significant increase in coronary bypass flow induced by both rates of 0. 4 and 0. 8 microgram x kg- 1 x min- 1 dobutamine, but there was no significant effect on bypass flow induced by dopamine. Developed myocardial force is raised more by dobutamine medication than by dopamine. However, the rate of contraction increases significantly and relaxation is significantly accelerated by dopamine at both dosages.

40|$|Abstract- Two {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine the effects of friction and needle geometry during robotic needle insertion into soft tissues. In Experiment I, friction forces along the instrument axis were characterized during needle insertion into bovine liver under CT fluoroscopic imaging. Because the relative velocity of the tissue and needle affect viscous and Coulomb friction, the needle insertion process was segmented into several phases of relative motion: none, partial and complete. During the complete relative motion phase, it was found that Coulomb friction accounts for the majority of <b>needle</b> <b>force.</b> In Experiment II, insertion forces along and orthogonal to the needle axis were measured during insertion into a silicone rubber phantom with a consistency similar to liver. The effects of needle diameter and tip type (bevel, cone, and triangle) on insertion force were characterized. A bevel tip causes more needle bending and is more easily affected by tissue density variations. Forces for larger diameter needles are higher due to increased cutting and friction forces. These results may be used in the control of needle insertion for robot-assisted percutaneous therapies. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—During needle-based procedures, {{transitions}} between tissue layers {{often lead}} to rupture events that involve large forces and tissue deformations and produce uncontrollable crack exten-sions. In this paper, the mechanics of these rupture events is de-scribed, {{and the effect of}} insertion velocity on <b>needle</b> <b>force,</b> tissue deformation, and needle work is analyzed. Using the J integral method from fracture mechanics, rupture events are modeled as sudden crack extensions that occur when the release rate J of strain energy concentrated {{at the tip of the}} crack exceeds the frac-ture toughness of the material. It is shown that increasing the ve-locity of needle insertion will reduce the force of the rupture event when it increases the energy release rate. A nonlinear viscoelastic Kelvin model is then used to predict the relationship between the deformation of tissue and the rupture force at different velocities. The model predicts that rupture deformation and work asymp-totically approach minimum values as needle velocity increases. Consequently, most of the benefit of using a higher needle velocity can be achieved using a finite velocity that is inversely propor-tional to the relaxation time of the tissue. Experiments confirm the analytical predictions with multilayered porcine cardiac tissue. Index Terms—Cutting, fracture, highly deformable bodies, needle insertion, surgical robotics, tissue dynamics.

To detect whether the needle has reached the target, the physician usually relies on physically sensing the amount of force being fed back from the tip of the needle to their fingertip.

40|$|Abstract—Breast biopsy {{guided by}} imaging {{techniques}} such as ultrasound is widely used to evaluate suspicious masses within the breast. The current procedure allows the physician to determine the location and extent of a tumor in the patient breast before inserting the needle. However, there are several problems with this procedure: the complex interaction dynamics between the <b>needle</b> <b>force</b> and the breast tissue will likely displace the tumor from its original position necessitating multiple insertions, causing surgeons ’ fatigue, patient’s discomfort, and compromising {{the integrity of the}} tissue specimen. In this work, we present a new concept for real-time manipulation of a tumor using a robotic controller that monitors the image of the tumor to generate appropriate external force to position the tumor at a desired location. The idea here is to demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} manipulate a tumor in real-time by applying controlled external force in an automated way such that the tumor does not deviate from the path of the needle. A laboratory experiment has been presented on a phantom that demonstrates the essence of this concept. The success of this approach has the potential to reduce the number of attempts a surgeon makes to capture the desired tissue specimen, minimize tissue damage, improve speed of biopsy, and reduce patient discomfort...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} an evaluation study using a force feedback evaluation framework for a novel direct <b>needle</b> <b>force</b> volume rendering concept {{in the context}} of liver puncture simulation. PTC/PTCD puncture interventions targeting the bile ducts have been selected to illustrate this concept. The haptic algorithms of the simulator system are based on (1) partially segmented patient image data and (2) a non-linear spring model effective at organ borders. The primary aim is to quantitatively evaluate force errors caused by our patient modeling approach, in comparison to haptic force output obtained from using gold-standard, completely manually-segmented data. The evaluation of the force algorithms compared to a force output from fully manually segmented gold-standard patient models, yields a low mean of 0. 12 N root mean squared force error and up to 1. 6 N for systematic maximum absolute errors. Force errors were evaluated on 31, 222 preplanned test paths from 10 patients. Only twelve percent of the emitted forces along these paths were affected by errors. This is the first study evaluating haptic algorithms with deformable virtual patients in silico. We prove haptic rendering plausibility on a very high number of test paths.

Alterations in the force transmission pathways assessed in hypertrophied dog hearts by micro-ergometry qualitatively confirm structural remodelling in so far as an irregularity in the transmural rotation of the main stress vector was found. The measured disparities between the alignment of the myocardial f ibre weave and the direction of stress transmission both in the normal and the diseased heart is widely individual, and hence, scattering of the data is marked. However, it must also be called into consideration that the measured orientation of force vectors is that at the moment of highest developed force, only. Further investigations will elucidate if discrepancies between that force vector and morphology are less pronounced when the vector is averaged over the entire heart cycle...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for real-time dynamic monitoring of force experienced by a spinal needle during lumbar puncture using a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor is presented. The proposed FBG force device (FBGFD) evaluates the compressive {{force on the}} spinal needle during lumbar puncture, particularly avoiding the bending effect on the needle. The working principle of the FBGFD is based on transduction of force experienced by the spinal needle into strain variations monitored by the FBG sensor. FBGFD facilitates external mounting of a spinal needle for its smooth insertion during lumbar puncture without any intervention. The developed FBGFD assists study {{and analysis of the}} force required for the spinal needle to penetrate various tissue layers from skin to the epidural space; this force is indicative of the varied resistance offered by different tissue layers for the spinal needle traversal. Calibration of FBGFD is performed on a micro-universal testing machine for 0 to 20 N range with an obtained resolution of 0. 021 N. The experimental trials using spinal needles mounted on FBGFD are carried out on a human cadaver specimen with punctures made in the lumbar region from different directions. Distinct forces are recorded when the needle encounters skin, muscle tissue, and a bone in its traversing path. Real-time spinal <b>needle</b> <b>force</b> monitoring using FBGFD may reduce potentially serious complications during the lumbar puncture, such as overpuncturing of tissue regions, by impeding the spinal needle insertion at epidural space.

Needle biopsy is one of the most common medical procedures to cut and remove tissue for pathological diagnosis. Currently little study has focused on hollow needle tissue cutting. This lack of knowledge has led to the use of biopsy needles and devices that are inefficient at cutting tissue, thereby hindering the accuracy of the diagnosis, increasing the discomfort to the patient, and lengthening the procedure time. This dissertation directly fills this void in hollow needle tissue cutting knowledge to improve the yield of biopsy and advance the understanding of hollow needle tissue cutting in biopsy. This study is conducted in four topics that build on each other to reach the ultimate goal of developing the novel ECE biopsy needle. First, analytical models of needle geometry are developed for identification of inclination angle, normal rake angle, needle tip insertion length, and needle tip area on a variety of flat plane and curved needle tips. Second, oblique tissue cutting is studied through blade and needle tissue cutting experiments and three analytical models are developed to describe tissue flow angle and needle contact length. Third, a general hollow <b>needle</b> insertion <b>force</b> model is developed to predict <b>needle</b> insertion <b>force.</b> Fourth, a novel ECE needle tip is developed based on positive geometrical characteristics discovered by the force model for cutting tissue.

The value of the interaction stiffness is evaluated by comparing results from experiments and simulation. A mechanical needle insertion device is used to insert needles. Needle deflection during insertion is determined using a needle tip tracking algorithm. Results of this study provide insight into the mechanics of needle-tissue interaction, and can be used in studies for robotically steering needles into soft tissue...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with deriving a dynamic model of a moderately flexible needle inserted into soft tissue, where the model’s output is the needle deflection. The main advantages of the proposed dynamic modeling approach are that the presented model structure involves parameters that are all measurable or identifiable by simple exper-iments and that it considers the same inputs that are currently used in the clinical practice of manual needle insertion. Conventional manual needle insertion suffers {{from the fact that}} flexible needles bend during insertion and their trajectories often vary from those planned, resulting in positioning errors. Enhancement of needle insertion accuracy via robot-assisted needle steering has received significant attention in the past decade. A common assumption in previous research has been that the needle behavior during insertion can be adequately described by static models relating the <b>needle’s</b> <b>forces</b> and torques to its deflection. For closed-loop control purposes, however, a dynamic model of the flexible needle in soft tissue is desired. In this paper, we propose a Lagrangian-based dynamic model for the coupled needle/tissue system, and analyze the response of the dynamic system. Steerability (controllability) analysis is also performed, which is onl...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} scheme to produce {{realistic}} force reflection in a needle insertion problem. The target system is the spine needle biopsy simulator for tumor inspection by <b>needle</b> insertion. Simulated <b>force</b> is calculated using the 3 D human tissue model, the orientation and position of the <b>needle,</b> and this <b>force</b> is produced through the PHANToMTM device. To generate realistic force reflection, the directional <b>force</b> of the <b>needle</b> has been generated by related tissue model, and the other rotational force is generated using a pivot to keep the needle in the initial inserted direction after puncturing the skin. Since the haptic device has limitation for generating high stiffness and large damping, scale downed model and digital filter are used to stabilize the system. 1...|$|R
30|$|Needle {{insertion}} {{is commonly}} used {{as a means of}} administering medication or anesthetics, performing biopsies, and aspirating fluids. Certain needle insertion procedures, such as percutaneous ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation, are classified as types of minimally invasive surgery. If such procedures were performed without any image of the patient, however, human error may result in the insertion of the needle into an unintended target. Although needle insertion can be performed with the aid of an ultrasound (US) image, US images cannot be used for patients with large amounts of body fat. Furthermore, detecting the position of a needle in a US image requires considerable technical expertise. To detect whether the needle has reached the target, the physician usually relies on physically sensing the amount of force being fed back from the tip of the needle to their fingertip. Detection success thus varies according to the degree of proficiency of the individual. Thus, {{it would be possible to}} improve the insertion accuracy if a visual representation of the <b>needle</b> tip <b>force</b> could be provided to the physician. The current study focused on the regions where the <b>needle</b> tip <b>force</b> changes sharply upon reaching a target, such as the cava, blood vessels, and cancerous tumors.|$|R
