These methods {{are based on a}} noncompetitive type of assay using <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> rather than a competitive one. One of the greatest obstacles limiting the sensitivity of noncompetitive immunoassay methods using <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> is the nonspecific binding of labeled reactants to <b>solid</b> <b>phase.</b> A novel method (immune complex transfer immunoassay method) to overcome this difficulty has been developed. In the initially developed method, antibodies in test serum were reacted with dinitrophenylated biotinylated antigen. The complex formed was trapped onto (anti-dinitrophenyl group) IgG-coated <b>solid</b> <b>phase.</b> The <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> was washed to eliminate nonspecific immunoglobulins. The complex was eluted from the <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> with dinitrophenyl-L-lysine, again trapped onto avidin(streptavidin) -coated <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> and finally measured by reaction with (anti-immunoglobulin) Fab'-enzyme conjugate. Namely, the complex of antibodies and dinitrophenylated biotinylated antigen was transferred from one solid to another, effectively eliminating nonspecific immunoglobulins nonspecifically adsorbed onto the first <b>solid</b> <b>phase.</b> By this method with and without further modifications, the sensitivity for antibodies in serum has been considerably improved. The same principle of immune complex transfer has been applied to the detection of antigens, and one milliattomole (600 molecules) of human ferritin has been detected.

40|$|Amongst {{organophosphate}} pesticides, the {{one most}} widely used and common environmental contaminant is diazinon; thus methods for its trace analysis in environmental samples must be developed. Use of diazinon imprinted polymers such as sorbents in <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> extraction, is a prominent and novel application area of molecular imprinted polymers. For diazinon extraction, high performance liquid chromatography analysis was demonstrated in this study. During optimization of the molecular imprinted <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> extraction procedure for efficient <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> extraction of diazinon, Plackett-Burman design was conducted. Eight experimental factors with critical influence on molecular imprinted <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> extraction performance were selected, and 12 different experimental runs based on Plackett-Burman design were carried out. The applicability of diazinon imprinted polymers as the sorbent in <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> extraction, presented obtained good recoveries of diazinon from LC-grade water. An increase in pH caused {{an increase in the}} recovery on molecular imprinted <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> extraction. From these results, the optimal molecular imprinted <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> extraction procedure was as follows: <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> extraction packing with 100 mg diazinon imprinted polymers; conditioning with 5 mL of methanol and 6 mL of LC-grade water; sample loading containing diazinon (pH= 10); washing with 1 mL of LC-grade water, 1 mL LC- grade water containing 30 % acetonitrile and 0. 5 mL of acetonitrile, respectively; eluting with 1 mL of methanol containing 2 % acetic acid. The percentage recoveries obtained by the optimized molecular imprinted <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> extraction were more than 90 % with drinking water spiked at different trace levels of diazinon.
