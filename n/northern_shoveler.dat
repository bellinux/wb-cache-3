50|$|If {{you are on}} {{the look}} out for the <b>{{northern}}</b> <b>shoveler,</b> you might want to check out Weed Lake. They can also be found near ponds and marshes in the prairies of Western Canada. The <b>northern</b> <b>shoveler</b> is a duck that swims in shallow water and makes a nest on the land nearby. Be careful not to confuse this bird with the mallard. The <b>northern</b> <b>shoveler</b> male has a green head, red bottom and a white, brown and a light gray chest. Try not to get mixed up because a female <b>northern</b> <b>shoveler</b> and female mallard ducks, look the same. Male northern shovelers' eyes look different then male mallard ducks, they are yellow. Animal that prey on northern shovelers include red foxes, raccoons, owls, hawks, minks, crows, skunks and coyotes. They build their nest by water. In their nest, there are 8-12 eggs laid. When the duckling hatches, it will fledge - grow feathers large enough to fly. This usually takes 40-70 days. The <b>northern</b> <b>shoveler</b> communicates with a quiet quack, mostly heard at spring courtship. In the fall, it migrates to Mexico for the winter. Males weigh 17-38, females weigh 17-28 and the wingspan is 31 inches long. The <b>northern</b> <b>shoveler</b> diet is pondweed, bulrush, various grasses, sedges and algae.|$|E

40|$|Interactions among {{commercial}} fisheries and birds {{have been studied}} in open ocean ecosystems and at aquaculture facilities. On the Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, USA, a commercial harvest of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) eggs (i. e. cysts) occurs annually during fall and winter. Coinciding with commercial harvest {{is the use of}} the GSL by millions of waterbirds which has the potential to result in conflict among industry and birds. The objectives of my research were to examine fall and winter ecology of birds using the GSL and interactions with the brine shrimp cyst harvest. I examined the influence of temperature and food availability on the number and distribution of waterfowl and eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis). I also assessed the diets of the same species to see how much cyst biomass is being consumed by birds compared to removal by commercial harvest. A mass die-off (i. e. downing) of migrating eared grebes occurred during my research, so I assessed differences among birds that died and those that did not to better explain this phenomenon. Finally, I assessed the breeding origin of <b>northern</b> <b>shovelers</b> (Anas clypeata) wintering on the GSL using stable isotopeand banding data. I found that commercial harvest boats did not influence duck population numbersor distribution; rather temperature and food availability most influenced abundance and distribution, though this influence varied by species. Compared to commercial harvest, <b>northern</b> <b>shovelers,</b> green-winged teal (Anas crecca), and eared grebes removed {{a small fraction of the}} total amount of cysts that were removed from the GSL. Waterfowl diets were mainly wetland plant seeds during fall and spring, but when freshwater marshes were frozen in winter, ducks ate mostly brine shrimp cysts and brine fly (Ephydra spp.) larvae. Eared grebes are highly associated with saltwater habitats and they consumed adult brine shrimp most of the fall. Eared grebes that perished during the downing had mercury and selenium concentrations above levels seen in pre- and post-downing birds and higher than observed concentration that impact bird species, providing a potential ultimate cause of death during snowstorms that accompany most downings. Stable isotope analysis indicated <b>northern</b> <b>shovelers</b> that winter on the GSL had breeding origins throughout the specie’s range, but most came from local or southern Prairie Pothole Region breeding populations...|$|R
50|$|It is {{strongly}} migratory and winters further south than its breeding range. It has occasionally been reported as a vagrant {{as far south}} as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. It is not as gregarious as some dabbling ducks outside the breeding season and tends to form only small flocks. Among North America's duck species, <b>northern</b> <b>shovelers</b> trail only mallards and blue-winged teal in overall abundance. Their populations have been healthy since the 1960s, and have soared in recent years to more than 5 million birds (2015), most likely because of favorable breeding, migration, and wintering habitat conditions.|$|R
50|$|Cobbs Lake {{is a large}} shallow lake {{which forms}} around the creek during the spring thaw.

50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>shovelers</b> feed by dabbling {{for plant}} food, often by {{swinging}} its bill {{from side to}} side and using the bill to strain food from the water.

Their wide-flat bill is equipped with well-developed lamellae - small, comb-like structures {{on the edge of the}} bill that act like sieves, allowing the birds to skim crustaceans and plankton from the water's surface. This adaptation, more specialized in shovelers, gives them an advantage over other puddle ducks, with which they do not have to compete for food resources during most of the year.
