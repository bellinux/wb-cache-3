5|$|The {{cluster of}} keys {{at the bottom}} of the upper joint (protruding {{slightly}} beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the trill keys and are operated by the right hand. These give the player alternative fingerings that make it easy to play ornaments and trills. The entire weight of the smaller clarinets is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on what is called the thumb-rest. Basset horns and larger clarinets are supported with a <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> or a floor peg.|$|E

25|$|The bassoon is held diagonally {{in front}} of the player, but unlike the flute, oboe and clarinet, it cannot be easily {{supported}} by the player's hands alone. Some means of additional support is usually required; the most common ones are a seat strap attached {{to the base of the}} boot joint, which is laid across the chair seat prior to sitting down, or a <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> or shoulder harness attached to the top of the boot joint. Occasionally a spike similar to those used for the cello or the bass clarinet is attached to the bottom of the boot joint and rests on the floor. It is possible to play while standing up if the player uses a <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> or similar harness, or if the seat strap is tied to the belt. Sometimes a device called a balance hanger is used when playing in a standing position. This is installed between the instrument and the <b>neck</b> <b>strap,</b> and shifts the point of support closer to the center of gravity, adjusting the distribution of weight between the two hands.|$|E

25|$|His {{expertise}} in color photography subsequently {{brought him to}} National Geographic magazine, where he was officially hired on July 23, 1934. The magazine prided itself on publishing quality color photography, and Marden was making good use of a lightweight Leica, which could hang from a single <b>neck</b> <b>strap.</b> Marden persuaded the magazine to see the benefits of using the small 35mm cameras loaded with the new Kodachrome film over the bulky cameras with tripods and glass plates that were {{being used by the}} magazine's photographers at the time.|$|E
25|$|Polo saddles are English-style, close contact, {{similar to}} jumping saddles; {{although}} most polo saddles lack a flap under the billets. Some players {{will not use}} a saddle blanket. The saddle has a flat seat and no knee support; the rider adopting a forward-leaning seat and closed knees dissimilar to a classical dressage seat. A breastplate is added, usually attached to the front billet. A standing martingale must be used: so, a breastplate is a necessity for safety. The tie-down is usually supported by a <b>neck</b> <b>strap.</b> Many saddles also have an overgirth. The stirrup irons are heavier than most, and the stirrup leathers are wider and thicker, for added safety when the player stands in the stirrups. The legs of the pony are wrapped with polo wraps from below the knee to the fetlock to minimize pain. Jumping (open front) or gallop boots are sometimes used along with the polo wraps for added protection. Often, these wraps match the team colours. The pony's mane is most often roached (hogged), and its tail is docked or braided {{so that it will}} not snag the rider's mallet.|$|E
2500|$|In a few {{models of}} scuba {{regulator}} the mouthpiece {{also has an}} outer rubber flange that fits outside the lips and extends into two straps that fasten together behind the neck. This helps to keep the mouthpiece in place if the user's jaws go slack through unconsciousness or distraction. The mouthpiece safety flange {{may also be a}} separate component. The attached <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> also allows the diver to keep the regulator hanging under the chin where it is protected and ready for use. Recent mouthpieces do not usually include an external flange, but the practice of using a <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> has been revived by technical divers who use a bungee or surgical rubber [...] "necklace" [...] which can come off the mouthpiece without damage if pulled firmly.|$|E

The Pickens fight song {{is titled}} [...] "When the Flame Goes Burning In", which is a variant of [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In".When the team scores, the drumline plays a cadence called [...] "Bananas" [...] This cadence begins with rolls {{up and down the}} bass drums, interspersed with the student section {{and the rest of the}} band shouting [...] "Go Blue Flame" [...] This is followed by a solo played on the tenors, while the rest of the band adds visual effect. The drums twirl their sticks, the saxophones and bass clarinets twirls their <b>neck</b> <b>straps,</b> and the rest of the members dance. When this ends, the drumline starts up a lively cadence to which the crowd spells out Pickens. Right after the 'C', the band all scream [...] "Yeah Boy", and the drumline plays a triplet to get everyone on beat. After Pickens is spelled out, the entire crowd yells, [...] "Pickens, Blue Flame, fight, fight, fight!" [...] This is followed by a short tenor solo. This solo can be many different things.

50|$|Pottery {{made by the}} Caborn-Welborn {{women was}} built up from strips of clay, and then {{smoothed}} out by the potter, much like other pottery in the Eastern America area, where the potters wheel was unknown. Common vessel shapes include jars, bowls, pans, plates and funnels. Most jars tend to have rims with rounded <b>necks</b> and <b>strap</b> handles. The majority of the pottery found at Caborn-Welborn sites are of the kinds known as Mississippian Plain and Bell Plain, which are varieties very common to most Mississippian cultures throughout the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. It was buff colored, contains large fragments of ground mussel shell as a tempering agent, and is not as smooth and polished as other varieties.|$|R
50|$|Martingales {{are usually}} {{attached}} to the horse one of two ways. They are either {{attached to the}} center chest ring of a breastplate or, if no breastplate is worn, they are attached by two straps, one that goes around the horse's neck, and the other that attaches to the girth, with the martingale itself beginning at {{the point in the}} center of the chest where the <b>neck</b> and girth <b>straps</b> intersect.|$|R

50|$|Klezmer {{instrument}} {{choices were}} traditionally based, by necessity, on an instrument's portability. Music being required for several {{parts of the}} wedding ceremony, taking place in different rooms or courtyards, the band had to relocate quickly from space to space. Further, klezmorim were usually itinerant musicians, who moved {{from town to town}} for work. Therefore, instruments held in the hands (clarinet, violin, trumpet, flute) or supported by a <b>neck</b> or shoulder <b>strap</b> (accordion, cimbalom, drum) were favored over those that rested on the ground (cello, bass violin), or needed several people to move (piano).|$|R

60|$|A {{week later}} Frank Mallett {{was sitting in}} a chair by his bedside. The {{fighting}} was all over, and a strange quiet had succeeded the long roar of battle. His <b>neck</b> was <b>strapped</b> up with bandages, and save that he was unable to move his head in the slightest degree, he felt well enough to take his place with the regiment again. Many of his fellow officers dropped in from time to time for a short chat, but the duty was heavy. All open resistance had ceased, but the troops were engaged in searching the houses, and turning out all rough characters who had made Lucknow their centre, and had no visible means of subsistence. Large gangs of the lower class population were set to work to bury the dead, which would otherwise have rendered the city uninhabitable. Strong guards were posted at night, alike to prevent soldiers from wandering in search of loot and to prevent fanatics from making sudden attacks.|$|R

50|$|<b>Neck</b> <b>strap.</b> A simple narrow {{leather strap}} buckled around a horse's neck to give {{security}} to jockeys and other riders. Up until several years it was only used by beginner riders, but has now become popular with jockeys who ride with a very short stirrup leather. Another form of <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> (or rope) is the one used by cowboys when roping. This style is shorter and placed closer to the horse's head with the lariat passing through it, {{in order to keep}} the horse facing the calf after it has been roped. It also refers to the part of a martingale, which buckles around the horse's neck. A loose neck collar is also used on harness racing horses when the reins are passed through it.|$|E
