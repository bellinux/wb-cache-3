5|$|Construction {{was mostly}} done by volunteers; the {{building}} of the stadium required 31,000 man-hours in volunteer work and cost NOK 150,000. After the land was cleared, a layer of mixed sand and earth were laid. The pitch, with the dimensions , was sown in mid-1950. The work also included a grandstand, changing rooms, a watering system and kiosks. The stand could accommodate 2,500 spectators, and the stadium had a total permitted capacity of 6,000 people. The inaugural match was played against Sarpsborg on 7 July 1951 in front of 3,500 spectators. A training pitch beside the stadium pitch opened in 1953. The following year, a <b>new</b> <b>steel</b> entrance was built, following in 1955 with a referees' changing room and administrative offices. In 1959, after eight years of planning, construction of an additional terrace started, which opened in 1960.|$|E

50|$|In the 'Think Big' era of New Zealand industrialisation, {{the mill}} was upgraded. In 1987, <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Steel</b> was {{acquired}} by Equiticorp. However, Equiticorp was bankrupted in the New Zealand sharemarket crash of 1987. In 1989 <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Steel</b> {{was acquired by}} Helenus Corporation, which consisted of Fisher & Paykel, Steel & Tube, ANZ and BHP. In 1992, BHP took up a controlling interest with an 81% shareholding by acquiring the shares of Fisher & Paykel and Steel & Tube. The company was initially renamed BHP <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Steel</b> Limited, but in 2002 it was renamed <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Steel</b> when BHP Steel was listed on Australian stockmarket under the name Bluescope Steel.|$|R
50|$|From 1965 the Victorian Railways {{introduced}} the Train of Knowledge, essentially a mobile school camp for week-long tours. The train {{made use of}} the E type sleeping cars for students and teachers, as they were increasingly being displaced by <b>newer</b> <b>steel</b> cars.|$|R
5|$|From 1937 <b>new</b> <b>steel</b> O stock trains, with doors {{remotely}} {{operated by the}} guard, replaced the wooden-bodied trains dating from 1906. It had been intended to operate the new trains with four or six cars, but after initial problems with the traction current only six-car formations were used. Services to Kensington (Olympia) via the curve at Latimer Road were suspended in 1940 after bomb damage to the West London line and not restarted after the war. When the similar trains running on the Circle line were lengthened to six cars in 1959 and 1960, the stock of the two lines was integrated with maintenance at Hammersmith depot. Aluminium C Stock trains, with public address systems and originally unpainted, replaced these trains from 1970. One person operation was proposed in 1972, but due to conflict with the trade unions was not introduced until 1984.|$|E
5|$|The South Stand of the rugby ground {{formed a}} {{complete}} unit with the North Stand of the National Stadium. Now the same {{structure of the}} South Stand of the rugby ground is also physically attached to the North Stand of the Millennium Stadium. This section is known colloquially as Glanmor's Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, former chair and President of the WRU. This came about because the WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the Millennium Stadium, and the National Lottery Commission would not provide any additional funds {{to be used for}} the construction of a new ground for Cardiff RFC. The Millennium Stadium was therefore built with the old reinforced concrete structure of the National Stadium (North Stand) and the <b>new</b> <b>steel</b> Millennium Stadium structure built around it.|$|E
5|$|These {{methods of}} steel {{production}} were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz process of {{basic oxygen steelmaking}} (BOS), developed in the 1950s, and other oxygen steel making methods. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used. Today, electric arc furnaces (EAF) are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create <b>new</b> <b>steel.</b> They {{can also be used}} for converting pig iron to steel, but they use a lot of electrical energy (about 440 kWh per metric ton), and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity.|$|E

Before steel was superseded by lighter materials, riders using Mercian won {{national and international}} competitions.|$|R
5|$|TCI was {{not fully}} {{incorporated}} into U. S. Steel, {{and continued to}} operate as an extremely profitable subsidiary of its parent company well into the 20th century. Immediately following the merger, a venture was launched to create a new, larger TCI plant {{to the west of}} Ensley and {{at the center of a}} new company town, and so in 1910 work on the planned community of Corey, Alabama, began. Named after an executive who later committed suicide, Corey was soon renamed Fairfield, and the steel works there opened in 1917. With the discovery of new coking coal and ore deposits in the region, and with the aid of U. S. Steel's enormous capital, the Fairfield works were quickly expanded with the construction of <b>new</b> <b>steel</b> mills and rail links. Several rolling mills were completed in 1917, which produced ship materials for the nearby shipbuilding plants in Chickasaw, Alabama, in support of America's sudden entry into World War I. In 1920 a direct rail line between Fairfield and Birmingport, the new port of Birmingham on the Warrior River was opened. This was followed by the completion of the 'High Ore Line Railroad', which connected the Red Mountain and the Fairfield works; trains literally rolled down the hill from mine to mill. In 1923 a merchant steel mill was completed, followed by the opening of a sheet products mill in 1926.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} closed to motor {{vehicles}} on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening. It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months, but after {{the condition of the}} bridge was found to be worse than expected, it was closed for 22 months. All of the timber in the decking as well as the footway that had rotted away were replaced, with additional timber added for strengthening. Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement decking were replaced. <b>New</b> <b>steel</b> structures were added to strengthen the bridge. All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy-efficient ones. The tollbooths were refurbished. All twelve layers of paint were stripped down until the bare metal was exposed, which was repaired and treated before three new coats of paint were added. The whole project cost £7.2 million of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25% of the cost and the other 75% was provided by Transport for London.|$|E

40|$|There is {{currently}} an extensive {{effort to develop}} <b>new</b> <b>steels</b> with a better combination of strength and ductility, the so-called Ultra-High Strength Steels (UHSS) and Advanced High Strength <b>Steels</b> (AHSS). The <b>new</b> <b>steels</b> {{must be able to}} be manufactured using existing plant {{and at the same time}} meet ever decreasing cost demands. This study looks at developing AHSS, with a focus primarily on the microalloying precipitation behaviour and microstructural evolution during thermomechanical processing of transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) assisted steels. This approach combines two mechanisms that are known to enhance properties, namely the TRIP effect and precipitation hardening arising from strain induced precipitation. In respect of the TRIP effect, a detailed investigation was undertaken to look at the effect of the intercritical anneal on strength and ductility. For the strain induced precipitation, the effect of combined microalloy additions was investigated. Initially, the effect of intercritical annealing was studied using a trial as-cold rolled multiphase V microalloyed TRIP assisted steel with a polygonal ferrite matrix (1. 5 Mn C+Si+Al+N≈ 1. 0 (C 0. 2) and V˂ 0. 2 wt...|$|R
