[...] Actor Sean Bean, who portrays Ned in the HBO television series, said when asked in a 2014 interview about returning to the series to appear in flashbacks, [...] "I've definitely got some unfinished business that <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> there. I'm obviously not Jon Snow's dad. And you need that to be revealed at some point, don't you?" [...] The uncertainty arises from anecdotal evidence in the texts interpreted by readers to connect the mysterious maternity of Ned's son with the vague backstory of his sister Lyanna.|$|E
2500|$|The precise {{distance}} at which acuity is measured {{is not important}} {{as long as it}} is sufficiently far away and the size of the optotype on the retina is the same. That size is specified as a visual angle, which is the angle, at the eye, under which the optotype appears. For 6/6 = 1.0 acuity, the size of a letter on the Snellen chart or Landolt C chart is a visual angle of 5 arc minutes (1 arc min = 1/60 of a degree). By the design of a typical optotype (like a Snellen E or a Landolt C), the critical gap that <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> is 1/5 this value, i.e., 1 arc min.
