500|$|Although both of Vonnegut's {{parents were}} fluent German speakers, the ill feeling toward that country {{during and after}} World War I caused the Vonneguts to abandon that culture to show their American patriotism. Thus, they did not teach their {{youngest}} son German or introduce him to German literature and tradition, leaving him feeling [...] "ignorant and rootless." [...] Vonnegut later credited Ida Young, his family's African-American cook and housekeeper for the first 10 years of his life, for raising him and giving him values. [...] " [...] gave me decent moral instruction and was exceedingly <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> So she was as great an influence on me as anybody." [...] Vonnegut described Young as [...] "humane and wise", adding that [...] "the compassionate, forgiving aspects of [...] beliefs" [...] came from her.|$|E
500|$|A reclusive gifted {{musician}} and writer, Daniel changed his surname from Pinter to Brand, the maiden {{name of his}} maternal grandmother, before Pinter and Fraser became romantically involved; while according to Fraser, his father couldn't understand it, {{she says that she}} could: [...] "Pinter is such a distinctive name that he must have got tired of being asked, 'Any relation? [...] Michael Billington wrote that Pinter saw Daniel's name change as [...] "a largely pragmatic move on Daniel's part designed to keep the press... at bay." [...] Fraser told Billington that Daniel [...] "was very <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{at a time when it}} would have been only too easy for him to have turned on me... simply because he had been the sole focus of his father's love and now manifestly wasn't." [...] Still unreconciled at the time of his father's death, Daniel Brand did not attend Pinter's funeral.|$|E

[...] " [...] was the strangest {{day of my life}} because I was in a room with all these famous people." [...] He added: [...] "It was completely different to how I imagined it would be. Everyone's been really <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and it's going well." [...] Prior to the airing of the Connor family's arrival on the famous cobblestone street in August 2006, Thompson commented, [...] "I can't say too much about Ryan and the story lines, but he's very mischievous. The character is not a bad lad, but he's not a good lad either." [...] Garth Philips, series producer, said at the time, [...] "We held extensive casting sessions to get this family right, and the energy that Sean, Rob, Kym and Ben have will certainly make them a joy to watch on screen." [...] He continued, [...] "They're a twenty-first century Coronation Street family, and we hope our viewers will be as enthralled and excited by them as we are." ...|$|E

500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E
500|$|The fear in of {{the fourth}} floor refers to tetraphobia, the superstitious fear of the number four. Jokes about this have been {{featured}} in such pop culture works as the 1999 film Being John Malkovich and the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. The song [...] "Unskinny Bop", a 1990 single by the band Poison, plays {{during one of the}} strip club scenes. Leslie said Tom hides his emotions behind [...] "a very thick layer of Axe body spray", a reference to the real-life male grooming product. The Parks department employees eat at a restaurant called Jurassic Fork, a reference to the Steven Spielberg dinosaur adventure film Jurassic Park, which was adapted from a novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. During one scene, Tom refers to Ron as [...] "Rondoleezza Rice", a reference to former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. At the strip club, Leslie mistakenly refers to a stripper named Sierra by the name Seabiscuit, a champion thoroughbred racehorse. Reflecting on his marriage, Tom said, [...] "At least we lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and that guy from Sum 41", a reference to the pop singer's short-lived marriage to Sum 41 guitarist Deryck Whibley. Tom says one of the strippers also works at Quiznos, a sandwich fast-food franchise; Tom says of her: [...] "She's really <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> here, but really mean to me at Quiznos." [...] Andy said he has a T-shirt that is [...] "literally priceless" [...] because he was wearing it when he tackled American singer Eddie Vedder. When Ron was commenting on how well Tom was pretending to be sad about his divorce, he tells Tom, [...] "Take it down a notch. You've already won your Oscar, DiCaprio," [...] which is a reference to the Academy Awards and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.|$|E
2500|$|That is {{when the}} man Herrera had {{believed}} to be his father gave him the stunning news of his Mexican birth, and said, [...] "Son, you don't have to go, they can't draft you...you aren't an American citizen." [...] Even {{in the face of}} these multiple shocks, and a perfect opportunity to dodge the war, Herrera was unswayed. [...] As he later related, [...] "I thought, I'm going anyway. [...] I didn't want anybody to die in my place... I felt that I had my adopted country that had been so <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] I thought, I have an American wife and the kids and one on the way." [...] It was only the first of several life-changing acts of heroism Herrera would take.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Cameron {{was labeled}} selfish and cruel by one collaborator, author Orson Scott Card, {{who had been}} hired a decade earlier to work with Cameron on the novelization of The Abyss. Card said the {{experience}} was [...] "hell on wheels. He was very <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> because I could afford to walk away. But he made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of working with people, I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people." [...] He later alluded to Cameron in his review of Me and Orson Welles, where he described witnessing a famous director chew out an assistant for his own error.|$|E
