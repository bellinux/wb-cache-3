5|$|STAC {{suggested}} that two designs naturally {{fell out of}} their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan {{suggested that}} a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £75 to £90million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962. Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.|$|E

Although still in prime operating condition, thanks to a diligent maintenance program, the cost of custom-made replacement parts and the tramway's limited passenger capacity made replacement desirable and economically practical. The replacement project was authorized by the New Hampshire legislature in 1977 after a study by consulting engineer Robert Heron proved the project feasible.|$|E
25|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} men who choose active {{surveillance}} for early stage tumors eventually have signs of tumor progression, and they may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> treatment within three years. Men that choose active surveillance avoid the risks of surgery, radiation, and other treatments. The risk of disease progression and metastasis (spread of the cancer) may be increased, but this increase risk appears to be small if the program of surveillance is followed closely, generally including serial PSA assessments and repeat prostate biopsies every 1–2 years depending on the PSA trends.|$|E

25|$|Cassiodorus devoted much of {{his life}} to {{supporting}} education within the Christian community at large. When his proposed theological university in Rome was denied, he was forced to re-examine his entire approach to how material was learned and interpreted. His Variae show that, like Augustine of Hippo, Cassiodorus viewed reading as a transformative act for the reader. It is with this in mind that he designed and mandated the course of studies at the Vivarium, which demanded an intense regimen of reading and meditation. By assigning a specific order of texts to be read, Cassiodorus hoped to create the discipline necessary within the reader to become a successful monk. The first work in this succession of texts would be the Psalms, which the untrained reader would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> with because of its appeal to emotion and temporal goods. By examining the rate at which copies of his Psalmic commentaries were issued, it is fair to assess that as the first work in his series, Cassiodorus's educational agenda had been implemented to some degree of success.|$|E
25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Navy was {{thinking}} along similar lines. A design had been circulated in 1902–03 for [...] "a powerful 'all big-gun' armament of two calibres, viz. four 12-inch and twelve 9.2-inch guns." [...] The Admiralty {{decided to build}} three more s (with a mixture of 12-inch, 9.2-inch and [...] ) in the 1903–04 naval construction programme instead. The all-big-gun concept was revived for the 1904–05 programme, the [...] Restrictions on length and beam meant the midships 9.2-inch turrets became single instead of twin, thus giving an armament of four 12-inch, ten 9.2-inch and no 6-inch. The constructor for this design, J.H. Narbeth, submitted an alternative drawing showing an armament of twelve 12-inch guns, but the Admiralty {{was not prepared to}} accept this. Part of the rationale for the decision to retain mixed-calibre guns was the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> the building of the ships quickly because of the tense situation produced by the Russo-Japanese War.|$|E

Menzies replied that he could not authorise the test until after the Australian federal election, to be held on 28 April 1951, but was willing to allow work to continue. Menzies was re-elected, and the Australian government formally agreed in May 1951. On 28 May, Attlee sent a comprehensive list of assistance that it hoped that Australia would provide. A more detailed survey was requested, which was carried out by [...] in July and August 1951. [...] The British government emphasised the importance of security, so as not to imperil its negotiations with the United States.

[...] Although General Clinton had {{dispatched}} Brigadier General Benedict Arnold to Virginia to threaten Greene's supply lines, Cornwallis needed {{to deal with the}} wily general. [...] Greene had detached Brigadier General Daniel Morgan with a light infantry corps to cause trouble in the highlands of South Carolina. [...] Cornwallis sent Tarleton with a sizable force to chase down Morgan. [...] In a tactically brilliant battle at Hannah's Cowpens on January 17, 1781, Morgan decisively defeated Tarleton, capturing most of his force. [...] News of the battle so upset the earl that he was reported to snap a sword. [...] He wrote that [...] "he late affair has almost broke my heart", and vowed to recover the prisoners Morgan had taken. [...] Immediately giving chase, he was unable to gain on Morgan, who, although burdened with prisoners, was not burdened by a large baggage train. [...] Cornwallis, in a move calculated to force his army {{to be able to move}} faster, ordered most of his baggage train destroyed on January 24. [...] Starting with the personal effects of himself and his officers, he ordered the burning of everything except a minimal set of supplies. [...] Cornwallis's second in command, Charles O'Hara, commented that the move [...] "must ever do the greatest honor to Lord Cornwallis' military reputation".|$|E
