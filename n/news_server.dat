25|$|The {{format and}} {{transmission}} of Usenet articles {{is similar to}} that of Internet e-mail messages. The difference between the two is that Usenet articles can be read by any user whose <b>news</b> <b>server</b> carries the group to which the message was posted, as opposed to email messages, which have one or more specific recipients.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases where}} {{unsuitable}} content has been posted, Usenet has support for automated {{removal of a}} posting from the whole network by creating a cancel message, although {{due to a lack}} of authentication and resultant abuse, this capability is frequently disabled. Copyright holders may still request the manual deletion of infringing material using the provisions of World Intellectual Property Organization treaty implementations, such as the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act, but this would require giving notice to each individual <b>news</b> <b>server</b> administrator.|$|E
50|$|Newsgroup servers are {{hosted by}} various {{organizations}} and institutions. Most Internet service providers host their own <b>news</b> <b>servers,</b> or rent access to one, for their subscribers. There {{are also a}} number of companies who sell access to premium <b>news</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|R
50|$|For <b>news</b> <b>servers</b> {{provided}} by Internet Service Providers {{as part of}} a user's subscription package, typical retention rates are usually only 2-4 days. For premium <b>news</b> <b>servers,</b> this often rises to 6-12 months. Many commercial providers are now advancing to 520 or more days of retention.|$|R

25|$|Each <b>news</b> <b>server</b> {{generally}} allocates {{a certain}} amount of storage space for post content in each newsgroup. When this storage has been filled, each time a new post arrives, old posts are deleted {{to make room for the}} new content. If the network bandwidth available to a server is high but the storage allocation is small, it is possible for a huge flood of incoming content to overflow the allocation and push out everything that was in the group before it. If the flood is large enough, the beginning of the flood will begin to be deleted even before the last part of the flood has been posted.|$|E
25|$|Not all ISPs run news servers. A <b>news</b> <b>server</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} Internet services to administer because of the large amount of data involved, small customer base (compared to mainstream Internet services such as email and web access), and a disproportionately high volume of customer support incidents (frequently complaining of missing news articles that are not the ISP's fault). Some ISPs outsource news operation to specialist sites, which will usually appear to a user as though the ISP ran the server itself. Many sites carry a restricted newsfeed, with a limited number of newsgroups. Commonly omitted from such a newsfeed are foreign-language newsgroups and the alt.binaries hierarchy which largely carries software, music, videos and images, and accounts for over 99 percent of article data.|$|E
25|$|Early {{versions}} of Usenet used Duke's A News software, designed {{for one or}} two articles a day. Matt Glickman and Horton at Berkeley produced an improved version called B News that could handle the rising traffic (about 50 articles a day as of late 1983). With a message format that offered compatibility with Internet mail and improved performance, it became the dominant server software. C News, developed by Geoff Collyer and Henry Spencer at the University of Toronto, was comparable to B News in features but offered considerably faster processing. In the early 1990s, InterNetNews by Rich Salz was developed {{to take advantage of the}} continuous message flow made possible by NNTP versus the batched store-and-forward design of UUCP. Since that time INN development has continued, and other <b>news</b> <b>server</b> software has also been developed.|$|E
50|$|XOVER is a Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) command used {{to return}} {{information}} from a <b>news</b> <b>server's</b> overview (NOV) database.|$|R
5000|$|GARR USENET NEWS {{provides}} the Italian feed {{and part of}} the international feed of Usenet news to managers of local <b>news</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many newer <b>news</b> <b>servers</b> store NOV data in {{a variety}} of formats. A {{specialized}} database is frequently used in favor of the original flat file arrangement.|$|R
2500|$|When a user posts an article, it is {{initially}} only available on that user's <b>news</b> <b>server.</b> Each <b>news</b> <b>server</b> talks {{to one or}} more other servers (its [...] "newsfeeds") and exchanges articles with them. In this fashion, the article is copied from server to server and should eventually reach every server in the network. The later peer-to-peer networks operate on a similar principle, but for Usenet it is normally the sender, rather than the receiver, who initiates transfers. Usenet was designed under conditions when networks were much slower and not always available. Many sites on the original Usenet network would connect only once or twice a day to batch-transfer messages in and out. This is largely because the POTS network was typically used for transfers, and phone charges were lower at night.|$|E
50|$|InterNetNews (INN) is a Usenet <b>news</b> <b>server</b> package, {{originally}} {{released by}} Rich Salz in 1991, and {{presented at the}} Summer 1992 USENIX conference in San Antonio, Texas. It was the first <b>news</b> <b>server</b> with integrated NNTP functionality.|$|E

40|$|Newscaster is an {{architecture}} {{and a set}} of protocols for distributing Usenet Netnews via IP multicast enabled networks. The architecture is designed to be useful in the global Internet. In particular, it allows multiple <b>news</b> <b>servers</b> to cooperate on multicasting each new article only once. To facilitate scalability {{to tens of thousands of}} <b>news</b> <b>servers,</b> it also provides for receive-only multicast participants (that continue to send articles via conventional NNTP). First results from an experiment using the Newscaster system for global news distribution are reported. 1...|$|R

50|$|C News is a <b>news</b> <b>server</b> package, {{written by}} Geoff Collyer, {{assisted}} by Henry Spencer, at the University of Toronto {{as a replacement}} for B News. It was presented at the Winter 1987 USENIX conference in Washington, D.C.|$|E
50|$|Some servers, such as INN, allow {{multiple}} storage {{schemes to}} be used at once. Various hybrid storage schemes have also been used in <b>news</b> <b>servers,</b> including different organizations of the file-per-article method, or smaller containers carrying perhaps 100 articles apiece.|$|R
50|$|Usenet was {{originally}} designed {{based on the}} UUCP network, with most article transfers taking place over direct point-to-point telephone links between <b>news</b> <b>servers,</b> which were powerful time-sharing systems. Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles directly from the local disk.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{newsgroup}} hierarchies outside of the Big 8 (and alt.*) that can be found on many <b>news</b> <b>servers.</b> These include non-English language groups, groups managed by companies or organizations about their products, geographic/local hierarchies, and even non-internet network boards routed into NNTP. Examples include (alphabetically): ...|$|R
50|$|Every {{host of a}} <b>news</b> <b>server</b> {{maintains}} {{agreements with}} other nearby news servers to synchronize regularly. In this way news servers form a redundant network. When a user posts to one <b>news</b> <b>server,</b> the post is stored locally. That server then shares posts with the servers that are connected to it for those newsgroups they both carry. Those servers do likewise, propagating the posts through the network. For newsgroups that are not widely carried, sometimes a carrier group is used for crossposting to aid distribution. This is typically only useful for groups that have been removed or newer alt.* groups. Crossposts between hierarchies, outside of the Big 8 and alt.* hierarchies, are prone to failure.|$|E
50|$|Morland J {{then held}} that {{whenever}} a defamatory posting {{is transmitted from}} the defendants' <b>news</b> <b>server,</b> the defendants {{should be regarded as}} having published that posting to customers who accessed the newsgroup containing that posting.
