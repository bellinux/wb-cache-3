5|$|A {{new church}} was <b>needed</b> <b>because</b> the old church needed {{significant}} repair {{and also because}} the growth of Brynsiencyn meant that more people lived there than in Llanidan itself. Like its predecessor, it is dedicated to Nidan, a 7th-century Welsh saint who was the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, on the eastern tip of Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not <b>needed,</b> <b>because</b> the Germans had not developed such weapons.|$|E
5|$|In the East, {{under cover}} of ground fog the field army {{successfully}} withdrew from the Grebbe Line to the East Front without being bombed as had been feared, and disengaged from the gradually pursuing enemy troops. The new position had some severe drawbacks: the inundations were mostly not yet ready and the earthworks and berms <b>needed</b> <b>because</b> trenches would be flooded in the peat soil {{had not yet been}} constructed, so defences had to be improvised to accommodate the much larger number of troops.|$|E

There was one for each turret, and each had the turret/director distance manually set in. They automatically received Relative Target Bearing (bearing from own ship's bow), and Target Range. They corrected the bearing order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo converged on the same point.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, a {{study on}} {{improving}} the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel by either building another tube or by constructing a bypass was carried out. Based on the study, the turnpike commission planned to replace the deteriorating tunnel with a cut through the mountain. The plans were put on hold in 2001 because it would cost $93.7 million. It resurrected the project in 2009. The nearby Mountain Field and Stream Club prefers that the tunnels are improved or a new tube is built rather than building the bypass. These improvements are <b>needed</b> <b>because</b> the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel is narrow and deteriorating, with disintegrating ceiling slabs and outdated lighting and ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} are <b>needed</b> <b>because</b> {{radar systems}} such as NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{believed that}} the changes were <b>needed</b> <b>because</b> of the collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school leavers at 16 years of age are finding it increasingly more difficult to find employment, consequentially in many cases making them unemployable. Within the last 40 years, the number of unskilled jobs available have more than halved, from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to the increasing demand for skilled labour. This, together with fewer students continuing their further education, increase the difficulty for young school leavers to find work if they were either not able, or chose not to, stay on at school and complete further education.|$|E
5|$|There are {{competing}} views over the appropriate {{role of the}} judiciary in matters concerning preventive detention under the ISA. A related concern is whether the judicial process is suitable for such matters. The legislative and constitutional amendments relating to judicial review under the ISA were intended to limit {{the role of the}} courts in national security matters. In 1989, Law Minister S. Jayakumar argued in Parliament that the amendments were <b>needed</b> <b>because</b> the courts would effectively be responsible for national security matters if judicial review was permitted. The subjective test was deemed necessary to reserve to the executive the responsibility for national security matters, and to enable the Government to deal effectively with security threats.|$|E
5|$|By November, {{proponents of}} the peace coin had {{realized}} that congressional approval was not necessary—as the Morgan dollar had been struck for more than 25 years, it was eligible for replacement {{at the discretion of}} the Secretary of the Treasury under an 1890 act. The Morgan design was then being used for large quantities of silver dollars as the Mint struck replacements for the melted coins under the Pittman Act. Though Congress had not yet convened, Baker contacted Fraser in early November to discuss details of the design competition. According to Burdette, Baker's newfound enthusiasm came from the fact that President Harding was about to formally declare an end to the war with Germany—a declaration <b>needed</b> <b>because</b> the US had not ratified the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, the Washington Conference on disarmament, for which the administration had great hopes, was soon to convene. On November 19, Fraser notified competition participants by personal letter, sending official rules and requirements four days later, with submissions due by December 12. Competition participants included Hermon MacNeil, Victor D. Brenner, and Adolph Weinman, all of whom had designed previous U.S. coins.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the failure}} to remake the game for the WonderSwan Color, and Square's merger with former {{competitor}} Enix to form Square Enix in , the company posted assurance that the game's promised remake would not be completely forgotten, and there was speculation that it might find its way to Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Game Boy Advance as its predecessors had. Square Enix considered porting the game to the PlayStation 2, but was eventually convinced by Nintendo to develop the title for their new handheld system, the Nintendo DS, a decision that would later be positively reinforced by the commercial success of the Nintendo DS. The Final Fantasy III remake was first announced on October 24, 2004, but detailed information did not emerge for a year. Hiromichi Tanaka headed the project as both the executive producer and director. His guidance and supervision were <b>needed</b> <b>because</b> the remake was not a mere graphical update as Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy IIs remakes were, but a total overhaul using the Nintendo DS's 3D capabilities. Along with 3D graphics, a full motion video opening scene was produced for the game, {{similar to those found}} in the ports of the 2D Final Fantasy games for the PlayStation. Programming was handled by developer Matrix Software.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} Miami's post-score kickoff {{needing to}} score quickly {{in order to}} have a chance to have a second opportunity on offense — <b>needed</b> <b>because</b> Tech was now two scores behind. Tech returned the kickoff to the 24-yard line but were penalized 12 yards for an illegal block. Casey passed for an eight-yard gain and ran for three yards for a first down. After that gain, things went against the Hokies. Casey was penalized 15 yards for intentional grounding, and Tech was unable to gain another first down. The Hokies punted, and Miami took over on offense at its 46-yard line. In possession of the lead, Miami began to run out the clock, executing multiple rushing plays in succession in order to force the game clock to continue to count down. Tech's defense forced a stop, but because Miami punted the ball with just 2:20 remaining in the game, there was little chance that Tech would be able to make up the needed two scores.|$|E
