40|$|In this thesis, {{we provide}} an {{empirical}} {{study of the}} relationship between corporate <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management and shareholder wealth in the Nordic countries. The focus on <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management has increased because of the economic crisis that engulfed most of the world in 2008, as firms have turned to their own balance sheets in search for liquidity. The methodology used in this thesis relies on the model proposed by Faulkender and Wang (2006) and later expanded by Kieschnick et al. (2011) to assess the effect of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management on shareholder wealth. By examining 278 listed companies in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland from 2008 through 2013, we find that an additional Norwegian krone invested in <b>net</b> operating <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> is valued at less than one krone by investors. Further, we find that an additional Norwegian krone invested in cash holdings is valued at more than one krone by investors. Second, we find that the importance of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management differs across industries, although our sample prevent us from analyzing all industries. Third, we find that the valuation of an additional Norwegian krone invested in <b>net</b> operating <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> is influenced by a firm’s bankruptcy risk and financial constraints. Fourth, we find that an additional Norwegian krone invested in account receivables is valued more than an additional Norwegian krone invested in inventory. Our results are largely consistent with previous research in this area, although research is scarce. Altogether, the results in this thesis points out the importance of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management on shareholder wealth. nhhma...|$|R

And unlike studies on industrial firms, Return On Equity and Working Capital Flow emerged as two distinctly independent financial ratio groups. Furthermore, the Cash Flow ratios did not differ consistently from their surrogate measures—the Net Income Plus Depreciation ratios.

Within the analysis, indicators such as <b>net</b> situation, <b>working</b> <b>capital,</b> the need of <b>working</b> <b>capital,</b> <b>net</b> treasury and many others were taken into account.

The results of the study have shown significant differences between the analyzes made on different types of balance sheets. These results could open new research directions, such as more detailed analyzes based on the financial balance sheet, but could also raise the awareness of the stakeholders (except the governments) about the fact that the balance sheet, in its present form (form which is imposed by the law), has some boundaries, and for a meaningful analysis of the financial position (financial balance) it is often necessary to resort to derivative forms of the balance sheet...|$|R
